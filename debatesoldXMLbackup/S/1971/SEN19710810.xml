      <P>I have received notice from Senator Quinlan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House tonight he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The inadequacy of the notice given by the Minister for Education to secondary school authorities of his refusal to sanction staff increases for which graduates had already been engaged provisionally.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and, in accordance with practice, I propose that the matter be taken from 9.30 p.m. to 10 p.m., or earlier if the business of the day concludes.</P>

      <P>If this motion is to be taken at 9.30 p.m. that takes away half an hour from the time available to Senators to debate the business on the Order Paper.  May I suggest that it be taken at 10 p.m.?</P>

      <P>I have received under Standing Order No. 26 notice of a motion of urgent and definite public importance from Senator O'Higgins. The motion reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To discuss the critical situation for the Irish people, North and South, which has arisen because of recent events in Northern Ireland and the desirability of joint discussions thereon between the Government and Opposition parties in Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> I have received very short notice of this matter and in view of the importance and complexity of the issues raised, I should like with the leave of the House to postpone my decision on this matter until immediately after the tea adjournment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite agreeable to that.  I do appreciate, and I am sure the House will appreciate, the reasons for it, that the notice given to you was extremely short.  Obviously the matter is one which must receive your very serious and earnest consideration.  In view of the short notice I think the House should agree that you should be permitted to reserve your decision on it.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose the following amendment to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>That &ldquo;3&rdquo; be deleted.</P>
      <P>In view of events which have occurred within the last 48 hours this is not the time or the place in which we should be debating a Bill of this kind.  We have enough repressive legislation in this country, north and south, and I do not think we are helping the Government or that the Government are helping themselves by proceeding with this Bill.  Therefore, I propose as an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 3 be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment that has been proposed.  It seems to me opportune that the Government, having had the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill passed through the Dáil, should take a further opportunity to reflect fully on the implications of the Bill.  It seems to me also that, in view of the matters which have been mentioned by Senator Jack Fitzgerald, it would be quite outrageous <Col N="4" /> that we in this part of the country should be discussing one of the most controversial pieces of legislation for a long time.  In view of the situation existing in the country as a whole, the Government would be serving the people well by at least postponing further consideration of this measure for some time.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest in this connection also &mdash; I intended to propose an amendment on these lines &mdash; that this particular Bill should not be taken for some time, first in order to enable the Government to reflect more fully on the implications of the Bill and secondly to enable Senators of all parties to consider initiating a petition to the President under Article 27 of the Constitution in the event of the Bill being passed in its present form.  I do not know if it is necessary to put that in the form of an amendment because the simple amendment moved by Senator Jack Fitzgerald that this particular item be deleted from the Order of Business today probably covers the matter fully and enables Senators to discuss the reasons in reasonable depth as to why it should not be taken today.</P>
      <P>The most important reason, possibly, is that which has been mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald &mdash; that in view of recent events in part of this country it would be quite ridiculous that one House of the Oireachtas should engage its time in discussing a Bill of this nature.  In saying that, I do not want to analyse the Bill at this stage.  I hope that the opportunity for analysing it will not occur today, but there are certain aspects of the Bill which have been the subject matter of very considerable controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Senator for a moment?  The Chair is worried that the nature of this discussion is such that it would arise more properly on an amendment to the Second Reading rather than on a simple discussion on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue that line any further.  I would strongly urge on the House to accept this <Col N="5" /> amendment.  I know that, in order to have the amendment accepted, a Chathaoirleach, it is necessary for me to convince some of the Senators sitting opposite me as to why it would be inopportune to have this discussion at this particular time.  It was because of the necessity to make my words receptive to the people on the benches opposite that I mentioned some of the particular aspects of the Bill.  I merely want to put it on the broad basis that some aspects of the Bill, although not all, are extremely controversial and are regarded in many quarters as being obnoxious and objectionable.  Other aspects of the Bill probably would find acceptance if the Bill could be discussed at a different time and in a different atmosphere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that the merits of the Bill do not arise on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not say any more on that.  Having regard to those views, we should not discuss it today and we should alter the Order of Business proposed by the Leader of the House by deleting item No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Another reason which I feel I should add to those given by Senator O'Higgins is this: the course of the debate on this Bill in the Dáil suggests very strongly to me that we are going to have a discussion in this House which will not be good-tempered. In view of the events in the north&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell Senators on the far side of the House that a closed mind is nothing to be proud of.  If the Minister for Justice displays in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add as briefly as I can, and if the other side will allow me in peace and silence, this very strong consideration to those advanced by Senator O'Higgins.  If this <Col N="6" /> country has to witness agonising television programmes and listen to agonising news broadcasts over the next three weeks it will provide a background for all our dealings which is going to make a debate in this House on a Bill like the Forcible Entry Bill something the like of which this House has never yet seen.  I do not say that by way of a threat.  I have no business to threaten anybody.  It is not intended that way at all but everybody on the far side of the House knows that that is going to be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to live this month watching the things that have been seen during the last couple of days, this is the last matter that a House of this Oireachtas should be asked to discuss.  I warmly recommend to the Government, if their minds are open even a crack or a chink, that they put this Bill off until the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I do not intend to discuss in any way the terms of the Forcible Entry Bill &mdash; the views of my party are well known on it &mdash; but I would appeal to the Government party, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Soldiers of Destiny, to consider why they should bring it before us on the Order Paper today, in this critical &mdash; and I say &ldquo;critical&rdquo; very advisedly &mdash; stage in the history of our country.  At the present moment there are people on the streets of our country being killed; there are people dying. Senator Crinion has a newspaper there that says: &ldquo;12 dead today&rdquo;.  There is an evening newspaper over there that says that the total may be 20.  Why are they being killed?  We are not entirely blameless.  Indeed, we are not blameless at all in this part of the country for what is happening in this other part of our country.  It is deplorable of the Government party to ask this House to discuss this type of legislation when, because of similar types of action in another part of the country, our fellow countrymen are being killed.</P>

      <P>It was with this in mind that I had intended to move motion No. 19 on the Order Paper: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the statement relating to Northern Ireland made by the Taoiseach on July 11th, during the commemoration of the Truce in 1921&rdquo; so that this House could have a debate on the north.  However, in view of your statement, a Chathaoirleach, that the question will come up again at 7.30, after the tea-break, as to whether an emergency debate on the north will take place, I will defer that; but if the Emergency debate does not take place then I shall certainly, at the next possible opportunity, move that this motion be taken, because it is crystal clear that this is not the time to debate the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill.  The Bill has gone through a very stormy and unhappy debate in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall conclude by saying that far from considering this an appropriate time, I should like to have the Bill removed from discussion and I should like to see this House turning its eyes a hundred miles north and discussing the northern situation.  It is much more relevant and much more important at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support very strongly Senator Fitzgerald's amendment.  It should not be necessary to debate it.  I appeal to the good sense of all the Government party to accede to this request.  What we are asking simply is if we proceed to debate this over the next two to three weeks, will we aid the northern situation or will we do something that could be very detrimental to it?  In such a situation the rush is far too great.  This legislation is not urgent at present.  What is happening elsewhere may make this urgency far less.  I would appeal to the Government to let us have one big magnanimous gesture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see that the Government party are concerned with the whole of the Twenty-six Counties and with the opinions within them; and then that they are concerned with Ireland as a whole.  We are asking the Government to take the first step and by doing that they will show their sense of duty and their sense of realism. I would endorse what Senator Robinson has said, which is an appeal coming from most of our universities.  We have traditionally been independent; we have been critical in our contributions to this and to other debates and now I join with Senator Robinson, especially from the university sectors for which we have the privilege to speak, in asking the Government to show restraint and realism and not to do any act in this House that will in any way make things worse in the north.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one very short point in order to remove any misunderstanding that may have arisen. The Fine Gael Party indicated in the other House their acceptance in <Col N="9" /> principle of this Bill.  They strenuously opposed certain sections of it.  We would adopt the same attitude in this House and we would hope that the Minister for Justice would show a sense of co-operation and realism in considering reasonable amendments to the Bill.  We feel, however, as has been expressed here very forcibly, that this is not the time to debate a measure of this kind.  Our position is purely directed along those lines.</P>

Hot on the heels of that of course, as we might have expected, came Senator FitzGerald, Senator O'Higgins, Senator Mary Robinson, Senator Quinlan and Senator Russell.  Senator O'Higgins said a few words very early in order to confuse to some extent the work of this House today.  It is well known to every Member of this House as well as to Members of the Lower House that the attitude of these people is to prevent discussion of item No. 3 on the Order of Business.  They tried to introduce a national question and a very serious one &mdash; so serious that it involves each and every individual citizen of not only the Twenty-six Counties but of the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland.

With all due respect to the more rational and more tolerant people on the opposite side of the House, the efforts being made to shout us down are exactly the same type of efforts that were made during the last 15 to 20 years by the Unionist majority in Stormont&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a very sad thing for me &mdash; as an Ulsterman who was reared half a mile from the Border &mdash; to come in here today and witness the <Col N="12" /> hypocrisy that we have witnessed on the opposite benches.  Those people would have us believe that we should cease doing the work which we have come in here today to do in order to blackmail us into withdrawing No. 3 on the Order of Business.  Is it the contention of the people on the opposite side that it will help the people in Northern Ireland if the work of every institution in this city and in this State should cease?  We came in here today to do this work and we are going to do it.  We are not going to be affected by this filthy blackmail that is going on, that Fianna Fáil because they will not withdraw&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the inadequacy of my vocabulary I cannot find words to cover the tactics that have been going on, not only in this House but in other places as well, in trying to pretend that if Fianna Fáil do not knuckle under to certain things the Opposition and other people want, we are going to be blackmailed or frightened by being compared with the Unionist Party.  We know what the Unionist Party are and we know what Fianna Fáil are and we will not bow our heads or accept this at all.  It is entirely wrong and I do not think it helps the situation to compare any of the political parties here, or any of their actions during the last 50 years, to what has gone on in Northern Ireland for the past 50 years.  If the people opposite really knew what they were talking about they would not use these tactics.</P>

      <P>I rise to support this <Col N="13" /> amendment moved by Senator Fitzgerald.  It is a matter about which this party feel very strongly.  I assure this House that we are not being hypocrites and that we are doing this from the very best motives we can muster.  Fear is a very real emotion in this country today.  We want to prevent this House, if we can, from debating a matter which we believe would instil further fear into the people on this side of the Border.  Surely the dearest wish of every Senator is that our people, men, women and children, in each county of the Thirty-two Counties should live in freedom from fear. Whether the Government party believe it or not there are people in the Twenty-six Counties who have very real fears about the measure, No. 3 on the Order Paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. J. Cronin) Gerry Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. J. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide allowances for the widows of military service pensioners and Connaught Rangers service pensioners, pursuant to the Budget Statement of the 28th April, 1971.</P>
      <P>As from the 1st October, 1971, the widow of a person who was granted a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, or 1934, or a service pension under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1936, will be eligible for an allowance, provided she has not remarried.  A widow's allowance will be one-half of the annual rate of pension payable to her husband on the 1st October, 1971, or which would be payable to him, if he were alive on that date, subject to a minimum rate of £52.20 a year.  The allowance will be payable from the 1st October, 1971, or the day following the date of death of the pensioner, whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>The allowance will be subject to a number of general provisions of the Army Pensions Acts and these are applied by section 2 of the Bill while section 3 excludes the allowance from certain restrictive provisions of the Army Pensions Act, 1953, and the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, 1937.  I may add that under the Social Welfare Acts the allowance will be disregarded as means for purposes of widows' and old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the provisions of the Bill.  Everybody in the House likes to see provision made for the widows of the men who gave their services in years gone by that we might enjoy the freedom we do today. <Col N="22" /> I am sure every Senator would join with me in providing a speedy passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the Bill in any great detail but there are one or two comments I should like to make. It is a simple Bill and the Minister has outlined its purpose.  It is clear from the terms of the Bill that it is confined strictly to the widows of persons who were granted pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924 or 1934, or a service pension under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1936.  Only the widows of these pensioners will be provided for under the Bill.  It is a very welcome step in the right direction, but it does leave certain gaps which I am sure the Minister would like to deal with sympathetically.  The Minister will probably reply that he is restricted under the terms of this Bill from helping the women I have in mind.  I refer specifically to the widows of men who for one reason or other did not apply for military service pensions before the final closing date in 1955. I do know that considerable cooperation was given to ensure that everybody entitled to a pension would have an opportunity of getting it. There have been a number of extensions of the closing date until the final date in 1955.  There must still be men who gave their services in some cases over 50 years ago and the widows of these men are now in very difficult circumstances. I should like to see some provision included in this Bill to give these men or their widows an opportunity of getting a rightful pension from the State.  This Bill is entitled the Army Pensions Bill, 1971, but the form of payment is referred to as a grant of allowance.  Although this may not be very significant it does tie the pension which the qualifying widow is eligible for to the pension which her husband now enjoys, and which she would enjoy if he dies between now and the 1st October, 1971 to 50 per cent with a minimum of £52.20.  This is a reasonable provision but, in my view, it does not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reading the Dáil debate on this Bill I noticed that the pensions will now range from a minimum of £52.20 or, <Col N="23" /> approximately £1 per week, to £600. Perhaps the Minister in his reply to the debate would give the House some information as to the reason for the wide differences in these pensions.  I am sure that one obvious reason is the type of service rendered by the veteran in question.  But it seems to me that there is a very great disparity, and what I would like to see in this Bill is the increasing of the pensions of the widows who would qualify only for the minimum of £52 per year.  Possibly if the Minister has not got the necessary funds he might even give less to some of the widows at the top.  I say that with reservations, because what I would like to see would be the minimum brought up to a much higher figure and the maximum left to stand as it is.  If the Minister is tied by the provisions of the Budget everybody here would like to see those less well off getting more. There is the point I have just made in regard to the widows of men who did not apply in time and who are not provided for in this Bill at all.  They may be paid an allowance &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong in that &mdash; but they do not qualify under the terms of this Bill.  The Minister might be prepared to amend the Bill, even if it means a further extension of the closing date of 1955, to bring in those widows.</P>
    <P>Another provision I do not quite understand is that concerning allowances given provided the widow in question does not remarry.  The youngest of these widows must be in her sixties and the eldest must be in her eighties.  While I suppose this is a usual type of regulation it is unnecessary and might be excluded from the Bill altogether.  I see no point in putting it in.  I am sure the numbers involved must be very small indeed.  Women of this advanced age should feel that their private affairs are excluded from the investigations of any officer or of any committee.  I should like to see them getting their pension free from all incumbrances or any conditions.</P>
    <P>Another small point which was made in the other House was that when a military service pensioner dies his free travel voucher is withrawn.  The cost of <Col N="24" /> allowing that to remain with his widow would be nothing extra on the State, and the question of voting any extra moneys or increasing the moneys already provided would not arise.  It should be possible for the Minister to make provision whereby when a pensioner, who has enjoyed free travel facilities, dies his travel voucher would automatically transfer to his widow. It would mean no extra cost to the State and it would certainly mean a good deal to an old lady in her sixties or seventies or possibly eighties.  It would be a further gesture on behalf of the Government to the widows of the men whom we have endeavoured to honour down the years and to whom we would like to make some small recompense for the sacrifice they made in very different and much more difficult times.</P>
    <P>There is very little else I want to say on the Bill.  As I said, I would like to welcome it; but I would also like to ask the Minister to try to include those who for one reason or another are outside the provisions of this Bill at the present time.  Many men refused for various reasons to take pensions in years gone by.  Some felt that they were blessed sufficiently with the world's goods and that they did not need a military pension.  Others felt that they had given their services in the cause, and did not wish to be paid for it.  Others may have had other reasons for not accepting a pension, but whatever the reason then was it means that their widows are in a position where they cannot be provided for at this stage.  The Minister might have another look at this Bill to see if he could make provision for the men left out and the widows excluded from it.  Perhaps the Minister could increase the minimum of £52 a year.  In this day and age £1 a week is a very miserable sum.  I am sure the Minister would agree with that.  I hope the Minister does not feel himself too hidebound by regulations, Civil Service or Army, not to make some improvement at least in the minimum payment to the widows of men to whom we in the Oireachtas and elsewhere owe so very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very pleasant duty to speak in the Seanad on a measure <Col N="25" /> with which we are all pleased.  With Senator Russell, I welcome the magnanimous action on behalf of the Minister and his Department to treat with generosity those people, who for some slight technical reason or other, do not quite come under the scope of this Bill.  Generosity is involved in the spirit of this particular piece of legislation. However, I should like to make some comments on the question of Army pensions in general.  I would join with Senator Russell in saying that we owe a great deal to our armed forces. In my experience we have first-class personnel and I would say to the Minister &mdash; and I am sure he is well aware of this&mdash;we have an Army which has first-class personnel and first-class morale.  We are extremely fortunate to have such morale, spirit and fine tradition in our Defence Forces.  This tradition has been amply shown in recent years in the work of Irish units serving abroad in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The point I wish to make is that I am rather disappointed that in legislation which is dealing with Army pensions an attempt is not being made to deal with the problem of single officers and single men, particularly in respect of their pensions and their gratuities.  I have had some correspondence with the Minister and his Department on this particular issue.  The Minister would like to do whatever he can for this class of soldier. I would like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister to redress the position in regard to the non-payment of gratuity.  The position as far as I am aware on 22nd April, 1971 is that the number of single officers serving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will not take <Col N="26" /> up the time of the House.  I want to make this point, because it is important, that gratuities are not paid to single officers and men.  The number of single officers concerned is 25 and the number of single non-commissioned officers and privates 168, so quite a large proportion or a relatively large number of people are involved and it is a pity that something was not done in this legislation to remedy this.  We are now in an era in which married and single people are not being treated differentially in matters of salary and pension.  We are moving into this era and the Army and the Defence Forces should be moving in the same direction.</P>
      <P>After all, those single people who are in the Army &mdash; the single officers and single men &mdash; will all be living in barracks. In general they do not get permission at any stage of their service to live outside Army barracks so they will need resettlement grants just as much as the married officers and men, many of whom will be living outside barracks before the end of their terms of service. I want to make the point that we as legislators would not be doing our duty if we did not try to make their conditions as just as possible.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to look into this position of non-payment of gratuities to single people and also to the conditions in which soldiers, non-commissioned and commissioned officers serve.  Something has been done in this area to help the members of the Garda Síochána.  The Conroy Report has been of great benefit and has helped to take away a lot of the bad feeling that existed.  The implementation of the recommendations suggested in the Conroy Report have helped a great deal in this respect and we might well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It was just as a matter of comparison.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. There is one aspect of the military service pensions to Connaught Rangers that I have felt has been neglected over the years.  A man had a service pension and when he died his widow had to depend solely on the widows' non-contributory pension in most cases. Where the couple were living quite comfortably on an old age pension and a military service pension, the widow was left in a very bad way after her husband's death.  I am glad that the Department has seen the need to help out those people who have found themselves in a bad state after the husband's death.  I am glad that the pension will not be taken into account for old age pension purposes or with regard to the non-contributory widows' pensions.  I think that the State owes that much to those people.  Their husbands had done a lot for the State and here we are giving the widow half the husband's pension and we should try to give them as much as possible in the way of social welfare pension.  In many cases the families are reared and have gone away, leaving the widow on her own and she needs every extra penny she can get to keep going.</P>
      <P>One aspect that will be welcomed is that the minimum rate will be £52.  It is time that the Department have realised that there is a need for that. It was an insult to people to get a pension of £1, £4 or £5.  I know it was the regulation.  Some of them would not accept such a small pension.  At least now there is a limit of £52 a year and that is welcome for the widows.  For that reason I should like to commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all Members of the Seanad will be happy to see a Bill such as this being introduced.  It is time to look after the widows of men who were with us in our time of need, and who fought when there was nobody else to fight for us.  There are certain aspects of this Bill which I should like to criticise <Col N="28" /> in some way, and if my criticism is unfounded it is because I have not understood certain sections and subsections of this Bill and I should be grateful if the Minister would put me right.</P>
      <P>The fundamental title which uses the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; connotes to me that it is going to bring with it social welfare benefit restrictions.  Any annual payment to a person who fought for our independence at a time when those people were needed or any money we give to the widows of those people should be in a special category altogether and should not be dependent on any other income whatever that that person may receive.  She should get this benefit &mdash; I dislike the word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; but I prefer it to the words &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; in this regard &mdash; irrespective of whatever other income she may have. The aspect of this matter which amuses me no end is the phrase in section 1: &ldquo;The Minister may grant to a widow provided she has not remarried ...&rdquo; Having regard to the probable age of a person in that category it might be somewhat ridiculous to assume they would remarry.  Even if this were not so, the Minister, his advisers and his draftsmen should have consulted some body such as the Censorship Board.  To produce phrases such as, &ldquo;provided she has not remarried&rdquo; is, in fact, an incitement to live in sin.  She can live with someone else and get paid but she cannot remarry and get paid.</P>
      <P>What is our country coming to?  I do not think the question of whether the person is a widow or a married person should enter into any benefit accruing to her under a Bill of this nature.  It is immaterial whether a person has remarried. No enactment, in my view, should be carried out with an end result that would preclude people from remarrying if they so wish.  It is good to know that under this Bill whatever social welfare benefits would accrue to a widow at present will not affect any benefits that will be forthcoming under this Bill.  It is a very good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to advert to something Senator Russell said.  Since the enactment of the 1934 Act and the Connaught Rangers Act &mdash; which I think was enacted in 1936 &mdash; there are many gaps.  Some person mentioned the case of a man <Col N="29" /> being well enough off not to accept a pension and subsequently his widow might find herself in straitened financial circumstances.  In cases like that &mdash; I think Senator Russell mentioned this point &mdash; I believe the Minister should take a second look at the problem.  I know that up to the present certain emoluments or lump sums have been paid in such cases but I think those cases should be looked into again to see if they could be included under the benefits of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the total cost of these benefits to the Exchequer would be £90,000 in the current year and £220,000 in a full year &mdash; assuming that there are still the same number of people alive and benefiting under it.  I presume that is inherent in that statement because the figure given is approximately 3,000 widows at present. In five or ten years' time that number will be considerably decreased.  This is a Bill which involves expenditure that will ever be decreasing unless we have a repetition of what went on before 1921.  I hope that situation will never recur.</P>
    <P>To return to my original point, this benefit should be given regardless of the needs of the person involved.  The person mentioned in the Bill is a widow but I think it should include a person, whether married or unmarried.  The benefit a widow would get should be immaterial to her means but, in fact, it is material to her means.  In a statement of Deputy Tully &mdash; which is reported in Vol 255, column 1938, of the Dáil Debates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, <Col N="30" /> to my recollection from time to time Members of the House, including Senator Belton who is speaking at present, have quoted quite extensively from the Official Reports of the other House.

That has been allowed by the Cathaoirleach and by the Acting Chairman at that time.

      <P>A Deputy in the other House said:</P>
      <P>I assume that the reason is that a similar provision is included in other widows' pensions regulations.  It is a widow's pension and the lady is not a widow when she remarries.</P>
      <P>That is a very profound statement.</P>
      <P>Section 1 (4) of this Bill states:</P>
      <P>Every application for an allowance under this section shall be in such form and contain such particulars as the Minister may require.</P>
      <P>I consider that that is going too far. All the information that should be required in a case of this nature is information that will pertain to her being a widow &mdash; I confine myself to speaking of widows though I do not agree that it should apply only to widows &mdash; of an Old IRA veteran or a Connaught Ranger veteran.  All the information looked for should be only that information regarding her qualification for a pension under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 subsection (4) goes too far. But I feel that the Minister might add to that subsection &ldquo;and would pertain to her application&rdquo; or something of that <Col N="32" /> nature.  I have not been so much against the means test, but I am against the method by which the means tests are processed at the present moment.  I have always heard that they are very badly done.  This is another addition to the badly executed means tests.  We had to have a number of investigators to find out what a person is worth and whether they should get any benefit. However, I should like the Minister to keep in mind the suggestion that the form should confine itself to such relevant information as would be solely necessary for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are slightly perturbed that the pensions are not a bit higher.  It may be that under the present circumstances the Minister has not the money although he would be a very courageous Minister who would say a Government has not money at any time.  There is one other aspect about this that strikes me. The minimum pension for the widow is going to be £52.20.  Is it a fact that her husband might have been only in receipt of £30?</P>

      <P>If brevity be the soul of wit I will be very witty this afternoon.  Is mian liom ar an gcéad dul síos fáilte chroiúil a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Sé is lua is gann dúinn ná aitheantas a thúirt do bhaintreacha na bhfear cróga a throid go calma i gCogadh na Saoirse.  Tá líon na mbaintreach an-bheag anois.  Níl mórán díobh ann agus cuireann sé árdáthas orm agus, dár ndóigh, cuireann sé ard-áthas ar gach Seanadóir anseo go bhfuil aitheantas tugtha ag an Rialtas, ag an Roinn Cosanta, ag pobal na hÉireann do sheirbhís agus do chruatan na mbaintreacha sin in am an ghátáir.</P>
      <P>It is only right and proper that we would in some tangible form recognise the great sacrifices of the women of these Old IRA men who did their part bravely and fearlessly in the time of trouble here in the Twenty-six Counties. Many youngsters growing up now have no realisation of what these women suffered, not at least until recently.  As a result of the coverage of the terrible things that are now happening in the Six Counties, they can get some idea from the sufferings of the women in that tortured part of our land, to see what these women who are benefiting &mdash; to some extent anyway &mdash; under this Bill, suffered 50 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated here that the widow's allowance will be one half of the annual rate of pension payable to a husband on 1st October, 1971, or which would be payable to him if he were alive on that date, subject to a minimum rate of <Col N="34" /> £52.20 a year.  I have already made an inquiry in relation to this and I understand that no widow will receive less than £50.20 per annum, which is approximately £1 a week.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking to a number of widows who will benefit under this scheme and, as I should expect, what they were interested in was not so much the amount of this pension, but the recognition that they are getting, and the privilege that they feel is theirs in having that recognition widely accepted. That is what one would expect from those women who went through their Gethsemane 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>There is one particular sentence in the Minister's speech that gives me great pleasure to read, namely the last sentence:</P>
    <P>I may add that under the Social Welfare Acts the allowance will be disregarded as means for purposes of widows' and old age pensions.</P>
    <P>One of the very annoying things about many awards is that when the day of reckoning comes, an old age pension, or some other pension will be reduced so that the beneficiary will not be granted more than a total sum of, say, £X.  That is a very frustrating experience and I am glad to see that in this case the award to deserving widows will not be taken into account.  I welcome the Bill and I am sure that the Minister and the Government regrets that this pension could not be increased ten-fold.</P>

Is mór an trua nach bhfuil an suim airgid i bhfad níos mó ná sin.  Aontaím leis an Seanadóir <Col N="35" /> Cranitch nuair a thugann sé moladh faoi leith don abairt dheiridh i ráiteas an Aire anseo.</P>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and to say that I agree entirely with the Senators who have supported it.  The only fault that I have to find is with the minimum amount, £52.20 a year.  With the present high cost of living, there is very little that one can do with £1 a week.  I agree entirely with Senator Cranitch when he says that, apart from the monetary value, its other value is that of recognition.  Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the minimum should be so low.  I should like to emphasise the fact that the number of veterans of the War of Independence is becoming very small, as is the number of widows and dependants.  There are a large number of cases of hardship among people who, for one reason or another, did not apply for a military pension.  Because they failed to do so, it would be a sad thing if their widows were now ruled out.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the case of an IRA veteran who is in a mental hospital.  He was not in a position to apply for a military pension when any of the Acts were passed and is now at the end of his days.  His wife is considerably younger and his mental illness is a result of an accident that occurred after the War of Independence.  It would be a sad thing if a widow in such a position were to be debarred from benefiting under the Act, as a result of red tape.  I know that the Minister and his civil servants must work within the terms of the Act, but seeing that the numbers are diminishing each year I should like to see the Minister err on the side of generosity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of another case in which two unmarried brothers, who were members of the Irish Republican Army at that time, were supported in all their endeavours by a sister.  At present I know that they are making a claim to the Department of Defence to have some payment made to her in respect of the work she did for them.  It would be a pity if, when they pass on to their reward, their sister were deprived of any benefit because of some technicality. <Col N="36" /> In view of the dimishing number of veterans of the War of Independence, it would be a good thing to err on the side of generosity instead of adhering to regulations and red tape.  It would be noble and humanitarian of the Minister if he made it possible for payment to be made to such people in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has made representations to the Minister for the introduction of legislation of this nature, I should like to thank him for doing so.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Russell's sentiments about the widows of many who until now have not claimed this pension: their deceased husbands may not have claimed a pension and they are therefore not entitled to it.  I can see great difficulty here for the Minister in trying to decide what widows would be entitled to benefit and who would not be entitled.  Most of the people who stood guarantor for their husbands in former years may not now be available. I would not agree entirely with Senator Belton's contention that the widows of these people are necessarily over 60 years of age.  Many a man of 80 might have been running around with a young woman of 21 or 22 years, and she would be entitled to this few bob, whether or not she was married, if Senator Belton had his way.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the scarcity of competent civil servants. The time has come when many men who are retiring from the Army today, at a fairly young age, could be utilised in the Department of Defence.  This would save money because these men would not be entitled to all their pension while working there and the men who are at present employed in the Department of Defence could be transferred to other Departments where they would be equally useful.  It would be an asset to have ex-service men in the Department of Defence because they would be <i>au fait</i> with the correspondence from the different branches within the Army.  In conclusion, I thank the Minister for introducing this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators <Col N="37" /> in welcoming the provisions of this Bill, limited though they are.  Basically, the Minister is giving legislative form to the proposals made by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech this year.  It was not wholly unexpected at that time.  This is a Bill to enable the widows of Old IRA pensioners to get the equivalent of what was given some 18 months ago to the widows of established members of the Civil Service and subsequently members of the local authority service by way of <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  In this case, the Minister saw fit to give legislative form to the proposals.  It might have been better if those earlier <i>ex gratia</i> payments were made also by way of legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the House should go overboard in their gratitude for the implementation of this very fair provision. It is enough for us to say that we are grateful that it is being done at this stage.  As many Members from both sides of the House have said, we have, over the years, a pretty shameful record in the way in which we recognised our IRA veterans, in the amount of money paid to them and in the way the State treated them generally.  I am sure the Minister would be able to tell us that the IRA pensions have been increased by over 100 per cent in the last ten years.  Everyone will accept that, while recognising the fact that in the last ten years, due to age, the numbers of IRA pensioners must be decreasing. We are thus dealing with an ever diminishing number.  In the equivalent pensions which this Bill seeks to grant to the widows of IRA pensioners, we are again dealing with a decreasing number.  Time is taking its toll and they will decrease every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how grateful we should feel for the granting of a minimum pension of £52.20 per annum to the widow of somebody who has rendered service to his country?  This is a fraction of a penny over £1 per week.  The Minister may say that there are IRA pensioners who are receiving less than that figure but if I were a Minister for Defence, I would feel so ashamed of that fact that I would not mention it by way of reply or rebut.  It is a good thing that in the Bill the Minister has decided to ensure <Col N="38" /> that the widow of any pensioner would get a minimum of £1 per week even if half of her deceased husband's pension amounted to less than that.</P>
    <P>The widows of civil servants who received the <i>ex gratia</i> payment of the equivalent of half of what would have been their deceased husbands' pensions, have, since getting that concession, been pressing the Minister for Finance to increase their 50 per cent <i>ex gratia</i> payment and to endeavour over as short a number of years as possible to bring that <i>ex gratia</i> payment up to parity with what would have been their husbands' pensions were they still alive.  I should hope that the Minister for Defence would think along similar lines and that, while this Bill is designed to give to the widows half their husbands' pensions, he would anticipate increasing that half as soon as possible, in a short number of stages, to bring to parity the payments being made to those widows.  The cost of bringing this pension up to par during the next five years would not involve a large amount of money.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister for Finance decide to increase by 10 or 15 per cent the <i>ex gratia</i> payments being made to the widows of civil servants, he may do so by an announcement in the course of a Budget speech.  But if the Minister for Defence wants to make an equivalent increase at a later date in the pensions being paid to IRA or Connaught Rangers widows, he will have to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas with an amending Bill.  We all know Ministers are more loath to change something when it involves not merely the change itself but also the changing of legislation already enacted.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister is replying to the Second Reading of this debate he will outline his views on this and tell us whether he expects that there will be an attempt made to raise the payments being made to the widows so that they will be more than 50 per cent of what their husbands would have been entitled to, and how soon he thinks that may happen and in what way he would anticipate its being implemented.</P>
    <P>Senators from both sides of the <Col N="39" /> House have spoken about the particular exclusions from this Bill, not, I would venture to suggest, deliberate exclusions or people whom the Minister felt were not entitled to the pension but who, through the inaction of their deceased husbands in not applying for the military service pension or special allowance, are not entitled to receive anything under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am referring basically to two categories of IRA veterans.  The first were men who for reasons of pride, their own financial wellbeing or stability at the time, chose not to apply for a military service pension under the Acts of 1924 or 1934, although they would have been entitled to such a pension had they so applied.  The second category are those who would have been entitled to a pension had they applied but did not do so up to the year 1955. After 1955 the panel for assessing whether military service pensions ought or ought not to be granted was wound up.  From then on anybody who had not applied could apply for and, perhaps, be given, a special allowance. If the second category of person did not apply for either a military service pension or a special allowance his wife will discover now, because of the failure of her husband to apply, that she will not be eligible for any payment under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The situation can arise &mdash; I am sure many Members of the House have come across it&mdash;where somebody who had performed sterling service for the country in that troubled period up to the Treaty did not, because he did not agree with the terms of the Treaty, feel like applying for a military service pension.  They, until recently, would have been described as the diehard republicans.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there are so many people of varying categories now claiming to have the God given rights on that particular term that one finds it somewhat difficult to know how best to describe these men.  Perhaps the best way to describe them is to state that they were men who performed a very definite service for this country, who did not agree with the actions of their <Col N="40" /> colleagues afterwards and who in no way tried to profit or prosper from the subsequent events.  In many cases they found themselves in severe financial hardship and straitened circumstances because of their pride in clinging to their ideals.</P>
    <P>It must be rather galling for a wife who saw her husband go through 50 years of hardship and privation, who watched his pride refuse to melt away, who saw him nail his colours to the mast right to the end at the expense of himself and his family, who saw him interred, to then see a group of men who, in fairness I think it can be said, have prospered and done well now at this late stage turn around and don the mantle of &ldquo;greener than green&rdquo; re-publicianism, touring the country proclaiming their ideas with all the trappings of luxury and wealth attached to them.  At the same time, the widow of that other man discovers that she is not even entitled to £52.20, £1.20 or even 20 new pence per annum because of her husband's pride.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have made a definite effort to have included the widow of such a person in this scheme. I would suggest to the House that it would have been easy for a Parliamentary draftsman to add a further subsection to section 1 stating that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may grant to a widow at his discretion a pension equivalent to the pension she would have been entitled to under subsection (1) had, in the opinion of the Minister, her husband qualified for a military service pension under the 1924 or 1934 Acts had he so applied.</P>
    <P>That subsection added to section 1 would have given discretionary power to the Minister for Defence to cover the situation which has been dealt with by many Senators on each side of the House and has been dealt with in the other House by Deputies from all sides. I know that the Minister before this Bill left the other House was asked to give special attention to this before the Bill came before the Seanad.  I do not know what attention the Minister has given to it but, unfortunately, the Bill has arrived in the Seanad in the virgin <Col N="41" /> state in which it entered and left the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It would have been a very easy and simple operation on the Minister's part. The Opposition find themselves somewhat inhibited because if such amendments were to be proposed by an Opposition or Private Member they would almost invariably be ruled out of order as involving a charge on State funds.  I hope the Minister might even at this late stage in the Seanad consider introducing an amendment which would give to him the discretionary power to grant an equivalent <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the widow of a person who would have been entitled to a military service pension had he so applied but who for reasons of his own decided he would not do so.</P>
    <P>In his reply to the Second Stage debate I should like the Minister to tell us what he envisaged were the difficulties in granting to the widows of Army service pensioners under the Acts of 1924 or 1934 or under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1936 the concession which was enjoyed by their husbands of free travel on the public transport services.  If the State felt that a man was entitled to a pension, while he was alive and was entitled to free travel and his wife if she accompanied him was also so entitled and that when the man dies his wife because she is the wife of an IRA pensioner, is entitled to half of that pension, then the logical conclusion is that the wife must be entitled to half free travel.  If the Minister feels that a wife is entitled to half her husband's pension surely she should be given a reduced fare.  I do not believe, and I do not think the Minister believes, that it would cost the State very much to allow all of the widows free transport.</P>
    <P>There is a second point which it is fair enough to bring up at this stage.  A person who is in receipt of a military service pension at the moment has free transport facilities.  If his wife accompanies him she too is entitled to travel free.  In the event of the wife of the pensioner going out on a journey on her own she is not then entitled to the free transport which she would be entitled to if her husband were with her. <Col N="42" /> I am not married so I do not understand many of the advantages or disadvantages attached to that, but I would imagine that there are many married Members of the House here who could think of many occasions when they feel like going somewhere and would not particularly feel like going out with their wives.</P>
    <P>There are certain occasions when the wife might feel like going somewhere which would be the last place her husband would be inclined to go.  It is rather galling for a military service pensioner who has done his duty for the country to have to hike himself off three or four miles to a bingo session and back again simply and solely to ensure that his wife gets free transport on the bus there and back.</P>
    <P>While that situation may be regarded as facetious, men who qualify for military service pensions under these Acts would invariably at this stage be men of a fairly advanced age.  Many of them, thank God, are very active men. But there are a number who are not only inactive and not in full physical or mental health but who are confined to bed for long periods or all the time and who very often are confined to bed not in the comfort of their own homes but in a nursing home, a geriatric home or a hospital sometimes very far away from their homes.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation where an IRA pensioner is in hospital as a geriatric patient or physically disabled and because of that disablement or illness he probably has not earned very much for the last few years.  Indeed, if it is a disablement of long standing, as quite often is in the case of these IRA pensioners, he may not have earned very much for a number of years and the family may be in financial suffering and deprivation.  While that man is in hospital his wife will wish to visit him but she will have to pay the cost of public transport which will take her from her house to the hospital and back again because her husband, who is entitled to free travel, is not with her.  I would ask the House if there is anybody here who can see the logic in a situation such as that.  I again respectfully ask the Minister to consider extending this free <Col N="43" /> travel facility to the wives of military service pensioners under the 1924 and 1934 Acts, whether or not they are accompanied by their husbands, and to further extend it to the type of person who is covered by this Bill, in other words, to extend the free travel facility to the widow of a military service pensioner.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us the minimum pension payment which will be made to a widow but we have not heard what the maximum will be, whether the Minister envisages that the majority will be more towards the lower or the higher end of the scale or what the Minister envisages the average pension payment to these widows might be.  It might be useful also if we were in a position to know how many military service pensioners there are under the two Acts, how many Connaught Rangers pensioners there are under the two Acts and how many widows there are of military service pensioners and Connaught Rangers pensioners under the three Acts.  What would be the cost of extending free travel facilities to the widows and how much would the cost of extending free travel facilities to the wives and widows be?  It is normal enough in these days, when a Bill such as this is placed before either House, for the explanatory memorandum accompanying it to outline in fair detail figures such as this; but unfortunately both the Minister's speech and the explanatory memorandum fall a little short of the statistical information, which Members of both Houses invariably look for and inevitably find very useful in assessing the real merit or otherwise of a piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I would also quibble with the two provisions in section 1, one of which is contained within the brackets of subsection (1) and the other is in subsection (3) of section 1, the effect of both of which is to stop payment to a widow in the event of her remarriage. As Senator Cranitch so very eloquently explained to the Minister and to the House, the widows of the military service pensioners were very often the people who kept the military service pensioner going at the time he was in <Col N="44" /> active service.  Very often, as he and Senator Gallanagh pointed out to the House, the widows of those pensioners who at that time were their wives, were the people who provided care, comfort and shelter for their husbands.  They fought for them and provided alibis for them.  As the Senators on the Government side of the House pointed out to the Minister, very often those women would have been entitled to military service pensions themselves if they had applied for them but they were content that their husbands should receive pensions, not for the financial amount involved but because it recognised the services rendered by the husbands and indeed the services rendered by the whole family.</P>
    <P>If the State feels grateful to a man and in turn feels grateful to his widow &mdash; apparently feels grateful, or at least feels 50 per cent grateful, if the terms of this Bill are an indication &mdash; why then should the State be grateful to an IRA veteran who is a military service pensioner and be 50 per cent as grateful to his widow until such time as she, as Senator Belton has suggested, commits the heinous crime of remarriage?  I assume that Senator Belton was being just a little facetious when he suggested that the State was forcing the widows of military service pensioners, who felt inclined to remarry, to instead live in sin in order to continue in receipt of their £52 a year, or whatever it might be.  Senator Gallanagh has suggested that there are many men of 80 or 81 running around with young girls of 21 and that there may be quite a few of these widows who are still, if not in the first bloom of youth, at least able to get out and about, make acquaintances and meet friends.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the majority of these women are middle-aged and elderly women and it is highly unlikely that they would want to get married again.  In the event of their wanting to get married I do not see why there should be something contained in a piece of legislation which would inhibit them.  It is hardly likely that there will be a number of gigolos chasing about the country looking for the widows of Army service pensioners to get their hands on the 50 per cent <Col N="45" /> of the Army service pension.  The prevention of a situation such as that is the only reason that I can see for having included in the Bill the words &ldquo;provided she has not remarried&rdquo; in subsection (1) of section 1 and the whole of subsection (3) in section 1.</P>
    <P>It is an undue interference by the State in the private life and activities of a group of people who have already suffered far too much.  I am a bit surprised at those Members of the House who are exponents of equal rights for women, not having already made their voices heard by the Minister very clearly and definitely in this regard.  In any sort of scheme such as this, which is designed to implement the provision of pensions to a group of people who did not previously qualify for them there is always a certain amount of difficulty in establishing where they are, who they are and where they live.  I know this because I am aware of the difficulty which the Department of Finance encountered in trying to implement the <i>ex gratia</i> payments to widows of civil servants.</P>
    <P>I would imagine at first that it would be quite a simple task.  All you have to do is write to the last known address of the husband and you will find the widow.  In many cases, following the death of the husband, the widow will move to a new address and perhaps to a second or third address, not realising that a Minister for Defence in 1971 will decide to pay her half of what her husband was getting by way of pension. She will not think of acquainting the Department of Defence of that fact.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to let us know how he anticipates contacting the widows of these military service pensioners.  Will he merely write out to the last known address, in which case he will find a very high percentage of non-replies, or does he anticipate utilising the vast resources of the Department of Social Welfare to get the assistance of their investigation officers to follow up and find out if the widow is still living in the area or where she may have moved to? Will he, as the Department of Finance did, advertise to a fair extent in the national Press and on television in an effort to contact these people?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> It is not good enough if we implement a scheme like this and say &ldquo;It is there and available for them so long as they find out about it.&rdquo;  The onus is surely upon the Department of Defence to make every effort to contact these widows, to explain the provisions of the scheme and to inform them that they are entitled to a pension, even if it is only 50 per cent of the pension which was being paid to their husbands. What we are doing here is paying to quite a small number of women half the pension which their husbands had been receiving.  Again, in the year 1971 it is a little ironic that we should be talking of paying a minimum pension of £52.20 per year to the widows of the men who fought for and secured for us the freedom which we enjoy today in this part of the country and for which we should be very grateful when we read the distressing news of what is happening in another part of the country.</P>

      <P>That in view of the critical situation for the Irish people north and south which has arisen because of recent events in Northern Ireland, Seanad Éireann urges the desirability of joint discussion thereon between the Government and Opposition Parties in Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
      <P>If Members agree, I will withdraw the application under Standing Order No. 26 and, at whatever time may be agreed, move this motion.  This would, of course, involve an alteration in the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business was fixed this afternoon at 3 p.m., but it is open to the House, by general agreement, to vary the Order of Business if it so wishes.  The Chair would suggest, if the House agrees, that this motion might be taken at 8.30 p.m. tonight, the proceedings on that motion to be brought to a conclusion by 9.30 p.m. or, if finished earlier, then the Order of Business as agreed this afternoon to be resumed. Is that agreed?</P>

      <P>It seems to me, just taking a quick note of the motion, that it is a very limited motion, much more limited than a discussion would warrant on the northern situation.  It seems, if I have got the gist of it, that it just urges, in view of the critical situation, a joint discussion between the Government and the Oireachtas parties here.  I would not have thought it needed a Seanad resolution to do this.  I would have thought the situation in the north required a great deal more than this.  I would be in favour of a much more formidable debate than that and if there is a motion taken tonight I shall certainly move No. 19 on the Order Paper this evening, that is a motion to discuss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before business was suspended I referred to the fact that some of the payments to widows of military service pensioners were, in my opinion, inadequate.  I should like to refer to something that was adverted to by Senator Belton and that is the fact that the Bill, as it comes before us, allows for the Minister to elicit such information as is necessary.  Subsection (4) of section 1 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> Every application for an allowance under this section shall be in such form and contain such particulars as the Minister may require.</P>
    <P>This does not relate solely to the Department of Defence; it relates to Government Departments generally. There is far too much bureauracy of the most stifling kind embodied in our legislation and in legislative proposals. There could not be all that much information that the Minister would require from the widow of somebody who was already in receipt of a military service pension or a Connaught Rangers pension in order to establish that she qualified for 50 per cent of that pension. Instead of that we will probably get a most complicated form which will be presented in almost every case to a lady in the autumn of her life asking her to supply all sorts of data, 95 per cent of which will be quite irrelevant to the question as to whether or not she qualified for a pension under the Army Pensions Bill, 1971.  When one bears in mind that this does not in any way interfere with her right to social welfare payments under the Social Welfare Acts and the social welfare code it seems a little bit strange that the Minister for Defence should want to ask questions &ldquo;in such a form and contain such particulars as the Minister may require.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is also the question of a widow of a military service pensioner who may, in order to keep body and soul together &mdash; and this would relate especially to those cases of hardship and privation to which I referred before tea &mdash; be working in a part-time or full-time capacity, earning £7 or £8 a week, which would be just outside, or on the borders, of the tax net.  The Minister made it clear that the payment of a pension under this legislation would not, in any way, interfere with payments under the social welfare code. What he did not make clear &mdash; and I would consequently assume it is not the case &mdash; was that the payments of this pension would not be assessable for income tax purposes.  That being the case, if there is a widow who is working and earning £7 or £8 a week to keep body and soul together and she applies for and receives a 50 per cent pension <Col N="49" /> under this measure, the receipt of that pension &mdash; let us say it is £3 or £4 a week &mdash; could well mean that she is brought within the tax net and, out of a pension of £3 a week, she would be asked to pay £1 by way of taxation.</P>
    <P>I would have thought we had enough respect for our military service pensioners and their dependants to be in a position in 1971 to exclude for the purpose of income tax the payment of pensions either under the Military Service Pensions Acts or under this Army Pensions measure.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to give us his views on this.</P>
    <P>There is also another anomaly which could very well arise under this Bill. The Minister has, quite rightly, I think, decided that the minimum pension under this Bill should be a pension of £52.20 per annum and that that would be so even in the case where £52.20 per annum is more than half the husband's pension and we could have a situation in which a widow would be paid £52.20 per annum where her husband received £40 per annum.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying, I should like him to explain to us how, in justice and equity, he can uphold a situation where two men of equal rank and of equal service were both granted a pension of £40 per year; one dies in due course and under this Bill, his widow will be paid £50.20 per annum while his colleague, of equal service and equal rank, is paid £40 per annum. It is quite likely that the colleague is also maintaining a wife.  I do not see the fairness in that and the Minister, who has quite rightly introduced a minimum pension of £52.20 per annum for widows, has very clearly and definitely brought out the fact that the minimum military service pension to the IRA veteran himself is far, far lower than it should be.  The fact that this anomaly will arise in the future, and that a military service pensioner with a wife could be in receipt of a smaller pension than the widow of one of his former colleagues, will emphasise that even more.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister, in replying, briefly explain to us if he can include under this Bill, or in some other way, payment of an equivalent pension to the widows of men who would have <Col N="50" /> qualified for military service pensions but did not make application for them? The Minister should find a way in which those widows can receive what is rightfully theirs.  He should bear in mind the fact that, because of the failure of their husbands to apply for pensions down through the years, the State has been saved a considerable amount of money in some cases.</P>
    <P>Secondly, would the Minister tell us why he does not feel empowered to extend to the widows of military service pensioners the free travel concession which their husbands enjoy; if he feels that they are entitled to 50 per cent of their husbands' pensions why are they not entitled to at least 50 per cent of their husbands' free travel concession?</P>
    <P>Thirdly, would the Minister tell us why he feels that the wife of a military service pensioner can receive free travel when she accompanies him, but not if she uses public transport on her own?</P>
    <P>Fourthly, accepting that the minimum pension under this Bill will be £52.20 per annum, would the Minister tell us what he envisages the maximum to be? How much does he envisage this scheme will cost for a whole year?  How many widows does he think are involved? How many military service pensioners are still alive and in receipt of pensions, and how many Connaught Rangers pensioners are still alive?</P>
    <P>In the event of the Minister for Finance increasing the <i>ex gratia</i> payment to widows of civil servants to bring it up to a higher percentage than 50 per cent, which he can do without introducing legislation, would the Minister for Defence be inclined likewise to increase the percentage payment to the widows of military service pensioners?  Would he introduce a Bill to amend the present Bill?  How would the Minister envisage contacting the widows who would be eligible for pensions under this Bill, but who may not realise that they are so eligible? Why does the Minister feel obliged to exclude from this scheme the widow of a military service pensioner who is entitled to a pension, but who decides to remarry?  If the Minister answers these questions, then I have done my task here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I should like to add my voice in support of the other speakers who have welcomed this Bill. I should like to make a few comments, on a matter referred to by the previous speaker.  Senator Boland referred to the widow who, on remarriage, would be deprived of the allowance.  This may surprise Members but, frankly, I am entirely in agreement with the Minister on this.  Until the day we pay all housewives a proper allowance we should not single out any particular category of them.  I consider also that our widows' allowances generally are completely inadequate.  Until such time as we are in a position to provide for them properly, and to see that they, on their own initiative, can provide for their children, I do not think that we are in a position to allow a widow who chooses to remarry to continue to have a State, or a semi-State, pension.  I say this with some reluctance, perhaps, because Senator Boland was probably trying to taunt the lady Senators to come in on this debate.  However, I feel very strongly on this question as to where we should look to our priorities in distributing whatever is available to help the poorer sections of our community.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw Senator Boland's attention to the fact that the widow who does not choose to remarry needs the support.  When she looks for employment &mdash; and, on the level of allowances which she gets in this country, she certainly has to &mdash; the very fact that she is a woman means that she is paid approximately 57 per cent of the going rate for the job.  This is something that should be remedied first before we come to the stage at which we shall, perhaps, some day be paying all housewives for the very valuable contribution that they make to this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point in the Bill with which I do not agree is the date on which it becomes operative, 1st October, 1971. I know that the intention to introduce this Bill was announced in the Budget and that it is part of the Budget provisions for the current year, but it is a pity that it has not been given some retrospection.  The Army pensioners, the widows of Civil Service pensioners and local authority pensioners, and I think the teaching professions, were <Col N="52" /> given pensions back-dated at least two or three years.  I am open to correction on the actual operative date.  It is unfortunate that the Minister has not been able to introduce some retrospective element.  As some of the pensions will be as low as £52.20 per annum retrospection of a year in those cases would not cost the Exchequer so much.</P>
    <P>While I am on this point, I should like to mention the position of our State pensioners generally.  We have seen a long statement in the newspapers today from the organisation of the Civil Service pensioners.  They feel, rightly I think, that they have been let down rather badly.  They have been left behind in the general type of increases that are being awarded.  They are the weakest section of our community from a bargaining point of view and it is very important that we, in the Legislature should be particularly concerned about them.  We are all aware of the increased cost of living and of the difficulty of these people on a fixed income have in meeting the demands made on them. Demands on them can be exceptionally heavy, when one considers that they are in the later days of their lives and their expenditure must be higher than that of the average healthy young person.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Boland and I am anxious to hear the Minister's reply as to how he intends to operate the scheme when a widow remarries and the pension is terminated.  There may be an administrative difficulty here and I should like to know what type of notice is brought to the attention of those widows who remarry.  I should not like to see any of them in the position &mdash; it could easily happen &mdash; in which they would be overpaid for a year or two. They should be warned clearly and an explanation should be clearly given that there is an obligation on them to declare remarriage.</P>
    <P>With reference to the question of application for the pension, I know that when the pension in the Civil Service was introduced it was an extraordinarily difficult task for the Department of Finance to locate all the widows involved and, after 18 months operation, there are still widows who are not <Col N="53" /> aware of this pension scheme.  I ask the Minister and his Department to make every effort to publicise the fact that this scheme, when it comes into operation, will be available and to urge people, who may be entitled to apply, to do so and take advantage of their rights.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland referred to the question of the effects of the receipt of this type of pension on a widow who is at present in receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension.  She may, by a small margin, be deprived of her non-contributory widow's pension and as a result, lose the other facilities she gets, such as free travel and free light.  These are of considerable value.  I was pleased to see a report in yesterday's paper, I think it was, that the Minister for Finance has agreed to discuss this question with the Minister for Social Welfare.  This is at the instigation of the Association of Civil Service Widows.  I hope the matter will be resolved and that people who are to benefit under this Bill will do so and not find out, in the heel of the hunt, that they end up worse off than they were before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill.  I am sorry to begin by disagreeing emphatically with Senator Owens in her remarks with regard to widows in receipt of these allowances losing them on re-marriage. I may be wrong in my approach to this, but I am fortified by having read some of the remarks made by the Minister in the other House to think that I am correct.  My approach to this is that while all of us will welcome whatever can be done to help the lot of those who are regarded rightly as veterans of the fight for independence in this country and for their widows, the financial provisions which have been made for them and the financial provisions which are being made for widows under this Bill are inadequate having regard to the service rendered by those people to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot regard the allowances being made as anything more than a gesture or a symbol of the honour which the State would wish to pay to them.  Looking on the matter in that light, there is no justification for depriving a widow who re-marries of <Col N="54" /> an allowance paid under the provisions of the Bill.  I do not wish to be churlish about this.  I am glad the Minister has introduced this measure and that provision was made for it in the Budget. The Minister should be commended for bringing in the Bill and for his back-room work in ensuring that provision in this respect was made in the Budget. At the same time, what we are paying is not enough; it is nothing more than a gesture or a symbol.  It is something which signifies the honour and respect with which we feel these people should be treated.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was replying to the Second Reading discussion on this matter in the other House he said this at column 1924 of the Dáil Official Report of 20th July of this year:</P>
    <P>Or course this is as it should be.  I should like to point out that of themselves these allowances should not be regarded as a means of providing a living for these widows.  They are intended to supplement the incomes of widows and they will be a help in that way.  They should be looked on primarily as a practical gesture in honour of those who rendered very valuable service in the war of independence.  I would not say that the allowances are in any way a measure of the value of these men's performance.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to view the Bill in the light of those remarks of the Minister and in the light of them I cannot see what the justification is for discontinuing an allowance on re-marriage. I do not think a case could be made for a person in receipt of a pension for the pension to go on <i>ad infinitum</i> from one member of a family to another but the case of the veteran pensioner who has died and his widow is in a different category.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas would be very happy to feel that when this legislation is enacted the allowance made to the widow at least would remain with her for the duration of her life.  On the law of averages, it is not likely to be a strain on the Exchequer for a very long period.  When one regards it in the nature of a practical gesture in honour of those who fought for our independence, I feel that that <Col N="55" /> practical gesture in their honour should continue at least for the lifetime of the widow.  To that extent I disagree with the remarks made by Senator Owens on that subject.</P>
    <P>I should like again to say that although we welcome that this measure has been introduced, it is a pity we cannot be even more generous.  I do not say that in any grudging sense.  All of us, on both sides of the House, would feel that if we, as a country in our economy, could afford to be more generous with a diminishing number of people such as are involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland raised a number of queries which are valid, and I should like to hear the Minister dealing with them when replying to this discussion. I was particularly impressed by the argument developed with regard to travelling allowances.  There does not seem to be any good reason for a differentiation between the case of a pensioner who gets a travel allowance for his wife, provided the wife is travelling with him, and a case where the wife is travelling on her own.  That is a matter which the Minister, who has shown his good intentions by the introduction of this Bill, might take up and examine again.  I would also urge that at some stage &mdash; obviously in view of the case the Minister has made it cannot very easily be done in the context of this Bill &mdash; the question of those who are entitled to pensions but did not apply for them should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The argument was made in the other House to the Minister that there would, be cases, possibly only a limited number, of IRA veterans who would clearly have been entitled to medals and to pensions had they applied for them. Some for entirely worthy patriotic motives never made application.  They did not feel that the services they had performed in the early days for this State were given in order to qualify for pensions or to get any reward.  From those purely unselfish patriotic motives they did not apply for medals or pensions.  With the turn of the wheel where they have passed on and their widows may find themselves in very straitened circumstances, it seems to <Col N="56" /> me that there is a case for looking at again in relation to these people. Surely the person who was entitled to a pension and did not apply for one has over the years saved this country an amount of money?  Yet his widow is to be precluded from getting any allowance under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has difficulties in relation to this matter and I appreciate the difficulty of trying to deal with it within the framework of this Bill.  I would welcome some indication from the Minister when he is replying to this discussion that he will have a look at that problem again, possibly before the next Budget, and talk to his colleague in the Department of Finance to see if some suitable type of machinery might not be devised whereby cases of that sort could be dealt with.  They are reasonable cases and even though the widows may possibly feel the same way as their husbands, at least the machinery should be there to enable them to make application if they are in circumstances where an allowance of the sort provided for in this Bill would be necessary to them.</P>
    <P>I should just like to ask one other question of the Minister and this may possibly be due to precedent rather than for any other reason.  Section 1 (1) begins:</P>
    <P>The Minister may grant to the widow (provided she has not remarried) of a person who was granted a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, or the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, or a service pension under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1936, an allowance of &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  £52.20 per annum, or</P>
    <P>(b)  one half of the annual rate of pension payable under any of the said Acts to her husband on the 1st day of October, 1971, or which would be payable to him if he were alive on that date,</P>
    <P>whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>It is discretionary to the Minister under the terms of the Bill as it stands that he may grant allowances to widows of the minimum of £52.20 or one half of the <Col N="57" /> amount of the pension which the husband was in receipt of.  Why is that not mandatory?  Why is it not worded that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; grant rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; grant?  This may be simply a question that this is the usual wording and that there is no question of a Minister exercising his discretion against an applicant who is qualified within the terms of the Bill.  It is at least necessary for a House of the Oireachtas which has a revising character to point this out to the Minister.  The Minister and maybe even his political heirs will not always be in that particular Department.</P>
    <P>Theoretically it is open to the Minister under the terms of this Bill to exercise discretion in favour of certain applicants and against others.  I know that is not the intention.  I know that was not present in the mind of anyone who had a hand in the framing of this Bill.  The Minister might consider, maybe not in this Bill but in future Bills, recasting that particular phraseology. The reason I do not press him unduly on it now is that I do not want to be responsible for holding up the Bill in any way because if it is amended here, even in a drafting sense, obviously it would have to go back to the Dáil before it could become law.  If it is a matter of precedent that this is the phraseology that has always been used I am prepared to accept that, but if it is not, I would ask the Minister to look at it again in connection with any further measures in his Department of this sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this rather belated and not over generous allowance that under this Bill can be paid to the widows of Old IRA pensioners.  All of us here, particularly members of local authorities and people who have served on old age pension committees, realise the hardships that have been suffered over the years by the veterans themselves and consequently by their wives and families.  It can be said that we were not over-generous with our freedom fighters.  As Senator O'Higgins said earlier, this is in the nature of a token payment rather than a salary or remuneration provided for services rendered.  All of us who in the past have seen some of our freedom <Col N="58" /> fighters die in the workhouse or county home and others who were too proud or too much involved on one side or the other in the civil war to apply for a pension, have also seen their families and their widows suffer hardship and there was nothing we could do about it.</P>
      <P>As Senator Boland has requested, I hope the Minister will tell us when he is winding up the debate how many of these widows exist at the moment.  Also it would be good for all of us to know how many of the freedom fighters are alive at the present time.  The fact that a widow is to get 50 per cent of whatever pension her husband, if he had lived, would be getting on 1st October, 1971, might seem to be something until you realise that the vast majority of the people involved, the vast majority of veterans who have left widows behind them, were privates and the pensions which they got were miserable and the increases which have been given over the years were also miserable.  Even though in many cases they might be given at the rate of 100 per cent, 100 per cent on £10 is very little.  If the facts were known to the Oireachtas of the actual money involved it would shock all of us.  While I compliment the Minister on attempting to do something at this late stage, I could only wish that in the shortest possible time he will attempt to do something more for these people.</P>
      <P>All of us I am sure tried to do the best we could for them at local authority level under Health Acts and also on old age pension committees.  It would appal many people here to know that when they made applications to the Department of Defence and went through the screen as it were, the manner in which this screening was done was to my mind shocking.  Everybody knows that people engaged in combat do not always kill somebody and possibly the people who did most work never fired a shot &mdash; the people on outpost duty, the people who were carrying despatches, the people who night after night went to ambush points and did not take part in an ambush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people were debarred from getting pensions purely because there was no referee to say that they had actually been engaged in combat.  This <Col N="59" /> screening was shameful.  The fact that they belonged to the organisation and that it could be verified that they had given service within the particular period should have been enough rather than have this horrible screening that they were subjected to.  I hope that as time goes on the Minister and the Department of Finance and all of us will realise that those people were wonderful people at a time when they had not as much education as they have now, at a time when to take up arms and train oneself was a tremendous job. Today it is not very difficult.  One could almost train himself from television today.  All of those people deserve the greatest respect and I am delighted that their widows will get the pittance, and it is a mere pittance.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that the number of Connaught Rangers' widows would be very small.  There are various cases of hardship among the men who mutinied in India at that time &mdash; unfortunately, men who were illiterate &mdash; because even though the Connaught Rangers were a gallant regiment who showed their gallantry for their native land in the far off fields of India, many of them were unable to state the name of the town or the barracks which they were in at that time.  Naturally enough the British officers were not very keen on letting the records of their enlistments and dates and attachments to barracks and that type of thing be known.  I know one of them and I and many other people have tried to do something for him, all of us knowing that his comrades could tell that he took part in the mutiny, but unfortunately, we have not been able to do anything for him.  I might be slightly out of order in introducing this note at this time but I think it is a thing that will do Senators good to hear.</P>
    <P>Again, I would, with everybody else, ask the Minister to ensure that the wives will be able to have free travel without the husband because it only requires the issue of a simple warrant, a piece of paper, a card, sufficient identification for the person who will be travelling, and there is no problem in it financial, administrative or otherwise. When you think of it, it is so silly that the woman can travel free when <Col N="60" /> she is with her husband and cannot travel free on her own.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that regulation be changed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Most of what I had to say has been covered by the speakers before me but I would ask anybody who speaks here to do his best to ensure that the Minister gets from the floor here the encouragement he will need when he goes to the Minister for Finance, and if he gets that encouragement to provide moneys for those people, I hope it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those Senators who have spoken in welcoming the decision of the Minister for Defence to introduce this Bill and thereby give some practical recognition of the debt we owe to people whose widows are being catered for under this measure. I accept the statement made by the Minister in the other House, according to Senator O'Higgins, that this allowance is merely in the nature of a subsidy to enable the widows of men who had military service pensions to live in somewhat more comfort than they might otherwise do.  For that reason the criticism I intend to make might not be entirely relevant.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that in measures relating to widows generally there is a tendency to allot to the widow 50 per cent of that accredited or paid to the husband if he were alive.  While this may be a simple question of dividing by two, I think it is not as simple as that because in the case of any married couple there is the question of joint expenses, the question of running a home, and heating and lighting that home.  This is certainly not diminished by half when one of the partners passes to his or her eternal reward.  Therefore, this carrying through of 50 per cent for widows is, to my may of thinking, not justice.  I am reminded to refer, as I am sure several other Senators have done, to a danger that might be inherent in this question of £52.20 leaving a widow with a sum of money which would debar her from receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension and thereby debarring her from free travel and free electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister, like the others who have spoken, not, <Col N="61" /> perhaps, on this measure but on a subsequent measure that he might introduce, to amend this Bill to ensure that this will not happen.  I cannot understand how the sum of £52.20 arises.  I can never understand what sort of reasoning is behind 20 new pence. Why not 30 new pence or 40 new pence or round it off to 50 new pence?  Why are these figures cut so fine when we are dealing with widows or social welfare recipients?  We could break away.  We have all complimented the Minister for introducing this measure. It is certainly a break.  I think he should go a little further and look to the day when we would have a more enlightened approach to the people for whom we cater generally under legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>The question of retrospection has been covered by many speakers.  In measures such as this you invariably have the provisions coming into operation on a date sometime in the future. We have a very different approach to people who are getting several hundreds or several thousands of pounds from whatever source moneys are being applied to them.  Retrospection for two, three or four years is quite in order.  It would be a very generous gesture to these people if we were in a position to read in this Bill that the Minister intended to make the measure retrospective to October, 1970.</P>
    <P>There are so many questions we all want to ask.  We do not know how many of these widows are involved; we do not know what this measure will cost the State; we all tend to believe that the cost will be a minimal one.  We hope that when the Minister is replying he will enlighten us in this regard.  Were it possible to give retrospection to a measure such as this it would be a very good gesture towards the people with whom we are dealing.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have referred to the fact that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; make this payment to the widow of a pensioner, and that it is permissive rather than mandatory on the Minister to do this. Those of us who welcome this measure but who are a bit critical and would like to have something better done for these people, who would like to see their right established to this pension, <Col N="62" /> would be anxious to have the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; inserted in the Bill.  By and large, we all welcome anything that will make easier the lot of people who will be beneficiaries under this measure.  None of us wants to hold up this very welcome measure by the introduction of amendments at this stage but we would hope to see in the very near future some amending legislation that would give effect to the criticism we are making.  By the introduction of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; we would establish the right of these widows to receive a pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in view of the critical situation for the Irish people north and south which has arisen because of recent events in Northern Ireland Seanad Éireann urges the desirability of joint discussion thereon between the Government and Opposition Parties in Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
      <P>I am moving this motion with a full sense of responsibility.  All of us have been deeply shocked and saddened by the events which have taken place in Northern Ireland over the past few days.  Certainly neither I nor any person associated with me in the Fine Gael Party would like to say anything or even to risk having anything said which would in any way inflame feelings in the north or kindle any feelings of bitterness or animosity there.  Being an Opposition party, we are very deeply conscious of a definite sense of responsibility in this matter.  We have already made it clear&mdash;and I should like to make it clear again&mdash;that in no sense should any of us, in Opposition or in Government, regard the northern situation as something which should become the plaything of southern politics.  I have no wish, nor have any of my colleagues any wish, to traffic for party political purposes in the sufferings and anxieties of our fellow countrymen in the north.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are deeply saddened and deeply shocked by what has occurred in the north over the past few days.  I feel&mdash; and this is the real reason why I am <Col N="63" /> moving this motion&mdash;that it is necessary that political parties represented in the Parliament of southern Ireland should show a very definite sense of responsibility in this matter.  Whatever our political differences here in the south may be, all of us should be prepared to stand side by side in a united way in our approach to the problems posed by the northern situation.  I know very well that a party in opposition risks being tagged with responsibility without authority if they are prepared to enter into discussions with the Government party in a situation like this.  I recognise very well that any mistake, any rash words which may be spoken&mdash;and I hope none will be&mdash;by those in authority if spoken by the Government and if there have been discussions such as I have suggested in this motion, my party and any other Opposition parties who may be prepared to enter such discussions, could be and possibly would be, tagged with some part of the responsibility for any inadvertent errors or slips that may be made.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of our anxiety and our sincerity to be helpful that we ask in this motion that Seanad Éireann should encourage, should urge, the desirability of joint discussion such as I have spoken of.  I do not want to say much more than I have said already.  I think that it would be helpful in calming the situation in the north.  That must be the first desire of all of us.  If politicians south of the Border could, and could be seen to, speak in a united way on these problems, if the Government speak merely as a political party, Fianna Fáil; if we speak as an Opposition party, Fine Gael; if Labour speak as another Opposition party; even though the end result which all of us seek to achieve may be the same, even though the words we use may be virtually the same, even though we may all seek to have a soothing and a calming effect and to de-escalate the situation in the north, I do not think it would have the same weight or impact as if we could show to the world that here in the south, in face of a critical situation in dangerous times, we were prepared to consult one with another and were prepared to pool our brains, our resources and our energies to try to <Col N="64" /> be as helpful as we can to our countrymen in the north.  I recognise the risks in an Opposition party offering to engage in that kind of discussion but I feel this is a time when, for the sake of the entire country, we must be prepared to take political risks.  All of us must be prepared to look at this matter from the viewpoint of the nation as a whole, north and south, and none of us can afford to look at it from a party political point of view.  I would earnestly ask the Seanad to adopt this resolution.</P>

      <P>I welcome the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Higgins in proposing this motion.  I agree wholeheartedly with him that we, in this part of Ireland, should show an example of self-control, responsibility and united voice in regard to the tragedy which has overtaken the people in the north-eastern counties.  Our sympathies, naturally, are with all who have suffered in this unfortunate situation. We realise, as Senator O'Higgins has pointed out, that words dropped easily or dropped casually may be a cause of grave disservice to the nation. I echo his appeal that every one of our people should speak responsibly and should speak with a sense of the gravity of the occasion in regard to all matters connected with what is happening in the north these days.  There is no doubt that there is, in this part of Ireland, so far as the objective is concerned, a completely united front among all political parties.  There is no doubt that our sympathies, unitedly, are with those people who have suffered and are suffering as a consequence of the events which are taking place in the north.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are convinced, as the British Military Commander in the north is convinced, as the former British Foreign Secretary, Michael Stewart is convinced, and as a large section of the British Press is now convinced, that there can be no military solution to the problems of the Six Counties.  We are convinced that only a political solution will bring the desired peace among the people in that area.  Our prayers and good wishes should go to everyone who <Col N="65" /> makes an effort, in any direction, to bring about peace and harmony between varying sections of the people of the north.  There is no doubt that the British Government are slowly becoming convinced of the truth of Michael Stewart's statement.  There is no doubt, also, that the opinion created throughout Great Britain is swinging strongly in favour of the proposition that the time has come for a political settlement with a view of restoring peace and harmony. Every effort that can be made, on our part, should be made to bring that about.</P>
    <P>If the Seanad, by approving of this resolution proposed by Senator O'Higgins, can contribute in any way to showing the people of the country that on this matter, at least, we speak with one voice then this discussion will have been worth while and we will have done a very good day's work for the nation.  I am happy to inform the House that the Taoiseach has, this evening, 'phoned the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Mr. Cosgrave, and the Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Corish, to tell them that he will keep them informed, regularly, of any developments in the situation and that he will be open to receive their suggestions, comments and views at any time.  I have no doubt that, throughout the country, the same unity of purpose which we have shown here will be manifested by our people. I appeal to all, and especially to those with whom I have any influence, to be very careful in any words they may use which could add fuel to the flames which are now sweeping parts of the north-eastern counties.</P>
    <P>I am probably in a unique position here in being one of the few people who has had actual experience of a civil war. Based on that experience I would do anything to ensure that such a tragedy could never happen in this country or in any part of it again.  The grave danger that I see is that injudicious remarks and injudicious actions may contribute to escalate an already dangerous situation.  I trust that our people down here will take heed of the consequences which might follow as a result of lightly-spoken words or injudicious actions.  The Taoiseach in his Garden of Remembrance speech on the <Col N="66" /> anniversary of the Truce put the issues, so far as Nationalist Ireland was concerned, fairly and squarely.  Yesterday he made certain proposals and we await some reply to those proposals. We can only pray that commonsense will prevail and that, among those in a position to influence events in the north and at Westminster, intelligence will conquer prejudice and that they will realise that the time has come to stop this bloodbath and to restore the situation which all Irishmen, irrespective of creed or politics, would wish to see: that is harmony, unity, peace and neighbourliness among all sections of the Irish people irrespective of creed or class.  We can have that and we must have it if this entire country is to prosper. That should be our aim, and it should be our objective.  It should also be the object of our prayers.</P>

      <P>While I have sympathy with the idea and sentiments in the motion before the House, I must express a certain amount of disappointment with it.  I fail to see what meetings of this kind, held behind closed doors, are likely to achieve.  I agree with what Senators O'Higgins and Ó Maoláin stated regarding anything that might be said or done at this particular point in time which might have very tragic consequences for our people in the six north-eastern counties; but we have the assurance of the Leader of the House that the Taoiseach has informed him that he will keep in touch with Deputy Cosgrave, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Corish, the Leader of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I and, I think, the movers of the motion are grateful for that assurance but the assurance in itself is not sufficient.  I should like to put forward the idea that we have a joint meeting of the Dáil and Seanad where Standing Orders might be suspended and where the MP's for Stormont and for Westminster from the six north-eastern counties could come along and take part in a debate of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Ó Maoláin has rightly pointed out, the three parties here have adopted an attitude of responsibility in this tragic situation.  We hope that that will continue.  We would not be <Col N="67" /> gaining in public confidence if we were to go along the lines suggested in this motion and merely have meetings which would be held behind closed doors whereby our people would not be kept in touch with what was really happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragic situation which exists in the north at the moment is of course the result of the frustrations and injustices from which the minority have suffered for a long period.  There was reason to hope after August of 1969 that the position there was improving, that there were hopes of improvement and that the situation was moving at least towards an interim solution; but these hopes, unfortunately, have not been realised and it has been clear that in recent months Stormont was dragging its feet and that the certain section in the north were regaining the influence which they had in the past.</P>
      <P>The speeches which we have heard in recent months up there calling for the return of the B Specials and the rearming of the RUC disclosed an appalling lack of appreciation of what has taken place there in the last few years and of the changes that have taken place in the minds of the minority in the north.  Everybody there must realise that in 1969 and in the months that followed the minority attained a taste of independence, a taste of freedom, a taste of an assurance which meant that for them things could never be the same again.  Certainly when people up there tried to speak as though things could be the same again, it led to the frustration and the events which have taken place in the last few days.  It would appear that some people have learned nothing and have forgotten nothing.  It is clear that until the minority there are given nothing less than first class citizenship they cannot be expected to be satisfied and until Stormont and Westminster take positive radical imaginative steps to ensure that this end is realised then there cannot be lasting peace in the north or in this country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how we may feel, no matter how much the frustration may be, no <Col N="68" /> matter how much the injustice may be, no matter how much the provocation may be, no long term advantage can be gained by violence of any kind.  Even those who feel that short term advantage can be gained must quickly realise that the advantage is very short term indeed and that it has had a tragic loss of life and tragic consequences.  So we must remain firm in our conviction that, no matter how hard it may be to be patient, it is only by peaceful means that a final solution can be achieved to the problem which is presented by the division of this country.  We want the long term solution.  What we want to attain ultimately is a united Ireland.  That means an Ireland in which all the people are united and in which no one section is dominated by any other.</P>
    <P>In the situation which presents itself to us at the moment we need the co-operation of everybody, everybody of goodwill, everybody who believes in a peaceful rather than a violent end to this situation.  Consequently, I agree that all the parties and everybody in this part of the country should unite and co-operate in every possible way to help to take such measures as are necessary to deal with this situation.  I am in general agreement with the sentiments which are expressed by this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that, in spite of the angry words which were spoken here this afternoon, I appreciate and value the tone adopted by Senator Ó Maoláin in replying to the proposal of Senator O'Higgins.  I am sorry if anything which I said here this afternoon may have contributed to the ill-humour with which the day began.  I should like to try to make that expression of sorrow genuine by saying that the words which I stated in an angry moment to the effect that Senator Ó Maoláin's party had neglected the North of Ireland are, in a large measure, applicable to my own party as well.  I believe that all parties in the Republic have neglected the North of Ireland and its problems over the last decades.  The price for that neglect on all sides is being paid now, not by Fianna Fáil or by Fine Gael or <Col N="69" /> the Labour Party, but by the people who live in the North of Ireland and who have to face the problems, which existence there presents them with every day.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Senator Ó Maoláin's appeal to the people whom he describes as those over whom he might have some influence.  I hope that Senators on the other side will not think that I am making a political point in saying this, that the people whom Senator Ó Maoláin has in mind ought to have a restraining influence exercised on them.  I think well of him&mdash;if I may say so without impertinence&mdash;for saying in public something which he does not very often say, namely, that there are people holding the same nominal allegiance as himself who differ from him widely on questions of policy and tactics.</P>
      <P>I was also glad to hear him say that he would go to any length to avoid a civil war in this country again.  I take that to imply not in any sense a regret that he espoused the side which he did espouse during the Civil War in this part of the country.  I do not mean that and I did not take him to mean that, but I take him to mean that he recognises that on issues on which feelings run high, as well as deep, honest men can differ and differ to the point of un-wisdom. These are recognitions, implicit in what Senator Ó Maoláin said, which I value and which the Senators on this side of the House will not forget quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main burden of the motion standing in the names of Senator O'Higgins and myself is the expression of the opinion of this House that the national interest will be served by discussion between the parties represented in this Parliament.  The reason for that is not to give any particular importance to the Leader of this party that he does not otherwise merit, or to the Leader of the Labour Party that he does not otherwise merit.  The reason for this motion is not to make Mr. Cosgrave or Mr. Corish privy to decisions or counsels which do not democratically belong to them.  The reason for it&mdash;and <Col N="70" /> the main burden of what we on this side are trying to do&mdash;is to give confidence to the people of this Republic.  I ask Senators on the other side with all sincerity to believe that I am not trying to register an easy point against them when I say this.  The reason why it is important at this stage that we should try to provide the people with something to hold to and something to look to is that there are people in this Parliament whose allegiance to the idea of peace, to the ideals which the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch himself, has expressed, is suspect, and it is not 24 hours since some of these people expressed those ideas in metaphorical forms which, if I were a Northern Unionist, would make me very angry. I know very well that Senators on the other side know whom I have in mind and that these are the people whom Senator Ó Maoláin's has in mind.  I realise that these people are a minority of Senator Ó Maoláin's party, and I realise that any big party, be it Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, has to deal with people within its ranks who do not and will not conform to the party line, whether for reasons of their own or because of an inherited disposition. However, these people are there in the Government party.  They represent a respectable fraction of the Government party, and their existence in that party represents for the people in this Republic a source of suspicion that the stability of the Government is dubious. That is why consultation between the Government party and the other parties represented in the Parliament of this Republic is so vitally important.</P>
    <P>I hope that these words have not offended anyone in the House.  I should not have been doing my job if I had not made them plain.  The ordinary citizen of this Republic, for the reasons I have given, does not and cannot have total confidence in the party which at the moment is conducting affairs.  Although the sincerity of the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch is accepted by the people in regard to his desire for peace in the North of Ireland, their peace of mind and their sense of stability and security would be immeasurably heightened if they could see that the words coming out of this House, directed to the North <Col N="71" /> of Ireland, or directed to Britain, or further afield, came not only from the Taoiseach but also from the other democratic parties represented in this House.  That is the chief importance of this motion; that is the reason why we have put this motion down; that is the reason why we feel that its acceptance by the House will be of value to the people.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in spite of a rocky start to the day, we have managed to avoid anger and recrimination.  I also hope that it will not be taken amiss if I say that occasional dispensations of information by the Taoiseach to Deputy Cosgrave or to Deputy Corish, or occasionally making himself accessible to these gentlemen, will not fulfil the purpose which we have in mind.  What we have in mind is not occasional hand-outs by the Taoiseach to his opposite numbers, or making himself accessible to their suggestions, but constant frank consultation.  Nothing but that, in my view, in these deadly days, is going to make the ordinary citizen of this Republic feel that he is in the hands of secure, stable people and of a stable Government.  These are the reasons why we have put down this motion.  I repeat my appreciation of the spirit in which the remarks of Senator O'Higgins were greeted by Senator Ó Maoláin and by Senator Ó Riain, and I hope that nothing I have said will detract from the spirit in which I hope the motion will now be accepted.</P>

      <P>When this motion was read to us at 7.30 p.m. by Senator O'Higgins, I expressed disappointment at the mildness of the language in it, in that it urged the desirability of joint discussions on the northern situation by the political parties here.  I did so partly because I felt that it did not need a Seanad resolution to get joint discussions here, and partly because I felt that the north deserved, perhaps, an even more serious resolution.  Yet I am grateful for the half loaf and also I should like to associate myself with the sentiments expressed on both sides of the House, and to join with those who have stressed the seriousness of the situation and the necessity for a <Col N="72" /> peaceful solution and for a political solution to the situation.</P>
      <P>I am particularly glad that we have the opportunity to debate this resolution because I agree&mdash;Senator Kelly made this point&mdash;that there is great value in the Government here acting in consultation and in co-operation with the other political parties.  You then have the mandate of a national Government.  You have the Government acting not from the point of view of Fianna Fáil but from the point of view of the three political parties, in other words, of the people of the South. This is of great value in what will be a very tense situation.  It is of great value in the international sphere.  Northern Ireland is a tragic focus of world attention and we will be judged here in the south by our reactions.  If we react in a united way and if it is seen that the Government have consulted the Opposition parties and act with this national mandate and authority, this will carry great significance and will make a great impact.</P>
      <P>Having said this it is necessary to go further in the terms of this debate and ask what will they discuss.  We must at least hazard a guess at what might be discussed, and constructively discussed, at these meetings between the political parties.  Obviously, the first matter which ought to be discussed is the question of internment.  It was internment in Northern Ireland which triggered off this holocaust and I should hope that in a discussion the political parties will make it clear that the situation in the south does not warrant internment, that we do not have a breakdown of law and order and that under no circumstances would this be acceptable jointly to the parties in the south.  If this were made clear it would be a very valuable contribution to the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question on which there might be useful joint discussions in the political parties is that of a political solution.  They may with great emphasis point out the desirability of our system of election, of proportional representation, the desirability of what the Taoiseach yesterday described, but did not elaborate on, as a new administration <Col N="73" /> in Stormont.  It is obvious that the present composition of Stormont is not acceptable.  From here suggestions might come of a committee system in which the Opposition might take a part in the administration and government in Northern Ireland.  This is the type of joint thinking, the type of joint ideas, which would be helpful and would be very significant in the present situation. It requires radical thinking and radical solutions and the greater uniformity, the greater the joint mandate from here, the greater authority this will carry.  I welcome this resolution and support it very strongly.</P>

      <P>Having been involved earlier on in some of the happenings in our country and having a close and intimate knowledge of the situation, I resolved some years ago to exercise at all times the greatest care in any word that I might utter, either in private or in public, in relation to the very grave and serious problem of division we have had here throughout this century. Knowing and understanding the consequences of communal strife, I would do all I possibly could to avoid saying anything that might in any way whatsoever add fuel to the already overheated atmosphere in our country.  I had some doubts earlier on about the wisdom of this motion but the Senators who have already spoken have resolved that for me.  This is too serious a question for anyone of us to engage in playing to the gallery.  I was very glad to hear Senator O'Higgins speak as he did at the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of stress has been put on the idea of the political parties coming together here with the mandate of a national government.  I have spent a good deal of my time in the north over the years.  I am connected with bodies in the north and I think I understand the feelings that underlie the problems there.  One of the great difficulties, one of the things we ourselves are virtually unable to cope with, is the very large number of Irish people in the north of the Protestant faiths who have been indoctrinated into believing that we have some idea of taking over the north as they call it.  Therefore, it should be stressed that the coming together <Col N="74" /> here as a united group is for the purpose of resolving a problem because it is too easy for politicians of one kind or another to turn good intentions into something entirely different.  It is because of our joint concern and anxiety for people that all parties here are united and not for aggressive purposes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of expressing the gravest concern and anxiety for Irish people who are caught up in the web of history.  These are people whom I have described before as being prisoners of a black, black past.  The situation in which we are living is one during which we must exercise complete self-discipline in the interests of the lives and security of all our fellow Irishmen of all classes and creeds in the north.  This is a time when calmness of mind, maturity and a vision for the future are the things which are essential.</P>
    <P>We all know that in this country and in every other country, every dispute, every disagreement must end up at the conference table.  We also know that in communal strife of any kind there is never a victor, nobody can win.  I should like to repeat something that I said on Easter Sunday, 1966, in Trafalgar Square to try to clear the air on a situation which has bedevilled our history, that is, that, we do not seek and never have sought domination over Irish Protestants.  I realise that there are many in the north who have been indoctrinated by fear and suspicion of their neighbours and of us, indoctrinated for political motives and they are unable for various reasons to look at their own country and at us through normal eyes.  There is no intention&mdash; and this has been said here&mdash;thank God, over the past few years, on the part of any representative body to try to exercise any sort of domination over our fellow countrymen in the north. To employ those methods would simply be to repeat the errors of history.  These are the kinds of methods that were used before my time, and before the time of most of the people here, against this country.  To me it is inconceivable that the men whom we respect, those who set out in 1916 to set an example to this nation and to get this nation standing upright on its feet, it is inconceivable <Col N="75" /> that such methods would conform with the ideals of those men.  The situation that exists at the present time and has existed as long as I can remember in the north did not begin last year or the year before or 50 years ago.  It merely took form in 1921 as a result of the 1920 Act.  What we have got to understand is that it resulted from British policy over centuries of a pretty bad history.  This situation is not the fault of the present or previous British Governments, or of the British people; but because of the part that Britain played in our history and because of her existing involvement in the situation in this country Britain has got a direct responsibility to resolve the situation and the sooner she sets about that in the interests of all of us, north, south and in Britain, the better.</P>
    <P>I would urge our fellow Protestants in the north to try to understand that a minority has the right to live without discrimination, without repression and that it has to be given equality.  I should like them to understand that Ireland can be a great place to live in and to work for, that we all owe our country our devotion and that the interests and security of all our people in the whole of Ireland must come first with every one of us, irrespective of creed or class.  I wish they would understand that we and the generations that follow us will have to live here in Ireland and contribute to Ireland for centuries to come and that they and their descendants will have to live here also.  If we could get that message across to them and could impress on them that despite the past our aim is an ideal; it is not something that we are imposing on anybody.  It is a perfectly legitimate ideal and it is one in which they can share, whenever they want to but that we do not wish to compel them.</P>
    <P>I should like to end by saying that I hope that every citizen of the Republic will exercise the greatest care and self-discipline in what they say or do in the present situation because the lives of our people of both sides in the north can be involved in any foolish remarks or actions.</P>

      <P>As an independent Member of this House, I should like to support this motion.  I should also like to associate myself with what was said by the Leader of the House about the urgent need not to say anything here or elsewhere that might inflame the situation in the North of Ireland.  If we had here now a full debate on what is going on in the northern part of this country, it might not be possible to avoid saying things that might have some adverse effect.  On that account, I think this resolution has considerable merit in avoiding this and, at the same time, giving us an opportunity of expressing our views moderately but with some force and letting it be seen that in expressing these views that the views have the support of all parties.  I should like to associate myself also with what Senator Brugha has said.  I do not propose to say any more but if I am speaking briefly it is because the hour allotted to this motion is already now nearly past and other speakers wish to take part in the discussion and it is not for any lack of sincerity.

      <P>The debate this evening will redound to the credit of the Members of this House and it will do much to add to the image of this House of the Oireachtas.  It will do a good deal to bind our people together and to encourage them to think of this problem in a rational coherent way.  I feel safe in saying that if there are two top priorities common to all the parties in this House and to all Members of this and the other House they would be the abolition of Partition and the restoration of the national language.  On these two problems we are all agreed.  We agree that they are the top priorities confronting us as a people.  We may differ in the ways most likely to attain these objectives but of the two objectives themselves we have not any doubt.  It is a good thing that here tonight we can sink our differences, historical and others, and come together and have a rational assessment of the situation as it confronts us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the two top priorities the one that is most urgent by virtue of what is happening in the northern part of the <Col N="77" /> country is the restoration of national unity on the clear-cut evidence that the system of partitioning this country and establishing a puppet sectarian government in one part of it is breaking down. We should come together and present the strongest possible case as a united people to the third party and the one that is mainly responsible for keeping it in existence, that is the British Government. They are maintaining that régime in existence by a subsidy of over £100 million a year and by other methods.  We must indicate to the British people now that no matter what our differences may be we are at one in demanding that that continue no further.  A mature people in times of crisis come together to achieve a common end.  An immature people in times of crisis are apt to break up and become further sub-divided and run off in incoherent clamour with different objectives to attain an ideal that they soon lose sight of in their excitement and in their panic.  As is clear from what has been said here tonight, nobody in this House has lost sight of the objective.  It is most important at a time in world history when members of the British Parliament of all sides are loud in their condemnation of what is happening in Rhodesia and South Africa that we as a united people should present the obvious truth to them, that they are conniving at and insisting on something of the same nature being perpetrated in this island, their next door neighbour.</P>
    <P>I believe that we can do that best by all parties coming together and speaking with one voice.  I do not believe for one minute that the members of the Government party here today are not doing their utmost to achieve these objectives.  Neither do I believe that the Leaders of Fine Gael or the Labour Party would not in the same situation do their best to achieve the same effect. But I do believe that a binding together of all the people in this country would bring the situation home more forcibly to the people of Britain.  The man in the street in Britain today, in common with his colleague in all parts of the world, is better informed as to what is going on than he was 150 or 200 years ago when autocrats acted on behalf of the people. If we could get it across to the people of <Col N="78" /> Britain that boys in the British Army are being done to death in order to maintain something in which the British people themselves do not believe, they would not tolerate it.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is certainly not as difficult to bring the Leaders of Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil together here in this kind of crisis as it was in Britain, during their time of crisis, to bring Winston Churchill and Ernest Bevin into the same government.  What is needed is to get our priorities right, to go one step further on the lines which we have adopted here today, to sink the minor differences and come together not only to form a national council or discussion group but to form a national government so that the people in this part of the country will, with the nationalists in the North of Ireland and their exiled brethren at the far ends of the earth, present a united front to the British people indicating that the people of Ireland want unity for Thirty-two Counties.  If we present a united front to the world, no Government, whether it be led by Mr. Ted Heath or Mr. Harold Wilson, could withstand that force, and in the end I am convinced we would achieve one of our two top priorities.</P>

      <P>As an Ulsterman I should like to comment briefly.  In doing so, I fully realise that it is very easy to say too much and to say the wrong thing.  Living in Donegal and as one who has keenly observed the good relations that existed between all shades of opinion in County Donegal, I have high hopes, despite the hardline evidence in recent months, that with our entry into the Common Market much of the problem will have been resolved. As one who has come from quite near the Border, I have always looked on it as having been assembled in three different sections and as affecting the general public in three different ways. We have the domestic border that runs between the Six and the Twenty-Six Counties and affects the day-to-day lives of our people.  This automatically creates a psychological border, which is very evident there.</P>

      <P>I have received notice from Senator Quinlan that on the motion for the Adjournment tonight he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The inadequacy of the notice given by the Minister for Education to secondary school authorities of his refusal to sanction staff increases for which graduates had already been engaged provisionally.</P>
      <P>I have already announced that I have accepted that notice and the matter will be taken from now until 10 p.m. On the motion for the adjournment at this time the matter generally is confined to the Senator who raises it and the Minister must be allowed sufficient opportunity to reply.  The usual practice is that ten minutes or more, if possible, is given to him.  I should like to give one further warning that this motion is severely limited in its wording and the Chair will have to insist that speakers on this motion remain within the narrow limits in which it is worded. Senators should not widen it.</P>

      <P>The motion is:</P>
      <P>The inadequacy of the notice given by the Minister for Education to secondary school authorities of his refusal to sanction staff increases for which graduates had already been engaged provisionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> The facts on this are that I have checked on a number of secondary schools and find that the application made to the Department in early May was not answered until 20th July.  I propose to prove that this notice was totally inadequate and very unjustifiable because the normal school practice has always been to engage teachers for the following year on 1st May, allowing three months before the teachers take up duty on 1st August.  This fact has been known to the Department of Education and the Minister all down the years and is just ordinary courtesy between school authorities because many of those engaged would be moving on from other schools and would have to give the usual three months' notice of their intention to leave these positions.</P>
    <P>The 1st May came this year and the school authorities had got no intimation whatsoever from the Minister that there was to be any change in the situation this year with regard to recognition of additional or replacement teachers. This notice did not come until 12th May&mdash;12 days after schools would have been expected to have engaged their teachers.  On 12th May a circular came that said that in future, beginning this year, all replacement teachers and all additional teachers would have to be individually sanctioned by the Minister and would have to have a case made for each.  This was a very big change from what held up to that time.  Up to that time there was no question of individual sanction.  A new teacher was acceptable for registration as a secondary teacher if he had the credentials necessary.  Otherwise the school had merely to show that they had a ratio basis of 1 to 50 so that if they had 65 pupils and four teachers and then in the following year if there was an increase of ten pupils, bringing the total to 75, that meant the school was entitled to five teachers and could get sanction for the fifth merely by applying.</P>
    <P>The drastic change in the situation was not notified until after the normal date for employing teachers, and the decision was not reached and communicated to the school authorities until late July.  I hold that this is a very <Col N="81" /> grave discourtesy to the school authorities concerned.  Unfortunately, it is the type of discourtesy that all of us, whether we are teachers, school authorities or university people, have come to experience from the Department of Education.  That is something which has to be put right.  There was no intimation given to the school authorities prior to 12th May that there was to be this change.  In fact, there was no consultation with them on what was a major change and a major breach in our educational commitment and understanding.</P>
    <P>We accepted the situation that was offered by the package deal put forward by the Government three years ago on the understanding that a certain level of education and of equipment and provision for all teachers would be maintained.  Now this is being changed unilaterally by the Minister without warning.  That is totally wrong.  This inadequacy of notice is most unfair to the young teachers involved.  Some of those were already in positions and wanted to better themselves, perhaps, by teaching a subject in which they had better qualifications.  They gave notice to the schools in which they had been last year and accepted that credentials, as in previous years, were in order.  The schools authorities said that their numbers were correct, and therefore, they made arrangements to go to other schools for the coming year.  Now they are left high and dry, which is a callous way of treating our most valuable citizens, our teachers, on whom the whole future of our children depends.</P>
    <P>This comes at a time when there is increased competition and rising standards everywhere.  It is obviously the children who are to suffer by this latest penny-pinching effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not talking about finance.  I am merely talking about the inadequacy of the notice involved.  In May, assuming that the conditions were the same as in previous years, many of the schools, in order to carry out the Minister's exhortations <Col N="82" /> to cater for the increased numbers in their neighbourhood, actually made provision for additional classes.  I know of schools where these additional classes are there but there are no additional teachers to handle them.</P>

      <P>I am appalled at the inadequacy of the notice given.  It allowed no provision for the school to plan for the coming year.  It forced them into taking classes which they would not have taken had they been given adequate notice.  Some schools, following out the Minister's grandiose exhortations about providing extra subjects, providing more comprehensive curricula, when not given adequate notice went ahead and committed themselves to employing teachers for those subjects for the coming year. Now with the inadequacy of the notice involved, what will happen?  Are all those teachers who have been employed to teach physical education, music and all the other highly desirable subjects to be told: &ldquo;Sorry, you had better take the mail boat to England&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why applications received in early May should take two months to process, why it should take two months to decide whether these should be allowed or not under whatever criteria the Minister has established.  That is grossly <Col N="83" /> unfair.  Any businessman worth his salt would have reached decisions on such vital matters within a week.  I cannot understand the procrastination. It is due to the inadequacy of the notice that our children are suffering. They are now seeing the ballyhoo of the grandiose plans that have been launched which are not now to be funded.  Most of the school authorities are not given any encouragement or, indeed, allowed to plan for the future. It is a sad situation; it is one I deplore and at this late date I would appeal to the Minister to see that he rids himself of the advisers who have landed us in this mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion because I have come across so many examples of secondary schools which have been caught on the hop and the graduate teachers just finishing their diplomas who also have been caught on the hop because of the fact that notice was not given to the schools by the Department of Education until 20th July concerning the employment of additional teachers to deal with extra numbers of registered pupils, when it is customary to have the matter agreed early in May.  It has been a matter of form up to this that schools are allotted teachers and paid for them in relation to the number of recognised pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan has outlined the problems facing the schools and the teachers in this regard.  I would also appeal to the Minister because it has caused grave effects and it is another example of the problem in his Department in the matter of public relations. Senator Quinlan has described this late notice as a discourtesy to the schools and the teachers involved.  I I am sure the Minister in his reply will give a reason for the lateness of the notice.  Perhaps, it is financial.  The point is that it does nothing to enhance something about which I have very strong feelings and that is the need to improve the public relations of the Department of Education.  Telling schools that they are unable to hire teachers, which is the situation, as late as 20th July when they have already made arrangements to hire these <Col N="84" /> teachers early in May or, at the very latest, the beginning of June, will cause more friction and there will be less co-operation and worsening relations between headmasters, managers of secondary schools and the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I would also add my voice to Senator Quinlan's appeal to the Minister at this late stage to do something for the schools and for the teachers who are still hamstrung by the lateness of the notice and the lateness of the decision of the Department of Education.  I am sure there are reasons for this decision. It was clearly not an easy decision to make but the very fact that it should come at such a date has seriously inconvenienced secondary education.  I would appeal to the Minister to do something to rectify the situation so far as the schools are concerned, in the shortage of teachers in relation to the number of recognised pupils, and so far as those teachers who have been provisionally hired by the schools and now find themselves jobless are concerned. They are being forced to leave the country or take up some other occupation having spent four years training for teaching.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to mention a matter which was raised by Senator Quinlan.  He stated that teachers who are on the incremental salary and who transfer from one school to another were now being left high and dry.  This is not the case.  No teacher who had an incremental post last year will be unemployed as a result of the restriction on recruitment.  I want to make that fact very clear.  I have already had discussions with the ASTI and that was one of the matters which I mentioned to them.</P>
      <P>My Department's circular of 12th May, 1971, was addressed to the authorities of all post-primary schools. What was sought, as is clear from the document itself, was a close examination of the use of existing resources in teaching personnel and the keeping of additional commitments to a minimum in the particularly difficult circumstances of 1971-72.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far from a refusal to sanction staff <Col N="85" /> increases, to which the Senator's motion refers, approval has already been given to the appointment of over 500 additional teachers in secondary schools and cases of difficulty, submitted by the authorities of those schools, continue to be examined in accordance with the Department's circular.  In addition to the 500 extra teachers I have mentioned, many additional teachers have been sanctioned in the vocational sector which has not been mentioned in the Senator's motion.  There have been misunderstandings&mdash;I will not use a stronger word than that&mdash;in relation to the position generally.  I noticed, when Senator Quinlan was speaking on the Higher Education Authority Bill on 30th June, that he stated that there were 200,000 post-primary pupils and 10,000 teachers.  At that time I had intended replying to his remarks but, unfortunately, as a considerable amount of matters were raised I overlooked it.</P>
    <P>Quoting figures to the nearest 10,000 may be a satisfactory way of dealing with a matter like this when you wish to make a particular case.  I, of necessity, have to be much more precise and more accurate in my figures.  The fact is that there were 204,000 post-primary pupils with 11,650 teachers which, of course, is 1,650 more teachers than Senator Quinlan mentioned.  This alters very much the picture that he painted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, the figure was given to me by the secretary of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator appears to have rounded off the figure.  The pupil/teacher ratio was, in fact, 17.5 pupils to one teacher and not 20 pupils to one teacher, as was indicated by the Senator.  Here I want to make it clear that I am referring to the whole post-primary system and not simply to the secondary school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, very well aware of the limitations to be observed in referring to averages.  I wish to illustrate this by indicating that, whilst the overall pupil/ teacher ratio in secondary schools was 20 pupils to one teacher, some of the schools have been managing with a high ratio while other schools are so <Col N="86" /> staffed as to have a ratio which is better than 15 pupils to one teacher.  One of the merits of the exercise in which we are now engaged is that, with the general aim of providing an adequate allocation of teachers for all schools, particular attention can be paid to the schools which up to now have been relatively understaffed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the occasion on which the Senator was reported&mdash;I think it was the 22nd June, shortly after the previous debate&mdash;in which he said that the present 20 to one ratio would now be increased.  This is a point which I want to deal with very precisely because it is of the utmost importance in relation to policy on the development of education in post-primary schools.  The real fact is that the pupil/teacher ratio will be improved next September.  This is policy and it is as I would like it to be.  Next September we will have about 214,000 pupils in post-primary schools and they will be served by 12,450 recognised teachers. The pupil/teacher ratio will be 17.2 pupils to one teacher as against 17.5 pupils to one teacher in the year which has just finished.  Next September an additional 800 teachers will be provided for approximately 10,000 extra pupils in post-primary schools or better than one teacher for 13 pupils.  From the figures available to me this will be about one teacher for every 12 pupils in secondary schools.  We are catering not only for an increased enrolment in secondary schools but also, to some extent, for a very necessary widening of the curriculum in these schools.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood or misinterpreted in relation to this.  I am not saying that the ratio in our schools at the moment is one to 12 or one to 13. What I am saying is that in relation to the additional number of teachers being employed and the additional number of pupils this is the ratio.  In secondary schools alone&mdash;and I think this is something worth remembering too&mdash;the number of recognised teachers will have risen from 4,900 in 1965-66 to 8,000 next September.  This is an increase of 63 per cent as against an increase of 58 per cent in the number of pupils.  The arrangements for the coming school year were made in the light of current <Col N="87" /> financial resources.  Even in the light of the difficulties, it is clear from what I have said that we have done very well in the circumstances.  I have arranged, as I have already mentioned in the Dáil, for representatives of the secondary school authorities and representatives of the teachers to have meetings with representatives of my Department in the autumn for the purpose of making suitable staff arrangements for all secondary schools from 1972 onwards.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to a question that has been raised here in relation to the adequacy of the notice to secondary schools.  Everyone was well aware long before May of this year that the resources available in 1971-72 were going to be very tight in relation to demand for expenditure.  In case this could be misinterpreted it is well to remember that in 1956-57 the total expenditure on education was approximately £15 million while this year the total expenditure will be between £80 million and £90 million.  This is no small sum of money in any man's language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> I do not think I have anything further to add.  I have clearly shown that there will be an improvement this year despite the fact that we have very considerable difficulties, as was pointed out in the notice which was sent round to the schools.  I should like to stress that in every instance where an appeal was made to my Department in relation to the staffing and recruitment of teachers the merits of the case were fully considered.</P>
