      <P>This amendment is designed to meet a point made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald when he pointed out that the subsection as it stood allowed the Minister to make an order prescribing conditions in relation only to the assigment of functions mentioned in section 5, subsection (2). I agreed at the Committee Stage to examine the point raised by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and section 4 subsection (2) has been amended, as suggested, with a view to entitling me to prescribe conditions for the board under the subsection.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for meeting the point made on the Committee Stage.  There is just one minor point I should like to raise more in the line of correctly interpreting the effect of the amendment than anything else.  I take it that the fact that the amendment reads &ldquo;such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo; means that it is not necessary to add the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; in this particular case.  I should like to be reassured that the absence of the prescription of any conditions by the Minister would not invalidate the <Col N="1062" /> actions of the board.  Just with this one very minor reservation I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we agree to that I might say that I am not entirely happy about the form of amendment No. 2 and might wish to move an amendment to it.  As they are cognate but do not completely go together, it might be advisable to separate amendment No. 2.</P>

      <P>If the Senator wishes it that way.  Senator Dooge inquired on the Committee Stage whether it was intended to restrict advice in regard to reactors for training and research purposes to advice tendered to the Government.  This was the net point raised by the Senator and the subsection could be construed as indicating that the board could not advise anybody else on the acquisition of nuclear reactors.  It was intended that the general powers available to the board under section 4 would enable them to give advice to anybody under any Minister on matters such as the acquisition of training reactors.  What I have in mind here in these amendments &mdash;I think they are cognate although we can discuss them separately&mdash;is to put the issue beyond doubt.  In order to put it beyond doubt, we are amending the subsection to ensure that advice by the Nuclear Energy Board will be available to any group interested in nuclear science as well as the Government. This is the purpose of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that I agree that the amendment as such is acceptable but I indicated I might wish to amend it on a minor point. Accordingly, I would ask leave of the House to recommit this particular amendment so that the discussion would not be curbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say once again I am grateful to the Minister for meeting the point that was made here and I think that amendment No. 2 is a substantial improvement on the Bill as it stands.  However, there is one point in regard to it that I should like to raise.  Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 5 reads:</P>
      <P>to advise the Government on the acquisition of nuclear reactors for training or research purposes and, in the event of the acquisition by the Government of such reactors, on all aspects of their location, installation, operation and supervision.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that the section here reads: &ldquo;for training or research purposes&rdquo;.  However, when we go on to look at the amendment, the amendment allows the board to advise the Government or, with the consent of the Minister, any other person or group of persons engaged in research in nuclear science.  I am just a little bit worried about the failure to repeat &ldquo;training or research&rdquo; in the amendment. It might well be that there would be some group who were using the reactor for training purposes and were not using it for research in the strict meaning of the word.  I should have thought that it might have been safer to give the wider scope here and allow the nuclear energy board to advise persons who would be engaged, perhaps at one particular time only, in the limited field of training without, at that time, any research connotation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  I have a further point which is of the same nature but perhaps more minor and that is whether the words &ldquo;nuclear science&rdquo; might not be interpreted narrowly so as to exclude nuclear engineering. We might have a case where a body was engaged either in training or research in nuclear engineering and someone might make the distinction between nuclear science or nuclear engineering. It might be sufficient if the Minister consulted the draftsman on that point before the Bill goes to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 are designed to meet points made by Senator Dooge on Committee Stage.  In particular, Senator Dooge was very keen on having more definitive definitions in regard to reactors. He was concerned to have radioactive devices added to pin the matter down properly.  This is the purpose of amendments Nos. 3 and 5.  Amendment No. 4 deletes &ldquo;by the Government&rdquo;. This is designed to meet the point we have just been discussing to include bodies other than the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for meeting both these points.  I am very much happier that the Bill should cover radioactive devices so that sub critical reactors should be covered.  While these things are not as potentially hazardous as the critical reactor, nevertheless they are not things to be used in the same way as ordinary equipment.  It is very desirable that they should come within the whole scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is largely concerned with the question of acquisition of reactors by other persons and I think it really reflects the intention of the Bill.  The Bill was originally inadvertently drafted to indicate that the Government would be the only body to acquire reactors.</P>

      <P>These three amendments are designed to meet points made by Senator Sheldon and Senator FitzGerald on Committee Stage.  Senator Sheldon inquired if the fact that the board could offer advice to the Government and to the Minister on the installation of nuclear reactors only on request and could prepare safety codes only when requested to do so by a Minister of State limited the general advisory functions of the board.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the fact that under section 5 (1) (e) the board could advise on representation on international bodies only at the request of the Minister for External Affairs.  On Committee Stage I said that I regarded section 4 as the superseding section.  At that stage I did not think it was necessary but, on looking into the matter, I decided that the points made were valid and that there was a doubt as the section stood.  However, in order to remove any doubt I am deleting &ldquo;if so requested&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we are grateful to the Minister for meeting these points.  It does, as he says, remove any possible legal doubt but it also does something more.  It places beyond doubt that it is the wish of the Minister, as he expressed on Committee Stage, and it is the wish of the House, that a body such as this should not <Col N="1067" /> only have a formal function to answer the questions that a Minister might ask, to advise on topics that the Minister might think important but rather in the case of such a board they should offer advice as often as they thought fit.</P>
      <P>When we enter into areas such as nuclear power&mdash;and it is only one example of the complex problems which impinge on Government policy at the present day&mdash;it is necessary that such bodies be given complete freedom in the tendering of advice.  On these complex matters there could be many times it would be inappropriate to wait for the Minister to have to seek advice because it is the essence of the problems involved that what is to be done is not obvious to the layman or the Minister.  It is not merely for such bodies to give the answers but it is for them also to pose the problems and list the problems that must be solved.</P>
      <P>In many instances, other than nuclear power, the same thing will happen in the years ahead.  We in the Oireachtas will have to adjust ourselves to a situation in which especially skilled bodies will be placed in the position that they will advise freely of their own volition rather than merely do so on request.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments all cover a very important aspect of comment by the Seanad on both Second Stage and Committee Stage, so I should like to explain them in some detail, with your permission, Sir.</P>
      <P>These amendments are concerned with the basic question as to the control of various radioactive substances raised by a number of Senators.  The opinion was expressed that opportunity should be taken here to centralise all these functions now vesting in various Ministers and that they should vest in the proposed Nuclear Energy Board.  The view was expressed that the board would be in a much better position to exercise its function of control than in the proposed situation whereby the board, as the Bill stands, in regard to radioactive substances could only act at the request of or within limitations placed by different Ministers.</P>
      <P>To be more precise about the matter, at present, control over radioactive substances, irradiating apparatus and the safe disposal of radioactive waste, is vested in the Minister for Health under section 59 subsection (4) of the Health Act, 1953. Under this section the Minister for Health may make regulations for the prevention of danger to health of persons using radioactive substances or irradiating apparatus and also for ensuring the safe disposal of radioactive waste products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Minister for Labour, under section 71 of the Factories Act, 1955, he has powers of control over any manufacture of machinery, plant, process or anything of that kind used in factories which is of such a nature as to cause risk or bodily injury.  The Minister for Labour, under that section, must consult the Minister for Health before making regulations to meet particular cases.  Therefore, there is a certain duality of control, as it were, between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Labour in regard to safety.  The point was made here that the creation of a Nuclear Energy Board, with similar powers in regard to safety measures and dealing with radioactive substances, will only add to the complexity of the whole situation. <Col N="1069" /> The view expressed here was why not centralise it within the board?</P>
    <P>The intention of the Bill was to leave the position open so that the board when set up&mdash;I said this on both Second Stage and Committee Stage&mdash; could initiate the appropriate discussions with the Departments concerned in order to tidy up and resolve any problems.  However, I have had a look at this since the Committee Stage and the provisions incorporated in the amendments are designed to meet the problem to some extent.  Originally, it was intended that the board could compile a safety code only when asked to do so by the Minister concerned&mdash; that is as the draft stands&mdash;and could act as agent for ensuring compliance with any such code again only at the request of the Minister.</P>
    <P>As the Seanad will notice from amendment No. 7, it is now proposed that the board will have the function of preparing safety codes without reference to any Minister.  Furthermore, the power to act as agent to ensure compliance with safety codes or regulations made by statutory order is being transferred to subsection (2) of section 5. That is to the area where I, as Minister, may from time to time by order, after consultation with other Ministers, assign functions to the board.  Therefore, the power to act as agent is being brought within my area and from me to the board.  The subsection has been further strengthened to ensure that the board will have full power to carry out any function so assigned.</P>
    <P>In addition, under amendments Nos. 31 and 32, the relevant sections of both the Health Act and the Factories Act are being amended to require direct consultation by the Ministers for Health and Labour with the Nuclear Energy Board in the preparation and implementation of the regulations under these Acts dealing with radio-activity. It is also provided that both Ministers can designate officers of the Nuclear Energy Board as inspectors under the Health Acts and the Factories Act. This again tightens the situation.</P>
    <P>All of these points are designed to meet views expressed here in the Seanad.  However, as I said on both Second Stage and Committee Stage, it <Col N="1070" /> is impossible just now, before the board has been set up and before expert staff has been recruited, to arrive at final, binding decisions in regard to the exact allocation of responsibilities under the three Acts.  However, I feel the amendments go some of the way to meet the points of view expressed here in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We are seeking in these amendments to ensure full consultation between the three parties involved&mdash;the Nuclear Energy Board, the Department of Labour and the Department of Health. Appropriate arrangements can be worked out for assignment of functions to the best and most suitable staff available for the implementation of the responsibilities allocated and with the minimum duplication.</P>
    <P>We also propose, under amendment No. 31, to limit the functions of the Minister for Health, under section 59, sub-section (4) of the Health Act, to medical radioactive substances and medical irradiating apparatus.  That is, again, a refined definition of the Department of Health's particular responsibility.  Therefore, by this amendment we will remove from the Minister for Health responsibility for the safe disposal of radioactive waste products whether resulting from medical uses or otherwise.  This will come under the Nuclear Energy Board. In fact, the surrendered functions will then be vested in the Minister for Transport and Power, who can assign them to the board.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that at a later stage the Minister for Health will be equally anxious to assign responsibilities for other areas of control, particularly those dealing with radioactive substances, to the new board as soon as practicable.  I envisage eventually a total centralisation under the board, and these amendments are designed to ensure that.</P>
    <P>No doubt we can work out similar arrangements with the Minister for Labour in regard to protecting the health of factory workers from excessive radiation.  I understand from the Minister for Labour that he is in a position to make regulations in the very near future along these lines.  He has already made arrangements for <Col N="1071" /> the training of a number of inspectors in the use of the necessary testing and monitoring equipment in order to implement the proposed regulations. Therefore, the Minister for Labour will shortly be in a position to exercise a fair measure of control over dangerous emissions from radioactive substances.  I think it is proper to leave it in that area for the moment.  It will be some time before the Nuclear Energy Board will be organised to the extent necessary to take over these controls.</P>
    <P>We are taking the most practical steps here in these amendments to meet the points of view expressed by Senators.  We are not yet in a position to provide the total centralised control on all radiation matters.  Under the aegis of the Nuclear Energy Board this is the desirable objective, but in particular, as I have stated, the Department of Labour are already taking steps to deal with it on the safety aspect.  Inspectors will be there and the mechanism will be established.  We are proposing in these amendments to provide the mechanism whereby, when the board is established, staffed and financed, it will be able to absorb these functions into a centralised Nuclear Energy Board.  For the time being, this is not practicable but we are providing the mechanism here in the amendments to enable that to be done when the time is right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure that the Seanad will welcome the extent to which the Minister has in this group of amendments met the views which were expressed.  It is a point on which there was considerable debate both on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It is a point on which it is very hard at any particular point in time to be quite clear as to what the best arrangements should be.  While the amendments do not go the full way towards meeting the views expressed by myself and by other Senators&mdash;indeed we did not always agree on what we were pressing on the Minister&mdash;nevertheless, what is here goes a good deal of the way.  It introduces a degree of flexibility.  It introduces <Col N="1072" /> a further degree of consultation which makes these amendments a distinct improvement on the Bill as introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in recommending the Bill on Second Stage, mentioned that it was probable he would have to come back with amending legislation in a few years time.  The situation brought about by the Bill, as amended, would enable advice to be obtained not only from the Nuclear Energy Board but also from the other Departments which would be helpful in this regard.  I feel that in the situation we now face it is, perhaps, desirable from some points of view that the Department of Health and the Department of Labour should not be at this stage completely excluded from the picture.</P>
      <P>If we regard this measure as being a Bill in relation to which an amending Bill is likely to follow it would be as well if a body as important as the Department should have an interest in this matter at least until a final solution is found in the amending legislation. As far as one can judge in the time available to study them these amendments will go a good distance towards meeting what is proposed and they should do the job they intend to do.  I certainly welcome the amendments and hope that the intention of these amendments&mdash;to promote cooperation between the ministries involved&mdash;will be successful in this respect.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Senator Dooge requested the use of some word other than &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;. He took objection to it and I take his point.  He expressed the view that in making the board responsible for the safe custody of fissile fuel, the operation of nuclear power reactors and nuclear training reactors, the responsibility of the operator of a reactor for accidents involving international third party liability be diminished. He took this view and I think &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo; meets the point made. This amendment is to meet that point.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge raised the point on Committee Stage as to whether the definition of radioactive substances in section 1 might not be too broad and might include radioactive substances which it would not be necessary to control.  It has not been possible to amend the definition of radioactive substances to meet the point made by Senator Dooge.  We have amended section 6 to make it obligatory on the Minister to take account of the level of radioactivity in the substance, device or apparatus the control of which may be contemplated by the Minister or the board as his agent.  I think that goes some of the way towards meeting the point made by Senator Dooge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I must say I am grateful to the Minister.  I might say that the amendment goes rather further than I would have gone myself. The Minister has drafted this amendment indicating that in every order the Minister &ldquo;shall have regard&rdquo;.  I might well have been content with &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this connection.  On reading the amendment and thinking it over, it is, perhaps, better that it should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so that the point will never be forgotten when an order is drafted and it may, quite simply, fix the level at a zero level in the making of the order, if necessary. I am in agreement with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other small point in regard to the amendment, as drafted. It is the point that, once one decides on a level then it becomes a matter of fixing that particular level by order. The amendment reads that the level to be fixed is one which &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo; is safe.  I take it that this means the opinion of the Minister. Since we are now on Report Stage I think it would be sufficient if I raised this particular point and asked the Minister, if he is unable to give a <Col N="1077" /> clear interpretation of it at the moment, that he would look at it before the Bill goes to Dáil Éireann. I feel that because the Minister, under section 6, may wish to make an order which would specify a certain limit but might want to introduce some flexibility in regard to that limit which might be left to the discretion of the Nuclear Energy Board.  On the other hand, it might be thought preferable to keep the wording as it is, so that the Minister would make a more complex order or make orders more frequently in this connection.  The Minister will, almost certainly, in making an order specifying a level of radio-activity for a particular substance or in regard to a particular device or apparatus, be acting under the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board.  Since the Minister will be acting on their advice, he may wish to introduce some degree of flexibility within fixed limits in regard to these orders, specifying that the level must be one which, in the opinion of the Minister, would rule out any such flexibility in an order.</P>

      <P>The point being made by Senator Dooge is covered by section 5.  We empower the board to advise the Minister.  This is covered in subsection (5) (b) and (c), in particular. Subsection (1) (a), (b), (c) (d) and (e) of section 5 would provide the arrangements whereby the board will, in fact be the body who will influence the opinion of the Minister.</P>

      <P>If I perhaps could be permitted a few sentences, I am quite happy about the ability of the board to advise.  I am concerned that the Minister might, perhaps, be restricting the nature of the order which he could make and be binding himself to make an inflexible type of order under the wording of the amendment. I would be quite content if the matter were looked at in this light between now and the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge and, I think, Senator O'Higgins, queried the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;receipt of the letter&rdquo; which is in the draft as it now stands.  The phrase could be interpreted as meaning when the letter of resignation was received in the Department and it thereby limited the Minister's opportunity to withdraw the resignation.  Senator Dooge suggested that, under the section as drafted, a member intimating resignation at a later date would find the resignation effective, and the Minister would be precluded from possibly retaining an excellent person by reason of the tightly worded drafting as it now stands.  I accept the point of view that the section as drafted is too tightly drawn and that is why I propose the amendment to delete &ldquo;and the resignation shall take effect on receipt of the letter&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

      <P>I feel the section is improved by the deletion of these particular words.  It was indicated on Committee Stage that a person on resigning might well be resigning because of a very sharp difference of policy.  It would be quite inappropriate that, at the time the letter is stamped in the registry of the Department of Transport and Power, such a resignation would take effect.  On a quick reading it appears that by the deletion of these words, it is necessary for the resignation to reach the Minister's desk and he will be aware of the resignation, and the reasons for it, before it can take effect.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, having deleted these words, when does the resignation take effect?  We have deleted the words which ensured that it took effect at what we thought was an inappropriate time.  What is the position in regard to the time when the resignation becomes effective?</P>

      <P>The point was made by many Senators, particularly Senator FitzGerald, on Committee Stage that instead of this section we should apply the appropriate clauses in the Companies Act, 1955.  I have had a look at that since Committee Stage <Col N="1080" /> and the draftsman advises me that the Companies Act provisions, which refer to commercial companies, would not be appropriate to the statutory body we envisage in the Nuclear Energy Board.  However, the draftsman has come much of the way to meet the point made and the amendments are designed for this purpose.  The provisions, as they now stand, are standard provisions and the amendments we now propose are a departure from the existing pattern.  The points made were valid in regard to the disclosure of interest.  As the Bill stood prior to amendment, the situation was that somebody who could be of considerable value to the board in their discussions on nuclear matters would be prohibited from taking part in and making a constructive contribution to such discussions.  The improvements here are desirable; they mark a new departure.  The points of view expressed by Senators are valid and I should like to see a similar type of drafting in all future legislation dealing with State boards.  I am very thankful to the Senators who contributed to the discussion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, may I express our pleasure that the Minister has introduced this amendment and gone a fair distance towards meeting the points raised.  If Senator Alexis FitzGerald were here he might still press the Minister in regard to one or two points in connection with the amendment as it stands.  I mention these points so that the Minister might consider them.  Recalling what Senator Alexis FitzGerald said on Committee Stage in regard to the question of direct or indirect interest, he might well press the Minister in this instance to follow the Companies Act, which, so far as I am aware, specifically excludes interest by members of the family of the person concerned.  This may not be quite as relevant in this connection as it would be in the Companies Act but, nevertheless, it is a point which should be remembered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the amendment indicates that the person shall take no part in the deliberations of the board relating to such contract save to such extent as the chairman of the <Col N="1081" /> board may permit.  This is in line with what was suggested by a number of Senators when this matter was discussed on Committee Stage.  However, it raises one particular point at this stage.  One asks oneself what is the position of the chairman himself in regard to this.  The amendment seems rather to be drawn to take care of the position of an individual member of the board and it seems that it may be stretching the wording of it to say that this covers the position of the chairman.  In the case in which the chairman had made a particular disclosure I should like to raise the point as to whether it is proper for the chairman to preside over a subsequent discussion.  If he did, he would only make such interventions as he permits himself.  Nevertheless, one knows that a chairman, without speaking <i>ad rem</i> in a particular discussion, can merely by his formal control of the discussion make it move in certain directions.  I would ask the Minister if he would consider further whether it might not be necessary to make special provision to insert a paragraph to take account of the particular position of the chairman and to consider if he might not be required to hand over to a deputy and perhaps remain present for the remainder of the discussion.  I realise that this suggestion would involve amendment of other parts of the Bill in which the chairman is required, when present, to act as chairman, but I just want to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The only other point is that I hope no one would take advantage of the fact that a person who makes a disclosure can only make such contributions as the chairman may permit, and assume that those who have made no disclosure may make any contributions they like with or without the permission of the chairman.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I think he is as it stands, when you link sections 10 and 11 together.  On the other point of the family, in my view the phraseology we have is an improvement on the Companies Act.  That Act, as it stands, is too tightly drawn and this is the opinion of many people whose advice we sought since Committee Stage.  &ldquo;Directly or indirectly&rdquo; is a better terminology in that it is more global and more flexible.  In the view of many people, the existing terminology in the Companies Act is too tightly drawn.</P>

      <P>I think that it would be inappropriate to allow the Bill to pass finally from this House without a general word of appreciation of the Minister for the manner in which he has conducted its passage.  The Bill which he introduced was a good Bill but the Bill that he now brings to the Dáil is a better one.  In this regard the amendments&mdash;all of which were Government amendments&mdash;which were brought into this Bill in large numbers have improved the Bill.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the fact that he brought in this large number of Government amendments to meet points which had been raised by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as we dealt with it today, is substantially better in regard to the co-ordination of the regulations concerning radioactive substances.  There are a few points on which the Bill as it stands is perhaps a little unsatisfactory. There is just one I should like <Col N="1086" /> to mention and that is in regard to the penalties which arise under this particular Bill and the penalties that arise under other legislation.  The Minister indicated that an examination in regard to this fact has been initiated and I hope this point will be further examined before the Bill finally passes.</P>
    <P>There are a number of minor points which I raised here on Report Stage which, I think, could well bear further examination.  However, I should like to return to saying that we are thankful to the Minister for having introduced this Bill here; we are thankful to him for the way in which he has listened to the Seanad in this regard and we only hope that the time we have kept him here will not discourage him from introducing further Bills of this non-controversial type into this House.</P>

    <Title>Road Transport Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes amendments of road transport legislation to free the carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs for reward from the merchandise licence requirement and to provide for a measure of relaxation of the restrictions on the road freight haulage industry to enable the industry to adapt itself more easily to present and future requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to decontrol carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs arises out of my consideration of the findings of an interdepartmental study group which examined whether restrictions on the carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs should be removed or relaxed.  The group found in effect that the licensed haulage industry including CIE had <Col N="1087" /> been unable to meet adequately and flexibly the special needs of the livestock trade and that haulage of cattle, sheep and pigs could operate more effectively if restrictions were removed. A group set up by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries a short time before that to inquire into the store cattle trade also commented adversely on livestock haulage facilities.</P>
    <P>It is apparent indeed apart from these studies that illegal haulage by interests associated with the livestock trade has become firmly established on a widespread basis and that reversal of this situation is impracticable.  I am satisfied that a licensing system adequate for the exceptional needs of the livestock trade would involve the issue of so many licences that the effect would be equivalent to decontrol and wasteful of the time of civil servants, the Garda and the courts.  I consider therefore, that the sensible and efficient solution is to remove cattle, sheep and pigs entirely from the scope of the Road Transport Acts.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to exclude the carriage of horses from the scope of the Transport Acts because the special considerations that warrant this course in the case of other livestock do not apply in the case of horses.  Moreover, it would not be feasible to liberalise haulage of horses without including bloodstock.  CIE who are virtually the only professional bloodstock carriers in the country are fully geared to cater for the needs of that traffic.  Bloodstock carriage calls for highly specialised equipment and handling, and CIE have invested in a fleet of modern sophisticated bloodstock vehicles.  The board also have special arrangements for door-to-door transport of horses between Ireland, the UK and the Continent.  I am convinced that liberalisation of carriage of bloodstock would merely facilitate the erosion of the valuable traffic built up by CIE and undermine the economics of the regular service and costly equipment which is necessary.</P>
    <P>As a result of reports in recent years it is now possible to measure the overall composition of the road freight transport market and to make a quantitative assessment of the extent to <Col N="1088" /> which the rigid restrictions on road haulage for reward either assisted the maintenance of railway services or affected the cost or efficiency of road haulage in general.  An analysis of road freight transport was carried out by the Central Statistics Office in 1964. This was published in 1967 as &ldquo;Sample Survey of Road Freight Transport 1964&rdquo; and was presented to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, a paper based on the survey was delivered to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society in 1967 by an officer of the Central Statistics Office in which the results were further analysed and relevant comparisons made with railway statistics and with the results of similar road transport surveys made in Britain.  The survey was, of course, conducted on a sample basis and is subject, therefore, to sampling errors.  The Central Statistics Office believe that the sampling errors for total road freight activity are only of the order of 2½ per cent but that sampling errors for detailed subdivisions may be significantly greater.  Projections of these results and certain other figures used in these studies are also estimates and therefore subject to reservations.  Nevertheless, this survey brought to light a great deal of new and valuable information of great relevance for national transport policy which has been of great assistance to me and my Department. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the work of the Central Statistics Office in this field and of the officers concerned. I have been anxious to have similar and improved surveys carried out at regular intervals but, because of staffing difficulties, the Central Statistics Office have not, so far, been able to conduct further surveys.</P>
    <P>I cannot deal at great length with the results of these studies but should bring to the notice of Senators some of the more important and relevant. Total estimated ton mileage for road freight traffic in 1964 was 1,048 million ton miles.  Of this total it was estimated that 83 per cent was accounted for by haulage on own account using a total fleet of 44,180 vehicles.  CIE road transport with 860 <Col N="1089" /> vehicles accounted for 6 per cent of the total and licensed hauliers with 1,140 vehicles for 11 per cent.  This total figure, of course, included local deliveries and similar kinds of transport for which CIE and the licensed hauliers do not cater, but this element could not be segregated with any accuracy. Nevertheless, it is significant that for hauls of over 100 miles 81.5 per cent of tonnage was carried on own account, 4.7 per cent by CIE and 13.8 per cent by licensed hauliers.</P>
    <P>In the same year, ton mileage of railway freight amounted to 212 million ton miles of 17 per cent of total estimated freight ton mileage for 1964.  The railway, however, accounted for 24.9 per cent of tonnage for haulage over 50 miles.  Comparisons with rail are relevant, of course, only where rail services are available and it is estimated that in 1964 the railway carried 43 per cent of tonnage originating in Dublin and 38 per cent of tonnage consigned to Dublin.  The overall picture of freight transport in 1964 is, of course, a static one and it is necessary also to consider trends.  Detailed or strictly comparable estimates are not available to anything like the same extent for other years because the sample survey was confined to 1964 but there are figures or estimates available which do show the trend.  Thus total estimated road freight tonnage increased from 38 million tons in 1960 to an estimated 64 million tons in 1968, an increase of 26 million tons.  This latter figure is based on a projection of the 1964 sample survey results.  CIE road freight tonnage increased from approximately 2.5 million tons by 1½ million tons to 4 million tons in 1969.  Tonnage figures for licensed hauliers are not available except for 1964 when they amounted to 6.4 million tons but total mileage accounted for by licensed hauliers increased from 27 million miles in 1964 to 33 million miles in 1967, and it may be assumed that tonnage increased in at least a comparable ratio.  Rail freight, which amounted to 2.69 million tons in 1960, fell to 2.46 million tons in 1964 and increased to 3 million tons approximately in 1969.  The general picture which emerges is of a growing volume of freight of which the railway share is relatively static.  A small <Col N="1090" /> part of the increase is accruing to CIE road freight and to the licensed hauliers but the bulk of the increase in volume is being carried on own account.</P>
    <P>The increase in rail tonnage since 1960 is due mainly to increases in bulk long-haul traffic and this is reflected in the steadily increasing average length of haul from 82.2 miles in 1960 to 101.27 miles in 1969.  While CIE has been able to maintain and even increase the absolute volume of rail freight this continues to be a diminishing portion of the growing total volume of freight. Moreover, maintenance of the volume of rail business has involved keeping down rail freights to highly competitive levels.  Thus average rail receipts per ton mile which were 4.93 pence in 1959 amounted to only 4.37 pence in 1969 despite the heavy increases in costs in the interval.  It is clear that the prospects of increasing rail freight depend very much on bulk and long-distance traffic carried at rates sufficient to deter large commercial and industrial interests from using or increasing their own fleets.</P>
    <P>A striking feature of the figures I have quoted is the inordinate proportion of road freight carried on own account.  In Ireland in 1964 81 per cent of total tonnage was carried on own account and 81 per cent of tonnage hauled over 100 miles was also on own account.  By contrast, in Britain in 1962 only 51 per cent of total tonnage was carried on own account and only 32 per cent of tonnage on hauls over 100 miles was on own account.  A further contrast is to be found in vehicle utilisation.  In Ireland own account lorries over five tons performed on average 186,000 ton miles as compared with 132,000 in Britain showing greater utilisation of own account vehicles in Ireland.  But in the case of haulage for reward annual average ton mileage for similar vehicles in Ireland was only 109,000 compared with 193,000, in Britain, indicating an inferior utilisation of Irish vehicles in this sector.  Disparity in vehicle utilisation is also reflected in much higher empty mileage per vehicle in Ireland than in Britain.  A further contrast with Britain lies in the composition of the whole road haulage fleet.  In Ireland the professional road <Col N="1091" /> haulage industry consists of CIE with some 860 vehicles, unrestricted as to size or area, together with some 840 professional hauliers of whom 700 are restricted to only one vehicle and not more than 20 can operate three vehicles or more.  Only 100 hauliers in Ireland are licensed to carry throughout the State.</P>
    <P>In Britain there is a large number of substantial firms engaged in the industry who suffer no restrictions as to size or area such as apply in Ireland. These comparisons, despite the differences in conditions in the two countries, do suggest a significantly lower level of efficiency in the road freight industry in Ireland with consequent higher costs and poorer quality of service for industry and trade.  Indeed, it is clear that individual firms limited to one or a few vehicles and in most cases restricted as to area cannot offer comprehensive or efficient services, avail themselves of modern management techniques, or employ highly qualified personnel.  Neither can they benefit from economies of scale or organised back-haulage so as to enable them to offer rates more competitive with its own account operation.</P>
    <P>The CIE road freight fleet is, of course, subject to no similar restrictions but its management must take account of the interests of the railway, provide railhead deliveries and collections and operate regular services, not always economic, to meet public need and replace withdrawn railway services. Against this background, therefore, it is not surprising that over the years there should have been a very marked trend to own account haulage by larger industries and traders accompanied by complaints of high transport rates and inadequacy and inflexibility of transport facilities.  The existence of inadequacy of facilities is well borne out by the fact that the price payable on transfer of a single-vehicle licensed business exclusive of goodwill and the cost of equipment, has, I am informed, exceeded £7,000.  This figure merely represents the scarcity value of the licence and is by itself a very strong indication of the inadequacy of the private sector of the licensed haulage industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The considerations I have outlined suggest that not only have the rigid restrictions of the Road Transport Acts led to reduced efficiency and to a consequent inordinate growth of carriage on own account, but have not served to protect the railway to any significant extent.  As I have indicated, rail freight has remained relatively static in our rapidly expanding economy, consisting more and more of the long-haul bulk traffics for which it is specially suited and the maintenance of this position has required holding down rates to a level competitive with large scale own account road transport.</P>
    <P>Road transport licensing, which was always very much less restrictive in Britain, was the subject of a public Committee of Inquiry there in 1965. The report of this committee found, <i>Inter alia,</i> that the restriction of road transport by licensing reduces efficiency with no off-setting advantages, had not helped the railways and could not do so without a very large and complex administrative machine and without placing a heavy burden on industry and trade.  Restrictions on road freight transport in Britain have now been abandoned.</P>
    <P>In other countries, also, quantitative restrictions on road transport haulage have been largely abandoned.  Transport policy in Common Market countries aims at the most economic and efficient use of road transport under harmonised conditions of competition. Own account haulage in these countries is unrestricted and there is free access to the professional haulage industry, subject only to qualitative conditions related to professional competency, technical and safety considerations and financial integrity.  We must accept that in the Common Market we would have to move towards a completely liberalised position for road transport.  Indeed, the conclusions I have earlier drawn would, in any case, indicate that in our own interests we should move in this direction.</P>
    <P>In our expanding economy with its growing element of foreign trade and dependence on exports the overall efficiency and cost of transport must be <Col N="1093" /> the main aim of transport policy; the possible effects on CIE's finances must be a secondary consideration.  In any case, I do not believe that the adverse effects on CIE, even of complete liberalisation, would be unduly serious. The railway is maintaining its role in the bulk and long-distance carriage for which it is best suited but is doing so only by keeping rates down to a competitive level.  CIE road freight services operate profitably.  Insofar as any particular measure of liberalisation led to an overall increase in efficiency with lower transport rates by licensed hauliers, CIE might well have to adjust their rates to remain competitive.  The main competition to the railway, however, will inevitably continue to come from own account transport.  It is in any case indisputable that the cost of any reduction in CIE freight rates, in itself a very desirable measure in the interests of the economy and the export trade, would be very much less than the total reduction in cost over the entire transport sector and the consequent benefit to the whole economy, brought about by any general reduction in road freight rates.  Even if this involved some marginal increase in subsidy to maintain the railways we would have to face up to it.  Moreover, an increase in efficiency and reduced rates in the professional haulage sector should help to direct traffic from the own account sector with benefit to both the licensed hauliers and CIE.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have said it might well be argued that we should move rapidly, if not immediately, towards complete removal of quantitative restriction on road freight transport for reward subject only to qualitative conditions directed towards technical and professional competency, financial integrity and general social and economic interests.  But there are other important considerations to be taken into account.  The existing licensed hauliers whose opportunity to expand and improve their businesses has been impeded by the restrictions under which they work must be given an opportunity to put their house in order.  Likewise, we must bear in mind the need to protect their substantial investment in vehicles and equipment <Col N="1094" /> and to avoid heavy over-investment in equipment which might be encouraged by too rapid measures of liberalisation. We must also bear in mind the uncovenanted but real scarcity value of their licences for which many new entrants to the trade have in recent years paid in cash when acquiring existing licensed businesses.  Already relaxation of administrative restrictions on the transfer and acquisition of businesses and on lorry weight have permitted some expansion of activity and should permit the emergence of larger and more efficient units with consequent reduction in real transport costs.  My aim is to proceed by stages so as to permit the existing haulage industry to expand and improve in efficiency in our growing economy to the point where we can consider the complete removal of quantitative restrictions and the admission of new entrants to the haulage business without prejudice to the equitable rights of existing efficient operators.</P>
    <P>For this reason I am, at this stage, proposing only a modest measure of liberalisation which should facilitate some expansion and improvement in the efficiency of the private sector of the industry and which should have no significant adverse effects on the railway or CIE, but it is abundantly clear that in the context of our probable entry into the Common Market and the overriding need to improve efficiency and reduce transport costs in the interests of the export trade and of industry generally, we shall have to move further in due course in the direction of abolishing all quantitative restrictions on haulage for reward. In the meantime, the market is growing rapidly and there is ample opportunity for all efficient operators, including CIE, to expand and improve their businesses.</P>
    <P>The present Bill provides, firstly, for the removal of weight limitations on licensed vehicles.  In earlier years the standard lorry weight provided for in hauliers' licences corresponded precisely with the weight of the vehicles as weighed for tax purposes and enforcement of the weight restrictions was simple and uniform.  Changes in the law relating to vehicle taxation <Col N="1095" /> and the special weight concessions granted administratively to permit the use of diesel engines, creels, <i>et cetera</i> in the interests of more efficient opertion have, in large measure, made it impossible to enforce weight restrictions satisfactorily.  Most licensed hauliers are now operating the size of lorry which suits them best and the relaxation provided for in this Bill goes little beyond recognising the existing position.  Instead, therefore, of being confined to the standard lorry weight prescribed by their licences as modified by existing concessions, hauliers will be free under the Bill to use the size of lorry best suited to their business but they will be limited to the number of lorries which they had in operation or were entitled to have in operation on the 1st January, 1969.</P>
    <P>This date has been chosen to ensure that hauliers who, in anticipation of this legislation, might have expanded the numbers of their fleets by acquiring lighter vehicles will not enjoy any unfair advantage.  In just over 100 cases the licensees will be authorised by an amendment which I introduced in the Dáil to operate one extra vehicle over the number operated on the prescribed date.  I shall refer to this later.  There is provision at section 4 of the Bill to enable me to make fair and equitable adjustments in the case of hauliers who at the prescribed date were not operating their normal complement of vehicles.</P>
    <P>I know that Senators will be concerned lest a substantial increase in the numbers of heavy lorries should have deleterious effects on our roads. I do not anticipate that this measure will lead to any rush by hauliers to plate larger vehicles.  As I have already indicated, they are at present generally in a position to use the type of vehicle that suits them best.  There is no limitation on the size of vehicles used by CIE yet only half of the CIE fleet consists of lorries in excess of five tons unladen weight.  Similarly, only a small percentage of the private account fleets consists of very large lorries. Licensed hauliers would have no greater incentive than CIE to use heavier vehicles.  The dimensions and <Col N="1096" /> carrying capacity of vehicles are, of course, the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Local Government from the safety and traffic point of view and nothing in this Bill affects any regulations or prejudices any steps which he may feel it necessary to take.  I am satisfied, however, that any restrictions on the size or type of lorry which may be justified by safety considerations or in relation to wear and tear on the road systems should apply all round and should not be confined to licensed hauliers who have less than 5 per cent of the total road haulage fleet.  Of all lorries over five tons weight CIE, licensed hauliers and unlicensed hauliers, that is to say, for turf and in city areas operated 1,042 in August, 1969, as compared with 2,041 such vehicles on own account.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for the abolition of existing restrictions on area of operation.  Of the 840 licensed hauliers concerned only 100 are at present entitled to carry throughout the State. The balance are entitled to operate in areas ranging from a radius of 10 to 15 miles or a single county up to substantial areas comprising the greater part of the State.  These restrictions have been a major factor in preventing improvements of efficiency in the industry. They have militated against the provision of comprehensive and efficient services to industry and the export trade and against the organisation of back-haulage and consequent reactions on costs.  They have also discouraged the amalgamation of businesses into larger and more efficient units and have excluded a large number of hauliers from participation in the cross-border trade which was liberalised some years ago with the result that an unduly large proportion of this trade has now been taken over by Northern Ireland hauliers who are not subject to any restrictions of this kind.  A final consideration is that liberalisation of cattle transport will bear heavily on those licensed hauliers who were legitimately engaged in it and it is both equitable and in the public interest to provide them with alternative opportunities to maintain and develop their businesses.  The removal of area restrictions represents a <Col N="1097" /> concession to the many hauliers with very small areas but none at all to those 100 or so who, up to now, have had no area restriction.  As a &ldquo;levelling up&rdquo; gesture, and I referred to this earlier on, each one of these 100 hauliers will, as I have previously mentioned, be allowed to operate one extra vehicle.  The relevant provision is in section 3 (1) (d) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the concessions provided for in respect of commodity and area apply only to existing carriers, that is those professional hauliers who were licensed under the 1933 Act or the 1944 Act which brought certain previously exempted areas within the ambit of the legislation.  They do not apply to special licences granted since then to meet local needs or special circumstances such as licences to permit the use of small vehicles for local distribution of Sunday newspapers, for instance, or for the operation of local services in Valentia and Achill islands for which no licensed transport was available.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill will enable me to authorise road transport for reward by hauliers coming from abroad.  The Government in 1966 authorised the complete liberalisation of cross-Border haulage for reward subject to the exclusion of haulage from point to point within the State.  This decision was taken because of the over-riding importance of our export trade and the development of trade with Northern Ireland generally.  With the development of car ferries between this country and Britain and the Continent there has emerged a rapidly growing roll-on/ roll-off traffic, particularly in perishable commodities, including fruit and other imports from abroad and exports of meat and other produce from this country. This traffic has been facilitated as far as possible by administrative measures which somewhat strain the statutory provisions of the Road Transport Acts.  It is desirable and necessary to make appropriate provision to deal with these developments on a comprehensive basis.</P>
    <P>I should point out that it is the long-term policy of the Common Market and among the member countries of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport, of whom <Col N="1098" /> we are one, to achieve complete liberalisation of international road haulage subject to harmonisation of fiscal, technical and social conditions of competition.  The Common Market countries and the European Conference of Ministers of Transport have already agreed on the establishment of experimental multilateral quota schemes which will enable holders of multilateral licences to operate freely throughout the territories of member countries.  Presently, such international traffic in Europe is facilitated under bilateral agreements concluded on a reciprocal basis.  To permit us to become parties to such multilateral or bilateral agreements and so enable CIE and our licensed hauliers to engage in this potential traffic and to regularise entry of foreign hauliers under formal agreements or otherwise the powers provided for under section 8 of this Bill are essential.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for the regularisation of the licence held by a particular firm.  It was found in the course of preparatory work for this Bill that this particular firm's licence, which had been issued under an incorrect category in 1937, was now on a strict interpretation of the law no longer valid.  The Bill aims to remedy this position on a reasonable and equitable basis.  I will deal with this point in detail at the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some considerable length on what is after all a relatively short Bill which will not make any immediate substantial change in the law or practice governing road transport for reward.  I have done so mainly because the Bill marks a departure from previous thinking and policy in this field and must be regarded as a first important step towards a completely new regime more in keeping with the growth and orientation of our economy and foreign trade and the practice in other countries, with whom we are likely to become much more closely associated, even if we were not to become members of the Common Market.  Our present legislation is very much a relic of the very different conditions which prevailed from 30 to 40 years ago.  It is now inadequate and inappropriate and the Bill represents the first of a series of measures which <Col N="1099" /> we shall have to take, on a phased basis, over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Before closing, I should reiterate that nothing in the present Bill should militate against existing legitimate interests.  The aim is to secure greater efficiency and reduce transport costs, and to reverse the present trend of the industry to haulage on own account to the advantage of the professional haulage industry of which CIE road freight is the largest component.  It is up to the haulage industry to ensure that these objectives are achieved by offering to all users of road transport the improvements in quality and efficiency of service which these relaxations are intended to provide.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said in his very comprehensive statement, this is a relatively short Bill and also it is a Bill in which the changes he proposes are reasonably modest ones. However, as the Minister emphasised, the Bill does propose fundamental changes in our whole concept of road transport and for this reason will be generally welcomed by the Members of the Seanad.  The Minister's statistics which he gave during the course of his remarks are certainly very revealing and indicate that he is rather belatedly introducing measures which at least some of his predecessors should have introduced several years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quite wisely and realistically has accepted the policy to hasten slowly having regard to the special circumstances of CIE.  We would all agree that any sudden or rushed measure that would endanger the livelihood of a transport concern employing some 20,000 workers would be strongly resisted by every public representative in this House and in the other House and throughout the country.  The measures which the Minister has outlined are without exception acceptable.  He has quite rightly pointed out that, whether we like it or not, within a very few years we will be competing with carriers from countries inside the Common Market.  Unless we can put our own house in order quickly we are going to be at a very serious disadvantage, <Col N="1100" /> not only in handling the products of our factories but also in dealing with imports from competing member countries.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises that the time has come to appraise the limitations of the 1933 and 1934 Road Transport Acts and to release the transport industry, in general, from the straitjacket of those Acts.  The reasons which may have induced the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to bring the 1933 and 1934 Acts into being have long since passed.  The time has now come for fresh thinking on the needs of the Irish road transport industry in the 1970s.  The Bill recognises that the restrictions imposed, for possibly very good reasons, 40 years ago are now inhibiting the efficient development of transport without any compensating advantages in the way of increased employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has demonstrated very forcibly in his statement that, far from assisting the development of CIE, the restrictions of the 1933 and 1934 Acts have had, if anything, the opposite effect.  The current situation in this country, as statistics have demonstrated, are in many ways making the worst use of available road transport, resulting in excessive costs.</P>
    <P>The decision to decontrol the carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs is a welcome step and gives greater flexibility to the special needs of the livestock trade.  The Minister has mentioned the exclusion of the carriage of horses.  I am sure the Seanad will agree that, on balance, this is a right decision although some case might be made for the carriage of horses for slaughter.  This is a specialised business in which CIE have made considerable investment in specialised equipment and have gained considerable experience in the handling of these valuable animals.</P>
    <P>Some comment was made in the other House on the preponderance of the road traffic handled by merchants on their own account: in other words, the carriage of own goods.  It is a revealing statistic that more than 80 per cent of the goods transported by road are carried by merchants or <Col N="1101" /> traders on their own account.  This development would not have increased over the years were it not for the fact that merchants, traders and manufacturers believed that the most efficient way of carrying their goods, or products of their factories was by their own transport.  I am quite satisfied that many of those merchants and manufacturers would far prefer that the transport of their goods, which is a highly professional business, would be carried out by CIE or licensed operators, provided one or other of them could offer an equal, or more competitive, system.  I am sure that I am quite right in saying that no manufacturer would, by choice, engage in the road transport business if he were satisfied that he would get at least as good, or perhaps a better, service through CIE or through some other licensed carriers.</P>
    <P>It is only appropriate, in discussing the road transportation of goods, that we should pay a tribute to the wonderful service given by these licensed hauliers.  Most of these hauliers are one-man concerns who work long hours and give a highly efficient and competitive service to the firms and factories they serve.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the transport of goods is a professional job and anything that will encourage the creation of larger units in the road transport business should be encouraged by every possible means.  Road transport firms in England and on the Continent give a highly efficient service at a reasonable cost.  They provide good conditions for their staffs and, due to their size, they are in a position to guarantee satisfactory and stable employment to them.</P>
    <P>The part CIE play in the general transport business, as the Minister has stated, is essentially that of a carrier of bulk transport over long distances. There is no danger of competition from the licensed haulier or the private trader in this field.  It is interesting to note in the Minister's figures that, although the total volume of goods carried by CIE has increased substantially in recent years, the cost per ton mile has gone down.  This is due largely to developments in the carrying of bulk transport <Col N="1102" /> and in particular the development of the mining industry and the carrying of metal ores from Silvermines and other areas to the nearest ports.  This is also due to the development in the cement trade whereby cement is transported over long distances.</P>
    <P>Comparable organisations, large units, are required for transport to operate in Common Market conditions by carrying the products of our factories across Europe.  It is interesting to note that this type of inter-country transport has become almost the complete monopoly of the continental, North of Ireland and UK carriers.  It is quite obvious that if we do not move with the times and take the necessary measures to ensure that Irish carriers can compete with their continental and UK rivals this business will become an even greater monopoly of outside interests in the years to come.  For this reason we must welcome the measure the Minister is now introducing.</P>
    <P>The development of the ferry service between this country and Great Britain, and Great Britain and the Continent, is one that must be integrated with the road transport service.  The Minister referred in his speech to the fact that the Bill contains reference to internal transport only in this country.  The Minister is remiss in that in bringing this Bill before the Seanad he did not give some indication of his thinking on an integrated road transport, ferry transport and sea transport service between this country and the Continent.  I hope, when he is replying to the various points raised by Senators here, he will give us some idea of his thinking on this development.  Our position, on the fringe of Europe, will call for the adoption of the most modern and sophisticated methods of transport. The provisions in this Bill are to be welcomed in that they do give the haulage industry an opportunity of developing and preparing for the general liberalisation of transport under EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statistics relate to 1964 when a survey of the road transport industry was carried out.  I would suggest to the Minister that the time is long overdue for an expert investigation <Col N="1103" /> into the road transport industry so that the Minister would be in a position to know what changes and developments are necessary to equip the transport industry to meet conditions in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Any re-equipment or radical changes in the present structure of the road transport industry will be very costly and for this reason the Minister should give some indication that the State is prepared to assist the rationalisation of the industry.  It is not possible, in present circumstances, for the hundreds of small individual road carriers to compete against the giant carrying corporations of foreign countries.  Measures should be introduced to assist the licensed hauliers to group themselves into larger units to enable them to withstand competition from UK and continental carriers.  Otherwise we will have the position in a few years time where this section of the industry will become a virtual monopoly of outside interests.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will give some hope to the licensed hauliers that State assistance will be forthcoming to enable them to compete with the well-organised road transport industries in Britain and on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister touched on the effects on our roads of large trucks.  I am aware, as we all are, that 20- and 30- ton trailers and trucks have a very bad effect on our roads.  They slow down traffic.  I appreciate that they pay very substantial road taxes.  However, the time is now opportune to have a look at the structure of road taxes. If we are to provide a highly efficient road transport system, either through the aegis of CIE or larger road transport firms or through individual licensed carriers, the whole question of the road network will have to be considered. That will involve the expenditure of many millions of pounds.  Anyone who has seen the throughways or freeways on the Continent or in the US will understand the reasons why road transport is so successful at low cost in those countries.  Compare this with the conditions here, where on a main road, between Dublin and Cork, for instance, enormous vehicles hold up a succession of vehicles for many miles. <Col N="1104" /> There is a tremendous job of road reconstruction to be done and unless the cost is to fall directly on the taxpayers and the ratepayers in individual counties, the tax structure in regard to these larger vehicles will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not mentioned this in his speech but I hope the roadways question is being examined and that some form of national transport body, some central body who would take into consideration the road network concurrently with the question of road transport generally, is being contemplated by the Minister or one of the other Departments, possibly Local Government.  Development on the realistic lines the Minister desires could be completely inhibited, unless there is a suitable road network system to cater for developments in vehicular traffic.</P>
    <P>There are some other points in the Minister's speech which are worthy of comment.  He mentioned the liberalisation of conditions in regard to outside carriers coming into this country.  This necessitates the expediting of the developments outlined in the Bill and for this reason I should like to reiterate my view, a view expressed in the Dáil during the course of the debate, that the Minister will have to face up to the necessity for financial assistance to enable those engaged in the road transport industry to group themselves so as to be able to compete with outside firms.  I am repeating myself on this point.  The good intentions of the Minister should not be blunted by ignoring the capital cost implications of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome in general the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister realises that the present static condition of the road transport industry cannot be allowed to continue.  He is to be congratulated on facing up to this situation. The measures he is now introducing are, as he said himself, tentative measures towards a greater liberalisation policy.  Whether we like it or not, we will have, within the next few years, a situation in which we will have to face up to a complete liberalisation of road transport.  It is better to face up to that situation now and to take the necessary steps towards this.</P>
    <P>The safeguarding of employment for <Col N="1105" /> 20,000 people in the national transport company, CIE, will not be helped by closing our eyes to the economic facts of life.  I would much prefer the Minister's approach in doing all we can to help CIE to do a good job and, if necessary, increasing the subsidy to enable them to exist primarily on the carriage of bulk cargoes over long distances.  Private enterprises should be allowed to compete fairly for road transport so that internally and externally we will be able to offer our manufacturers, traders and farmers the best and most efficient transport system possible, comparable with systems in the countries that will be their competitors in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill particularly from the point of view of liberalisation of the transport of livestock.  CIE were priced out of this trade and a much better service was given by the private hauliers.  The private hauliers can provide a tremendous service and they were very agreeable.  One did not get the same service from CIE.  In addition, their costs were much more realistic than those of CIE.  From my own experience in the livestock business, CIE costs were roughly 50 per cent more than the private hauliers'. I shall give one example.  A friend and I were at the sales in Ballymahon and CIE asked if they could carry our cattle home, and quoted a price.  We had not made any arrangements for carrying home the cattle but could not accept the offer of CIE because of the high price quoted.  We then engagd two private hauliers at two-thirds the price quoted by CIE.</P>
      <P>CIE could never realise the economics of the business and were never really able to enter into the competitive cattle transport business.  They were never able to give a comparable service, particularly as regards time. That was where the private haulier really beat CIE&mdash;not alone in price but in time.  In 99 per cent of cases you could set your watch by the time a private haulier would arrive and you were always sure that your cattle would arrive on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had one awful experience with CIE.  They were to bring my cattle <Col N="1106" /> to the sales in Dublin.  They arrived reasonably well on time, loaded the cattle, and I waited the usual three-quarters of an hour, or one or two hours, before I left in my own car to come to Dublin.  At Kinnegad I caught up on the lorry which had been loaded an hour earlier.  It had got a puncture and they were waiting until somebody arrived with another wheel which had to come from Longford. Naturally, my cattle were late for the sales, so the next time I had business I engaged private hauliers and have had the utmost satisfaction with them.</P>
    <P>Private hauliers have been able to keep down the price per head, even compared with what was being paid 30 years ago.  The price of the journey to Dublin has increased considerably but the number of lorries has increased immensely. I remember paying 30s a head to bring cattle to Dublin 30 years ago.  I am paying exactly the same price today.  At that time there would be only about six or eight cattle to a lorry: today there are 18 to 20 cattle.  With the larger lorries, they have been able to keep the price down in a reasonably competitive way.  The non-liberalisation of transport forced many farmers to become law-breakers. Normally it is not a practical proposition for a farmer to own a lorry unless he is dealing extensively in cattle. I know because I have had a couple of lorries in my time.  Some farmers went backwards and forwards to sales but did not always fill their lorries, so they were asked to bring home a few cattle for other farmers.  This practice made them law-breakers although they were obliging somebody, but in order to make the journey a more economic proposition these farmers were paid for the service.  Therefore, it is good to see an end to such a practice. One was never safe with CIE because they were liable to inquire at any stage, even if the lorry were empty.</P>
    <P>If transport is liberalised now, particularly in relation to the cattle business, anybody may operate, and I welcome it.  There is much transport on short haulage backward and forward to sales.  CIE had never been interested in this aspect of the haulage business and for the past year or so have given up the haulage of cattle. <Col N="1107" /> It is a welcome change, without the State having to pay compensation to the plate owners.  There are hundreds with 32-county plates and this will allow them to have an extra lorry now. I must compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It means that people will be compensated with the Department having to part with money.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that 80 per cent of transport is carried by firms using their own lorries.  The reason for this high figure has been a breakdown with CIE. I know of some firms who would gladly give this business to private concerns or to CIE if they could get the same service. There are firms that actually bend the law by leasing lorries to employees, who are paid on a rate per service basis.  This is the same as if a plated lorry or CIE were doing it.  If CIE really gave a good service one would find that 80 per cent of private business would drop, because most firms would prefer to engage a haulier.  It is difficult for a firm to supervise its employees all the time.  The question of big overtime enters into it.  If a firm could get their tonnage brought at a certain figure, or so much a run, it would be easier on both the manufacturer and the business firms.  They would be able to work their costs much easier than having to provide their own transport.</P>
    <P>By and large, I think most of them would say that providing their own transport is not economic but just that they have a more satisfactory service and more control of it.  I feel that CIE should seriously consider going after a lot of this business and trying to give the service that is demanded by our industrialists and firms.  They went after it a number of years ago but this bulk transport seemingly has fallen down. They should go after it again because there is in this a big volume of business which can be tapped.  I know firms that are giving it out in another way and CIE would get it if they could give the service.  It would be welcome from the exchequer point of view if they could enlarge their business because it would mean that they would be able to make it pay, or at least they would not be looking for this huge subsidy every year.  The business is <Col N="1108" /> there.  It is only a case of going after it and getting it.</P>
    <P>Particularly in the meat trade, the big lorries from Europe seem to have completely dominated this end of the run with the ferry service.  Any time I go to a meat factory leaving cattle, on the roads I see those huge frozen containers. They seem to be international: they come from Italy, France, Belgium, anywhere.  For my part I like to see stuff being exported but I would prefer to see an Irish firm doing it.  Here again some of our factories are big enough to have their own transport but they do not want the trouble of having to provide the capital required and the supervision, and they are prepared to go to international firms to provide it. As I have already said, it is easier to work your costs if that were done.  That was a business that CIE seemingly did not even bother going after.  It was there for them and they had the capital to go after it.</P>
    <P>I see the Bill does not include the carriage of horses.  I know that CIE have been doing this work but I have heard that often in the past trainers were dissatisfied because they could not use their own horseboxes, particularly in the case of a trainer who had only one or two horses going to a meeting. He could provide the service with his own transport and seemingly he is not allowed to do so now.  That is just a criticism I have on it, but by and large they seem to be doing a fair service there.  However, the Minister might consider the feasibility, where there would be only one or two horses, of permitting the person to provide the transport himself.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with section 10.  All the legislation that we have had of a restrictive nature has not protected CIE.  Indeed it has been the reverse to the extent that the money they are looking for now is much more than what they needed 15 or 20 years ago, even taking the changing values of money in the time between.  Restriction never leads to good business.  I feel that maybe with this liberalisation CIE will try and pull up their socks and go after business.</P>
    <P>I presume it is the railway that will <Col N="1109" /> do the bulk of the long distance haulage. Although they have nearly the monopoly of it, I would say that CIE would want to pull up their socks even in this regard, because looking at the length of the lorries you see when you are coming up behind them, overall length 41 feet, 50 feet, 54 feet, if the lorries are to get that big I would imagine that they will be able to compete favourably with if not excel CIE, and here again it is the service that they will want to look after if they are to keep it.  Those private men with the big lorries will give a service and in most cases be able to give a better punctuality.  I think timing is a very important factor in that you are sure of the lorry arriving at the appointed time.  With labour so costly at the present time you need to organise your business and if you are to have a lorry there at 9 o'clock or 12 o'clock you organise for that schedule.  If it does not arrive until 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock, it means that men are hanging around and it is costing the firm money in the process of having to wait.  Usually I find that those private men are able to give the timing.</P>
    <P>Regarding the heavy lorries, I should like to ask the Minister if he could take up the matter with his colleagues to provide that the heavy lorries would not hold up traffic.  I have seen maybe two, three, four, five lorries on the roads.  Two or three are the ones that really cause the trouble. When they get behind one another they literally hold up traffic for miles. This situation could be saved if a lorry driver, knowing he could not pass out the one in front of him, were obliged to leave a space for three or four cars between him and the next lorry so that the cars could pass him, get in and wait until a space would come again to get out.  Otherwise, you want a very long straight for a car to pass out three or four lorries.  It means you take a big gamble in trying to pass out three or four lorries all together.  This is happening quite frequently on the roads.  The only road exempt from this would be a dual-carriageway.  On every other road out of Dublin or out of any town, you are held up when two, three or <Col N="1110" /> four lorries of any size get tight up against one another.  If some regulation could be made that they must leave a certain space between one another so that cars can hop in and out, this could save a lot of accidents.  People become frustrated if they have to travel for miles behind a big lorry or if they are caught in a big build-up of traffic.  These people are inclined to take a chance and chances occasionally have bad results.</P>
    <P>In general I am quite happy with this Bill.  It will have a beneficial effect on transport in this country.  Again, I should like to give a warning to CIE that they should pull up their socks and go after the private trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senators Russell and Crinion, I, too, welcome this Bill.  It is fair to say that it caused a certain amount of anxiety to the representatives of CIE employees and to the licensed hauliers when it was announced that the Minister was introducing this Bill.  The Minister seems to have met the problems and the anxieties in a fair manner.  I am very pleased that nearly 40 years after the passing of the 1933 Act we have a Minister who is prepared to amend and liberalise the transport of cattle, sheep and pigs, because I and many people felt that there were many anomalies in the 1933 Transport Act. Many people were very unfairly treated as a result of the 1933 Act when it came to the issuing of licences when the new licensed haulage operator came into operation.  Many of us here know, although it is quite a long time ago, &mdash;perhaps if we were wise we would not be giving away our ages in this way as it is about 38 years ago&mdash; that those licences were being issued by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, the people who were the pioneers of road transport in the twenties and in the early thirties and who used the old Ford ton truck to carry sheep and pigs to the markets and fairs were overnight put out of business.  I do not mention cattle because many of the trucks at that time were capable of carrying only calves. As transport improved trucks were capable of carrying cattle.  Those <Col N="1111" /> people who were engaged in the transport of livestock and who did not get licences have been fighting a running battle with the law since because, to their credit, most of them stayed on. They have provided a great service to the farmers and livestock producers of this country.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am glad that the Minister, even at this late stage, has introduced this legislation that will in some way compensate those people for the services they have provided in the transport of cattle, sheep and pigs. I believe the concessions in the Bill satisfy the people who were so adversely affected by the issuing of licences.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the licensed haulier may fear that the Bill will not help him because he was licensed to carry cattle.  Many of them paid very high prices, not only for their trucks, but also for their licences.  Now they find that they are in competition with people who have been handed a licence for nothing.  The Minister has gone a long way and I am sure he has satisfied the licensed hauliers in as much as he has allowed them to increase the weight of their trucks.  One hundred of them can get an extra truck and the rest of them, who were confined to limited areas&mdash;some of them with as few as three, four or six counties&mdash;can now operate throughout the country, if my interpretation of the Bill and the Minister's speech is correct. This is concession which I am sure will be welcomed by the licensed hauliers.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced there was anxiety this would have an effect on employment in CIE.  I do not think it will.  I can speak with a fair amount of authority on this.  CIE have not been engaged to any great extent, in the transport of cattle.  I agree with some of the things Senator Crinion said with regard to the reasons but I do not agree with others.  It would be very difficult for CIE to provide the service they were expected to provide, even under the 1933 Transport Act, with regard to the haulage of cattle. It is all right for a big farmer like Senator Crinion, who would send about 20 fat cattle to the Dublin market, to <Col N="1112" /> ring up CIE and have a lorry on tap at the right time.  Unfortunately, they cannot guarantee that they will not get a flat wheel and be late for the fair. By and large, the man with four or five cattle could not get the same service from CIE for economic reasons.</P>
    <P>We can criticise CIE for many things and we can talk about the service that CIE can give, but we should be fair to them.  There are many firms in this country who have their own transport. They haul what is economical for them to haul of their own goods and products. Such small items as the carton of cigarettes are handed over to CIE. Sometimes one wonders why these are not sent through the post.  I hate to see a CIE truck going from shop to shop with small parcels.  This is a service that CIE provide, even though it is most uneconomic for them.  It is difficult for CIE to provide an economic service for everybody who requires them to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the effect heavy lorries will have on our roads. This is a big problem.  I often wonder is it right that we have or should have those huge ten and 12 ton trucks with a trailer almost as big as the truck attached to it.  While it is all right on our main roads, arterial roads, they are having a very serious effect on our county roads.  I am not going to criticise the carriers operating those heavy lorries and trailers because they pay a hefty road tax.  Road tax is intended for road maintenance.  That is the aim of it, but unfortunately not all of it finds its way back to the maintenance of the roads.  Since they pay a very heavy road tax I am sure that they are entitled to put the heaviest tonnage possible on their trucks.  I feel we may have more and heavier transport, especially on our county roads.  Indeed, I am sure the Minister, when he comes as far as Leixlip on the road from the west, finds these big containers coming down from the meat factory and turning to the right towards Dublin at the chapel.</P>
    <P>What Senator Crinion has said in that respect is to a certain extent correct. It appears that eventually we will channel all our transport to roads, because the time has gone when the <Col N="1113" /> people of this country are going to go to railway stations or other railheads in order to collect their goods.  They now want them driven on to the premises and, whether we like it or not, CIE or other firms are going to provide this service.  To provide it in the most economic way it means that they must buy the trucks that will carry the maximum amount because the more tonnage they carry the cheaper they can carry it and the more economical it is for them.</P>
    <P>While I am saying this, I know it is not in the Minister's power to do anything about it.  However, it might be no harm if the Minister for Transport and Power had a word with the Minister for Local Government as to what will be required in view of the fact that so much of the freight of this country is going to be carried on our roads.  We all realise that our roads are incapable of carrying what they will be intended to carry in the very near future.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that we will have to be competing with these huge trucks that will be coming in when we join the Common Market.  If they have to come in here and compete with us there will be roads required even for our own transport.  This is something that will have to be looked at.  This Bill serves a worthwhile purpose and the Minister is to be complimented on introducing it, even at this late stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I should like to join with those who welcome the Bill.  I think it is a forward-looking step and the Minister is to be complimented on its introduction.  I would just ask the Minister to consider seriously at this time, as he has indicated that he will have under review in the Bill the entire transport system of the country, the freeing of other products.  In the interest of the farming community there could be a case made to free the transport of lime.  We probably would have a reaction to some extent from the transport companies, from CIE and those that are presently engaged in the transport of lime. Nevertheless, time and time again the farmers complain that they are not getting the subsidies that are chalked <Col N="1114" /> up against them.  This is one of the headings here under which a benefit could be passed on to the farmers who are paying transport costs on the lime. This subsidy was really going to the transport companies and in some cases going to the quarry owners who are transporting the lime themselves.  The Minister should consider the freeing of lime.  That would be welcomed by the farming community generally.  I say this in the knowledge that farmers could easily operate on a community basis, in so far as they could draw the lime themselves.  That would bring about a greater use of lime.  They could help each other out with tractors, lorries or by whatever transport a farming community could arrange within its own local area.</P>
      <P>A case could also be made for the freeing of agricultural produce such as potatoes.  Perhaps this applies to my own part of the country more than any other.  Nevertheless, a case could be made for it.  A number of farmers now have to have their own transport of some kind, whether it be a tractor or an articulated vehicle, and this should be liberalised to the extent of allowing the farming community to work on a community basis.  Consideration should also be given to the inclusion of fish on the grounds that it is specialised.  While at the present time public transport is giving quite a good service, this could be improved on by allowing the free transport of fish.  It is a specialised job.  Those engaged in it would have to live very near the port to be on call round the clock.  If this were included and freed it would give much more efficiency in the industry and would help the industry to the extent that people would specialise in it; we would get fresher fish and faster delivery and it would be generally welcomed in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestions here are maybe too sweeping but I make them in view of the Minister's indication that this Bill be reviewed from time to time.  I would also suggest that county councils throughout the country be free to hire transport on a competitive basis for the haulage of sand, gravel, stone, clay or other road-making material. At present we have situations where <Col N="1115" /> the public transport company has not always the lorries and the transport that the local authority demand.  At times they engage private trucks to haul on a licence-charge basis for the local authority.  This is a very indirect way of dealing with it.  It is very inefficient. It gives a lot of trouble in so far as the payments are made to the public transport company that allows the licence to be passed on to the private carrier.  It is very unsatisfactory to the private man who is hired through the public transport company and it is very unsatisfactory from the local authority point of view.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to include those items.</P>
    <P>In general, I think this Bill represents a very good step forward.  The produce and lines that I have mentioned are of a non-goods nature and I do not think they will seriously affect CIE or the other transport companies that are involved.  The introduction of the Bill will bring about a healthy air of competition which can only do good.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see in this Bill, the decontrolling of the carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs.  This is particularly welcome by people living in the west of Ireland who had serious problem in transporting their animals. <Col N="1116" /> The Minister gave as the reason for decontrol of this type of livestock was the setting up of an interdepartmental study group, and he also referred to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, who recommended this action.  The Minister also referred to the illegal haulage of livestock.  I thoroughly agree with the Minister and I am sure anyone in the House living in a rural area will also agree.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan pleads for other commodities to be decontrolled, such as fish, potatoes and lime.  Many other things could be mentioned, such as fertilisers.  The Minister would be well advised to have complete decontrol of the haulage of all merchandise.  This would solve the problem, particularly in the west of Ireland.  I am not in a position to comment on the position in Dublin, Limerick or other built-up areas.  There is not much point in saying that there will be an increase in the number of licence hauliers.  In my own county I doubt if there is any licensed haulier there who would be prepared to do a haulage for people who have been compelled to use this transport. Offhand, I know of only one licensed haulier living within a radius of 50 miles of my home.  In Roscommon, the Minister's home county, the situation is somewhat similar.  If this problem is to be solved in the west it can only be solved by decontrolling the transport of all goods.</P>
      <P>The problem of traffic congestion in Dublin city is caused by lorries from rural parts coming here to collect merchandise during the peak hours.  I have often wondered if any thought has been given to the possibility of operating this business at night instead of during the day.  This is done in some European countries.  I believe this would give great ease here in the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to welcome this Bill, particularly in relation to the liberalisation of livestock haulage.  This means that private lorries can now transport cattle to and from marts and farms and in this way are performing a good service for the marts and for the livestock industry generally.  Most of these lorries are <Col N="1117" /> owned by small farmers or dealers and probably they understand better than CIE drivers the vagaries of the four-footed animal.  CIE were not able to provide the cheap service needed by those dealing with livestock.  The more personal approach of the private lorry owners is the service wanted by farmers generally.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the introduction of co-operative farming, or the co-operative ownership of machinery among farmers.  I believe that more use must be made of this practice in the future, if small farmers are to survive. In my own area a number of these machinery co-operatives have been set up, particularly in regard to the handling of the beet crop.  We can make use of our machinery co-operatives as far as the transport of the beet to the factory is concerned.  If five or six farmers co-operate to buy a lorry and if they are allowed to use it for that purpose, this would be a natural offshoot of machinery co-operatives. However, I do not think that it is permitted now, but it should be.</P>
      <P>This also applies to the carriage of milk to creameries, particularly in the south, where one frequently sees a queue of farmers' carts or transport of some kind waiting their turn to deliver small quantities of milk.  This is a great waste of time.  There should be a system where four, five or six small farmers could co-operate to transport their milk to the creameries.  Farmers usually contract to have their silage cut. If the Transport Bill was strictly enforced, it would mean that a silage contractor could be prosecuted for hauling silage by road from one part of a farm to another.</P>
      <P>In regard to the haulage of lime and beet, CIE sometimes employ transport other than their own.  When they are sending a cheque to the haulier for work done, there is a percentage deducted from the cheque for an accounting charge to CIE.  Farmers costs have increased, but their returns have not increased accordingly.  This is an unfair imposition at this time and the Minister should look into this 10 or 15 per cent accounting charge imposed by CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to stress that co-operative <Col N="1118" /> farming will be a very live factor in farming in the future.  We must have some liberalisation there to allow farmers to co-operate in the haulage of their own goods on the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most of the other Senators, I welcome this Bill.  However, it is rather a belated effort on the part of the Department of Transport and Power.  For the past ten years, at least, there has been a lot of illegal haulage of livestock.  That was not without the knowledge of the Department and the people concerned.  For a number of years many people have been prosecuted for illegal haulage of livestock and fined very large sums.  I know of a few cases of people having been put out of business because of the imposition of a few heavy fines for illegal haulage of livestock.  When the Minister was framing this legislation did he consider these people who have been harassed down the years?  I suppose there is no redress for them, but those who remain in business will now be able to continue with a free hand.</P>
      <P>I should like to cite the case of a cattle dealer who owned a lorry and went to a fair in the west of Ireland. He was unable to buy a full load for himself but a farmer friend asked him to carry a load of cattle home.  He obliged, but was caught on the way home.  Many farmers were so caught but many got away with it.  He was fined £25 and costs and the man who employed him was fined another £25. To my mind, that was a grave injustice. This type of injustice should have been looked into long ago because CIE could not provide the lorries, particularly for the west of Ireland, on a given day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I am glad to see that the Minister has decided to liberalise the transport of livestock, he should have gone a bit further and allowed farm produce to be exempt also.  We have the case in harvest time of lorries being licensed by the buyers of wheat and the Department of Transport and Power to carry grain to the mills, but they are confined to a certain distance. If a farmer in County Meath is dealing with a seed merchant in Dublin and is outside the 15 mile range from the GPO in Dublin, he cannot send a <Col N="1119" /> lorry that is not his own lorry or a plated lorry.  He cannot send one of these lorries until he gets a permit or during that particular time in the grain season.  The Minister should also have included the transport of grain.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the whole system on which I have felt very strongly for a long time, and that is the advent of Northern Ireland hauliers into the Republic of Ireland.  I live in an area where there is a lot of this traffic.  I live beside Gypsum Industries, who export a lot of their product to Northern Ireland.  They had a fleet of lorries of their own some years ago hauling their products into the North of Ireland, but within the past five or six years all their trucks have been taken off the road and it has all been handed over to Northern hauliers.</P>
    <P>In my time as a Member of Dáil Éireann I put down question to the then Minister for Transport and Power on this matter.  He informed me at that time that this was a reciprocal arrangement between the Department of Transport and Power here and the Department in Northern Ireland.  If my memory and my eyesight serve me right, I think the balance is all on the wrong side in this position.  It is all very well for us to say that we will have &ldquo;hands across the Border&rdquo;.  Maybe it is the wrong time to talk about things like this.  However, the fact remains that many people who were in employment driving lorries from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland hauling products for this particular firm, and many other firms that I know of, are now no longer employed in that category.  This haulage is all being done by hauliers from the North of Ireland.  I understand they are going all over the country.  The Minister should take another look at this arrangement to see that we are not putting our people out of employment in the Republic of Ireland and employing people from outside.</P>
    <P>We are very pleased to be able to do business with the people of Northern Ireland and I am quite sure that these firms are agreeable to do business with us, but I feel our first duty is to the employees in the Republic of Ireland <Col N="1120" /> to see that they are not displaced by these trucks coming in here and taking away their livelihood.  I appeal to the present Minister for Transport and Power to have another look at this problem and see if there is anything that can be done about it to have, at least, equality, if not in favour the workers down here.  I will have more to say on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister will take some of the suggestions that have been put forward to liberalise this Bill further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Senators, welcome this Bill and welcome especially the liberalisation of the haulage of cattle, sheep and pigs.  However, the Minister should endeavour to make it a bit more liberal and include practically all farm produce.  At present, I think turf is the only farm produce that can be transported by an unplated lorry without any danger of a summons or conviction.  I think that is still covered by an emergency order.  Grain and potatoes should also be included as well as cattle, sheep and pigs.</P>
      <P>I should like to support what other Senators have said about the transport of ground limestone to the farmers.  It is unfair that CIE should have a monopoly of this transport and that even the proprietor of the quarry can operate only one of his trucks for the transportation of lime.  During the summer or the spring seasons you can see lime lorries travelling up to practically 12 o'clock at night.  This involves extra expense on CIE because of the overtime paid to those drivers. If the ordinary plated lorry were allowed to operate, it would cut down the overhead expenses of CIE by a large amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that county councils should be allowed to hire lorries within their own county if they cannot be supplied by the CIE or by the plated lorries organisation.  It is unfair that unplated lorries can be employed by CIE to operate for any county council, provided they operate through the agency of CIE.  These people's profits are low enough without having 12 or 15 per cent deducted from their cheques by CIE as an accounting <Col N="1121" /> expense.  It is unfair.  When they are allowed to operate under CIE's jurisdiction the local county council should be allowed to employ them themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider the type of machinery that is used in road making, such as the Shawneepool or the large dumper.  The large dumper can go on to a road making job.  It can transport clay from one section of the job to another, for example, where the side of a road has to be built up, without any fear of a summons or a conviction.  However under the present transport regulations they are not allowed to transport gravel.  Those machines are costly machines for the plant hirer.  Since they are definitely a road making plant, and strictly used for that, they should be allowed to transport stones and gravel for the road making and not confined to the transportation of clay.  Some experts are finding it difficult to distinguish at the present time whether it is clay or gravel the Shawneepool is transporting for road making purposes.  I should like if the Minister would consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am in order here, but the Minister should seek the co-operation of the petrol and diesel oil firms, and of all those people who transport the bulk of their material by road in large tankers.  Consideration should be given to the operation of some sort of shuttle service, such as operates in England, where these vehicles travel to their destinations during the night and the deliveries are made to the local pumps or local distribution points by day.  That would ease a lot of the road hazards at present. Anybody leaving Dublin in the morning for the west when he gets as far as Chapelizod, finds in front of him four or five large lorries and probably some large tankers.  For a mile behind there is a line of traffic that cannot pass out because of the narrowness of the road.  This has the effect of causing traffic jams almost in the heart of the city and of causing a lot of traffic hazards.  If the Minister could get the co-operation of these people, along with the people from the west and east, to transport a lot of material by road during the night hours and <Col N="1122" /> make deliveries by day it would ease the traffic congestion and the hazards created during the day.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I am in order in drawing the Minister's attention to the great necessity for the subsidisation of the transport of material from the west of Ireland to the ports.  It will be a very important aspect in the build-up of industrialisation in the west if the endeavours we are now making succeed. It is a great drawback to us in our approach to any industrialist whom we wish to set up an industry in the west if the cost of transport to the ports, and to the consumers in the east, is a deterrent.  I would sincerely thank the Minister if he would give that matter serious thought.</P>
    <P>We bring a lot of material from various parts of Ireland to the west by rail.  About three-quarters of the wagons that come in loaded leave the stations in the west of Ireland on the following day or so empty.  Those wagons have to be drawn out anyway. I would like the Minister to consider the provision of a free train a week from the various points of departure in west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am practically finished with the subject but I am glad that I have drawn it to the Minister's notice.  We need this badly in the west of Ireland.  Those are the few comments that I have to make on the Bill. I welcome the Bill and I am sorry that it did not come in 30 years ago.  It would have done far more good to the people and to the community if it had been brought in instead of the 1927 Transport Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome this Bill and to agree with other Senators who said that this type of Bill should have been introduced long ago.  I am glad to learn that this is to be the first of many other measures to rationalise transport in the future. The one thing that everybody is sure of is that the methods that controlled licensed haulage in the past and which were designed to help CIE failed to do <Col N="1123" /> so.  It is acknowledged everywhere that the reason for this failure was because sufficient forethought was not given before action was taken.</P>
      <P>We have over-stocked our transport by the free enterprise idea of having self-owned transport facilities.  There is underutilisation in this field.  For that reason transport costs certainly must be harder to bear among the sectors which must use this, because somebody has to pay.  With underutilisation there is always a very definite loss, particularly to the consumer who must utilise this particular transport.  I hope that the rationalisation as far as it goes, and which the Minister now proposes, will have the effect of bringing down tonmile costs to the people who will have to use the transport.  This is the hope of everybody here.</P>
      <P>Apart from relaxing restrictions, a complete overhaul of the whole transport system is absolutely necessary.  I suppose, under the rules of order, we cannot discuss CIE rail transport.  If rail transport had been rationalised, if somebody had inquired into things happening in other countries with regard to the design of the type of rolling stock needed for modern transport we could have taken a lot of traffic off the roads.  I fail to see why something was not done to ensure that oil depots, which used to be at railway stations, were not built in the modern way and a type of rail car designed which could be filled and operate at night so as to take the weight of traffic off our roads, a weight which is causing a traffic problem as well as a haulage one.  At the same time, I see no reason why things should not be done as they are in America where a particular type of train is designed for carrying oil and which takes these huge tankers off the roads and at the same time allows the traffic flow to go at a greater rate without bottlenecks and hold-ups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I will be pardoned for digressing a little bit but this point should have been made.  I blame CIE and everybody connected with CIE because they did not attempt in the past to give one thought to the rationalisation of their rail services so that the <Col N="1124" /> traffic on the roads would not be as chaotic as it is today.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Garret when he says that in this rationalisation the Minister has shown that county councils are able to avail of lorries other than those of CIE.  We all know of the situation where it is not always possible to get CIE transport and no hauliers can be used by the county councils for their daily work unless he comes via the CIE offices.  They have a kind of licensing system of their own. CIE have fixed charges.  County councillors at their estimates meetings have to consider the charges for hauling by road.  They find that CIE will put in a fixed charge on tender and they will not vary that.  As a matter of fact, if certain conditions are not complied with, the charges are automatically raised.  We could get cheaper transport from people who have lorries of their own and we could do the county council work cheaper if this was allowed.  I see no reason why a man who has a licensed truck within the county area should not be allowed work for county councils to haul road materials.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made the point that there will be difficulties.  Wherever rationalisation takes place it may hurt the people who are already in the business.  I would not like to see any haulage operator hurt in this transitional period.  It may also encourage people to rush in and buy trucks of various types at this particular time and afterwards they may be sorry for doing so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taxing of trucks, the Minister can say that he has very little to do with this.  If there is a tremendous vehicle that will do damage to the road the only way to control this huge vehicle, which is bound to be there when the traffic is rationalised, is to ensure that it is taxed according to its real weight.  We know that in the taxation for real weight there are many ways by which people can shed some of the weight when they go to the local authority for taxation purposes.  I hope that that kind of thing will be looked after.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to roll-on, roll-off traffic.  This type of ship-borne vehicle freight traffic is something that will increase and grow, and every method that can be adopted to rationalise and free this type of traffic should be considered.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that there will be no hold-ups in this particular type of traffic and that he will do everything he can to facilitate people who will engage in this trade and buy the type of truck to carry a container.  At the moment containers are leaving Ballyhaunis, going across on the ferry to England and arriving in London some time the following morning and returning again.  The only trouble about it is that, unless the system is more rationalised and unless haulage on the return load is authorised, it will mean that the costs involved in the transport of the one-way load will inhibit the growth of this particular type of traffic.  I should like to see a situation in which a container sent out with meat products, or other types of products, would be utilised in taking a return load from either the Continent or Britain.  I hope the Minister and his Department will ensure that in future every encouragement will be given to this type of traffic.  The design of our roads&mdash;something with which the Minister has nothing to do&mdash;should in the future take into consideration that we are going to have this form of transport.</P>
      <P>Again, Sir, I welcome the Bill and I hope that it will be followed by many other Bills to bring complete rationalisation into transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for a very constructive debate on this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell welcomed the Bill and spoke about the question of regulating the size of vehicles.  Senator Jack Fitzgerald, at a later stage, referred to this matter, too, and the pressure of the heavier type vehicle on roads.  This of course, is a matter for the Minister for Local Government. However, I am not just side-stepping the matter and I will deal with it here. I know that the road traffic code <Col N="1126" /> enables the Minister to make whatever regulations he may wish in regard to safety and size and all aspects relating to road vehicles, and I am aware that this matter is under very active consideration by him.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell made another proposal which I do not think is practicable, that is the question of giving grants to private enterprise road hauliers.  The whole spirit of this measure is designed to ensure greater competition; the development of a more professional approach to road haulage and transport in this country; to generate competitiveness and thereby reduce costs so as to ensure that our internal transport system will be efficient, and to ensure that our exports will be thereby more competitive also in regard to the transport element in them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if we see the development of a professional road haulage industry here, where you have proper safety precautions, proper vehicles, properly paid employees, this is all to the good: this is what we want to see.  I do not think there is any need in this type of situation to budget for the payment of grants.</P>
    <P>Senator Crinion made the very valid point that this measure is, in fact, legitimising a position that has existed in practice in regard to the haulage of cattle, sheep and pigs.  As the law stands, as Senator Crinion says, we have been making law-breakers out of people who are, in my view, legitimately engaged, although contrary to existing statute, in the haulage of cattle, sheep and pigs, from fair to fair and from mart to mart.  This practice developed to the extent that it was, to use the phrase, making an ass of the law, and it is only right that this should be legitimised and put into perspective. This is what the Bill proposes to do in regard to cattle, sheep and pigs.</P>
    <P>Senator Crinion and other Senators mentioned the question of extending this concession to horses.  This is all right up to a point, but how do you differentiate between horses?  I have had to strike a balance here between the interests of the various people involved&mdash;the interest of the public first <Col N="1127" /> of all, of the economy, of the farming community, of trade union employees, of CIE and the interest of existing licensed hauliers.  This is why the Bill is a middle course reform measure but at the same time not designed to prejudice any of the legitimate interests that are already involved in transport.</P>
    <P>This is where the bloodstock situation comes in&mdash;in regard to horses&mdash; that, first of all, one cannot differentiate between types of horse and, secondly, there is a very substantial section of CIE devoted to the specialised carriage of bloodstock, at present, where they give an excellent service to the industry; where there are people employed who are specialised in this particular type of transportation, and where there would be disemployment if we extended this particular exemption in regard to livestock to horses or bloodstock.  I have therefore decided against that.  I might say that CIE have offered to the bloodstock breeders the concession of plating, as the phrase is, allowing unlicensed owners who have transport to carry bloodstock on local hauls of a limited nature.</P>
    <P>Senator Jack Fitzgerald raised the question about the road situation in regard to heavier trucks and this is a matter that has been taken up by the Minister for Local Government.  The Senator also&mdash;and I was very glad to hear him say this because it refers back to what I have just been talking about &mdash;referred to the fact that in practice this measure will not affect CIE employment.  I was very concerned about this all through.  I met the trade union interest concerned and the fact is that the trade union interest accept the fact that as far as the livestock specified are concerned there will be no disemployment, but any extension beyond that would mean disemployment.</P>
    <P>This brings me on to the point made by Senator McGowan and it is relevant to what I have been saying.  He, and indeed other speakers here as well as in the Dáil, suggested that this concession should be extended to the transportation of lime and, as Senator McGowan suggested, potatoes, beet, vegetables, greyhounds, poultry, fish, <Col N="1128" /> oats and barley.  All of these have been suggested at various stages during the debates in the Dáil and here.  My answer to that is: where do you end when you start this?</P>
    <P>In regard to the point made by Senator Gallanagh about milk being brought to a creamery, this is free of the road transport legislation.  The same applies to wheat agents.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other matters mentioned, we are in this measure extending the whole haulage system to a number of operators who will now have freedom of operation in the Twenty-six Counties without restriction to commodity or weight.  In effect, this means that, along with the 860 vehicles owned by CIE, there will be 840 other vehicles owned by private enterprise, who will be roughly in a 50:50 position of competition against them and who will have unrestricted and unlimited freedom of action throughout the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds asked for complete decontrol in this field.  I indicated in my introductory speech on the Second Stage that this, in my view, will be the ultimate result of legislation. This legislation is a preparatory measure designed to see how this freeing-out process will work.  In the future, if it is necessary to go further in the way of decontrol I would be all in favour of it.  I am all for liberalisation and competition in this field but, at the same time, one must move with reason and ensure that the existing legitimate interests I have already mentioned are not torpedoed overnight, as it were.  The very fact that one is extending the licensing system within the private enterprise sector to this extent &mdash;instead of having 100 or so 26 County licensees, one is now going to have 840 26 County licensees&mdash;is a substantial leap forward to ensure competition and to ensure that there will be hauliers available, both State and private enterprise, in every part of the country who will be entitled to haul in any part of the country and that there will be free mobility with regard to the sale and purchase of these licences.  It will also ensure that they will not be centred in any particular areas, as happened heretofore, <Col N="1129" /> or limited in any degree, so that from Donegal to Cork one will be able to purchase a licence and establish oneself in any part of the country where the business opportunity occurs.</P>
    <P>I think that meets the point made by a number of Senators with regard to extending the scope of the Bill to allow for further exemptions other than cattle, sheep and pigs.  In fact, with the sort of competition which I envisage from the figures I have mentioned, there will be ample scope for professional hauliers to do this business without a need for exemptions. There will be ample scope for competition and, in that context, I do not see much point in developing the exemptions beyond the level of livestock. I may say that in the very nature of the transportation involved in cattle, sheep and pigs, where timing is important and where various day and night hours are involved, there is an immediacy involved which does not apply in regard to the transport of lime, grain, fish, potatoes, beet, vegetables and so on which are all dead goods, as it were.  The transport of these goods can be organised on a reasonably scheduled basis but livestock are in a particular category of their own and are rightly exempted here.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly mentioned the point about the North of Ireland arrangement in regard to haulage.  The point I have just made is relevant here, too. Once you have 840-odd licences operating, these will all be able to operate contiguous to the Border. Senator Farrelly complained that Northern Ireland operators coming south have an advantage at present. This point is valid having regard to the situation at present where we have a very limited number of licences contiguous to the Border.  Now we will have 840 licences&mdash;apart from CIE&mdash; here who will have the right to operate into the Six Counties and operate throughout the country.  The whole matter has been put on a more competitive basis and if the haulage operators here, with this type of concession and with this type of arrangement, are competitive enough they will be able to deal with the North of <Col N="1130" /> Ireland competition.  It will be their business to deal with that competition. I wish them good luck and I hope they will be able to deal with that competition in a competitive manner.  The criticism Senator Farrelly mentioned here is more relevant to the situation that now exists and which we hope will no longer exist once this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>The point was made about local authorities in regard to the haulage by lorries of road making materials.  Local authorities can hire any licensed haulier.  There appears to be some misapprehension here.  CIE, as a subcontracting arrangement, can arrange for the &ldquo;plating&rdquo; of unlicensed hauliers. This has been their practice over the years.  It is just a matter of business operations and enables CIE to fill a gap, as it were, where they have been hired to do a job by a local authority and may not be able to supply the required number of vehicles to do the job in a given period of time.  In that type of situation they are entitled, or empowered, to plate an unlicensed vehicle for the particular operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the general principles in the Bill which are, fundamentally, very straightforward. These principles are (a) to face the reality with regard to livestock, and to decontrol livestock, cattle, sheep and pigs from any form of restriction whatever; (b)&mdash;this is, in my view, the most important aspect of the Bill and is the real reason behind it, although the matter I have just mentioned has got a lot of publicity&mdash;the overcapitalisation in Ireland by people in haulage, particularly in own-account haulage. We have far too many trucks in this country which are underutilised and which cost business people and firms far too much money by reason of the underutilisation of these lorries.  As far as business and industry, small and big, are concerned there is far too much money invested in haulage plant having regard to the needs and the resources of the country.</P>
    <P>What we want to do here is to build up a really efficient private enterprise transport arm.  I would envisage this Bill helping towards the development of a number of efficient private enterprise <Col N="1131" /> firms in the haulage industry.  We would hope these would reduce costs and would be proper professional haulage firms, in the best sense of the word, giving the maximum service that can be given by such a professionally organised company and giving the maximum service to business, industry and agriculture generally.  This is what we would like to achieve and this is the whole purpose of the Bill.  It will be very interesting to see how it eventually turns out.  If further legislation is necessary in this direction I will see that it will be brought in.  This Bill should go a long way towards meeting this objective.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous to think that we have a situation at the moment where over 81 per cent of our haulage here is own-account haulage.  This figure is about 30 per cent above the British average. It is far more ahead of the Common Market and the American average.  We must reduce this wasteful investment by business people and by industry in own-account haulage in trucks and lorries that are underutilised and staffed by people who are also underutilised and we must instead develop a proper professional transport arm. This is the real purpose of the Bill and that 81 per cent own-account haulage figure will go down rapidly when we are in a position in which 840 Twenty-six County licences can be amalgamated, merged into various forms of companies, firms, partnerships and organisations that would be actively competing against the other 50 per cent State-owned organisations.</P>
    <P>This is also good for the State-owned organisations.  It is a happy coincidence that the percentage is roughly 50:50, so that we will have a legitimate competitive situation between private enterprise and public enterprise in this highly competitive field.  It is very necessary to be competitive in this field as we move towards the EEC because by reason of our situation on the very fringe of Europe it is all important, so far as our competitiveness is concerned, to have our transportation system organised as efficiently as possible.  It is far more imperative for us to be efficient in this field than <Col N="1132" /> any other country in the Common Market or those seeking entry to the EEC.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for the welcome given to the Bill and that, if there is any matter which occurs to Senators between now and the Committee Stage whereby the Bill can be improved, I shall be glad to hear their views and take cognisance of them on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee and the Strabane and Letterkenny Railway Company and for the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the undertakings to CIE.  An important feature of the Bill, and one which I will deal with in more detail later, is the provision for payment of compensation by the Exchequer to holders of baronial guaranteed shares in the Strabane company in consequence of the proposed dissolution of the company.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains a number of provisions dealing with measures to improve safety on the railways, the transfer of responsibility for maintenance of road surfaces on overline bridges to local authorities, toll charges at Fiddown Bridge, County Kilkenny, the handling of claims for redundancy compensation under the Transport Acts and with other miscellaneous matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Donegal Railways Joint Committee operates road passenger and freight services in the southern part of County Donegal.  Prior to 1st January, 1960, when the lines were closed, the joint committee operated rail services on its own lines and on the railway line between Strabane and Letterkenny which was owned by the <Col N="1133" /> Strabane company, in which the joint committee holds a majority interest.</P>
    <P>The joint committee is owned in equal shares by the Great Northern Railway Board and the British Railways Board.  Since 1964, however, the GNR Board's interest in the undertaking has, for all practical purposes, been represented by CIE.  British Railways have for many years been anxious to sever their connection with the joint committee and the Government decided in 1961 that CIE should take over the road transport business of the joint committee and should enter into negotiations with British Railways with a view to arriving at a basis for a financial settlement.  These negotiations, which were protracted, culminated in CIE signing an agreement with British Railways on 31st May, 1967, the text of which is scheduled to this Bill, whereby, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation confirming the agreement and payment of the sum of £57,742 by CIE to British Railways, the rights and obligations of British Railways in the joint committee and in the Strabane company would be transferred to CIE.  Pending enactment of the necessary legislation CIE have taken over British Railways' interest in the joint committee and in the Strabane company.  The board had, in fact, taken over management of the undertaking since 1st January, 1966.</P>
    <P>To give full effect to the Government decision that CIE should take over the road transport business of the joint committee, CIE also entered into an agreement with the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, successors to the Ulster Transport Authority, under which, subject to payment by CIE of a net sum of £3,449, the assets and liabilities of the GNR Board in respect of the joint committee and the Strabane company would be transferred to CIE.  This agreement, which was made in pursuance of the provisions of the agreement scheduled to the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, was formally approved by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Development on 21st March, 1969, and by my predecessor on 3rd April, 1969.</P>
    <P>The terms of the financial settlements with British Railways and the <Col N="1134" /> Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company were based on a valuation of the assets of the joint committee and took account of anticipated continuing annual losses on the operation of the joint committee's road transport services. No payment was made in respect of goodwill.  Things have turned out better than expected, however, and I am glad to be able to say that the joint committee's undertaking is now operating at a profit.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms the financial settlement between CIE and British Railways and provides for the transfer to CIE, with effect from a date which I shall fix by order, of the assets and liabilities of the joint committee and of the Strabane company, excluding any liabilities of the latter company in respect of its baronial guaranteed shares.  CIE will continue to provide the road transport services, both passenger and freight, which are being provided at present by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>All staff employed by the joint committee immediately before the transfer date will become CIE staff.  There are in all about 100 staff involved, of whom 81 are permanent staff.  The Strabane company has no employees. I am taking this opportunity to assure the House that no member of the joint committee's staff will be disemployed as a result of the transfer of the CDR undertaking to CIE.  It may be found necessary, however, to transfer some clerical staff to CIE locations outside County Donegal, but transfer of other staff are not at present envisaged; the necessity for such transfers at some future date cannot, however, be ruled out.  Transfers of CDR staff will be covered by the same arrangements applicable to CIE staff and there will be full consultation between CIE and the trade unions in advance of any such transfers.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for the preservation of the pension rights of existing and former salaried employees of the joint committee who are members of the British Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  These particular staff are being seconded to CIE pending completion of arrangements which are at present being made <Col N="1135" /> by CIE to set up a separate fund, with an appropriate share of the assets of the British fund, to which members of the fund in this part of the country, including CDR staff, will be transferred. This will require legislation both here and in Britain in due course. Until these arrangements have been completed it will be necessary to keep the joint committee nominally in existence.</P>
    <P>On being transferred to CIE, members of the CDR regular wages grade staff aged between 21 and 50 years will automatically become members of the CIE wages grade pension scheme. The position of employees who are ineligible for membership of this scheme because they are over age will have to be examined by CIE in consulation with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Strabane company, in which the joint committee holds all the debenture stock and 87 per cent of the share capital.  The remaining shares, which are privately held, include baronial guaranteed shares with a face value of £17,510 and 148 ordinary shares which are not guaranteed.  Payment of dividend at the rate of 4 per cent per annum on the baronial guaranteed shares was guaranteed, under statute, by Donegal County Council and by Letterkenny Urban District Council. These guarantees involved the county council and the urban district council in annual payments of £640 and £60 respectively, but following the termination of the joint committee's rail services on 1st January, 1960, the two local authorities discontinued their payments on the grounds that they had been advised that they ceased to be liable for these payments when the railway ceased to operate.  The Strabane company, on the other hand, was advised that the liability of the local authorities continued.  Apart from 1960, when the Strabane company paid the dividend in anticipation of a settlement of the dispute, no dividend has since been paid to the holders of the baronial guaranteed shares.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the guarantees on the baronial guaranteed shares were given to the Strabane company, not to <Col N="1136" /> the shareholders, and as such these guarantees would become unenforceable on dissolution of the company. Furthermore, the financial position of the Strabane company is such that there would be no assets available, on a winding up, to make any payments to unsecured shareholders, whether guaranteed as to dividend or not.  All the available assets of the company would be claimed by the joint committee, which has priority rights as holder of the company's debenture stock.</P>
    <P>In considering this aspect of the matter, the Government were conscious of the fact that in the reorganisation and writing down of the capital of railway companies guaranteed shareholders have generally been treated with some consideration.  In all the circumstances, the Government decided that the holders of the baronial guaranteed shares should receive compensation from the Exchequer on the dissolution of the Strabane company. The amount of money involved was relatively small&mdash;the total cost to the Exchequer is about £14,500&mdash;and the baronial guaranteed shareholders were, after all, the innocent victims of changing circumstances.  Section 13 of the Bill provides that CIE shall, within two months of the transfer date, pay to each guaranteed shareholder such amount which, if invested in Government securities, would produce the same amount in interest as he would receive if dividends were being paid on the baronial guaranteed shares. Section 13 also provides for payment of the arrears of dividend on these shares with effect from 1st January, 1961.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of the joint committee's undertaking with CIE is a logical development.  The Bill puts a statutory seal on the practical arrangements already made for the transfer of the CDR undertaking to CIE and provides for continuity of the road transport services already operated by the joint committee.  It is very satisfactory to be able to record that CIE are taking over an efficient and profitable unit and I hope that this will continue to be the position.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to carry out some desirable <Col N="1137" /> amendments of transport legislation to improve safety on the railways and to deal with some other miscellaneous matters.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill provides for the substitution of automatic controls for gates at level crossings at which CIE have no statutory obligation to provide attendance, although in some cases attendance is provided.  These are level crossings on roads which were not public roads at the time the railway was built but have since been taken in charge by the road authorities concerned. CIE's statutory responsibility is confined to maintaining gates on either side of the railway and it is the responsibility of users to open and close the gates.</P>
    <P>There are over 70 such public road crossings and some of them carry a considerable volume of traffic.  Where no attendance is provided by CIE, the gates are more often than not left open by users of the crossings thus creating a serious hazard for both road and rail traffic.  There has been a number of fatal accidents at these crossings and the question of improving safety arrangements has been under consideration by a working group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Local Government and CIE.</P>
    <P>The working group have recommended the installation of automatically controlled flashing lights and bells, without barriers, at seven of the more dangerous crossings, without prejudice to the addition at a later stage of any further protective measures, that is barriers, which in the light of experience may be considered necessary.  It is expected that the group will recommend similar installations at other crossings as their examination of individual crossings proceeds and that the continuing development of road traffic will create a need for further similar installations in the future.</P>
    <P>As the need for these additional safety measures arose out of the growth of road traffic which compelled road authorities to make the roads part of the public road system, section 23 of the Bill provides for the sharing of the cost of providing and maintaining these automatic installations between <Col N="1138" /> CIE and the appropriate road authority in each case.  It is proposed in section 25 of the Bill to increase from £2 to £25 the penalty for failure to close gates at unattended level crossings.</P>
    <P>Again in the interests of safety, it is proposed in section 29 of the Bill that engine drivers and persons whom CIE wish to train as engine drivers shall be subject to compulsory medical examination. CIE have made periodical medical examination a condition of employment since 1968 for new entrants to the grade of locomotive driver and the board is most anxious that such examination should be compulsory for all engine drivers with a view to ensuring the detection at the earliest possible stage of drivers who might be suffering from diseases which would constitute a disability for driving and a public hazard.  I am in agreement with the board that this additional safety measure is necessary.  It will be a matter for negotiation between CIE and the trade unions as to how men who are found unfit will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Section 36 deals with another railway problem&mdash;the misuse of the communication cord on passenger trains. This has been a growing problem in recent years and is particularly prevalent on trains which are being run for sporting occasions.  In some cases the cord has been pulled repeatedly with consequent lengthy delays to trains.  In the hope that an increased penalty will act as a deterrent in such cases, section 36 of the Bill provides for an increase in the penalty from £5 to £25.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill deal with a variety of matters including the application to level crossings on railway lines in this country owned by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company of section 9 of the Transport Act, 1958, which provides for the substitution of automatic controls for gates at level crossings on roads which were public roads at the time the railway was built; the transfer, subject to payment of compensation, of responsibility for maintenance of road surfaces on overline bridges from CIE to road authorities; the transfer from CIE to Westmeath County Council of liability to maintain <Col N="1139" /> Float Bridge on the River Inny&mdash; this would also be subject to payment of compensation; the reference in future of all disputes in redundancy compensation cases to the Circuit Court; the fixing of toll charges at Fiddown Bridge, County Kilkenny; and certain provisions relating to two of CIE's subsidiary companies, Aerlód Teoranta and CIE Tours International Incorporated.  I do not propose to deal in more detail at this stage with the miscellaneous provisions.  They can, in my view, be more usefully discussed during the Committee Stage debate.  All I can say now, impromptu, is that it is a miscellaneous Bill which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the Minister that this Bill is aptly titled.  I do not think that I have ever seen a more miscellaneous Bill during my period in this House.  On looking at the various provisions one has the same reaction&mdash;one wonders why all these things were not done long ago.  One almost has visions of a dusty file at the back of a press for which nobody could find the key. Either the key was ultimately found or the lock was broken open, the file was taken out, the dust blown off it and the Bill introduced to deal with the various matters that have been mouldering there for some years.</P>
      <P>Here we have a picture of private railways operating on their own in one corner of the country; epidemics of unfastened gates at railway crossings; power-blind drivers careering throughout the country, and a question of activities by the CIE Tours Company on the American scene.  So we have in this, as the Minister has said, a very miscellaneous Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is customary on Second Stage to look for the principle that underlines a Bill and to discuss that principle. The only principle that one can detect here is that it is advisable to clean up transport legislation, to take all these outstanding items and to put them in order in one measure.  On that principle there can be no quarrel.  The things which the Minister recommends in this Bill are all, on the face of <Col N="1140" /> them, desirable and quite properly they should be done.  At the end of his speech, the Minister mentioned that because of the nature of the Bill, it is probably far more appropriate to discuss the matters in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, there are a few comments which I should like to make in general.  Part II of the Bill, which encompasses almost 20 sections, is concerned with the final taking over of the County Donegal Railways.  This appears to make adequate provision for the taking over of this company. One might say that our Irish railway system has been so much the result of the amalgamation of smaller companies that the carrying out of this operation should by now be virtually an automatic, smooth procedure, with all the difficulties known for a long time past.  I do not know if baronial shares are a new complication of the situation but it seems to me that these have been certainly as generously dealt with as anyone could have possibly hoped for.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if these interests are being more generously compensated than was the practice.  In the case of taking over of companies in the past, for example, does this represent a more generous treatment than that of the shareholders in the Great Southern Railways Company? This was once the most attractive of investments for people in this country, but subsequently had a sorrier history.</P>
    <P>In Part III of the Bill we have a number of provisions in sections 22 to 25 dealing with the question of level crossings.  At this stage I should like to ask the Minister a question which might help us to a more appropriate debate on Committee Stage.  From time to time one notices in the newspapers accounts of accidents at level crossings. It may be that they are reported more often, but there seems to be a tendency for such accidents to increase.  This may be no more than a reflection of the increase in traffic on roads which hitherto carried hardly any traffic at all, but I should like to ask the Minister if he has information in regard <Col N="1141" /> to the incidence of accidents at level crossings and, in particular, if he has any information which he could give us, either now or on Committee Stage, in regard to the safety history of the automatic crossings, some of which have been put in in the past few years because, as I understand it, what is proposed here in the Bill is an extension of the idea of automatic barriers or, indeed, flashing lights.  It is not enough to say that people will get used to this new system.  One takes what happens in other countries.  For example, in the United States of America in all the years that they have had this system, despite all the injunctions that at every crossing you must stop, look and listen, the number of accidents at such crossings remains inordinately high.  It would be helpful to us if the Minister had some information on that when we come to discuss this Bill in detail.  It certainly seems necessary that there would be an educational campaign in regard to the dangers at such level crossings and it may well be necessary to make a quite substantial effort in this regard.</P>
    <P>The provisions in sections 26 and 28 in regard to road maintenance and the passing over of maintenance by CIE seem eminently reasonable and acceptable. The provisions in section 29 in regard to medical examination of locomotive drivers are one of those that one would have expected to have seen in legislation long ago.  One can only hope that they are now just merely a statutory enactment confirming what is the position in practice.  This is, of course, a most difficult area.  We know from reports of railway accidents from time to time that very often it is just that a driver passed a red light realising afterwards he had done it and unable to explain why.  There is, indeed, scope not only for legislation in regard to this but there is scope here for research into the causes of such accidents.</P>
    <P>Sections 32 to 35 deal with the company incorporated in the United States to promote CIE tours.  As I understand it from the sections here, the intention is that this company should be completely separate from CIE rather than a subsidiary.  I may well be minister-preting the sections here.  If not, I <Col N="1142" /> should be glad if the Minister could indicate what is the reason for this. For example, in section 32 we appear to be allowing for the position that anybody at present working for CIE who in future is to work for CIE Tours International is apparently to be terminated in their employment with CIE and then be employed by the company with transfer of superannuation rights.  I should be glad if the Minister would let me know if I am correct in my interpretation of this.  If so, what is the reason why this is handled in this way rather than by a secondment or anything of this type?  These are points which I have raised because in them I am looking for specific information which might be more helpful and, like the Minister, I think it appropriate that more detailed comment be left over until the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Dooge, I welcome the Bill because I feel that this is necessary legislation which perhaps should have been introduced earlier, but we welcome the provisions at this stage.  I should like to make most of my remarks at the Committee Stage of the Bill but just direct the Minister's attention to a few general points which he might mention in his reply to the debate.  First of all, he mentions that the staff of the County Donegal Railway Company numbers about 100.  Perhaps he could give the House some idea of the actual scope of the operations of the system when he is replying, because I have no idea of the number of vehicles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this.  Perhaps we could have a rough idea of the size of the company.  It is obviously not a big one.  I should like to make a general point.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill which to my mind even out the apportionment of finance from the railway company to local authorities in maintenance of road surfaces, bridges, <i>et cetera.</i>  I think that our railway company are usually at a disadvantage <Col N="1143" /> when costings are done, at least when they are done in public, because the full cost of the railway operation is borne by the railway company, and road hauliers and transport systems using the roads do not bear the full cost of the operation.  I will quote from the EEC <i>Manual on Transport:</i></P>
      <P>The fundamental principle underlining the EEC common transport policy is that traffic should be distributed between the different modes of transport by means of free competition after the full apportionment of infra-structure costs to the transport operators.</P>
      <P>I think this is very important.  Whenever we are talking about our railway system we should bear this in mind, as it is difficult to apportion the costs to, say, a licensed road haulier, but this must be done to compare it fairly with the railways who bear the full brunt of the costs involved in the operation, whereas the road hauliers are supported by the people who maintain roads and this is a tremendous proportion of the total bill involved in road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, I welcome the change in legislation on level crossings.  Certainly the safest type of level crossing is the level crossing with a gate which is manned, but this is now getting prohibitively expensive.  We can expect the number of manned level crossings to decrease with time and the number of level crossings with automatic barriers to increase.  I commend the warnings on RTE as to the correct operation and the correct way of using the automatic crossings.  I think these are excellent warning advertisements, much to be commended.  They make their point briefly and very well.  The public have no excuse for misusing these level crossings.  But whether they have an excuse or not, they will probably continue to do so.  I welcome the Minister's reference to a study group dealing with the problems of level crossings, because even the automatic barriers will prove too expensive to install in every case. We will be reduced to the question of grade crossings that are in operation in the US in which the lesser used level crossings are just marked by a post with two crossed pieces of wood with <Col N="1144" /> the words &ldquo;rail crossing&rdquo; or &ldquo;level crossing&rdquo; and then it is up to the driver who is approaching this to look out for trains and make his own way safely across.  This will involve further danger for the motoring and the pedestrian public but it is something that must be faced and a further campaign of warning by advertisement will help in the introduction of these crossings which are essential.  I welcome the change in legislation on level crossings.</P>
    <P>There are a few further points. Regarding the medical test for drivers, I note that the Minister has pointed out that CIE have been carrying out medical tests from time to time.  Medical examinations have been made a condition of employment since 1968 for new entrants to the grade of locomotive drivers.  Because these tests have been carried out over the last few years that will ensure that we do not find, on the test becoming statutory, a large number of our locomotive drivers legally unfit for service.  Presumably this will not be the case because the test has been gradually introduced.  I certainly welcome this provision.  It is essential that people who drive public vehicles which carry large numbers of passengers or large goods trains should have medical tests, just as it is essential for airline pilots to have the same sort of test to ensure their fitness for the service.</P>
    <P>In section 31, dealing with the Fiddown-Portlaw Bridge, there is a present toll of one old penny.  Perhaps it is the Minister's intention, with which I do not agree, to change it to one new penny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with section 22 of the Bill which provides for the substitution of automatic controlled gates at level crossings at which CIE have no statutory obligations to provide attendance.  What is stated in this section is entirely correct.  Many roads are now public roads and they have been improved and tarred.  The volume of traffic which uses these roads is considerable.  This section of the Bill, in my opinion, does not go far enough. It should provide for the introduction of grids in preference to gates.  Very <Col N="1145" /> few farmers today drive livestock across railway tracks.  They are usually transported by tractor-trailer or truck. If those grids were installed on each side of the railway at level crossings it would completely eliminate the maintenance of gates.  Many of those gates are far too narrow and they are often left without being properly maintained.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of installing grids in preference to gates.  There is no company or body in a better position to install grids than CIE themselves with the amount of surplus rail track they have and the amount of worn track which they remove from the lines from time to time.  They could provide those grids at a very minimum cost.  We all know that many accidents have occurred over the years as a result of having to get out of a car to open one gate and cross the railway to open the second gate.  By the time that person can get back into his car a train may have come along and a fatal accident may have occurred.  I should like the Minister to have a second look at this and introduce some section that would allow for grids in preference to gates. The maintenance cost of grids would be fractional in comparison with the maintenance of gates and they would eliminate the possibility of unattended gates being left open from time to time.</P>
      <P>I note that CIE propose to hand back to Westmeath County Council the liability for the maintenance of Float Bridge on the River Inny, I am also glad to see that this would be the subject of compensation.  I know that Westmeath county council have no funds to maintain or reconstruct any bridge whatsoever, this bridge is in need of immediate maintenance there is not any money to repair it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, I should like the Minister to consider the problem of all bridges spanning canals.  They were originally constructed in such a way that boats could travel underneath them.  Many of our canals are no longer used.  Many local authorities are more than anxious to dispose of those hump-back bridges and to erect a straight span in their place.  The Westmeath local authority is anxious to dispose of many of those <Col N="1146" /> bridges but they have not, as yet, got the go ahead from CIE.  I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of allowing all local authorities to construct new flat bridges wherever those dangerous hump-back bridges exist.</P>

Section 22 of the Bill provides for the substitution of automatic controls for gates at level crossings at which CIE have at present no statutory obligation to provide attendance. It is true that in many cases attendance is provided.  Up to now our attitude towards level crossings has been far too casual.  These level crossings are at all times potential killer points and any rules or regulations which will help to ensure safety both for road users and railway users is to be commended and I am very glad to see provisions in the Bill which would help to make travelling safer for both roads users and passengers on trains.</P>
      <P>Our attitude has been much too casual.  There is a story told of the tourist who on coming to a level crossing found one gate closed and the other open.  When he made inquiries as to the reason for this phenomenon he was told that they were half expecting a train that evening.  Unfortunately, we have a tendency to say: &ldquo;God is good, nothing will happen, everybody will think of closing the gates&rdquo;, and so on.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill that will help to make travelling safer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards section 36, dealing with penalties for the misuse of the communication cord on passenger trains, the Minister remarked that this has been a growing problem in recent years and is particularly prevalent on trains which have been in use for sporting <Col N="1147" /> occasions.  That is quite true and it is, if I may say so, a damnable nuisance for a sporting crowd on a train to have the train stopped by blackguards who just travel on the trains to do as much damage as they can and cause as much inconvenience to the public as they can.  If there is a fault to be found with this section as the Minister has devised it it is that the penalty is not half big enough.</P>

      <P>These people should be taught a lesson when through pure blackguardism and nothing else they pull the communication cord and cause inconvenience to the public who are travelling and to the officials of the railway company.  I am very glad to see that section there and I hope the fines will be levied without mercy for anybody concerned.</P>

      <P>I would not have been surprised to hear some Senator rising here to congratulate British Rail on their goodness in waiting four years for their money, but that is not the reason I rise.  I rise because I remember those railways and it is sad to see even their names passing from the records.  There must be a great deal of credit given to the people who originally started these railways at the beginning of the century for all the hard work that was put into them.  I remember the trains on these railways and later on, during the war years, a great service was given when they had the lone rail bus.  I do not know whether any Senators have travelled through Barna's Gap and seen a bus travelling along the side of the mountain as if it had come out of nowhere.  At nighttime it could even be frightening to see the light of the bus moving along.  This has given tremendous service to the people of Donegal and the scattered communities throughout the place throughout the years.  It was the only means of transport of those people, and they did a lot of coming and going. Unfortunately, many a good man travelled outwardly on those trains and never came back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the years they provided a <Col N="1148" /> great service and I hope that CIE will continue in this way to provide the service and will not evade this responsibility now that they have taken over; that they will not evade it from the point of view of economics&mdash;that when they talk about the assets and liabilities they will read into the liabilities their responsibilities to the community in that area and their responsibility of realising that the people in that area do not have the amenities of the people in other areas, particularly in cities and the bigger built-up areas. Maybe the largest town in Donegal would have a population of around 4,000.  You can think of goods going there that have to be paid for by those communities and think of the extra freight that must be charged either directly or indirectly to those people.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his consideration for the staff.  I hope that these considerations will be fully honoured and that, as the result of the transfer, no one will be put out of work and that no one, if possible, will be transferred out of their area into another area.</P>

      <P>One factual point first, which was raised by Senator Brugha with regard to the assets of the County Donegal Joint Committee now being taken over by CIE.  The net value of the assets comes to £175,000 odd.  Apart from various current assets, the fixed assets relating to passenger and merchandise vehicles and equipment come to £33,000 and depots and other buildings to £21,000, making a total of £54,000 for fixed assets.  The balance of £175,000 represents current assets, that is, cash, stores, amounts due and investments, less current liabilities, accounts payable, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this Bill is really doing in that respect is legitimising a reality.  In South County Donegal for some time now CIE have been operating <i>vis-á-vis</i> stores, road freight and passenger service, and this now legitimises what in fact has been a business operation for some time and safeguards the situation in regard to the staff taken over by CIE and their superannuation. <Col N="1149" /> I thought fit to use the occasion of this measure to bring in the other miscellaneous matters that I have mentioned. As Senator Dooge said in passing, the Bill is miscellaneous with a capital M. I thought the occasion should be used to clear up certain matters that were outstanding.  There are a number of matters, each of which could be regarded as a Bill in itself, small amending matters relating to level crossings, toll charges at Fiddown Bridge, the transfer of the Float Bridge in County Westmeath from CIE to the local authority, the communication cord problem and a number of other miscellaneous matters that I mentioned at the end of my introductory speech that required attention.  The provision about level crossings is a major one.</P>
    <P>I will be referring to that in greater detail on Committee Stage because there are important matters involved <Col N="1150" /> here, including responsibility for the safety of road and rail users.  I do not think there is anything else I need mention at this Stage.  The measure is one that has been generally welcomed and which, by reason of its very nature, is essentially, in my view, a Committee Stage Bill.  On Committee Stage we can have a useful discussion on the Bill, because there are so many miscellaneous matters in it that each one of them warrants a discussion in itself. This can best be done in the section by section type of debate we will have on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.20 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 10th March, 1971.</P>
