      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Television Programme on illegal moneylending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is to take notice of the said.  That is my only excuse for taking up the House's time today.  I think it proper that this House, and the other House, having passed resolutions to set Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the television programme on illegal moneylending.  It is a theme which has been debated widely and fiercely, both inside and outside these Houses.  It might in some respects seem to be a dead horse which needs no more flogging. I will not go over all the hard things which have been said about the Tribunal and about the circumstances in which it was set up.  I hope to be able to say one or two things about its background which have not yet been <Col N="122" /> up the Tribunal, should at least formally notice its Report.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with this matter in a controversial or offensive way, and I will try to treat the subject as soberly as I can.  If Senators on the opposite side will be patient with me, I will try to put the whole question of a judicial inquiry into a television programme into a larger perspective which may be painful to them.  This will not take me long, and the less interruption I have to endure the quicker I will be finished.</P>
    <P>The whole issue between the Minister for Justice, or the State, on the one hand and a television team on the other hand, arose out of an ostensible concern by the State for the authenticity of public statements.  It arose out of a concern for truth on the part of the State and on the part of the Government. Truth is a fine thing but it is a quality and a virtue which needs to be respected not only by individuals in their private dealings but also by great persons holding great offices in their public dealings.  I have to observe at the outset, because it would be unrealistic to approach this subject in any other way, that the example set by the State and by those who are in charge of it during the last 1½ years has not been a good example in this respect and that the regard shown by the State and by Ministers of State for truth and for authenticity has been less than perfect.  Ministers during the last year or so have been allowed, under the privilege of either House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator will appreciate that he cannot depart widely from the immediate terms of this motion.  This motion deals with a limited issue, of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the television programme on illegal moneylending, and events, for example, during the past 12 months do not have any relevance to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, they have every relevance because the Tribunal was set up in order to sort out a difference of opinion between a Minister and a television team in regard to the alleged non-authenticity <Col N="123" /> of a programme.  That reflects, in my view, an ostensible&mdash;I call it ostensible because I do not believe it is genuine&mdash;concern on the part of the State for truth and authenticity. I believe I am entitled to say&mdash; I have examples here if you will allow me to cite them&mdash;that Ministers in recent years have frequently been allowed to make statements in or outside either House about people which were palpably untrue and have been allowed to get away with these statements with no check or hindrance of any kind at all.</P>

      <P>This motion is quite clear.  It reads: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Television Programme on illegal moneylending.&rdquo; I must ask the Senator to restrict his speech to that limited issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to restrict my speech, but I feel that it would be unrealistic for this House to take notice of the Report of the Tribunal without setting it against the background of this ostensible concern for truth and authenticity.  In my submission, the situation has now been arrived at that the ordinary citizen would not believe daylight from a Minister, and if one were to cite any proposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The conduct of Ministers does not arise in this except in so far as it relates to the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry.  The motion has been framed in this way.  It could have been framed in a different way but this is the way in which it appears on the Order Paper and I must ask that it be discussed in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for the Chair's conduct of affairs in this House.  I will submit to your ruling, but I do so under protest, because in my view the whole question of the State taking a hammer to crack an alleged nut of untruth becomes ludicrous when viewed against the background of the fog of duplicity and deceit, of fraud and betrayal, of allegation and counter allegation, that the people have had to look at in the last year and a half.  If anyone were to cite <Col N="124" /> as authority for any proposition the fact that the Minister had given the information in reply to a question in the Dáil, he would be thought very naïve to believe it on that authority alone.</P>
      <P>The Tribunal set up by resolution of this House and of the Dáil functioned well, so far as my information goes, and so far as its strictly judicial or quasi-judicial operation was concerned. I have heard complaints that individual members of the Tribunal treated individual witnesses with something less than the respect they felt was due to them, but reading the report of the Tribunal, and comparing it with my impression of the evidence, I do not complain, and I cannot complain about the material conclusions which the Tribunal reached.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to say that from whatever contact I have with the people concerned with this programme, and I am not in any sense hand in glove with them, from my small contacts with them, my impression is that they recognise that this programme did contain faults.  They recognise that it fell short, in the way in which it was prepared, of the perfect standard, and I think they frankly admit they have learned something&mdash;though they have learned it the hard way, a way in which I think very few of us would like to have to learn a lesson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, the question arises whether the Act under which this Tribunal operated is a satisfactory Act and whether the kind of Tribunal which we get under it is satisfactory in a case of this kind.  I have heard it said, and I share this point of view, that it might have been more satisfactory had the tribunal consisted not simply of three judges, although the conduct of the judges individually and collectively, so far as I am aware, was irreproachable, but of one judge and two lay assessors&mdash;for example, in this instance a journalist and a social worker.  Because it can happen, and this case is a good instance of this, that a matter is being investigated by a judicial tribunal in which the issues at stake are ones which arise from a sphere of life which makes judges, by their nature&mdash;I make anyone who <Col N="125" /> wishes a present of this, though the Labour Party are not here to exploit it&mdash;and by the social background from which judges are normally drawn, not unfitted but perhaps less than perfectly fitted, on which to give a convincing judgment.</P>
    <P>The social problem which moneylending represents, and the existence of which, as a result of the Tribunal's work, has now been publicly recognised, might have been better ventilated, might have been better understood, and what the television team were trying to achieve might have been better understood, had the Tribunal, in this instance, been constituted in the way I suggest.</P>
    <P>The present Minister in introducing his Estimate in the Dáil recently referred to the findings of the Tribunal, and I say in fairness to him that he did not go in for the kind of overkill which other Ministers, past and present, might have been tempted to try.  He spoke in moderate terms of the Tribunal's findings and he did not unduly flog the media people who were affected by its findings.  But the Minister left out something which was, I think, important.  He left out from his speech&mdash;he may have been trying to compress his remarks in order to save time&mdash;a couple of important things, namely, that three separate allegations or insinuations which formed part of Deputy Ó Moráin's reply to Deputy Corish's question on 19th November, 1969, had been found by the Tribunal to be without foundation.</P>
    <P>While I have no wish to flog Deputy Ó Moráin any more than a dead horse, I must point out to this House that the nastiest allegations made by Deputy Ó Moráin were precisely the ones which were found by the Tribunal to be untrue. The Tribunal found, and its finding can be seen in paragraph 93, that no actors were employed in the making of this programme.  They found, and I refer to paragraph 53 of its report, that there was no such thing as stoking up with drink the participants in this programme. There was one instance, the Tribunal said&mdash;and I am sure the team accept it&mdash;where a person was allowed to be interviewed and was photographed <Col N="126" /> during interview in a condition in which he ought not to have been photographed because he had too much drink taken, but the insinuation contained in Deputy Ó Moráin's reply clearly conveying that drink was given in order to loosen up the tongues or to extract statements from people which otherwise might not have been available, was in the Tribunal's view without foundation.</P>
    <P>The implication equally clearly to be read from Deputy Ó Moráin's reply that people taking part in the programme had been paid to say things, was found to be without foundation. The Tribunal did say that they were satisfied that some people would not have taken part in the programme had they not had the prospect of being paid to take part in it.  That is a very different thing from the allegation which Deputy Ó Moráin made, which was to the effect that the money they were getting was in consideration of their saying a particular thing&mdash;in other words, that they were being suborned by money into an untruth which would be publicly relayed.  The tribunal did not find that allegation, that insinuation, substantiated.</P>
    <P>Moreover&mdash;this is perhaps not a solid point, not quite so substantial a point, but it is worth making all the same&mdash;any moneylenders named as such on that programme were shown to be moneylenders, or to have been moneylenders, and many of them were already known to the Garda.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the discrepancy between Deputy Ó Moráin's onslaught on the television team and what the Tribunal subsequently found, it is worth pointing out this.  Deputy Ó Moráin described this programme as a phoney programme.  The reference is volume 242 of the Dáil Debates, column 1269.  Deputy Ó Moráin said:</P>
    <P>I do not think it will help to deal with the abuse by putting on what appears, at all events, on the existing evidence to be a phoney programme.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy Ó Moráin is a lawyer and he instinctively protected himself, I suppose, as I would or any of the Fianna Fáil lawyers would, by inserting <Col N="127" /> the phrase &ldquo;on the existing evidence, at all events&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Garda investigations into moneylending were not completed for at least a fortnight after Deputy Ó Moráin made this statement. The appendix in the Tribunal's report which sets out the Garda activities in the various divisions of the Dublin area shows that these inquiries into the existence or non-existence or prevalence or degree of widespreadness of moneylending was still continuing into early December, although Deputy Ó Moráin felt free to describe that programme on the 19th November as phoney.</P>
    <P>I have said already that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, not intentionally, perhaps may have wished not to spend too much time on the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; issue.  But since he did take the trouble to mention it, and since he did take the trouble to refer to the Tribunal's finding that the programme in some respects was not authentic, I think he might have taken the trouble to say also that Deputy Ó Moráin's attack on it was not authentic either&mdash; that Deputy Ó Moráin's attack, in particular the nastiest part of the attack, was shown to be without foundation, by what the Tribunal established.</P>
    <P>The question of the Garda is, of course, the most sensitive question in this matter.  If I were a member of the Garda I should be very unhappy at finding the allegation made on television that the force of which I was proud to be a member was said to be lax in pursuing this serious crime and social evil.  I would be very unhappy indeed, and I can understand entirely&mdash; and I approve entirely of&mdash;the action of various Garda officers immediately after the programme was shown in contacting each other, and contacting the men under their command, to see what the situation really was and if the programme had exaggerated the matter. However, I must add that I understand that the Garda themselves were invited to take part in the making of this programme, and that they declined to do so.  I understand further that the Garda always decline to take part in television programmes.  It cannot be because they have any idea that it <Col N="128" /> would be a sinister thing for a man in uniform to appear on the screen, because they have their own programme, &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo;, and a good programme it is, and a valuable programme.  However, I understand that the policy of the Garda, re-enunciated only very recently according to my information, is not to take part in any shape or form in the making of any ordinary television programme.</P>
    <P>Although I am not in any way hand in glove with the television people, the impression which I get is that if the Garda had consented to take part in, or to collaborate in, the making of this programme a lot of trouble might have been avoided, and a lot of the exaggeration which the Tribunal established would have been cut short.  It is not for me to advise the Garda on their policy in this respect&mdash;they may have good reasons for not allowing their members to collaborate in the making of television programmes&mdash;but it seems to me that if they are invited to help, or to comment, and they refuse to do so, in a sense they are asking for trouble, if they subsequently are unjustly held up to public odium, or if a mistake is made in regard to their activities.  I do not want to lecture the Garda in any way.  I do not understand their problems. No doubt they have their own reasons.  However, it seems to me that you cannot have it both ways.  If you stay away from the media people, if you do not tell them anything and do not collaborate with them, you are running a clear risk that you will be misrepresented by them, if not deliberately, then certainly by mistake, or innocently.</P>
    <P>There are three more points that I want to make in regard to the findings of this Tribunal and the circumstances from which the inquiry arose.  First of all, it seems to me that the State has entirely the wrong approach towards dealing with statements made, or representations communicated, through television or radio.  I have said this before in this House and elsewhere and it has been the subject of frequent comment, that the normal way in which a Minister, or anyone on the Government side&mdash;and possibly, if we drew that much water, anyone on the Opposition side&mdash;interferes with a television programme <Col N="129" /> is to take up a telephone and ring someone.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>Through representations from the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Hilliard, in 1960, the Oireachtas passed the Broadcasting Authority Act, section 31 of which specifically entitles the Minister either to direct the authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting something, or to direct the authority in writing &ldquo;to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister of State in connection with the functions of that Minister of State&rdquo;, and the authority, states the section, &ldquo;shall comply with the direction&rdquo;.  That section is copied, nearly word for word, from the corresponding section of the English Act.  Like a great deal of our legislation, we go to the hated English for the guidelines when we find that the need catches up with ourselves.  That section has been on the Statute Book for 11 years and it has never yet been used.  We know that television programmes have been stopped.  A programme on the Special Branch was stopped; a programme on planned development at Mount Pleasant was stopped, but not <i>via</i> section 31, which is the means the Oireachtas intended to be used in order to stop a programme.</P>
    <P>It is not so much stopping a programme that I have got in mind as rebutting falsehoods in a programme, or what the State or a Minister takes to be a falsehood.  I could see no objection in the world to the Minister writing to the television authority and saying: &ldquo;We believe that such-and-such a programme has conveyed a serious and misleading and damaging impression, that is likely to undermine confidence in the Garda, or the judges, or some other institution of State which we think is important, and we want you to allocate ten minutes of time for a Minister, or someone delegated by a Minister, to rebut this allegation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know that this could be overdone and I am not hoping in any way that the day will come when a Minister will occupy the television screen for hours on end, like Dr. Castro, haranguing the people, and shoving everything else off the programme.  I am not asking for that, but I could see no objection to its <Col N="130" /> being done in moderation in exceptional cases.  I could see no objection in the world to a Minister writing openly&mdash;that is the rub, writing, because then it is on the record&mdash;and saying: &ldquo;I want an opportunity to contradict what has been said on this programme.  It reflects unfairly and un-truthfully on people or on institutions under my charge and I want to rebut it.&rdquo;  I could see no objection to that, but I see every objection to uisce faoi thalamh, such as has been employed in the past here with telephone calls.  I can also see every objection to the lámh láidir, which is what the Tribunal of Inquiry represents.  I cannot see why differences between the State and Ministers on one hand, and the Television Authority on the other, cannot be dealt with by means of the existing law.  I have had to say that on former occasions. Perhaps the Minister, ably advised by his front bench, will be able to explain why it is that section 31, to this day, has remained a dead letter.</P>
    <P>The second last matter I want to mention is the question of privacy, which arose in the context of the Tribunal's work.  The Tribunal and the Minister showed a touching concern for privacy.  The Tribunal spoke in strong language about the methods which had been used by the television team to collect information.  They said that they were methods which horrified a lawyer.  Of course they horrify, not just a lawyer&mdash;in fact lawyers are probably thicker-skinned than most&mdash;but they should, I suppose, horrify anybody; and I shall not defend, and I have never tried to defend even in private, the use of concealed microphones, or of telephoto lenses used in order to get shots of people, who are not, as it were, alert to the fact that they are being recorded or photographed. This matter was also mentioned by the Minister, and in the introduction to his Estimate in the Dáil he took over and repeated the point of view of the Tribunal.  At column 2136, volume 251 of the Official Report of the Dáil, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>One aspect of the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme in question which disturbed many people was the use of concealed devices to record conversations and to film scenes involving <Col N="131" /> certain persons without their knowledge,</P>
    <P>and so on.  The Minister also said in the following column:</P>
    <P>The use of sophisticated modern technical devices in ways which constitute an invasion of privacy is at present engaging the attention of specialised bodies under the auspices of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.  It seems probable that recommendations will be made to governments in due course for the control of the use of these devices.</P>
    <P>I must suggest to this House that this tender concern by the State for individual privacy is another ostensible piece of concern.  I do not want to wander from the subject of the debate, but privacy was a very central element in the work of this Tribunal.  I should like to refer this House to an answer given in 1957 by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Traynor, to a question asked by Deputy P. Byrne on the interception of postal communications and on telephone tapping.  Deputy Byrne had asked whether this practice existed in this State to any extent and if the Minister would say how often postal messages or telephone communications had been intercepted within the previous five years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor said:</P>
    <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. Interceptions are made on the authority of the Minister for Justice in exercise of a long standing power the existence of which is explicitly recognised in section 56 of the Post Office Act, 1908.  Each warrant is issued on the personal authority of the Minister for Justice which is given only where the warrant is required for security purposes or for the prevention or detection of serious crime, information as to which could not be got in any other way.  It is against the public interest to give figures for the number of interceptions and like all my predecessors in office I am not prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>Now this strict reply, let it not be <Col N="132" /> forgotten, was issued only a few months after Deputy Costello had been in office as Taoiseach and it is possible that the standards which he asserted, defended and maintained rubbed off on the Government which succeeded him and still were showing in 1957.</P>
    <P>The reference is volume 164, column 711 of the Official Dáil Report.  In the last year it has become obvious that no such safeguard is applied by the State in order to protect the privacy of telephone communications, whatever about postal communications.  When we hear, as we have heard in recent months, not alone that there are such things as scramblers in the country which are intended to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect, it is very germane to it indeed.  The Minister set himself up in the Dáil&mdash; I am sorry to use a phrase which may be hurtful to him&mdash;but he represented himself in the Dáil as being concerned with individual privacy.  In my contention, individual privacy in this country is being seriously eroded.  The fact that there is such a thing as a scrambler and that the secretary of the Department of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the views of this or any other Minister except in so far as they relate to the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Television Programme on illegal moneylending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>But I am entitled to put the thing in perspective and to draw parallels and to show that the concern which the Minister expresses in this very context of the Tribunal's report is only an ostensible concern and cannot be a genuine concern because he presides over a Department in which telephones are being tapped.  He sits in a Government, the secretary of one of whose Departments actually knows who has scramblers installed and who has not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator allow the Chair for a moment?  The subject matter of this motion is the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry.  The <Col N="133" /> attitude of the Minister to that Report arises perhaps incidentally, but it does not seem to me to form the subject matter of debate.  Essentially we are discussing the Report and only incidentally are we also perhaps dealing with the reaction of the Minister to that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so and I accept it.  I felt that if the Minister felt himself free, in mentioning this matter in the Dáil, to add his views on privacy as a footnote.  I am entitled to refute them and to show that he presides over a Department in which individual privacy is being eaten away.</P>
      <P>The last matter I wish to deal with, and I will be as brief as possible because I know my time is running out, is a matter with which I deal with great personal reluctance.  It bears on the question of the costs incurred in this inquiry.  The costs incurred in the inquiry, according to the Minister, the costs for which the State is liable, amounted&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;to something like £25,000 or £30,000.  I do not wish to hold up the House by looking for the figure.  If I have misquoted the Minister he will correct me.  I believe that that is what he said.  I cannot break that figure down into counsels' fees and other expenses, but I would guess that the overheads of the Attorney General's department, that the overheads of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and that the overheads of the solicitors acting for the Garda Síochána are not computed in that figure, and that a very large part of that figure represents counsels' fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that this is often said hypocritically by people who have no feelings on the matter at all, and I beg the House to believe that I mention this matter with real personal reluctance. I calculated from the names of counsel given in the report of the Tribunal&mdash;seven counsel altogether were employed by the State&mdash;two seniors and a junior on behalf of the Attorney General, two seniors and a junior on behalf of the Garda Síochána and one junior on behalf of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I know every one of these men personally and I am on terms of friendship with some <Col N="134" /> of them, and that makes it painful for me to have to say what I believe my public duty requires me to say: that with the possible exception of one,  at the very most two, but I think only one, all these counsel are open and active supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Although the Law Library is supposed to be a nest of Fine Gael supporters, so far is that from being the truth that a very large part of it has been recruited into the Government service and is being paid public money for doing public work, to the exclusion of persons of other political points of view represented in that profession. There are many people in the Law Library who are not supporters of Fianna Fáil who could make a bit of money for themselves by pretending to support that party, but who put their pride and their principles before their pockets in a tradition which I am afraid this Government are doing their best to destroy.</P>
    <P>I want to make this much clear because I know that what I am saying may be represented as a personal attack: I want to make it clear that the seven counsel representing the three interests I have mentioned are all, so far as I know, in themselves experienced and competent counsel and I make absolutely no complaint of the kind that might be represented as a criticism of their individual employment. Indeed, one of them is at the head of his profession and would be at the head of his profession no matter which Government we had in the country, so that I in no way criticise the individual persons concerned.  But what I think is a scandal is that the Government should persistently attempt to corrupt an entire profession by publicly and openly distributing jobs only to those of their own political persuasion. I have mentioned it before.  It is highly relevant to the question of the costs arising from this tribunal because these costs are going largely into Fianna Fáil pockets.</P>

      <P>These, then, are my remarks on the Tribunal of Inquiry and its results. The whole episode, in my submission, is highly discreditable to the then Minister for Justice and only in a much lesser degree discreditable to the television team whom he attacked.  The only two bright features in the whole history were first, that the Tribunal agreed that there was a social problem here of dimensions which formerly had not been publicly realised, and secondly, that Radio Telefís Éireann, the broadcasting authority, had the guts and the decency to stand over their own staff which was more, I think, than the public at that time would have expected of them.</P>

      <P>It is always a pleasure to listen to an Seanadóir Ó Ceallaigh, although one does not agree with very much of what he has to say. I do not propose to be drawn into answering some of the points he has made.  I thought first he was taking a leaf out of my book because I had noted in regard to the motion that I did not think it was very necessary.  He referred to it as flogging a dead horse. My feeling about it was that perhaps the public had heard so much about the Tribunal and about &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; that it might be best not to take up too much time with it, and I do not propose to take up too much time with the subject.  Nevertheless, as an Seanadóir Ó Ceallaigh has said, it is the right of the House to discuss a report of a tribunal set up by the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having read the report, in my view the members of the Tribunal carried <Col N="136" /> out their job fairly and impartially. It must be admitted that it was a most expensive way of inquiring into the authenticity of a programme and the adequacy of the information on which that programme was based.  In my view, the fact that the inquiry happened to be on moneylending is not so important.  What was important was to conduct an impartial inquiry into a programme so as to establish whether a proper code or standard was being maintained by those engaged in making such a public affairs programme.</P>
    <P>As I see it, there was no other means available to do what was done by the Tribunal except, perhaps, by appointing a Dáil Committee; this would have been far less costly, but when one considers the bias displayed towards politicians in this country I would question whether it is likely that the findings of a Dáil Committee would have been accepted, especially by some of those engaged in television.  I doubt it.</P>
    <P>We know from the report that the type of programme involved has an average audience of 620,000.  We also know that the programme was considered to be not authentic&mdash;that there was exaggerated data used in the introduction to the programme and that information from a small area was accepted as evidence or assumption of widespread abuse.</P>
    <P>These are the conclusions and it is valuable to have them.  What is disturbing about this report is that there must have been an assumption that because something wrong exists, something of which nobody approves, it was therefore widespread.  It is almost as if one wanted to find evil so as to condemn it.  This, I am sure, was not a conscious thought or intention but it is something we should all learn from. I do not intend to deal with the broad aspects of broadcasting on this motion. I wish to confine myself to the terms of the motion itself, the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Television Programme on illegal moneylending, because any broader discussion on broadcasting will be coming up later this year.  But some comment may be useful on the general principles or journalistic standards that are desirable <Col N="137" /> particularly because the report suggests that there was failure to apply principles of journalistic care.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Declaration on Mass Communication Media and Human Rights.  First of all, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights refers to the right to freedom of expression and to the duties and responsibilities that these freedoms carry.  The recent declaration, in December 1969, adopted by the committee referring to the mass media states as follows:</P>
    <P>The internal organisation of mass media should guarantee the freedom of expression of the responsible editors.  Their editorial independence should be preserved.  The independence of mass media should be protected against the dangers of monopoly. The effects of concentration in the Press, and the possible measures of economic assistance require further consideration.  Special measures are necessary to ensure the freedom of foreign correspondents.</P>
    <P>The report then goes on to refer to measures to secure responsibility of the Press and other mass media and continues:</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Press and other mass media to discharge their function with a sense of responsibility towards the community and towards the individual citizens.  For this purpose it is desirable to institute where this has not already been done:</P>
    <P>(1) Voluntary professional training for journalists under the responsibility of editors and journalists.</P>
    <P>(2) A professional code of ethics for journalists.  This should cover, <i>inter alia</i>, such matters as accurate and well balanced reporting, rectification of inaccurate information, avoidance of calumny, respect for privacy, respect for the right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>(3) Press councils empowered to investigate and even to censure instances of unprofessional conduct with a view to the exercising of self control by the Press itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> Edmund Burke has said: &ldquo;Freedom must be limited to be attained.&rdquo; It is obvious that our broadcasting service in some respects sets out to upset people, to make them excited or uneasy, and it seems to succeed in this. But the question that springs to mind is: how does one select the subject matter and what standards of ethics and philosophy are applied?  It is extremely important to keep before us the influence and motivating force that broadcasters have and the way in which they can stimulate people to achieve things, provided, of course, that they have got values themselves.</P>
    <P>Our broadcasters should always be conscious of the great power and influence they have in the life of the nation and that to a considerable extent what they produce can help to make a nation hopeful or despondent. In the light of that, where it is important that they should discuss serious topics they need always to bear in mind their responsibilities and seek to avoid entering into the field of what is called good television but which borders on the field of entertainment.</P>
    <P>I say this because one is involving oneself in one of the most powerful media that exist and one may at times be tempted to go over the border into other areas.  We have given great power and monopolistic independence to our broadcasting system.  Let us hope that they are exercising that power with restraint and imagination for the good of the nation and that they will continue to do so.  This, I believe, is what is important and is what comes to me out of this report on the Tribunal.  If the Tribunal has served the function of drawing attention to the very clear responsibilities that are inherent in the exercise of a power of this nature, then I believe, despite the cost, that a good purpose will have been achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points on which I would like to comment. A considerable time has elapsed since this report of the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Tribunal was published.  In that time judgments have matured and a lot of the incidentals and irrelevancies, perhaps, have been forgotten.  If one were <Col N="139" /> asked at this time what two factors of the whole episode stand out in one's mind I would expect that the general answer would be that this &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme was more than slightly exaggerated.  On the other hand, the wild and reckless accusations which were made by a Government Minister in the House against the team which produced this programme were even more exaggerated and unwarranted.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Brugha when he says that television is a very powerful medium.  Television is relatively young and new, and the producers have not yet reached the degree of expertise that has been reached in newspapers.  It is true to say that what a person sees on the screen has a very great effect on his mind, much stronger than if he were to read the most lucid accounts of the same event.  Those who produce television documentaries must always keep that in mind.  There is great danger of presenting an exaggerated view of the points being dealt with.  The discerning listener knows that that danger exists.  It is part of stage presentation and of film presentation to highlight certain points in order to give effect.  The discerning viewer would have regard to this danger when forming an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such exaggeration must be guarded against.  But reckless statements from a Government Minister making unwarranted accusations against people who are engaged in that type of production must also be guarded against. These statements do harm to the prestige, not only of the Minister himself but of the Government as a whole&mdash; and, indeed, of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In view of what is in the Report of the Tribunal it would have been just as effective, and in much better taste, if the Minister referred to had said that he believed that this subject was exaggerated, that the exaggeration might have been due to an attempt to highlight a certain evil, and that the exaggeration might also have been due to a certain amount of inexperience and lack of expertise on the part of the younger people in the crew.  That would have been sufficient.  It would have been better than accusing them of <Col N="140" /> making people drunk and of paying them fees to say this, that and the other.  That statement was not worthy of the dignity of the House.  The tribunal will have done some good if they draw attention to the fact that such statements are not to be commended.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe that this &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme did draw attention to something that does exist in the cities&mdash;though, I hasten to add, not on a very large scale, but it still exists.  We will not improve our prospects of dealing with these problems if we bury our heads in the sand and pretend not to see them.  Such programmes can do a great deal of good and help in the shaping of public opinion about different aspects of society.  They can help to make people in various parts of the country and in various strata of society more conscious of what goes on outside.</P>
    <P>A well-produced feature on the itinerant problem in this country would do a lot of good.  It would help the campaign which is being run by the Department of Local Government to integrate these people into society. There are a large number of people who do not appreciate the wretched conditions under which some of these itinerants live.  Even if a programme on television were somewhat exaggerated in driving home to people's minds that there are human beings living under such conditions, I do not think it could do any harm.  In that way programmes of this nature are good.  The work done by the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team on moneylending did not do any harm in the long run.  I should like to see this work extended&mdash;without the exaggeration of course&mdash;in order to educate public opinion on the different problems that confront society at the present time. For example, I do not think anybody in this House would have the slightest objection to a well-produced, or even slightly exaggerated feature, on the pollution of our lakes and streams.  It could highlight the problem of pollution in a way that could never be done by the printed word.  A feature on our slow progress in dealing with the problems of mentally retarded or deficient children, although it might <Col N="141" /> not be a very pleasant feature to watch, would awaken the public conscience. We should not be so thin-skinned.</P>
    <P>Every sensible member of every Government knows that, despite the best efforts of the individual Ministers in their own Departments and despite the collective efforts of a whole Government, there will always be problems which will need attention.  If the news media, be it television or the newspapers, in their own way draw attention to these matters, in my opinion it is for the good of the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>I will not give Senator Kelly, through the Chair, too many pats on the back because I thought much of what he had to say was completely irrelevant and I want to try to keep my speech relevant to this report.  I repeat that I think it is important. I think we were disciplined in having to sit in silence listening to much of what Senator Kelly had to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now debating this report at a time when we can discuss it in tranquillity. The immediate reactions and storms are over and we can now look soberly at a situation which arose from a particular programme.  If we see faults, errors or anything of which we <Col N="142" /> disapprove, now is the time, in tranquillity when there are no issues before us, to draw the morals and to take the necessary actions so that whatever mistakes have been made do not occur again.  For that reason I think that this is an important matter.</P>
    <P>An inquiry, probably of this form, had to take place.  An important part of the climate which led to this inquiry&mdash;and which, of course, Senator Kelly overlooked&mdash;was the calls by the Opposition in Dáil Éireann for an inquiry into the situation arising from the programme.  I have not the full debate before me at the moment, but I have the reference&mdash;I think Senator Kelly has it to hand&mdash;in the Dáil on 2nd December when the Taoiseach announced his intention to introduce a motion setting up a tribunal.  This announcement was welcomed by Deputy Corish.  The late Deputy Sweetman immediately intervened to point out that it was Deputy Cosgrave who first called for the inquiry.  Certainly, the Opposition were quite pleased to learn that their efforts would lead to an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we had a situation in which the public atmosphere and the way in which the Opposition intervened in this public debate led to the need for an inquiry of some kind.  We then had substantial debates on the terms of reference of the Tribunal and I, for one, am very happy to have found that the misgivings which the members of the Opposition had about the terms of reference of the Tribunal were proved completely unfounded.  As Senator Kelly has pointed out, the Tribunal did good work and its findings seem to be fair.</P>
    <P>May I say in this regard&mdash;I am happy to note that Senator Mrs. Robinson is in the House&mdash;that one satisfaction I draw from this result is when I remember the persistent, and at times bitter, debate to which Senator Mrs. Robinson contributed, criticising the terms of reference of the Tribunal. She made the point that tribunals hang on every word and phrase and that they would parse every single word of the terms of reference and, therefore, that this was a matter where every little comma and point was crucial.  I <Col N="143" /> expressed the view at the time, from looking at other tribunal reports, that this was not, in fact, the way tribunals worked and was not what emerged from the reports.  I am happy to find that this hysteria&mdash;in my view much of it was tendentious hysteria&mdash;was completely unfounded.</P>
    <P>I take no pleasure from the fact that my forecast at the time was that the money which would inevitably be spent on the Tribunal&mdash;I mentioned the cost of the previous tribunal, the Liam O'Mahony tribunal, which I think cost about £9,000 or so&mdash;would be substantial and argued that the money would have been better spent in the establishment of a Press Council which would be there to do this type of work on a continuing basis.  Naturally, at the time and in a climate of hysteria, I did not really expect that people would pay much attention to this situation.  Now in a time of tranquillity I ask all the people concerned to look around and to consider, if there are problems in the area of journalism, broadcasting and the media generally, whether or not a Press Council might cope effectively and might act as a defence of the freedom of the Press in our community.  Now, when there are no burning issues on hand, is the time to consider the establishment of such a body.  I hope to return to that point.</P>
    <P>I would like to go through the report, referring the House to some paragraphs and making some comment by way of note on the report. May I cite some of my credentials for doing this, in that I feel much of what I have had to say from time to time about the media has been completely misinterpreted?  A number of people seem to have been anxious to point to me as an enemy of the freedom of the Press.  May I categorically say that I believe the freedom of the Press is a basic bastion of our democracy and when I point to errors and to what seem to me to be defects in the work of journalists or broadcasters I am merely pointing to what I regard as factual situations, in the hope that the standards of work and procedures will be improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> Referring again to my credentials, I am speaking as one who regards it as a privilege to have worked for three years, after leaving college in the north of England, as a journalist.  I worked initially on a weekly paper, the <i>Blyth News</i> and subsequently on two evening papers, the <i>Shields Gazette</i> and the <i>Yorkshire Evening Press</i>&mdash;both evening papers having a larger circulation than <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Because those newspapers function as provincial papers, whatever about their size and responsibility, at least if one makes a mistake it is not a national headline.  We should remember that many of our operations whether broadcasting or journalism, although very small fry in an international sense, are extremely important because they have national responsibility.  It is all the more important, therefore, that their standards should be in keeping with the best international standards.</P>
    <P>The pattern of training I underwent as a journalist involved qualifying for the proficiency test of the National Council for the Training of Journalists. This test involved, initially, experience on a weekly paper, where if you make a mistake, as the paper is prepared early in the week, there is time for the editor to point out the mistake and to rectify it.  One is not, as a graduate, automatically plunged into commenting on affairs immediately, as so many graduates recruited to journalism here seem to be.  One is, in fact, put out to cover events like inquests, accidents and so on where one learns the basic task of the precise reporting of factual information.</P>

      <P>May I show how, in fact, they were directly relevant in a way perhaps which Senator Kelly's, through the Chair, were not?  I will begin on page 11 of the report of the Tribunal.  One of the things about television is that it greatly influences people.  However, most people who have any experience of journalistic media, or, indeed, any experience of being reported in newspapers or on television, realise that what appears is likely, from time to time, to be fallible. It is interesting to see what was the origin of this programme on illegal moneylending.</P>
      <P>The origin of the programme was two interviews on the &ldquo;Newsbeat&rdquo; programme&mdash;I am quoting from paragraph 22 of the report&mdash;which greatly influenced both Mr. MacConghail and Miss Moody.  Those interviews were the starting point for everyone who had a part in the final shaping of the programme and they similarly influenced them.  This is an interesting point, in my estimation, and worthy of record. The origin of a controversial programme was itself another programme which turned out&mdash;as is made clear subsequently in the report&mdash;to have contained claims by the participants in the programme which proved not to be based on any very strong evidence. We find in paragraph 23 of the report for example, that when Miss Moody followed up this &ldquo;Newsbeat&rdquo; programme she did not question the participant about the programme and did not ask him for the basis of the statements that he, Mr. Ryan, and Mr. Norrison had made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the origin of this whole episode was the impact which another television programme made on professional television personnel &mdash; a programme which they themselves <Col N="146" /> made no effort to check out.  This seems to me to be a classic example in its own way of the impact of television on people whose training should give them a much more sceptical outlook.  One gets the picture that many of the people who formed the programme were more impressionable than they should have been.</P>
    <P>May I cite again as evidence of this paragraph 27, dealing with some reference by a priest whom Miss Moody interviewed to the Mafia, <i>et cetera.</i> This experience, it is said, conditioned the team who were subsequently assigned to the programme to a rather naive acceptance of some of the more lurid information they received in the course of their investigations.</P>
    <P>In my view it is the job of reporters to resist being conditioned by anyone. One of the things which I found difficult to understand was why, where there was a possibility of violence and in preparing a programme where accuracy was of extreme importance, precautions were not taken.  Perhaps I might be allowed relate a relevant experience.  I have taken part in the preparing of a news report on an alleged racket using the small advertisements column as a device for making money through a bogus flat agency.  As a reporter I was sent out by the <i>Shields Gazette</i> to collect information for that story.  It was the sort of story where two reporters were always sent, so that if there was the likelihood of possible legal action or anything of that kind we would have two people able to say categorically what had happened in the particular situation.  It seems to me that in much of the preparation of the programme elementary precautions of this kind were not followed.</P>
    <P>I come now to page 42 of the report where there is reference to this business of the hidden microphone to which Senator Kelly referred.  I am not sure from what speech of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the Senator was quoting when he alleged that the Minister's interest in these matters was ostensible.  Discussion of paragraph 68 is, in itself, justification for dealing with just this topic and the words which Senator Kelly quoted from the Minister's speech seem to be virtually <Col N="147" /> the same&mdash;that this was a matter being investigated by other European authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to draw the distinction between what the Minister says and what his Department does or permits to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence whatsoever.  If Senator Kelly has, through the Chair, an allegation of this kind to make about intrusions into privacy and so on, a Press Council would not be the type of body to inquire into the matter in the area about which he is talking.  They would, of course, in the area relevant to the report, in the context of the production of a programme such as we are debating, as I would like to remind Senator Kelly.  In that context, a Press Council are the ideal body to investigate matters of this kind.  They could examine the use of new devices for reporting and the possible intrusion by the Press into areas of public privacy. I underline that as another possible role for a Press Council.</P>
      <P>The report caused me no concern because, as I have gone to some trouble to point out, I recognise that it is in many ways just an account of what is the routine method of producing a television programme.  It is to me a good account of the fallible way in which I was involved in newspaper production.  There were not too many surprises in it, but one major surprise to me, which again is a serious reflection on the emotional attitude of the team, comes in paragraph 92.  It says of the team:</P>
      <P>They made one further visit to Gardiner Street during which they parked the van in an obvious position in the hope that, if it were attacked, they could film the incident, but nothing happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, I think, is an extremely serious matter, where you run the risk of the making of news by provocation.  This is an extremely dangerous situation for any journalist, where one not only goes to report events but hopes that something will happen which will create <Col N="148" /> an event which will be news in itself. If I, as a citizen, ever heard of this type of thing happening in the future, I, for one, would be extremely glad to feel there might be some body like a Press Council to which I could refer a matter of this kind for investigation and comment.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem is referred to on page 60 of the report, paragraph 109.  There was a discussion between Mr. McGuinness and Mr. MacConghail about the various aspects of the programme and there were some doubts and reservations in the air.  Referring to Mr. McGuinness, paragraph 109 says:</P>
    <P>He repeated these doubts and reservations to Mr. MacConghail in a private discussion he had with him later, and stated that they might not know whether they had made the right decision until long after the programme.</P>
    <P>This is one of the great problems about television.  The matter is put on the air and is viewed by millions of people who react, and one can only judge later on whether it was proper to show this programme.  There is always an element of gamble.  With the pressure of time on a broadcaster, he is not in as much of a position as a newspaper reporter, for example, to consider what he is going to say.  Because of the influence of television the impact can be so much more serious. Worse still, the aggrieved person cannot buy for a few pence the evidence subsequently to look up and say &ldquo;Here is what really happened; how can I remedy it?&rdquo; It is a much more complicated matter for an aggrieved citizen to try to hold an inquest on what may have appeared on television.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators I welcome this opportunity to comment on the report of the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Tribunal.  Although this report was submitted in August, 1970, and although it concerns a programme of 11th November, 1969, I also do not consider that it is flogging a dead horse, because I do not think the influence of this report has ceased.  It has cast a blanket over research in Telefís Éireann, which is very dangerous for the freedom of television in this country.</P>
      <P>I know from my own knowledge in speaking to researchers in Telefís Éireann that they find it extremely difficult to get factual information from Government Departments at the moment.  I know from researchers that I have spoken to that if they ring up a Government Department from Telefís Éireann they are immediately referred to the Government Information Bureau.  Those of us who know the reputation at present of the Government Information Bureau, which insists that the Taoiseach is in Cork when he is holidaying in the Canaries, will know how much credit can be given at times to information from the bureau.  I have personally spoken to researchers&mdash;I am sure they will substantiate what I say&mdash;who say that they now go to their homes and telephone from there if they want to get even factual information from Government Departments because they will not give any information to Telefís Éireann. This is one of the unfortunate consequences of this lengthy report and, therefore, in commenting on it, we are not in any way flogging a dead horse; we are talking about a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer back to the terms of reference of this tribunal and to what I would regard as the unconstitutional broadness of those terms. <Col N="150" /> When the matter came before the Seanad originally to approve the terms of reference, I brought in an amendment&mdash;unfortunately it was defeated&mdash; to try to narrow those terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal itself was set up under a British statute which was carried on, first, by the 1932 Constitution and then by the 1937 Constitution, namely, the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1920, which allows the setting up of a tribunal of this nature when there is a matter of public importance.  However, the validity of a pre-1932 statute is only carried on if it complies with the constitutional provisions of the 1937 Act.  In so far as any pre-1937 statute does not comply with the provisions of the Constitution, it is repugnant; and I would submit that we are governed now in relation to inquiries by the terms of Article 40 of the Constitution relating to freedom of expression. Article 40, first of all, guarantees subject to public order and morality:</P>
    <P>The right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>There is a further phrase that:</P>
    <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave importance to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that the organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>The only restriction on the constitutional right of freedom of expression is in the interests of public order and morality.  I would submit now, and I was of the opinion when this tribunal was being set up, that the terms of reference go beyond that.  There is no question that this current affairs programme, which was put out on 11th November, 1969, undermined public order and morality&mdash;the single basis for having a tribunal of inquiry of this sort without infringing the constitutional freedom of expression of citizens.</P>
    <P>I know that when the Tribunal <Col N="151" /> opened the RTE council considered testing the constitutionality of it; but Telefís Éireann were of the view that from their point of view it was required that the inquiry take place, because they had the desire to vindicate the transmission of the programme, to vindicate themselves in this, and therefore, to test the constitutionality might make it appear as if the programme had something to hide and they were afraid of an inquiry.  This was an unfortunate tactical error on their part.  The result was that we had this inquiry which I think&mdash;I am prepared to argue this in any form&mdash;was unconstitutionally wide and, therefore, it weakened our protection of freedom of expression and brought us into disrepute.  It brought us into disrepute with the world Press, with television commentators and with people who have a knowledge of the importance of freedom of expression in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal sat for 49 days.  It heard 153 witnesses in public and eight in private.  It documented the evidence in the report we have before us.  The conclusions of the Tribunal are in many ways critical of the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team in relation, first of all, to the preparation and the planning of the programme.  In my view this type of inquiry could well have been and ought to have been held by the RTE Authority itself, which had power to do it. The assessment should have been done by people who were familiar with the background to planning a current affairs programme.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of the report one reads the criticism of the judges concerning the naïvety of the team, their lack of fundamental research, or the fact that they did not investigate particular witnesses more fully.  This seems slightly unfair.  The judges had unlimited time to examine each witness and did not have to face the realities of producing a weekly series of current affairs programmes.  Yet I am prepared to take the actual criticisms made as valid.  I just do not think that it needed this expensive exercise of occupying three of our judges and one <Col N="152" /> of our courts for over 50 days, occupying the brains of the Law Library, while other litigants were waiting to have their cases go on and criminal cases were delayed because of the time and expense of this inquiry.</P>
    <P>Who gained from this inquiry? Undoubtedly, certain individuals gained dramatically from it&mdash;the lawyers who were involved in it.  The fees paid to the individual lawyers were published in the newspapers some time ago and it was interesting to see that some gained to the tune of a couple of thousand pounds each, and more power to them.  This is the free enterprise society.  But, as I said, I do not think again this type of expensive, long process, occupying lawyers in this way even at the rate at which they were paid, was worth it.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anything which came out of the report which could not have been more simply and perhaps more validly done by an inquiry by the RTE Authority itself, a more full inquiry than they had. They had an inquiry prior to the setting up of this Tribunal and they pronounced themselves at least <i>prima facie</i> satisfied with the planning, preparation and authenticity of this programme.</P>
    <P>On the negative side I have already referred to the worst effect of the inquiry: the fact that it has had such a dampening effect on research in Telefís Éireann.  I am not talking just about the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team; I am not suggesting for a moment that the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team have been victimised in this.  Most of the researchers that I spoke to were not in fact associated with the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Tribunal but with other current affairs programmes such as &ldquo;Encounter&rdquo;. They have found a completely negative approach since the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Tribunal, whereas prior to that it was quite easy to get information for the running of their programme from Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I think our institutions have not gained.  The Law Library, as I said, has not gained because of the backlog of judicial work, because of the fact that litigants had to wait for the various lawyers involved to become <Col N="153" /> free because a court was held up for this three month period.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I do not think that Telefís Éireann have gained from this.  After all the inquiry was into a programme of Telefís Éireann.  They certainly have not gained in a financial way.  The enormous cost of this inquiry to Telefís Éireann has meant that they have had to cut back on other projects, that they have had perhaps to cut back on the very current affairs programmes into which the inquiry was held.</P>
    <P>First of all then, we have what in my view was the unconstitutionally wide reference of the Tribunal.  Secondly, the fact that it probed in depth into the preparation and authenticity of the programme.  Although I do not dispute many of the conclusions come to, I think nevertheless that it was the wrong type of inquiry.  I think it was not worth all the time, trouble and manpower involved in it.  Thirdly, and most regrettably of all, I think the effect of this inquiry is still with us.  It had a damaging effect, and far from regretting what Senator Keery has called my hysterical opposition to this Tribunal, I feel that any of us who opposed setting up the Tribunal can look back on our actions with happiness rather than with regret.</P>
    <P>Any lay person, seeing the amount of money that was spent, seeing that it did nothing to solve the underlying problem which might be a matter of public order and morality&mdash;the existence or non-existence on a wide or narrow scale of illegal moneylending&mdash; must feel the Tribunal did no good. The total cost of this report has not been computed.  Had this amount of money been spent in trying to solve the substantial problem of illegal moneylending in the city then I think that some real gain might have come out of it.  As it is I regret to say that my own comment on this report is that it was not worth it, that a great deal of money was spent on very little and that the only long-term effect of it has been the regrettable one of curtailing independent research by current affairs programmes and researchers in Telefís Éireann.</P>

      <P>Níl i gceist <Col N="154" /> agamsa ach cúpla focal a rá.  Nuair a fuaireas amach go rabhthas chun é seo a phlé inniu buaileadh isteach im aigne an sean-fhocal cáiliúil úd &ldquo;Is fearr an t-imreas ná an uaigneas&rdquo;. Is fada anois ó cuireadh an fiosriuchán seo ar síul&mdash;chomh fada sin anois go mb'fhéidir gur cheart dearmad a dhéanamh air.  Pé scéal é, ní fheadar an fiu é a tharraingt amach arís agus é a phlé athuair anseo.</P>
      <P>Whether good will be done by having this motion discussed at this stage or not is a moot point.  There is always the danger when a thing has gone by, a contentious matter such as this, that feelings may be hurt and things may be said that should not be said when the matter is drawn up once more and, so to speak, reviewed in hind sight. Possibly lessons to be learned that should be learned are not referred to but rather, if we have a re-hash of what we have already dealt with, feelings may be hurt and perhaps a certain amount of damage done.</P>
      <P>We all know the circumstances which brought into being the setting up of this Tribunal.  I remember how shocked I was on hearing from a good neighbour of mine of what were regarded as disclosures in the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme. I had not seen it but the accounts which were brought to me next day about it were, to say the least, absolutely startling.  Seemingly, the most profound impression this programme made on the minds of people concerned the type of strong-arm terrorism employed by moneylenders to extract from their unfortunate victims what these moneylenders regarded as their due.  It reminds one of the story in the Bible where the debtor came to his creditor, throttled him and said &ldquo;Pay what thou owest&rdquo;.  That seemed to be the note that was highlighted by this particular feature on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own conclusions at the time were, and I see no reason why I should change them, that in their enthusiasm for producing a certain programme the television team just went that little bit too far.  Somebody has made a point already that they were not experienced enough, that they were not, as we say in my own part of the country, sound <Col N="155" /> enough to tackle a programme of that nature.  I think that is a very valid point.  In dealing with matters of that nature one has to be very experienced, very sensible and very careful.  I thought the most startling statement of all was the bland statement that here in Dublin you had in or about 500 illegal moneylenders. That figure, of course, was later proved to be completely out.  The actual number of illegal moneylenders was only a mere fraction of that number. However, now that the Tribunal has issued its findings, and now that we have raised the matter here again and have had a further discussion on it, I hope that it will be allowed rest and that lessons to be learned will be learned and taken to heart.</P>
    <P>During the debate today somebody also mentioned that the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team are not producing programmes as, shall I say, invitingly educational or as efficient as they used to before that. In my opinion the very opposite holds true.  I think that since that inquiry the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team have gone from strength to strength, and one is inclined to see more authenticity in their programmes and more diligent research.</P>
    <P>I have very little to add to what has been said already.  I hope there will not be any further acrimony in the words of any speaker who is to follow.  Now that the whole thing is over, it ought to be let go at that. Everybody concerned, particularly the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team, have learned quite a lot and I am sure we shall continue to get excellent programmes from the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team in question.</P>

      <P>I listened with very great interest to the views of the Senators on this motion.  However, before commenting I should like to make a general remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now nearly 18 months since the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme was broadcast, and almost nine months since the report of the Tribunal was published.  In the meantime the matter was discussed at very great length in the Press, in the Seanad and in the Dáil, apart from discussion among the <Col N="156" /> general public.  The matter received such an airing that it is doubtful if it is now of very great public interest. However, we are I believe in a position to view the programme and what followed, including the Tribunal's report, in a more objective, dispassionate and sober light than could have been possible in the earlier stages.  It is in that light that I hope to deal, as far as I can, with the comments which have been made on the motion.</P>
    <P>The method chosen by the Oireachtas to resolve the conflict of evidence between the information available to Radio Telefís Éireann and the information on the subject available to the then Minister for Justice, was a sworn judicial inquiry on specific terms of reference.  An inquiry of this kind was sought by the Opposition Deputies in the other House and, with reluctance, the Government decided to accede to the demand for the setting up of an independent inquiry.  The Tribunal set up for the purpose carried out a very full investigation of the matters covered by its terms of reference.  It has set out the facts, the circumstances and the issues involved, fairly and clearly, and after detailed analysis has stated its conclusions cogently and lucidly.  Our sincere thanks are due to them in this regard, and their report and conclusions speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly suggested that the Tribunal should have been constituted in a different way and should have followed the idea of one judge, two journalists or two lay people.  He suggested further that one of these lay people should have been a social worker.  It is not useful to discuss the constitution, or indeed the terms of reference, of the Tribunal at this stage.  In the course of the discussion, Senator Kelly alleged that I, either deliberately or not knowingly, omitted making any reference during the course of my contribution to the discussion on the Estimate for my Department recently in the other House, to the findings favourable to RTE.  I should like to assure Senator Kelly, and indeed this House, that I did not choose to go into detail on the findings, either favourable or unfavourable to RTE.</P>
    <P>In regard to the statements made <Col N="157" /> by Deputy Ó Moráin&mdash;in respect of which Senator Kelly was, I feel, trying to score cheap political points&mdash;it is only fair to say that the stand Deputy Ó Moráin took in defence of the Garda on the main issues was fully justified. I would refer the House to page 78 of the report where it is stated:</P>
    <P>We have already indicated that we found no evidence to support the suggestion that serious physical violence is associated with moneylending. Accordingly, we consider that, in presenting a picture of laxity on the part of the Gardaí, the programme was not authentic.  We also find that the team had no evidence which would warrant the making of any such criticism.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly also seemed upset about my touching concern for certain privacy.  He may have been referring to the use of concealed devices to record conversations.  As the Senator should be aware, the Tribunal decided to make no recommendations on this, but I raised the question with the Authority, as I have stated previously. After doing so I was informed that an instruction to the staff had been in preparation before the broadcast of the programme in question, and that this instruction was issued shortly afterwards. This instruction prohibits the use of such devices, save in the most exceptional cases, and then only under the strictest control.  As Senator Kelly said, I said in the other House that the whole matter is being studied by specialised agencies of the United Nations and recommendations will probably be made to Governments for the control of the use of these devices.</P>
    <P>Although Senator Robinson has left, it would be wrong of me to allow pass her cheap gibes at the Government Information Bureau.  It is not necessary to answer them except to say that I would have expected far more from the Senator in question.  Perhaps I am wrong.  She made another statement which I believe to be utter nonsense: that no co-operation whatsoever is being given to RTE by any Department of State.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate to remark <Col N="158" /> that in dealing with this motion, we have been looking back.  I should like to conclude on the note of looking to the future.  Certainly the report was critical of certain aspects of Radio Telefís Éireann's handling of this programme operation.  It also expressed the view that Radio Telefís Éireann was activated by a desire to draw attention to what they considered to be a serious social evil.  To that extent the programme had a beneficial result.  In other words, the intention was good; but the planning, the preparation and the execution left very much to be desired.  I have no doubt that the RTE Authority have considered the matter in all its aspects and have taken what action they consider appropriate.  I sincerely trust that we will never have an occasion for a similar tribunal of inquiry.</P>

      <P>Senator Keery pointed out, quite rightly, that the Opposition had called for an inquiry. Although he did not say it in so many words I took him to mean, by introducing this subject, that having called for an inquiry and having got it, we are now squealing about the results of this inquiry.  That is not so.  I made it absolutely clear in my opening speech that I accepted that the inquiry had been satisfactory so far as I could judge it, apart from criticisms of it which I have heard but which I am not able to assess myself.  I accepted that the Tribunal has done its work properly and I have no fault to find with its conclusions.</P>
      <P>Although Senator Keery did not allege it in so many words, it is entirely false to imagine that the Opposition in general, or my party in particular, are in fundamental disagreement with what the Tribunal did. Our disagreement with the workings of the Tribunal arose not so much from what it did or was allowed to do but from the narrow terms of reference within which it was limited by resolution of these Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keery suggested, and I have some recollection of him having suggested it before as it is a favourite theme of his, that we might more profitably have spent the money which <Col N="159" /> this Tribunal absorbed on establishing and endowing a Press Council.  I think, as Senator Keery does, that there is a lot to be said for a Press Council.  But the point is that we have to be realistic about the kind of country that we are living in and the kind of people we are being ruled by, for the moment.  I do not believe for a second that a Press Council would have halted Deputy Ó Moráin's assault on the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team.  I do not think that a Press Council, with the kind of thin-skinned Government we have, would prevent that Government from taking up whatever attitude they felt like in regard to statements which could be damaging to their image.  The idea of a Press Council is absolutely fine, but, like section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, it would not achieve a great deal in a politically sensitive area of this kind.</P>

      <P>There are many things which we have experienced in this country which are unknown elsewhere in western democracy.  There are many things which, if the Chairman would allow me, I could detail and which happen here and happen nowhere else in western democracy.  If the Chairman will allow me another hour I will give a few instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson alleged that research was now inhibited in Radio Telefís Éireann and she made an allegation in regard to the Government Information Bureau.  I have had no experience of the Government Information Bureau except that they have done their best to help me whenever I needed any information.  If it is true that Government Departments&mdash;I know that the Minister has denied this&mdash;are now more reluctant than they were before to give information to journalists, it is not because of anything which &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; did, but because of a disposition which they have noticed in their own Ministers; it is because the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; episode has shown them the kind of men who are in charge of them.  It is not because of anything which the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo;<Col N="160" /> team did that this has happened, if it has happened.  I do not prejudge the issue because I have no first-hand knowledge of it myself.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned my suggestion that the Tribunal might have been constituted in a different way and he rightly said that it is water under the bridge and there is no point now in looking back at the way the Tribunal was constituted.  My remarks in that regard were intended more towards the future, that if we have an issue of this kind again which requires judicial inquiry it might be more satisfactory if we included in the Tribunal lay persons whose professional background or whose social background gave them some closer acquaintance with the problem in question than, let us say, the three judges in this inquiry had with the underworld of moneylending. It was not intended to be useless carping at something which has now passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he did not choose to go into the findings of the Tribunal and I accept that.  I said when I began that I recognise that he has spoken moderately in the Dáil and that he did not say much about the Tribunal either way or go out of his way to overkill the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team.  I accept that.  But I do not accept that when I criticised Deputy Ó Moráin for having said things which were unfounded, and have been shown to be unfounded, I should be described as having made a cheap political point. It is an easy political point, certainly and anyone following Deputy Ó Moráin's career would have had material served up to him nearly every week on which an easy political point could be made.  But how cheap is it? Is it not the truth that Deputy Ó Moráin said things about that team which were untrue?  These were shown to be untrue and in my belief Deputy Ó Moráin was reckless as to their truth.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of privacy, the Minister said that he told the Dáil that an instruction to the staff in Telefís Éireann was in preparation which is welcome news.  He referred also to the United Nations.  I want to ask this House: do we really need <Col N="161" /> the United Nations to tell us that there is such a thing as individual privacy? Do we need to be told?  Are we such poor Paddies that we need to be told by the United Nations or by the Council of Europe that there is such a thing as individual privacy and that it ought to be respected?  We ought to know that ourselves.  The Minister, possibly out of respect for the rules of order and because he did not want to chase me into an alley from which I had been evicted by the Cathaoirleach an hour previously, avoided dealing with my allegation, which I repeat now, that there is no effective control in this country on telephone tapping or on the opening of letters.  My belief is that it would be better for us to forget about the United Nations and about the Council of Europe and go back to observing the law of the land as it was correctly set out by Oscar Traynor in 1957.  The days when it is possible for people to have scramblers, which necessarily implies telephone tapping, and for a secretary of a Government Department to know who has the scramblers, are days which represent a climate in which a Minister has absolutely no business to be telling us about what the United Nations may recommend.  Let him cast the beam out of his own eye or that of his Department before he starts investigating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a foreigner were to come to this country, somebody who knew nothing about this State at all, except what is contained in this report, and if he were to sit down and read this report he would say: &ldquo;These are a terribly finicking crowd of people; their concern for the truth and for authenticity is superhuman.&rdquo;  But if he were to reside here for three or four months or for a year, particularly last year, and compare the standards of respect for truth and authenticity which this Tribunal was allegedly set up to uphold with what he sees around him in political life over the last year, where not so much as daylight can be believed from high places, he would come to the conclusion that the whole inspiration behind this report was ostensible and not genuine; that the solicitude for authenticity was selective; that it was only those things which were uncomfortable and damaging, which were destructive to an image which the Government wished to preserve, that needed to be investigated into the last nook and cranny and in which authenticity and truth needed to be established, but in no other respect.  Although I am not a member of the Government and never have been associated with Fianna Fáil I am ashamed that a foreigner coming here and going through the exercise I have described could be in the position to draw such a conclusion.</P>
