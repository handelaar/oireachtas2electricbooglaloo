      <P>May I also ask the Leader of the House whether the rule in regard to time will apply in regard to each of these motions?  I do not anticipate that anything I have to say or anything that will be said on this side will be inordinately long.  On the other hand, the leader of the House will appreciate that it is at our suggestion that these motions are being taken <Col N="1566" /> together.  A great deal of material could arise for discussion on each of them so I hope that the motions will be taken together at the same time, an arrangement that would be appropriate if we were discussing only one motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to motions generally, we find on this side that the present arrangement is not working out satisfactorily.  That is not in any way due to any failure on the part of Senator Ó Maoláin.  We appreciate his difficulties in securing the attendance of Ministers.  In effect, what is happening is that, by reason of the uncertainty as to whether the Leader of the House will be able to secure the attendance of Ministers, very often the notice which we get regarding the taking of motions is extremely limited.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ó Maoláin will appreciate, a number of the motions are of substantial importance which require a certain amount of homework to be done in advance.  I want to put forward as a suggestion for consideration&mdash; perhaps we could raise it later either in the House or at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges&mdash;that we should decide to fix an order in which the motions will be taken.  We should decide to adhere to that regardless of whether Ministers will be available. Adequate notice would then be given to Members of this House and it would enable Ministers to receive adequate notice.</P>
      <P>We should like to have Ministers in attendance if possible, but we are quite prepared to go ahead with motions whether Ministers are here or not.  I am not asking Senator Ó Maoláin to give any firm decision or commitment on this matter at this stage.  I am merely raising it to let him know our difficulties and for the purpose of suggesting that there should be some examination of the problem.</P>

      <P>The difference between Senator O'Higgins and me is that I do not see any point whatever in having a discussion on motions unless there is a Minister here to give the viewpoint of the Government in connection with them.  Otherwise it would be making the House a complete talking <Col N="1567" /> shop, nothing else.  With regard to giving adequate notice of motions, I do my best.  I do all I can to give adequate notice.  A week's notice ought to be sufficient in view of the length of time these motions are on the Order Paper.  I take it for granted that those who put them down must have been prepared to have them taken the following day, if called.  Therefore, I think a week's notice is quite adequate.</P>

      <P>With regard to taking them in a series, as suggested by Senator O'Higgins, that is not always easy.  You could decide on scheduling a motion for, say, next month and find that the Minister concerned is not available.  I do not see any point whatever in having a discussion unless there is a Minister here to answer.</P>

      <P>Pursuant to Standing Order 75, a Bill which has been initiated in the Seanad and amended by the Dáil is, after its receipt back from the Dáil, deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage, the Minister, on the Question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, explains the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters that may be discussed are the Dáil amendments.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first amendment was moved by Deputy Cosgrave on Committee Stage of the debate in the Dáil.  I accepted it <Col N="1569" /> and the House agreed to it.  Section 9 of the Bill, as passed by the Seanad, proposed to extend rights to lessees whose leases expired within five years before the passing of this legislation. The section was designed to implement a recommendation of the Landlord and Tenant Commission which is contained in Paragraph 63 (2) of their Second Report and which speaks of a lease which expired &ldquo;by the effluxion of time within five years before the enactment of any amending legislation&rdquo;.  Paragraph 61 of their report states: &ldquo;In the 1931 Act and again in the 1958 Act where new rights were granted to lessees, provision was made to cover cases where a lease had expired a short time&rdquo;&mdash;five years in the case of both Acts&mdash;&ldquo;before the statute was enacted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is to be presumed that the commission, when they recommended a period of five years' retrospection, intended that certain persons, chiefly on the Proby Estate in Sandycove, should benefit.  The Dáil in making this amendment, that is, increasing the period of retrospection from five to eight years, wished to ensure that section 9 would benefit all the persons that the commission intended should benefit.  It is to be noted that the commission's Second Report is dated 4th April, 1968. The point was made during the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil that if a period of only five years' retrospection were provided, some persons who felt that their rights were secure in 1968 would find that they had no rights under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is possibly in case of some leases that have expired. It would implement the intention of the report in ensuring that everyone in mind was captured within the terms of the section.  Certainly, we would welcome the increase of the period to eight years from five years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The second amendment is a much more important one. On Committee Stage in the Dáil I moved an instruction to the Committee <Col N="1570" /> empowering them to make this amendment. The revival of section 8 (1A) of the 1960 Rent Act was suggested to me by many people, including a number of Deputies in the Dáil, and quite a number of people outside.  I indicated on Second Stage debate that I would consider the position between that and Committee Stage and I then put down an amendment the purpose of which is to revive for a period of one year, the spent provisions contained in section 8 (1A) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  Subsection (1A) was inserted in section 8 of the 1960 Act by section 4 (1) of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, and in accordance with section 4 (3) of the 1967 Act it had a life of only two years, which expired on 8th May, 1969.  The amendment will enable what may be described as &ldquo;small&rdquo; landlords to have certain basic rents revised during the period of one year from the date of enactment of this Bill into law.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 8 (1A) of the 1960 Rent Act, which the amendment proposes to revive, the District Court will be authorised to review the basic rent on an application by a landlord who owns not more than six controlled houses or self-contained flats with a combined valuation not exceeding £60, in case one at least of them is situate in the Dublin area, or £40 in any other case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The landlord will be liable for the tenant's costs in the District Court, unless that court considers it proper, having regard in particular to the means of the landlord and the tenant, to order otherwise.  The rent, if adjusted by the court, is to be of such amount as the court considers reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, but, in particular, to the necessity of avoiding financial hardship to the tenant and the landlord.  It is not to exceed the maximum rent which would be fixed on the renewal of a tenancy under Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  Only a landlord who owned the premises on 8th June, 1966, that is, the date of introduction of the Bill that was subsequently enacted into law as the 1967 Rent Act will benefit from the re-activation of section 8 (1A).  This is not an innovation, <Col N="1571" /> it is the position that obtained during the original two year life of section 8 (1A).</P>
    <P>The court will be enabled to deal privately with the whole or any part of an application under the revived provision.  The parties may also agree among themselves on a new basic rent.  The court may, however, alter a rent so agreed, on the application of either party within three months after the service of notice of the agreed rent, where it is established that he has become aware since the agreement that the financial circumstances of the other party at the time of the agreement were substantially better than those by reference to which the agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>The re-activation for a period of one year of the spent provisions contained in section 8 (1A) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, will give those small landlords who satisfy the necessary conditions and who are in poor financial circumstances another opportunity to have basic rents revised.  Representations have been made to me and to my Department to the effect that many small landlords, who would have benefited under the provisions of section 8 (1A) during the two-year period when it was in operation, failed to do so because they were unaware of its existence.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that this amendment is very important to a lot of people who are in bad financial circumstances.  Unfortunately, so far as I know it did not receive publicity in the Dáil because it is not dramatic or anything like that.  It just helps people.  I would hope that it might be possible to report it sufficiently widely to make people aware of their rights.  The main reason why I am bringing it back now and asking the Seanad to approve of it is that, although it was in existence for two years before &mdash;from May, 1967, to May, 1969&mdash;it was scarcely availed of at all.  It was only at the time it expired in 1969 that people became aware of it.  I am proposing to reactivate it now for a period of one year to enable those who were not in a position to avail of it or who did not know about it the last time to <Col N="1572" /> avail of it now.  For that reason it would be of great help to many people in poor circumstances if the fact that this amendment is being made could be given as much publicity as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that the justification for this amendment is the complexity and obscurity of certain of the provisions of the Rent Restrictions code.  It is also true to say that this amendment was urged on the Minister by the Opposition in the other House. It is justified for the reasons that the Minister has mentioned.</P>
      <P>While there was enabling power to have basic rents in the class of cases to which the Minister has referred to&mdash; which he described, I think, as the small landlord&mdash;the enabling power to have the basic rents adjusted was there, as the Minister has mentioned, for a period of two years, I think it is true to say that largely that was not known.  It was not availed of because the particular small landlord class to which the Minister refers simply did not know of their rights under the previous Act.  For that reason I think the Minister is only giving them a fair crack of the whip by allowing another period of a year within which applications for review or adjustment of the basic rent in these cases&mdash; and it is a limited number of cases&mdash;can be made.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister can do to ensure that knowledge, even of this extent, will come to the people concerned.  It might be of some assistance if the Minister suggested to the Incorporated Law Society that they should call specifically the attention of their members to the extension that is being made now.  I am quite sure that the Incorporated Law Society will be happy to do that.  In that way at least a certain number of clients who would be in this class would probably have the benefit of being alerted that this extension has been granted by their solicitors. Other than that, I suppose the Minister can only rely on the news media to carry his appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not overly anxious to see Ministers getting publicity, on this occasion I would support the Minister's efforts.  I think it would be worthwhile for his Department to issue a statement <Col N="1573" /> through the Government Information Bureau calling specific attention to the amendment which has been made.  I agree with the Minister that it is important.  It could be important for a number of the small landlords who, particularly nowadays with the spiralling cost of living and with the continual erosion in money values, are probably very hard put to keep body and soul together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerenceOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last week I was saying that I should like to see greater powers given to the county committees of agriculture.  I had in mind the Land Project Office and the Farm Improvement Scheme.  I feel that if they were given over to the advisory service it would benefit the farming community considerably in so far as it would bring their problems closer to hand and they would be in closer touch with the agricultural instructors in their area. I have no doubt that they are fully qualified to advise farmers on those aspects of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see greater consideration given to the remote areas, such as the peninsular areas in my county where they find it very difficult to get instructors to remain, due to the fact that agriculture is not as advanced in those areas as it is in other parts of the country.  The system of appointment is on a temporary basis, the instructors being appointed by the committees in a temporary capacity and eventually appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  As soon as an instructor is appointed to one of the peninsular areas, straightaway he looks for another vacancy because he has a greater opportunity of improving his position elsewhere.  If the Minister could give some incentive to instructors to get <Col N="1574" /> them to remain in those areas it would be worth while.  If they could be given the maximum salary at the outset and their appointments were permanent they would not be looking for an opportunity to get away as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I feel that the pilot schemes should be extended in West Cork.  We are very grateful to the Minister for starting these schemes in West Cork and they have been very successful.  The results show what can be done by the introduction of the pilot schemes.  The time is now ripe for taking the remainder of the peninsular areas into the pilot schemes, thereby affording small farmers an opportunity of participating in and availing of the higher grants which are being given in the pilot areas.</P>
    <P>I feel that sheep breeding should get more consideration from the Department. We have the problem of sheep scab which we find difficult to eradicate which has been a plague to the sheep industry for some time.  Cork County Council have been advocating some scheme to remedy this problem.  Last year they introduced a pilot scheme in my area in the Beara Peninsula as a result of which there was an increase of 50 per cent in the number of sheep dipped.  This was a considerable increase and goes to prove that farmers will cooperate if they get the incentive to do it. Unfortunately, this scheme was not continued this year and a number of sheep farmers were quite perturbed. From inquiries I have made I find that there was a problem in relation to the sale of sheep in the North of Ireland. Because of the lamb subsidy and the ewe hogget subsidy one year would have to be left open for sheep which would be sold in the North of Ireland. I am sure we could find some way of getting around this problem and the sheep farmers deserve some consideration, especially in the mountainous areas.</P>
    <P>I know the sheep farmers are grateful for the subsidies which have been introduced, but there is also the great problem of the eradication of sheep scab.  I would appeal to the Minister to do all in his power to have this plague eradicated.  We are grateful to the Minister for introducing this Bill. It is a very worthwhile Bill and one <Col N="1575" /> which will help county committees of agriculture considerably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I like the previous speakers, welcome this Bill but in my view it does not go far enough.  In March, 1970, the Minister came before the Oireachtas with a proposal to increase the rates of subsidy to the committees of agriculture to 2s. 3d. That sum has since been found to be inadequate in most counties and the Minister has found it necessary to return to the Oireachtas to grant a further increase which will amount to 2½p more than the increase granted in March, 1970.</P>
      <P>With all due respects to the Minister &mdash;he is quite well aware of the workings of agriculture committees being a former member of one of them&mdash;2½p of an increase in 1971 is totally inadequate.  I should like him to reconsider the matter and accept the amendment, which some of the agricultural Members of this House have put down, to increase this sum to 30p.  As anybody who has anything to do with county committees of agriculture knows, their costs are increasing year by year.  The schemes they operate in their own counties are very helpful in fostering better farming methods and in educating young people who one day will take the places of the older members of the farming community. The scholarships provided by those committees in the agricultural colleges have increased by approximately £50 per head.  With their present limited finances it is very difficult for committees of agriculture to carry out their planned programmes.</P>
      <P>County Committees of agriculture in order to carry on during the last number of years had to refrain from appointing sufficient agricultural advisers.  They knew that by keeping one or two such posts vacant they would save 50 per cent of the salaries of those people and thereby be able to keep out of the red. This is not the proper method of improving agricultural conditions and methods of farming in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned here that there are people in rural Ireland who contribute sizeable amounts of money in taxation and rates to county committees <Col N="1576" /> of agriculture and who do not derive any benefit from those committees. People who live in labourers' cottages in Meath, and who contribute in rates to the agricultural committee through the county council, can get benefits from the schemes operated by the committee.  Such schemes include fruit and vegetable plots where subsidies are given in share to one-eighth of an acre and I am very pleased to say that we, in the Meath County Committee of Agriculture, initiated a scheme some years ago to give grants for filling machines to help the small cottier and the very small farmer to engage in the production of soft fruits and vegetables. The Minister for Agriculture at that time adopted the scheme and it has now become a nationwide scheme.  The amount of the grant at present is very small but nevertheless it is an incentive to such people.  They have approximately a statute acre of land each which was not in production heretofore and I am very pleased to note that many of them have come into production under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister listened to Senator O'Sullivan when he spoke about the sheep dipping scheme.  I can never understand why this scheme is not controlled by committees of agriculture.  The sheep dipping scheme is administered by the county councils at present.  I wholeheartedly agree with the previous speaker who said that this is a scheme which should be handed over to the committees of agriculture in future.  They are in a better position than the county councils to deal with such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware of many other increases in the costs of county committees of agriculture.  In 1969 we had 328 agricultural instructors and in 1971 we have 603.  Even with this increase in the number of agricultural instructors three are still areas which are not sufficiently serviced by those advisory people.  I should like to impress on the Minister that the committees cannot run the schemes without the necessary finance.  It is a serious reflection on the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries when somebody gets up&mdash;as I did at the general council within the last week&mdash;to say that the <Col N="1577" /> local committee of agriculture was over £20,000 in the red.  That is a great tragedy because, as we all know, agriculture is the basic industry of this country.  If it is not put on a proper footing right away, especially now that we are about to become a member of the EEC, many of our small and medium-size farmers will not be able to survive any longer.  Those people have carried on up to now only with the assistance of intensive agricultural advice.  Small farmers and middle-size farmers are hardworking, industrious people, but they need extra advice to keep them in production and on the land.  If such people are forced to give up farming it will create an immense problem for some future Government. Any man who understands the workings of agriculture will be able to survive, even in EEC conditions, if he has a 50-acre farm.</P>
    <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to reconsider the sum of 15p mentioned in this Bill and, if possible, to increase it to 30p.  Without such an increase I cannot see how the advisory service can carry on in any county in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the other speakers in welcoming this Bill. Like them, I feel that 15p in the £ is not going far enough.  Within another year some of our committees of agriculture will be in the red again.  I understand that there are about seven counties, including my own county of Tipperary, in the red at present.  However, I think it is a good thing to see county committees of agriculture in the red because it indicates that such counties are spending money usefully on agricultural schemes.  Some people seem to think that a demand for 15p in the £ is a considerable amount, but in my opinion it is a very reasonable sum because we were getting 1s in the £ when rates were £1 in the £, whereas today in a number of counties rates amount to £5 in the £ valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a rather sad reflection on agriculture committees that they have to go, cap in hand, to the county council every year, asking for so much money.  If a county council refused to grant a sum of money, the agricultural committee would be in queer street, <Col N="1578" /> but I do not think that has ever happened.  The Minister mentioned that he proposes to make changes in relation to committees of agriculture, and no doubt this system will be changed and other means will be introduced in order to permit farmers to carry on.  In some of our western counties county councils pay only 25 per cent: the Government pay 75 per cent of the cost of running agricultural affairs in the county.  This system should be extended to the whole country.  Money spent on agriculture is money well spent.</P>
    <P>In recent months much has been said about changing our committees of agriculture.  A change of some kind may be needed, but nothing drastic is necessary.  Many people claim that the system of electing committees is altogether wrong; on some committees there are people who are not farmers and who have no interest in agriculture. With regard to my own county, South Tipperary, there are three people on the committee who are not farmers, but they are people who know a lot about agriculture.  It is possible to know a lot about agriculture without being a farmer.  Different farming organisations claim that they should have the right to nominate people to serve on committees of agriculture.  In this country there are many people who would be prepared to act on committees if they could get in the easy way.  Such people would not be prepared to go to much trouble in order to canvass in the rural areas before election to a committee.  If a change is needed I believe that a good way of electing a committee of agriculture would be to conduct the election on the same day as the county council election. I also believe that only farmer members should be elected to the committees and only farmers should vote on that com mittee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that a way could be found to permit the agricultural labourer to have a vote.  If the agricultural labourer has a cottage plot, he would be entitled to have a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned <Col N="1579" /> about having a closer link between the committees of agriculture and the various offices of the Department of Agriculture in each county.  Something should be done in relation to that.  In Clonmel the County Committee of Agriculture purchased new buildings about two years ago.  At that time we were led to believe that the farm improvement scheme office and other offices of the Department in Clonmel would be transferred to our office, but that never transpired.  The result is that the two offices are at least one mile apart in the town of Clonmel.  I believe all offices of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, whether they be under the jurisdiction of the Minister or under the County Committee of Agriculture, should be under the one roof.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary there are about 14 agricultural instructors and this number is not sufficient.  Co-operative societies throughout the country should be encouraged by the Department to appoint their own agricultural advisers, and county committees of agriculture should be entitled to give grant to such advisers.</P>
    <P>Mention has also been made about sheep dipping.  I cannot understand why this is done through the county council, because people in the county council know very little about sheep.  Sheep dipping regulations should be enforced by the county committees of agriculture rather than by the county council.</P>
    <P>On the last day Senator Nash mentioned that the taxpayers should not pay the agricultural rate.  Not all taxpayers are paying the agricultural rate.  If you reside in an urban council area or in a city, you do not pay the agricultural rate, and that should be clarified to people resident in towns.  Senator Nash also mentioned that in the 12 western counties the taxpayer had to pay £2 in taxes and £1 in rates to help the agricultural community.  That is an exaggeration. A small portion of the money that comes from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries must come from the taxpayer, but certainly not to the extent that has been mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I spoke longer than I should but I was anxious to say those <Col N="1580" /> few words on the Bill, and I hope that this will be the last time that the Minister will have to legislate in order to authorise county councils to give us more than 3s. in the £.  There should be some other way of doing this.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that if a person's valuation is under £20 he is not paying rates on that and therefore not contributing to agriculture.  In such cases farmers who are not paying on the first £20 should contribute something to agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House any longer than is necessary but the importance of even a few pence spent on agriculture is great.  The total ceiling allowed, 15p, when compared with the rate of £7.20 in Mayo, is small. The Committee of Agriculture in County Mayo spent whatever they were given to spend.  Mayo has not the rich soil of Meath or some of the other counties.  It has problems of terrain, weather, and mountains to hinder agriculture.  In spite of this, the Committee of Agriculture felt that, if there was to be any production in the area, agricultural services had to be provided. This meant having instructors.  It is not always easy to get these in counties such as County Mayo because people prefer to live near what they call the facilities necessary for modern living in the spheres of education, culture and entertainment. It is becoming more difficult to get professional people of all kinds to work in the far West of Ireland and, indeed, in places in the Midlands too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of this the money was always provided.  The taxpayers and the farmers never grudged giving it.  I was pleased to hear Senator Ryan referring to Senator Nash's speech and comparing the amount of money being provided by the taxpayers with that provided by farmers.  Senator Nash is very learned and wise.  I should not like to question him on the legalities of any situation, but in the counties concerned the three-to-one he referred to was really one-and-a-half-to-one <Col N="1581" /> because in the western counties a 75 per cent grant was given as against a 50 per cent grant elsewhere. Senator Nash was making the case that this was paid by urban dwellers and that they also had to carry some taxation. The farmers had to carry in taxation exactly the same amount as the urban dwellers.  There was not a big gap between what they paid and what other people were paying.  From reading Senator Nash's speech one might think such a gap existed.  Farmers and rural dwellers have to contribute to amenities that they have not got themselves, such as footpaths, street lighting, libraries, <i>et cetera,</i> in towns.  Urban dwellers should realise that the traffic is not all one-way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase but I should like it to be greater.  It appears from what the Minister has said and from what columnists are writing that there will be a major reorganisation in agriculture and in the various bodies dealing with agriculture in the future. I want to say loudly and clearly to the Minister that, no matter what reorganisation is undertaken, there is no doubt but that the schemes under the Institute of Agriculture, the farm buildings schemes, the land project schemes and the schemes carried out by the committees of agriculture will have to be rationalised.  The people at local level will have to have a greater share than ever before in shaping the destinies of these rationalised agricultural bodies. The local people will not allow finance to be taken from the county councils.</P>
    <P>People have said that a statutory demand can be made by a vocational educational committee and that a statutory demand should also come from the agricultural committees.  It is possible in the future that a statutory demand will come from whatever new body takes over the administration of the services.  This would be quite in order, but I should like to see local control in existence.  While it is difficult to devise anything like perfect control, I could not agree with Senator W. Ryan in saying that an election should be held on the same day as the county council election, where some fellows would be nominated for the county committees of agriculture and they <Col N="1582" /> would be elected by popular vote on the same day.  An election of this kind could cause a great deal of confusion. County councils, so far, are quite capable of electing the proper type of people to the committee.  Perhaps the Minister could make it statutory that a certain number of the members of the committee should be composed of farmers and non-members of a county council.  I have been a member of a county council for over 20 years.  In the final analysis it is the elected members who have to say what the expenditure will be, and he who pays the piper should call the tune.  I want to see that the payer calls the tune and not the piper.</P>
    <P>More specialisation is needed regarding the instructors.  There is no point sending an instructor to Belmullet, Erris, or somewhere below Castlebar and leaving him there for years without making sure that he is given courses on the newest and best methods and kept up-to-date with modern procedures. Rationalisation would ensure this.  The Institute of Agriculture are doing great work in research, but it takes far too long to get the results of this to the farmer.  A means must be found to get all these things brought down to farm level as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>From reading the literature they publish, one can see the magnificent work the Agricultural Institute are doing, but this is no use unless the results can get down to farm level.  This means more specialised education, and people who know a particular job from A to Z should be sent out and a number of these specialists should rotate to each county.  The existing service does not leave much room for promotion.  There are always cribs about the fact that you can only move to deputy CAO and from that to CAO and after that it is a dead end.  Some new system should be devised whereby people who specialise in a particular branch would get remunerated for their services, and circulate from county to county as needed in order to do the particular job necessitated by the circumstances and the soil conditions.</P>
    <P>Again, coming from a western county, I would ask the Minister&mdash; despite whatever Senator Nash may <Col N="1583" /> have to say about its impact on urban dwellers&mdash;to pay the 75 per cent grant overall and we will all be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the maximum rate of 15p in the £ which committees can now demand from county councils, but I feel, like most other Senators here, that this may be inadequate and many committees will be in the red again by next year.  There should have been a bigger increase granted as committees could be relied upon not to spend more than was necessary in any particular year.  It is now more than ever necessary to provide an efficient advisory service for our farmers who are likely to be competing with European farmers in an expanded market in the near future.  We need central offices where land project officers, farm building supervisors and, possibly, Agricultural Credit Corporation staff work in close harmony and as a single unit.  The work of all these services could, in my opinion, be coordinated by committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>County committees of agriculture are doing very good work at present, but I feel that more progress could be made with schemes of development, such as the Small Farms Scheme.  This scheme was the means of bringing the advisory service to farmers who never consulted an instructor.  Now they are working to a plan and making satisfactory progress. This is the type of work on which we and county committees of agriculture should be concentrating and expanding to include more of our farmers, not alone small farmers.  In this way we would have the majority of farmers working to a planned programme. There could be an overall plan for the county.  We must do everything possible as far as the proposal in relation to viable farmers, is concerned, especially now, as we are going into the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of work of committees which should get more attention is agricultural education.  Every young person going into farming should have an opportunity to attend a course of instruction, either at an agricultural college or a farm training centre within the county.  Education of our rural <Col N="1584" /> youth is of paramount importance and must be treated as a priority.  Farmers of the future must be highly skilled in business methods such as marketing, if they are to hold their own under EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>The provision of educational centres is not going as fast as it should, and at the rate they are being built it would take years to have educational centres covering the whole country.  Granted, what is required is more money for education centres and proper accommodation where instructors can work to better advantage.</P>
    <P>More specialist advisers are also needed at county or regional level, as farming is becoming more specialised. County committee members should discuss development programmes at their meetings and have a more progressive outlook on agricultural matters. Too many side issues are being discussed at most committee meetings. It would be more unlikely to happen if the other Department services mentioned were under local control or at least organised under one body, such as the committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>These are the only few words that I wished to say and I hope that the Minister will give some of these points consideration because I think they are very important at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as far as it has gone.  But I am afraid that it has not gone far enough in relation to the western counties and especially to County Mayo from which I come, because even if we were to operate the 15p which we are being allowed now, in the next year, by March, 1973, the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture will still be £24,000 in the red; and as we are operating at the present time and as we will probably operate after March, 1973, we will be a committee trying to advise the farmers of the county at the whim of a bank manager and on a shoestring budget.  This is not very profitable to the agricultural community and it is not a very appropriate method of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate our deputy CAO, who is acting CAO, and our agricultural staff in Mayo.  We have the largest number of farmers operating <Col N="1585" /> the Small Farms Bonus Incentive Scheme of any county in Ireland, and there are many more applications to be processed.</P>
    <P>In order that we may be able to operate in the future we will have to cut down on unnecessary staff and on some of the schemes and plans that we already have.  This would be to the detriment of the community.  I do not know if it is proper for us to ask the ratepayers of Mayo, who are already paying £7.10 in the £, to take on an additional taxation burden in subsidising and looking after the agricultural committee.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to give some extra subvention to Counties Mayo and Kerry which are in a similar position financially in order to operate in a manner befitting an agricultural community and a county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is appropriate at this stage to mention the large contribution which we will be possibly called on to make to the health authority when we are striking the rate next March.  If we are going to be hit from all angles under this rates system, which I consider completely outdated, the people of Mayo will not be able to meet the extra burden.  We are the highest rated county in Ireland.  We are not complaining too much about that at the present time, but if it continues to increase we will not be able to exist.</P>
    <P>These, then, are my views.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to find some method whereby he could give a larger subvention than the 75 per cent we are getting for the payment of our agricultural advisers.  They are second to none and deserve to be paid for their work.</P>
    <P>I think money could be spared by many agricultural committees.  We appoint agricultural advisers.  They have recently left the university, but then they have to go away for a fortnight or three weeks on a special course.  If they complete the full agricultural course at the university, why have they to do these other courses?  Other professions, such as the doctors, for instance, do not have to do this.  Doctors do not go away for courses a few years after getting their degrees.  But they are <Col N="1586" /> informed by circulars and pamphlets from the Medical Research Council. Perhaps if such pamphlets were circularised to our agricultural advisers, there would be no necessity for extra expenditure in sending them on special courses.</P>
    <P>There is very little that Senator Nash said with which I can agree.  It was ridiculous for him to say that a farmer had divided his farm into three or four lots among his wife and children in order to avoid the payment of rates.  On two different occasions and for two different people recently I had difficulty in getting the Land Commission to subdivide two farms to enable a farmer to place a portion of his farm in his son's name so that he could get married and settle down.  On both occasions the Land Commission refused to do this. Unless the Land Commission cater for special cases in Tipperary to enable them to divide their farms into small allotments and avoid the payment of rates, a statement like that is nonsensical. I do not think it is happening or that the Land Commission would allow it to happen.</P>
    <P>If the urban population are subsidising agriculture to any degree there is many a pound and many a penny gone from the rural dwellers in subsidising every amenity that exists in an urban area.  Those urban areas are dependent on the farming community residing in their hinterland.  If the farming community were not capable of producing sufficient the urban community would soon suffer from the lack of customers in their pubs and shops. Anything which small farmers, such as we have in Mayo, get from the urban area they are well and truly entitled to.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to appeal again to the Minister to give us a subvention greater than we are getting.  I would like to see this 15p in the £ raised to 20p in the £.  We will have to do something like that in County Mayo in order to have a viable committee of agriculture and not one that is working at the whim, the good nature or mood of the bank manager on a Monday morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries admits that the financial position in some counties <Col N="1587" /> is bad.  He admitted it in the last paragraph of his speech.  He says:</P>
      <P>The proposed Bill is required to ensure that those committees which in the immediate future cannot carry out their statutory functions on the present incomes will be permitted to seek sufficient funds to enable them to do so.  My Department will, of course, continue to provide grants for committees on the same <i>pro rata</i> basis as heretofore.</P>
      <P>I wonder if this is on a <i>pro rata</i> basis? Some committees are in a very bad financial position.  When one examines the way that this money is collected and distributed, particularly the money collected from rates, it is an unfair type of taxation and the distribution of it by central Government is equally unfair. Take County Leitrim alone: if we increase rates by an old penny in the pound it gives us an increase of £640. We then get a <i>pro rata</i> grant against it of 1d which gives us £1,280.  In County Meath if rates are increased by 1d they get £2,500.  They get 1d from the Department which gives them £5,000. There is a difference there of £3,720.  It is most unfair and unjust.  Senator Nash said here the last day that some committees are getting 75 per cent, but they are getting only 75 per cent recoupment against employees in the advisory services.  Agricultural committees have other costs.  For that reason, this whole situation would need to be looked at.  Even now with the increase from 2s 3d to 3s, which is an increase of 9d, there will be approximately seven to nine counties which at the end of the financial year will not be cleared with the bank.  We know the position of banks at the moment.  Let it be private enterprise, committees of agriculture, the industrial world, these people are squeezing hard to get down overdrafts. It is an unfair situation for committees of agriculture to find themselves in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much talk in high places about taking powers from the committees of agriculture and getting rid of them.  When one hears of this, particularly at a time like this, one can only look at the recently appointed <Col N="1588" /> health boards and one is inclined to ask himself how satisfactory these are functioning.  The public representatives have been squeezed out.  They might have one of a majority on most health boards.  At the same time the people who have been appointed to these health boards, other than those elected by the popular vote, are responsible to nobody but their own organisations. These people, in my opinion, are not giving the service that was expected of them.  We were asked to give the health boards a trial.  That is being done and I have no doubt when their demands come out at the end of the financial year the ratepayer will get a far greater surprise than he will get from the miserable few pence the Minister has agreed to give agricultural committees.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider looking at agricultural committees in a different way.  We have in the agricultural committee a local organisation consisting in the main of public representatives.  It is reasonable at this stage to suppose that we are going into the EEC.  It is also reasonable to think that our farmers will have to be much more highly geared for the competitive market they are going to meet there.  Agricultural committees in the main down the years have been a kind of educational service to the farming community providing advisory services, winter classes, and instruction. They did a very good job for the minor scope they had.  When one looks at the increased number of instructors in the country over the last 12 years the increase has been approximately 275 instructors, or nearly double.  I do not think we have gone far enough.  We all know there is too much overlapping in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The whole situation could be quite easily solved.</P>
    <P>Take an average-size county.  If there were three to four offices set up in each of these counties, with the advisory services of the land project, the farm building section and representatives from the Department of Lands, these people could operate their services from these centres.  They could be supervised by the county committees of agriculture as they are now supervised in the advisory service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> The merit in this suggestion of combining together the four services which are now operated on a separate basis would benefit the farmers, especially if there was more co-operation at local level.  There does not seem to be co-operation between the farm building section and the land project section and the Land Commission.  There is an obligation on the Department of Agriculture to get this co-operation and introduce decentralisation so that most decisions can be made locally.  It would be a great achievement to get the heads of the various sections working together at local level and the Minister should look hard at this.  These people would have first-hand information.  They would have the local knowledge and know the requirements of a given area.  After a short time they would even know the requirements of each individual farm.</P>
    <P>At present under the 1931 Act no county committee can erect a building to house staff from any other section of the Department of Agriculture.  That is a pity and something should be done about it.  My second suggestion would be to enlarge the small farm bonus scheme to the level of what I would call the farm development scheme.  The farm bonus scheme has been in operation for some years by the committees of agriculture and it should be enlarged. At present only a farmer who has a poor law valuation not exceeding £25 or if his area of land is under 50 acres can get into the farm bonus scheme.  The new type of farm development scheme should be open to all farmers big and small.</P>
    <P>We must remember that on entry into Europe we must increase our agricultural production.  The scheme could run on the lines of a farm bonus scheme with a programme of four to six years of planning development, including a bonus at each successful stage.  It would work out much more satisfactorily than the scheme which is operating at the moment.  It might be no harm if grants were no longer paid to people who would not enter this type of scheme and that they would not qualify for grants for farm buildings or land project or any other grants on offer.  Senator Nash referred to this type of person here when he stated in <Col N="1590" /> Volume 71, column 1557 of the Seanad Official Report of Wednesday, 24th November, 1971:</P>
    <P>But it is now about time the agricultural community realised that all the time they cannot be at the taking end of the nation's pocket.  Throughout this country there are farms and farms and farms which are growing furze, which are inadequately tilled, which are improperly used and for which the ordinary taxpayer is expected to pay.</P>
    <P>If that type of person is there he should not be allocated a grant because we are not getting any production from him.  The Government's agricultural programme is aimed at increasing production.  Farmers who do not expand agricultural production should not qualify for grants.  The reward for following a planned development programme need not necessarily be a bonus.  It could be a loan free of interest or a subsidised loan, which operates in some of the EEC countries already.  It would help our farms to get ready for going into Europe.</P>
    <P>The two suggestions are, in brief: the setting up of many departments at local level, incorporating all agricultural services and giving as much control as possible to the local committee of agriculture.  These people would know the local problems and know how best to deal with them.  At the same time these services working together would be able to run a farm development scheme such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture should give very serious thought to this, because it would be most inadvisable to abolish agricultural committees.  Having served in one for the most part of 30 years I sometimes think they are not doing what they should, but we do what is possible with the limited amount of money which is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other Senators I welcome this Bill, which may be a short one but to me is a very important one.  My own county, Westmeath, has not yet exceeded its specified sum which it was allowed to expend in the past. Nevertheless, in an expanding economy <Col N="1591" /> it is reasonable to assume that it will in the very near future avail itself of the new limits which we are setting here today.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the importance of the county committees of agriculture, especially now that we are about to have a referendum on our proposed entry into the European Economic Community.  Every effort must now be made to provide all the technical, scientific and marketing information which can be regarded as beneficial to all our farmers so that they can reap the full benefit of membership of the EEC. The county committees of agriculture have enjoyed the confidence of the majority of our farmers over the years. For that reason nothing can be contemplated which would minimise their importance.</P>
      <P>At present the number of holdings over five acres in County Westmeath is approximately 6,282.  Of those holdings 4,018 are under 50 acres.  Assuming that Mansholt is right, are we to assume for one moment that all those 4,000 would have to disappear?  To my way of thinking, those 4,000 farmers are determined to remain in agriculture. Therefore, it is important that every aid that can possibly be given should be given to those people.</P>
      <P>When I said we had 4,018 under 50 acres, I should also say we have 2,423 holdings under £20 valuation.  If those 2,423 had to leave agriculture where would the jobs be to absorb them into industry?  They just would not be available.  Therefore, what is really required is an intensive small farm bonus incentive scheme to enable those people to increase their income from their existing holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time over one-third of all farmers are availing themselves of the services provided by the county committees of agriculture.  Farmers are conscious of the need to acquire new skills and new methods of production. They also realise that farming is no longer just a way of life; it is a business and, so far as the country is concerned, it is a very important one.  The Minister and his Department should do everything in their power to promote greater liaison between other sections of his <Col N="1592" /> Department which are directly or indirectly involved with the Committees.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have mentioned the veterinary services, the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, the Land Project Scheme, the Warble Fly Eradication Scheme, the Beef Bonus Incentive Scheme, the Brucellosis Scheme, the Farm Building Scheme, water schemes, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and so on.  At present all those branches are operating individually and I feel that the Minister and his Department should make a special effort to incorporate their activities under one heading.  I know that it would present many difficulties, but I feel that with the co-operation of all farming bodies a new and workable solution will be found, which will benefit all our farmers.  Any money invested by the State in agriculture is sound investment.  My own experience over the years would indicate that farmers are quick to avail themselves of any incentives given them to improve their lot.</P>
    <P>The value of our agricultural exports is increasing year by year, and are helping to pay for at least some of our imports.  More and more practical advice must always be available to our farmers in order to prepare for the challenge of the future.  Let me say that I believe the county committees have an important role to play in the future, as they have done in the past.  With new thinking along the lines which I have suggested, I am of opinion that the county committees can be repaid and should be repaid.  I welcome this Bill and, like other Senators, I wish to thank the Minister and his Department for their efforts to promote more and more aid for agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one important statement which was made here by Senator Jack Fitzgerald with which I thoroughly agree.  Why is there a limit at all so far as our basic industry is concerned?  Why are we tied down?  I am 18 years on the <Col N="1593" /> Cork County Committee of Agriculture. In the beginning there were five in the advisory service; we have 30 or 35 at the present time.  What is all this bluff about?  Is it an act from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to strap us down?  I firmly believe that it is; it is an excuse to get out.</P>
    <P>In Cork, through our grants and premiums, we have done a good day's work.  At the time when the late P.S. Moloney of Clare was the only agricultural instructor we had, the attitude of the farmers was: &ldquo;I should love to hear what he would say, but how am I to overcome the fact that I have no capital?&rdquo; That was the attitude until Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tire came along and they educated the people of the country.  They siad &ldquo;There is a necessity&rdquo; and the people agreed.</P>
    <P>That is the problem we have had for years&mdash;first to get over one system, and then to find capital.  This is the crucial point about it.  Of all the speakers who have spoken here there is only one with whom I agree&mdash;the one who asked &ldquo;Why are we held down when we are the basic industry?&rdquo; It is simple to understand that.  Only a few months ago Cork County Council, of which I am a member, gave planning permission for something which will exterminate the agricultural community in East Cork&mdash; the Cork Smelter factory.  Not alone that, but the workers who are employed in that area are affected.  They are employed by Erin Foods, by Irish Meat Packers, Cork Distilleries Company, Bord Bainne, and Firgoscandia Cold Store in exporting butter, cream and new potatoes.  There was no question at that time of seeing an advisory officer from the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  The CAO or his assistants were not asked.  Not at all, why should they be asked?  Why did they not ask the horticultural advisers?</P>
    <P>Somebody will say &ldquo;Liam Ahern is opposed to industry in East Cork&rdquo;.  I am not: I want plenty of industry there.  This problem should not arise. I take my advice from the CAO and his advisers in the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  I have been on the Cork County Committee of Agriculture for 18 years and I have seen several things <Col N="1594" /> happening.  You hear people talking about the political bore, but we have worked well.  I am a member of two rural organisations.  I firmly believe that the person who is elected by the people, who will have to distribute that money, is the proper person to be on such committees.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan mentioned that land projects in the Land Commission should be dealt with on a county basis and I fully agree with him.  People living in an area would surely know more about their own localities than the people here in Dublin.  I am violently opposed to the new set-up envisaged by the Minister and by the Department regarding county committees of agriculture. I am quite satisfied that they recognise the rural organisations, but any man who stands at the chapel gates and canvasses for an election is the man responsible for the striking of the rates.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for what it is worth but, on the other hand, its introduction should not have been necessary.  Agriculture, which is our greatest industry, should be better treated.  When the health services or the vocational schemes need assistance they can obtain it without any difficulty, but agriculture cannot get any help at all.  They seem to be hammered left, right and centre. Is it a gimmick to try to get us out?  I can assure you that Irish farmers will not co-operate as wholeheartedly with the Department as they would with their own local county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay a tribute to our CAO and the staff in our committee of agriculture who have been of great assistance to us.  It often happens that a man who has been in an area for some length of time and who knows the problems of the area is transferred to some other part of the country, and another man is sent to take his place but he, in turn, will have to move again after about two years.  Something should be done about this position which is causing frustration at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Members of the House for their contributions to the debate.  One of the points which emerged from it was that <Col N="1595" /> a new and improved system of advisory services should be devised.  I think I mentioned in my opening statement that we were in the process of devising such a development scheme&mdash;I should prefer to call it a development scheme rather than an advisory system.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators spoke of the anomalies that arise from time to time in that an individual farmer looking for advice, especially advice of a more penetrating kind, the evolution of a development plan for his own farm, may have to call in the services not only of the advisory staff but the land project, farm buildings and other services as well.  Senators made a very valid point that it would be a good thing if these different services could be co-ordinated within a unified service.  That is one of our aims.  There was a certain degree of paradox in the fears and anxieties expressed by Senators, that, while you look for a vastly improved advisory service being converted into a farm development service, at the same time local committees of agriculture which have been carrying on gallantly for decades can remain unchanged in function and unchanged in personnel. This appears to me to be unrealistic, but it does not appear to have any real bearing on the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald mentioned that it was the beginning of what he called an economic squeeze out of committees. He blamed the financial ills of certain committees of agriculture on the Department of Agriculture, unless I have misread him.  He also mentioned&mdash;as did other Senators&mdash;the inability, under the present advisory services, of deserving officers, especially those with specialised skills, to get to the promotional level they deserve.  Obviously, within a unified service men worthy of promotion would be able to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan and some other Senators mentioned, somewhat irrelevantly but nevertheless quite important, the question of sheep scab I know how important this problem is to the country generally and I have taken note of what the Senator has said.  I shall see if some better means can be found of dipping sheep against this disease. Several Senators felt that the Bill as <Col N="1596" /> presented did not go far enough I will deal with that point in a moment because it is necessary to get down to details when answering that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle and others spoke about the vital necessity for a new advisory development service and the training of young people going into farming.  Senator Doyle did not think we were providing sufficient places in agricultural schools for young men interested in agriculture.  That is quite true, but no matter how many places we provide in such schools more will be needed.  However, I would remind Senator Doyle that in his own county a new college was opened recently in Rockwell.  Not far away from there, in Pilltown, County Kilkenny, the Department of Agriculture have taken over Kildalton Abbey which is now being used for the training of young people going into farming.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds and Senator Keegan mentioned the question of the centralisation of the different farm services and it was a very logical point to make.  The desirability of having available under one roof the various services such as farm buildings, land reclamation and the advisory services, and possibly domestic science advice as well, was mentioned by many Senators.  There were many Senators who thought that the Bill does not go far enough.  I should first like to say that it is an interim measure.  It is a measure that is being brought in to enable committees of agriculture to meet their commitments until the present system is replaced by a better one.</P>
    <P>Among the Senators who said that a ceiling was being put on the activities of committees was Senator Dalgan Lyons of County Mayo.  I should like to remind him that in the case of County Mayo since 1966 the county council have not provided as much as they might have done for their committee of agriculture.  For instance, in the year 1966-67, against a permissible 21d, they provided 15d.  The following year it was 14.9d and the year after, almost 15d against a permissible 21p. The year after that again they provided 19d as against a permissible 21d.  Last year, as against a permissible 27d, they provided 20.8d.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> It is not unnatural that, in those circumstances, Mayo farmers found themselves in some difficulty.  Even in that case, and with the co-operation of Mayo County Council and the recognition of the vital importance of the advisory services to a county such as Mayo, where three-quarters of the tab is picked up by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries anyway, it is vital for the local authorities in Mayo to face up to this particular problem.  It is absolutely futile for Senator Lyons to say that the ceiling is not high enough. Even the existing ceiling which we are raising has not been reached by the Mayo County Council.</P>
    <P>County Kerry is a similar acute case. Starting in 1966-67 there were contributions of 14.9 pence made to the committee of agriculture, followed by 14.8 pence and 19.35 pence.  In 1969-70 they were increased to 20.76 pence; in 1970-71 they began at 24 pence and, rather oddly, went to the maximum.  In each of those cases the Kerry local authority did not provide sufficient money for their own committee of agriculture.  With the provisions now proposed in this amending Bill, they should be in a position, if not next year, during the following few years to get themselves out of the red.</P>
    <P>This is an interim measure and I hope that it is the precursor of a new and better farm development service.  I do not think that it is necessary for me to dwell upon each county, one after the other.  There are certain discrepancies. Senator Reynolds mentioned County Leitrim.  They are in the happy position of being almost, if not quite, solvent. Leitrim is a very difficult county with a very difficult soil and agriculturally it is difficult to evolve an agricultural programme for it.</P>
    <P>The new ceiling of 15p, advocated in the amendment that I propose, should be sufficient for the purposes that we require and I recommend it to the House.</P>

This is merely an interim measure and the provisions of it would certainly appear to be adequate, even for the extreme cases that I have mentioned.

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1971    (Certified Money Bill)    :Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of Senators.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm five orders made during 1970, under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, and the Finance Act, 1962.  It is a statutory requirement that such orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made, if they are not to cease to have statutory effect.</P>
      <P>The first of these orders, No. 184, was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Ministers for Finance.  It provided for an increase in the excise duty on Irish wines and a reduction in the customs duty on still wines in bottle of United Kingdom origin.  The effect of this was to make a fifth 10 per cent reduction in the protective differential between the customs duties on wines of United Kingdom origin and the excise duty on Irish wines, in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second order, No. 185, was also made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  It provided for the fifth tariff reduction on goods of United Kingdom origin in accordance with the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  In addition, the order provided for the maintenance of the special tariff concessions in favour of certain goods of Northern Ireland origin.  The order also provided for the reduction of duties on certain yarns and certain knitted or crocheted fabrics in accordance with recommendations made by the Committee <Col N="1602" /> on De-Pyramiding of Tariff Protection, and made a number of minor changes in the customs tariff. The new rates of duty brought into effect by this order are, of course, those which appear in the standard <i>Customs and Excise Tariff of Ireland</i> with which Senators are familiar.</P>
    <P>The third order, No. 186, provided for the imposition of a customs duty at rates of 40 per cent&mdash;full, preferential and special preferential&mdash;and 13.3 per cent (United Kingdom) on certain mobile home type caravans which inadvertently incurred a loss of protection as a result of the change over to the Brussels nomenclature form of customs tariff.</P>
    <P>The fourth order, No. 187, was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  The order was necessary because of the changover to decimal currency on 15th February, 1971, and it provides for the conversion to decimal form of all references to £ s. d. amounts in the tariff.</P>
    <P>The fifth order, No. 188, provided for a reduction of 10 per cent in the <i>ad valorem</i> rate of duty and certain reductions in the specific rates of duty on watches of non-United Kingdom origin, with effect from 1st January, 1971.  The Swiss watch industry had made representations about the high rate of duty on their products and it was decided to grant these reductions in duty.</P>
    <P>In deciding to grant this concession, the Government took into consideration the considerable contribution which the Swiss watch industry had made to the establishment of the Swiss/Irish Horological Institute in Ireland and that the Swiss are continuing to make a substantial contribution to the Institute, which trains workers for the watch industry.  The Irish watch assemblers were consulted and they did not oppose the granting of the concession.  Because of our international obligations the reduction of the duty had to be extended to watches of other countries.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to give any further information required in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple Bill, as the Minister has said.  It is a statutory enactment to confirm the imposition of <Col N="1603" /> certain duties which must be done before the end of the calendar year following the year in which the orders were made. Two of the orders do not greatly concern us.  Order No. 186 arises because of a change to Brussels nomenclature form, and Order No. 187 is due to the changeover to decimal currency.</P>
      <P>The other orders deserve some consideration, particularly in the light of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and its effects on employment in this country during recent years.  When the Minister comes to this or the other House for confirmation orders of this type, both Houses would welcome more information on the implications of the orders.  The examples before us may not be particularly good ones.  I have no idea of the amount of employment involved or what the effects will be of further reductions in the protective tariffs. Generally, the question of tariff reductions in the context of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is one which deeply concerns every public representative and all the information the Minister can give will be welcomed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The orders before us are minor ones and a strong case has been made in connection with the reduction of the duty on Swiss watches.  I should not like to think that because a country is making a contribution to some institution in this country it would necessarily warrant a reduction in tariffs.  I note that the industry concerned in this country has raised no objections and for that reason we can accept that the 10 per cent reduction will not have any adverse effects.</P>
      <P>Too much recourse to unilateral action in strict accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement has been made by the Government and not sufficient concern with the sections of the trade agreement which provide for a lessening in the tempo of reductions where vital and sensitive sections of Irish industry are concerned.  I have in mind industries such as wool textiles, clothing and footwear. They are examples where serious unemployment has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, I think in the Dáil, that industries such as these suffer from <Col N="1604" /> cyclical depressions in any event and are subject to variations due to changes in public taste and, for one reason or another, depressions possibly in other countries.  I think that where such industries are concerned it is not sufficient to say that this is something over which we have no control.  Reducing tariffs in line with trade agreements such as the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, in circumstances far different than those that existed at the time the trade agreement was signed, is something, I think, which should be opposed by Senators and, indeed, by Deputies in the other House.  I feel that we are, to some extent, accepting as inevitable the fact that tariffs must come down and therefore there is nothing we can do about it.  When the present trade agreement was under negotiation, some two or three years ago now, the conditions&mdash;as I think the Minister will agree&mdash;were very much different in a number of instances to what they are today.  But we still appear to continue the same tempo of tariff reductions and the dismantling of industrial protection built up over a number of years, as a matter of national policy, by successive Governments as if there had been no change at all in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is quite wrong and I think it is something the Minister and the Government would want to consider very seriously.  After all, there is provision in the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement for slowing down the rate of reduction of tariffs.  I am not aware of any instances where that clause has been invoked.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten the House if, in fact, this has happened.  I would like to mention again to the Minister that in the rapidly changing conditions we are experiencing today, it is difficult to rely completely on the wording of an agreement made, as I have said already, in far different conditions.  I do not wish to suggest that a Minister or a civil servant or, in fact, any public representative for that matter, can be a prophet but I think that in an era such as this, of quick change and savage competition, that every possible effort should be made when trade agreements such as the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area <Col N="1605" /> Agreement are being negotiated, to provide for any eventuality&mdash;particularly in the type of industry which, as the Minister himself has stated, is subject to cycles of change every so often.  I think the Minister did say when he was speaking in the other House that it was over a decade since there had been a depression in the wool textile and clothing industry.  Well, we now have a depression in that industry, and I suggest to the Minister that he and the Government should look very carefully at any further dismantling of protection in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that these cycles do upswing again, and it is quite likely that in a year or two the conditions which we are experiencing today, and which have caused a very serious depression and the closing down of some textile and clothing industries in this country, may change again.  I am saying that because, with some experience of that trade, I know, that it is a cyclical trade and that these things can happen.  But if it does happen, I think we should assume it is going to happen and take the necessary steps to ensure that in the period of trough there will not be any serious unemployment or redundancies, in so far as the Government can ensure that.  Obviously, the Government cannot do everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that.  Senator Mullins prompts me to say that I made it quite clear that these cycles in the wool textile and clothing industries are international.  They come to every country at some time.  But I suggest that since we have had this depression over the last two or three years, now is the wrong time to have a reduction in tariffs and, incidentally&mdash; although it does not arise under this Bill&mdash;an increase in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister comes to the House in circumstances such as these&mdash; and again I do not want to be specific about the order before us, he should tell the House exactly what is involved, the number of people involved in the industry concerned, the number of redundancies that may arise as a result <Col N="1606" /> of the reduction in protection and, on the brighter side, and taking the longer term, what opportunities will be offered as a result of nationalisation and the preparation for free trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Government's job, I suggest.  If there is no way of avoiding the Government's commitments&mdash;such commitments have been made under the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;the Minister should say clearly what redundancies will be involved and what steps the Government are taking to provide alternative employment.  In other words, I do not believe, although Senator Mullins might think I am trying to give that impression, that the Govern ment or any Government has a magic wand.  These things happen in trade and business, but I think we are now living in an era where Governments in every country have accepted the responsibility for full employment.  They just cannot pass the buck any more; those days are gone.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think there is an obligation on the Ministers concerned to come in and say: &ldquo;Look, we are dismantling tariffs in this particular industry.  We can't do anything about it.  We have entered into a trade agreement, but in lieu of that industry we have made arrangements for the establishment of another industry in the area and the retraining of workers to take up the unemployment that will arise.&rdquo;  I do not think it is too farfetched to say that, and I think it is the policy that should be adopted.  As an aside let me say this: this is the policy that has been adopted in certain instances, but not in all instances.  We must face the fact that we are entering an era of free trade, whether we like it or not.  Nevertheless, the policy of industrial Sinn Féin should still apply, and it should be clearly demonstrated to our people that free trade does not mean free-for-all trade when the big and the strong prosper and the weak go under through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that free trade offers great opportunities to <Col N="1607" /> our industrialists and farmers in the long term.  In the short term it can hurt a lot of innocent people, if proper and adequate, if temporary, steps are not taken to protect them.  In future, therefore, I hope that Ministers concerned will deal fully with the implications of any of these tariff reductions and not come before us with what I may describe as Civil Service-type jargon that could hide a lot of human suffering and cloak considerable disruption in a particular trade or industry.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I accept the necessity for the Bill; all I am asking, as one public representative, one Member of the Senate, is that Ministers coming to this House deal quite freely and frankly with us and give us in layman's language the full implications of the changes which these orders are intended to bring about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make the point that, as I understand it, in enacting this Bill the Oireachtas will not be doing something which will effect any factual economic fiscal change now.  As I understand the position, that economic fiscal change has already been effected.  It is effected in respect of the fifth year, which ended, I think, in June of 1970; and the five orders mentioned by the Minister, whch are the subject of confirmation of this Bill, were made presumably subsequent to that date, some time between the end of June and the end of December.  Some of them, I think, may have been made as early as July, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we would in many another measure, we do not have to consider without being able to get informed, what is to be the consequence of the legislation, because the Minister must now have some information as to the effect on employment, output and imports of the fifth reduction in the protection referred to in the second order, No. 185.  He must also have an idea as to the effect on the Irish wine trade&mdash;and, surprisingly, there is a good deal of Irish wine being made&mdash;of the elimination of the differential between the excise duty and the customs duty on wines of United Kingdom origin. <Col N="1608" /> There must be some information as to whether this has affected production in that industry, whether it has led to an increase in imports or has had any effect on the prices of these products of our industry or the employment given by it.</P>
    <P>With regard to mobile home type caravans, I would be interested to know when the changeover to the Brussels nomenclature form was effected and how long the industry concerned was without the protection which had hitherto been given to it.  What was the experience of the industry during that period of time?</P>
    <P>With regard to the fourth order, I am curious as to the necessity for it.  I thought we had debated in the House&mdash; I have not an exact recollection of the title of the Bill: it may have been the Decimal Currency Act of 1970 or 1971 but it came into effect in February, 1971&mdash;a provision for an automatic conversion of shillings and pence in all statutory instruments and that there would not have been any necessity for an order of this type.  If there was a necessity for such an order in relation to customs duty I would divine that there is a necessity for similar orders in relation to various other duties.  For example, what is the position of the Stamps Act?&mdash;is it necessary to make an amendment whereby there is conversion or does automatic conversion take place as an effect of the Decimal Currency Act of 1970 or 1971?</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in the rate of duty on watches of non-United Kingdom origin.  I am glad the Minister has informed both Houses of the contribution made by the Swiss watch industry in developing Irish skills in the matter of watch-making.  The Minister mentioned in the Dáil that the contribution of the industry to the Horological Institute was of the order of £10,000 a year and the institute carry on their good work of training Irish boys in this new skill in co-operation with the technical schools. The House would probably welcome a little more information in regard to this.  Are there separate premises occupied by the institute?  What is the sort of relationship between them and the technical schools?  Do the institute collaborate with one or more technical <Col N="1609" /> schools, or is it the vocational committee for the city?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the House has accepted that this Bill is necessary to put the various orders made during the course of 1970 in order as is statutorily required.  I was upset by Senator Russell's reference that information supplied to the House in relation to those orders was not as properly presented as he would have wished in so far as he indicated that it was not outlined in layman's language.  As I stated in my introductory remarks, an Explanatory Memorandum has been circulated in which the Bill is fully explained.  I do not think it would be possible to outline in any greater detail for the benefit of the House the basic information contained in the Bill. He said he felt that in presenting the Bill to the House I should be in a position to give an account of the overall effects of the orders.  I hope he appreciated that orders Nos. 186 and 187 were not extremely serious and did not merit his comment.</P>
      <P>Order No. 185, relating to the straightforward 10 per cent reduction in tariffs on goods imported from Britain, is something that affects a very wide range of industries here.  For me to attempt to outline the various industries that might be affected as a result of that order would involve me in covering the full employment range of all our industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell went on to say that since the completion of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement there never had been any moves to create standstills in respect of any of the reductions.  In this regard I must remind him that in relation to Article 19 of that agreement arrangements were made very early in 1967 to protect the tyre industry in so far as Article 19 was used to create a quota situation to give protection to Irish Dunlop against the importation of tyres in a period of 18 months.  As was announced immediately previous to 1st July this year arising from the review which took place, starting on 1st July, 1970, and which was completed in April of this year, there were discussions with the British <Col N="1610" /> representatives.  As a result, the tariff reductions that were due to take place on 1st July of this year were not made in relation to quite a number of articles.  I outlined these in the Dáil.  They covered certain iron and steel products, agricultural machinery, certain domestic electrical appliances, aluminium hollow ware, blankets, mobile homes, joinery.</P>
    <P>The Senator made reference to the footwear industry.  I indicated at that time that in relation to the leather footwear industry there had been a standstill in the reduction of the importation of leather footwear until such time as a review had been conducted of the footwear industry and a report on this review was available.</P>
    <P>This is the situation: there has not been from the 1st July, 1971, any reduction in duties on the items mentioned or on leather footwear.  In addition to that, there were reduced reductions applied in relation to furniture, ropes, cordage and twine, brushes and brooms.  All of those stand still, or reduced rates of duty were all effected arising from a review which took place during the course of the year commencing 1st July, 1970.  These arrangements have been come to by way of interim measures because the discussions have not been finalised.</P>
    <P>I can indicate to the House that discussions are still going on arising from that review aimed at endeavouring to protect some of the industries that are and have become effected by the reductions of protective tariffs that have taken place under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald went through the various orders made and asked if I could give any indication of the effects of the order reducing the duty on wine.  Arising from that reduction of duty we have no evidence that the change in the excise duty has created any difficulties for the Irish wine trade.  The Senator indicated when speaking that the volume of business was not extraordinarily high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, it has. <Col N="1611" /> That particular increase has been maintained and this order has not affected it to any extent.  I dealt with the overall effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the effects of the further fifth-round reductions. The discussions which we had prior to July of this year resulted in the standstill on certain reductions.  I am talking about the sixth round of reductions which took place on 1st July of this year.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Russell's remarks, I can say that world depression in the overall textile industry, which also affects us, is also the subject of discussions on Anglo-Irish free trade at the present time and is one of the matters which is being dealt with.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald mentioned Order No. 186 on mobile homes.  The situation there is that it was a considerable time before it was discovered that the particular mobile homes covered under this order were not covered arising from the changeover that took place under the Brussels nomenclature of customs classification. I would love to be able to deal with the Brussels nomenclature in simpler language, but this is the customs term and in the changeover to this nomenclature mobile homes were omitted.  It was discovered that there was an escape clause for the importation of mobile homes and it was necessary to make this order to capture them.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald said he understood that the arrangements made in relation to the changeover to decimal currency would have been such that it would have obviated the necessity for making this order.  As I indicated, this order was made on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  It is quite obvious that it was felt there was the necessity to have the £ s. d. rates changed over to the decimal form.  Straightforward departmental advice on this order was necessary so as to cover it.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to the last of the orders&mdash;Order No. 188&mdash;providing for the reduction in the rate of duty on watches.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald said he would like to have more information in relation to the Horological Institute. I indicated to the Dáil that my estimate of the overall benefit the Swiss watch industry had been to the Horological Institute, through the Department of Education, could roughly be assessed at somewhere about £70,000.  The Senator was anxious to know what the present arrangement is.  There is an arrangement whereby the Horological Institute provides a two-and-a-half year course for young trainees in watch assembly and watch repair.  At the present time the Swiss contribute two-thirds of the cost of this training.  I understand that the director of the institute, who was seconded from Switzerland in 1964, is still at the institute and imparting his knowledge to the students.  It was a six-year arrangement which began in 1964 and should have terminated last year, but the Swiss have co-operated in allowing the director to remain on in the Horological Institute.</P>
      <P>The scheme is operated by the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee. It is estimated that the overall cost of maintaining this scheme is in the region of £10,000, to which the Swiss are at present contributing two-thirds. The benefits that accrue to the pupils and the availability of those skilled graduates after training to the watch assemblers and repairers here should be recognised by me.  It was because of this that I arranged for the reduction of ten per cent in duty which was conceded last year.  I think that covers most of the points which were raised by Senators in their contributions to the debate.</P>

      <P>I have a single question for clarification.  I was not clear whether the Minister said that orders have been made in this year which must be confirmed and enacted before the end of next year.  Have orders actually been made in respect of the year ended 30th June, 1971?  If they have not and if orders are made in, say, January, does that mean that we will be confirming orders in respect of the year ended 30th June, 1971, in December, 1973?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This could be.  The position is that any orders that are made during the course of this year, 1971, will be confirmed during 1972.  They need not necessarily be coming before us in December of 1972.  Invariably, the object is to try to have the Confirmation of Orders Bill coming sooner.  I should have been able to bring this Confirmation of Orders Bill to the Seanad before the Summer Recess, but various difficulties arose.  Each year there is a Confirmation of Orders Bill.  Invariably, we have one order anyway, that is, the confirmation of the further reduction of ten per cent annually from the operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>

      <P>In reply to the question asked by Senator West, I should like to say that I have some limited information here and I think it is proper to refer to it on the Schedule.  One of the reasons why this order had to be made to cover mobile homes was that &ldquo;mobile home&rdquo; as such was not covered by &ldquo;caravans&rdquo;.  The Senator asked if I had any idea of the production here and for a comparison with imports. Virtually all caravans, including mobile homes, which are imported are from Britain or the Six Counties.  For instance, in 1969 and 1970 only one caravan was imported from sources other than United Kingdom sources. The imports of caravans, which cover mobile homes, in 1969 and 1970 were: 1969, 64; and 1970, 163.  The corresponding values in those cases were: for the 64 caravans in 1969, £11,028 and for the 163 in 1970, £30,391.  That information may possibly answer the question asked by the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to facilitate the amalgamation of co-operative dairy societies, commonly known as creameries.  The amendment was proposed by my colleague, the <Col N="1615" /> Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and I am sponsoring it as I am responsible for the administration of the relevant Acts.</P>
      <P>The existing law tends to hinder amalgamations and I feel the time has come to amend it in order to simplify the process of amalgamation.  This is necessary because the rationalisation and diversification of the creamery and milk processing industry is regarded by the Government as an essential and urgent aim of agricultural policy.  This was indicated in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has indicated that relatively few amalgamations of co-operative dairy societies have taken place over the past few years.  Progress towards the rationalisation of the creamery industry has been much slower than had been hoped for.  With the prospect of early accession to the European Economic Community, it is necessary that progress be expedited and it is expected that the proposed amendment will achieve this.</P>
      <P>I should explain that co-operative dairy societies are industrial and provident societies, that is, societies which are registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893.  Section 53 of that Act provides that two or more societies may amalgamate but only if each society passes a special resolution. Section 51 Paragraph (a) of that Act provides that a special resolution must be passed at a general meeting by not less than three-fourths of the members who vote, and paragraph (b) of the same section provides that the resolution must be confirmed at a subsequent general meeting by a majority of the members voting.  Voting in either case may be in person or by proxy.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is specifically to amend section 51 (a) of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893 to facilitate the passing of a special resolution for the amalgamation of co-operative dairy societies by a simple majority instead of by a mimimum three-fourths majority as at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has stated that the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Limited and other farming organisations had <Col N="1616" /> emphasised to him that the passing of a resolution for amalgamation by the required minimum three-fourths majority had proved a serious factor in delaying the amalgamation of co-operative dairy societies and in the rationalisation of the creamery industry.  These organisations support the proposed change to a simple majority requirement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has told me that he accepts that the arguments made by the farming organisations are valid.  He himself is aware of many instances where resolutions for amalgamation have been supported by a substantial majority of members at meetings.  They have, however, not been passed because they did not get the required three-fourths majority.  These instances have occurred particularly in Kilkenny and in the Golden Vale area of County Limerick and north Cork.  It would be only in a few cases that all members of a co-operative dairy society would derive their living solely or mainly from farming.  Consequently, in some cases it is a relatively easy matter to secure 25 per cent support, on various personal grounds, to oppose an amalgamation resolution.  The result is that the real economic interests of the majority of members of such societies are not being realised.  Further, agricultural development in accordance with the Government policy is being impeded.</P>
    <P>I believe that amalgamations are desirable so that greater resources, both financial and other, would be available to the enlarged societies.  This would enable them to achieve their aims more readily, and would be in the interests of the members and of the farming community generally.</P>
    <P>I therefore agree fully with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that, so far as co-operative dairy societies are concerned, it is urgently necessary that section 51 (a) of the Act of 1893 should be amended to enable a resolution for amalgamation to be passed by a simple majority.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it quite clear that the proposed amendment will not change, in any way whatever, the present requirement for a confirmatory resolution as set out in paragraph (b) of section 51 of the Act, and it will not <Col N="1617" /> affect any other matters which, under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, require the passing of a special resolution.  For example, the amalgamation of registered societies, other than co-operative dairy societies, would still require the passing of a special resolution by a minimum three-fourths majority.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to mention that this Bill passed all Stages recently in Dáil Éireann without adverse comment or opposition.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about time someone made an adverse comment.  I appreciate the economic reasons behind this measure.  With some diffidence I approve of the idea behind the change, but to have under the Act two different types of special resolution is an extraordinarily bad step to take.  We are going to amend section 51 and we are going to give &ldquo;for particular purposes&rdquo; a special meaning to a special resolution under that section, while the words &ldquo;special resolution&rdquo; are going to have an entirely different meaning, even under that section, for other purposes.</P>
      <P>It is expecting too much of the ordinary lawyer, let alone the secretary of such a society or co-operative, to be able to differentiate between these meanings readily and easily.  There is a tendency elsewhere for the law relative to industrial and provident societies to become assimilated to a degree&mdash;having regard to the different functions of the two Acts they are to serve&mdash;to company law where a special resolution has a completely different definition to the definition it at present has in section 51 or to the definition it will have in relation to dairy societies after this amendment.  This would be to make the law much too difficult and much too complicated for people to understand. What is needed in relation to this is a special section dealing with the type of institution the Minister has in mind to facilitate amalgamations where it is an ordinary resolution without confirmation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would want to go a little further and to make an amendment.  If the Minister will direct his attention to the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, <Col N="1618" /> 1893, he will find that it is open to a society or to the promoters of the society, when its rules are being drafted, to determine the mode of holding meetings and the scale and right of voting.  There should be a protective provision in this section preventing such a society having rules which could give, for example, more than one vote to some person or to different categories of people.  This would be a necessary protection if we are to have an amalgamation carried by, what is in effect, an ordinary resolution.  I strongly recommend my remarks to the House for their consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>As a creamery manager and a member of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association.  I welcome this Bill.  It has often been stated in public that our association is against amalgamation and I am glad of the opportunity to deny those allegations.  We, as managers, will carry out our duties and decisions&mdash;carried at the annual general meetings of our societies, at monthly estimate meetings and at any other meeting called by shareholders of our societies&mdash;to the fullest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Creamery managers know better than anyone the difficulty of getting 75 per cent majority vote in favour of anything. They would find it more difficult to get a majority in favour of amalgamation of societies. The decision to amalgamate one society with another is a very hard one to make.  People who have been voted as members of one society feel they should remain loyal to that society.  They, therefore, find it difficult to make the decision to vote for amalgamation with another society.  It is much easier to get a 25 per cent vote in favour of retaining the <i>status quo.</i> However, I believe that amalgamations must come.  They will come quickly and this Bill will help to speed up the matter. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the Government or the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are in earnest. Ninety per cent of the shareholders of a society in County Tipperary recently voted to amalgamate with another larger one.  This decision was not allowed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I do not know <Col N="1619" /> the reason for that, nor do the people of that society understand it.  This proves that the Government are not really in earnest.</P>
    <P>This is merely a Bill to please farming organisations.  We shall pass the Bill and leave it at that.  Even though a society may wish to amalgamate with another if the Government are not satisfied with the amalgamation, they will prevent it.</P>
    <P>This should not be allowed to happen, and this Bill appears to prevent it.</P>
    <P>On our entry into the EEC we should have an active and progressive dairying industry.  The only way to secure this is to have large creameries, to have costings as low as possible and to have an active sales programme.  This cannot happen with the type of set-up we have. Our societies are not large enough to compete with the type of organisations that will be in existence in the enlarged Community of the EEC.  We are a small State and the type of set-up we have is all right up to a point.  With the advent of amalgamations we shall need changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying before the suspension of business, this Bill is to encourage the amalgamation of creameries, which is a good thing, but we must be prepared for this amalgamation.  The factories where cheese, butter, full cream powder and chocolate crumb casing are produced must know in advance the quantity of milk available.  The best way to obtain this knowledge is to have as many suppliers as possible in a unit.</P>
      <P>Forecasting of supplies of milk must be carried out by creameries so that the development of the factories attached to those creameries can take place. Proper development cannot be carried out without this knowledge.  The farmers must have a much wider area than at present.  Diversification to and from skim powder and butter, to cheese, chocolate crumb casing and so on will be necessary so that the members of a creamery society will be guaranteed the maximum price for the milk supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater quality control is also necessary <Col N="1620" /> and this is best done by having an efficient advisory service.  Small creameries could come together and set up a service such as this.  Earlier I mentioned an amalgamation which did not take place, although the voting was 90 per cent in favour.  This could happen again and the position within the industry would remain static or would be little changed by the introduction of this Bill.  Membership of the EEC allows dairy producers to sell their milk wherever they choose.  I appeal to the Minister to allow the development taking place in Kilross to succeed.  That is the first time I have mentioned the society in case the Minister would not know to what area I was referring. I believe the Minister is interested in amalgamations, and this amalgamation must take place.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of the amalgamation of the creameries in Kerry or Clare or in certain areas of Cork and Tipperary.  There are many small branch creameries in Kerry and Clare which should be amalgamated.  When we see this taking place we will believe the Government are sincere.  Efficiency and the price of milk will be a deciding factor in this amalgamation.  I welcome this Bill and hope the Government realise what it involves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  Senator Butler mentioned Kilross creamery.  It is well known that this creamery are anxious to join the Mitchelstown group of creameries. Kilross is within three miles of Tipperary town where there is another central creamery.  Some time ago the IAOS and the Department of Agriculture drew up areas in which amalgamation could take place and Kilross happens to be in the Tipperary area. That is why Kilross cannot join with the Mitchelstown group, even though they supply Mitchelstown with milk during the year and Mitchelstown manufacture their butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area there are numerous small co-operative creameries who are not able to carry on alone, yet when their shareholders are asked to amalgamate with a neighbouring co-operative, they cannot get a three-fourths majority in favour.  Only neighbouring creameries <Col N="1621" /> or creameries within the group should be allowed to amalgamate.  Mitchelstown is a great concern, but it is large enough.  We in Tipperary have a wonderful opportunity, as we have more milk in the catchment area than they have in the Mitchelstown area and we should keep Kilross creamery.</P>
    <P>It is time to change the law whereby a three-fourths majority was needed to amalgamate.  With our entry into the Common Market there is not place for the small co-operative society.  There should be at least 20 big co-operatives spread over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, too.  The proposed change in section 51 of the 1893 Bill will certainly make it much easier for the members of the co-operatives to decide to amalgamate with a neighbouring or some other creamery, I was interested in the idea the last speaker expressed relative to a creamery in his area.  I really think that the members of any co-operative not only should have the power, as under this Bill, to amalgamate but should be able to amalgamate with whom they like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that different creameries are able to pay or can afford to pay different prices, and the members of a co-operative should be able to opt to join the best possible partner they can find in the Republic.  This is very important.  I suppose there is something to be said also for zoning and regionalisation. Nevertheless, I feel that the farmers are entitled to vote themselves into the best possible combine there is. I do not agree entirely with the idea of having just a limited number of powerful creameries or co-operatives. The organisations that have grown perform quite an amount of useful work, but the original doctrines and theories of Sir Horace Plunkett and others whereby the members of the co-operatives were the greater beneficiaries from this type of co-operation seem to have been lost sight of.  I feel that the profit margin of too many of these large co-operatives represent a very small percentage net profit.  Having regard to the prices being charged in these places that are supposed to be non-profit making, the individual member <Col N="1622" /> has very little to gain monetarily from them.</P>
    <P>The IAOS, who have a very fine structure, seem to me to be either indolent or very inefficient.  They have never made their mark on the co-operative scene in this country.  Perhaps they work too quietly and do not get credit for their work.  I consider a body of men and an organisation with the structure that the IAOS has should be able to lay a more definite pattern on co-operation in the country.  I know definitely that they have been actively engaged in the rationalisation of this industry and, indeed, in many other matters.  Nevertheless, there must surely be a better and more dynamic role for the IAOS to play.  I think they have underplayed their part and I should like to see them coming out more forcefully.</P>
    <P>If I may, I should like to offer some criticism on the tendencies of co-operatives in the past to go into the retail lines.  They appear to compete only with the retail organisation, in our towns and villages.  All these co-operatives have a tremendous amount of capital involved, and I would prefer to see them encouraging the true spirit of co-operation, and, through co-operation, providing a service for their members on the lines, perhaps, of farm machinery pools and this kind of service which nobody else can afford to give or which nobody else has got round to performing.  This Bill will facilitate that approach and enable many more co-operatives to grow stronger by the process of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I would regard this as being something one would anticipate from the formation of stronger units.  To me, the philosophy of co-operation, as far as the farming community is concerned is something that is bandied about a lot. Many people say that farmers should co-operate, but they do not speak in those terms of any other section of the community.  If is often held up as a cure for many of our aliments, and I feel that sufficient is not being done in this respect.  I think it is very desirable that we should tackle this problem, once and for all, and consider in a very detached and calculated manner the possibilities there are for Irish agriculture through the co-operative system.  Indeed, I was <Col N="1623" /> very glad to note the pilot projects undertaken this year and last year by the Land Commission in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just going to suggest that the creameries should foster more of these co-operatives. However, I have made that point and I am prepared to leave it at that.  Nevertheless, now that a simple majority of members of the creameries will be able, more or less, to control their own destiny it is desirable that this be done. However, I think the dairy industry needs a little more freedom and a little more flexibility.  By virtue of the fact that there is such a discrepancy in the price for milk paid to the farmers by one creamery compared with another, the Government should go that little bit further and enable the creameries to join or amalgamate with whatever societies they prefer.  The whole industry should be looked at from the point of view of profitability.  There are very few of the creameries closed down in the winter time and this has a detrimental effect. We should consider this problem.</P>

      <P>The Bill has great merit, but I was a little perturbed when I heard the references to the Dairy Disposal Company.  The Dairy Disposal Company was started by the Government at a time when the dairy industry was practically stagnant.  The Government decided, in their wisdom, to bring into being the Dairy Disposal Board.  Kerry and Clare, I would say, are probably the two counties that benefited most from it because at that time milk, and the various products from milk, were outside the scope of any type of industrial development.  It was a social scheme to give the farmers a sense of belonging to the community.  In my own county there is quite a wide diversion of opinion as to whether the co-operatives or the Dairy Disposal Board creameries are the best. The Dairy Disposal Board creameries have played a very important part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Senator for a moment.  Senator Mc-Donald's reference to the Dairy Disposal Company was on the question of whether it should be amalgamated with other creameries or not.  I do not think that justifies a general discussion of the whole question of the Dairies Disposal Company under this Bill, which deals strictly with amalgamations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that under the Bill it is suggested that the Dairy Disposal Company would merge with co-operatives.  I think the Dairy Disposal Company has played a very important part in the western side of the country.  It has been responsible to a great degree for bringing the farmers off their knees and making them into a productive unit.  The point I wished to make was that the final choice should be with the farmers themselves.  Everybody knows the advantages of the Dairy Disposal Company.  It will take a lot of persuasion to convince them they will have these advantages in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can welcome what is in this Bill.  As the Minister has stated it is to further the Government's policy of rationalisation in the dairy industry.  Consequently, perhaps we would be in order in having a look at whether or not this rationalisation is <Col N="1625" /> desirable.  What is proposed here is to further this in pursuance of Government policy.  Practically all progressive writers and thinkers agree on the necessity for rationalisation.  For one thing, we have only to look at our competitors to see the large units they operate.  By contrast with those units, the largest units we have, like Mitchelstown, Rathluirc, Golden Vale and Lough Egish are very small.  We have to get used to this form of thinking and it is well that at least this unreal obstacle of the three-quarters majority, especially a majority of shareholders without any regard to their stake in the societies, should be removed.  In other words, the man with one cow has as good a say by his vote as the man with 50.  The man making his livelihood from 20 cows has the same vote as the man with one or two as a sideline and depending on some other business.  The Government should do much more than merely change the percentage here to give the lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse what many speakers have said about Government policy and rationalisation.  Surely those creameries that are directly controlled by the Government should be the first to be brought into line.  Our view down south of the democracy of those bodies is not in line with what Senator Honan seems to feel.  The suppliers have not been consulted in a proper way.  There is positive Government policy preventing amalgamation in many areas.  In the case of the Coachford group of creameries who for quite a few years wished to amalgamate with the very progressive centre in Ballyclough, obstacles were put in their way.  This 50 per cent provision here will be no use to the Coachford suppliers because their votes do not count when it comes to dealing in this way.  It is taken as being a deal solely between the Dairy Disposals Company and Ballyclough without any real say by the members concerned.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this on a much broader plane.  There should be, as a matter of urgency, a committee set up to look into this, to report on and co-ordinate the work.  The first martyr for rationalisation died this summer when the dairying industry down south lost one of its pillars in the late Dave O'Loughlin who had actually spent <Col N="1626" /> himself endeavouring to promote rationalisation in the Golden Vale group over the past three years.  He paid for it with his life.  The demand had been made many years previously to the Government to change this very unreal rule.  However, better late than never.</P>
    <P>On the other side we see what rationalisation means.  We must face up to it.  It means the closing down by Government policy, as stated here, of the little branch creameries that meant a fair amount in the district.  That has to be compensated for.  Not alone do we want to build big units but at the same time we want to keep our countryside alive.  I suggest that the Government should consider what is the alternative source of employment to be put into those areas when the local branches are closed down or reduced to insignificance. It may be said that small industries can go there.  That is all right if they can. I am suggesting here that the Minister should seek those small industries or this local employment for the ten, 15 or 20 people who mean so much to the parish.  You do need bigger units for processing of dairy products to have all the diversification that is needed, but you also need the machinery pools or the relief worker service to modernise industry.  Anybody looking at it will say that in every parish the potential is there for first-class employment, for a properly organised and directed relief service from the co-operative.  This can be from the centre, but working out to where the present local branches are.  It is an indispensable work force in the development of agriculture in the time ahead.</P>
    <P>That will more than compensate for what Government policy now seems forced, and rightly so, to take away from the parish.  Obviously in this debate we cannot go into all the developments that are necessary, but I am suggesting that the provision of compensatory employment is necessary even if we are only to keep the local parish hurling team going.  I know that will appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The loss of even ten or 15 of those type of creamery jobs is a very serious loss to a parish.  On the other hand, I have said the effort should more than <Col N="1627" /> compensate for that.  As regards machinery pools, there probably is the question as to whether these are better operated from co-ops or from local enterprise.  In many areas local enterprise is doing quite well.  Again that is an area in which the co-ops could do something.  Obviously, they need local stores for the keeping of supplies and so on.  Therefore, I suggest that, if we look at it properly in a developed and co-ordinated way, we would find that, far from denuding the parish still further, rationalisation will leave the parishes and the areas much stronger in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest at this time also that there should be deliberate Government policy to have &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; those suppliers who want to go elsewhere. They should be free to go where they get the best price.  Kilross creamery, about which I know quite a bit, has been mentioned on both sides of the House.  It is ridiculous that the suppliers there, by Government edict, are losing at least 4d. to 6d.&mdash;old money&mdash;a gallon on milk due to the fact that they cannot join Mitchelstown.  On the other hand, their products are taken and sent into Mitchelstown, so what is the difference? The only difference is that there is some type of zoning map that says there will be a big centre in Tipperary some time in the distant future that will rival Mitchelstown.  It is not fair to the struggling farmers on the foot of the Galtees that they should have to &ldquo;live horse and get grass&rdquo; while this new complex in Tipperary takes shape, because there is not a sign of it at the moment.  Therefore it should be: &ldquo;Hands off Kilross&rdquo;.  Indeed the Government have given the green light to the Knocklong suppliers to join with Mitchelstown, so I cannot see why another parish should be treated separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short the quickest way to further rationalisation and development is to let progressive forces develop.  There will be more than enough processing for all when the industry is really <Col N="1628" /> developed to its full potential.  In the meantime let us not penalise the struggling farmer, least of all the struggling farmers on the slopes of the Galtees.</P>
    <P>As regards the 50 per cent voting here I suggest the Minister should have a look at this some time in the future to get some sort of weighting into this. I am not suggesting that a man with 50 cows should have 50 times as many votes or five times as many votes as a man with ten cows, but surely there should be some scale?  There should be some weighting, depending on whether the man is earning his full livelihood from dairying or not.  Example is better than any preaching in this.  The Government should set the example with the Dairy Disposal Company creameries. Senator Honan should realise that these were put up as a holding company merely to ease the transition to co-operatives, and this was to be done over a number of years</P>

This present Bill is one of the few <Col N="1629" /> bits of recommendations from various committees connected with the co-operative movements that the Government have implemented.  There are many many other things to be done and the most pressing of all is to give the IAOS its rightful place at the head of affairs.  It would have to be almost more than a permissive society, it would have to be one that has got real power in the industry, commensurate with the powers enjoyed by similar bodies in Denmark, Holland and elsewhere, where they have taken our ideas and earlier development of the co-operative movement and fashioned it into an indispensable instrument of agricultural marketing.  We have now got to learn from them, and we have to have our say in the development of the co-operative movement.  We have waited a long time since the first co-operative in 1908.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill, and, quite obviously, completely non-contentious. It is one which any sensible person must welcome.  There have however been many contentious matters referred to here.  Unfortunately, as they are irrelevant in discussion on the Bill, I do not feel that I would be justified in replying to them, including Kilross creamery about which many half statements and misstatements have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, in so far as it goes, will undoubtedly help the amalgamation of the creameries.  I believe, however, that it should have gone somewhat further and that, when there was an amendment being made of the principle Act, as we are now going to deal with very much larger business units, there should have been further amendments incorporated in this Bill.  We must realise that a creamery society in the ordinary way is not managed by a board of businessmen who have given their whole lives to business. It is usually managed by a committee of farmers who take things as facts, in particular if they are returned to them as facts.  This is where I feel a further amendment should have been incorporated in this Bill dealing with the audit of the accounts of friendly societies. In a public limited liability company at present only certain types of <Col N="1630" /> auditors with certain qualifications may audit their accounts.</P>
    <P>This does not apply to creamery societies.  Anybody who is called a public auditor may audit their accounts, sometimes with very tragic consequences. I have known a case of a creamery society with a turnover of almost a million pounds a year.  It is a society which should have been progressing very rapidly and nobody could understand why it did not.  The accounts always showed favourably.  Ultimately, after many years, and only when members of the society applied to inspect the books, was the reason discovered. That is another amendment of the Friendly Societies Act which I should like to see.  Even if it is provided in the rules of a friendly society that the books may be inspected by any member, nonetheless, the 1893 Act provides that the books or accounts may not be inspected by any member of the society. The only account that any member of the society may inspect is his own.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if ten members of the society make a complaint to the Registrar of Friendly Societies and if the Registrar suspects that something may be wrong, even at that stage he will do nothing whatsoever unless those people can lodge with him in advance whatever amount he considers an adequate deposit for a special audit of the accounts of the society.  Even if the auditor finds that the books and records of the society have been badly checked and badly audited, there is still no provision, no power in the Registrar, to insist that the society must pay the expenses of that audit.</P>
    <P>In the society to which I have just referred, you will have an idea of what the auditors must have been like when I tell the House that there were no creditor's ledgers kept.  In other words, when it came to auditing the accounts the society might have owed at the particular audit date, £50,000 to creditors, £80,000 to creditors or only £10,000 to creditors.  There was no such thing as a creditors' ledger and apparently the creamery manager had never heard of it. Yet, year after year after year, you had the auditors coming along, certifying the accounts of that society.  It was only thanks to Macra na Feirme and the new <Col N="1631" /> brighter and more progressive type of young farmer that we are getting today that some of those young men suspected something was wrong and after a great fuss insisted that some of them be elected on to the committee; when they were on the committee they insisted on getting in a new auditor and it was only then the complete chaos and difficulty were discovered.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think if you are going to have amalgamation, you are going to have a bigger society, you are going to have a greater turnover of money. Therefore, you are going to have greater losses if things go wrong.  When this Bill was being brought in, making this particular amendment, it should have made other amendments as well. One is in relation to the audit and another is in relation to inspection of the accounts.  Another should provide a right for the society to purchase back its own shares in certain circumstances. A farmer is a member of a creamery society.  He sells his farm, he goes off to live in a city for a time.  He has had some shares in a society.  Those shares stay there.  He is no longer a member, yet he has a right of voting at any meeting of that society and he must be notified of every meeting of that society if the meeting is to be regular.  When a person no longer is making his livelihood, it may be his main livelihood or his substantial livelihood as a farmer in the locality, the creamery society should have a right of purchasing back his shares.  This, for obvious reasons, is not a right which exists with a limited liability company, but I feel that in the interests of creamery societies, having regard to their special circumstances, that it is a power that should be given to them.</P>
    <P>These additional amendments with this would assist not only in the amalgamation but in the success of societies when they amalgamate.  The IAOS was referred to by the Minister in his speech here.  I feel also that the IAOS themselves could do somewhat more than they are doing to help in amalgamation.  I assure the House that I do not intend to be critical of them, I know they do a vast amount of very useful work, sometimes under the most <Col N="1632" /> difficult circumstances.  Any sensible person will realise that a committee of 22 or 24 people managing a friendly society will not manage it to advantage. Their rights, their obligations, their responsibilities become almost anomalous at that stage.  The committee of management of a society like that should be five or seven people, just as on a board of directors, where everybody will have his sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>In these societies where you have 22 or 24 people on a committee, what happens?  It is more a question of honour, or prestige to be on the local creamery committee.  A man's father was there, he helped to found the creamery society, therefore the son feels that it is a matter of prestige for him to be there too.  He might not attend two meetings in the year.  This is the type of man that is managing that society very often, instead of having a small compact responsible board of five or seven people, who could be held responsible and who therefore will be responsible because they will have to act responsibly.</P>
    <P>For the amalgamation of a society outside the purview of this Bill, I would ask the indulgence of the House and of the Minister to refer to it.  I would imagine that if it is to produce all the natural products of milk, butter, cheese, casein, milk powder&mdash;the most economic basis from certain calculations I have made&mdash;and I have some experience of these things&mdash;is if the creamery society or the amalgamated society has an annual intake of milk of not less than about 25 million gallons.  To operate a milk processing station to deal with that volume of milk, to avoid polluting our rivers and our streams, requires the investment of a vast amount of money. In the ordinary course of events&mdash;but again, depending on the quality of the soil&mdash;it would need a site of 200 to 300 acres.  The purchase of the site alone, when you are dealing with a site of that size, is going to cost in modern terms £50,000 to £60,000 before they start to do anything.</P>
    <P>They have got to erect their buildings and put in their machinery.  Those are in the heart of the country.  The only grant they get, and they get no grants for their site, is a 25 per cent grant <Col N="1633" /> which is the minimum given to an industry.  Industries in various parts of the country, particularly export industries, are getting far more and bigger grants than that.  A very high percentage of what a milk processing station of that nature will manufacture is going to be for export.  It is going to be, in so far as manufacturing is concerned, our biggest source of exports.  Therefore, I feel we should encourage amalgamation.  In those societies that are not amalgamated, it would be a very great encouragement if a time limit were put, be it two years, three years, or as the case may be&mdash;certainly not longer than three years and preferably two years&mdash; and if possible a somewhat shorter period and that provision is made for the giving of bigger grants than the present 25 per cent for the erection of buildings and the introduction of machinery for the processing of milk. I think if these bigger grants are limited to a specific period it would expedite considerably those creameries which are still standing on the sideline.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I feel that it will do much to remove an obvious ulcer which is, at the moment, preventing the co-operation so necessary between various creamery societies.  I would like to see the Bill go that little bit further. I would like the Minister to consider what I have said and he may find that there is something in it with which he agrees.  If I have been of any help in my criticism in this regard I shall feel that I have done something for the benefit of our creamery milk suppliers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on this Bill which I welcome.  I think it will give a new impetus to the inevitable amalgamation of co-operative creameries throughout the country.  I should like to sound a note of caution with regard to it.  Senator Honan struck the right note, when he spoke a short time ago in saying, that one great danger in amalgamating the dairy co-operative industry would be to try to rush the matter too much.  In fact, one of the reasons why it has not made as great progress as everybody would have wished is because efforts were made to force the issue at too great a pace.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me <Col N="1634" /> when I say that such things cannot be rushed.  It is quite different in regard to industry but the agricultural industry is somewhat different to a commercial concern.</P>
      <P>Industries usually find it quite easy to amalgamate.  You have the take-over process or the amalgamation of compatible industries.  But it would be a great mistake to apply the system that successfully works in industry to agriculture, because the two industries differ considerably. I have no doubt that amalgamation and nationalisation of the agricultural industry will come in time&mdash; and the sooner it comes the better&mdash;but most Senators appreciate, even Senators such as myself who do not live in rural areas, that there are very serious problems involved.  We have what one might call the mountainy creameries, the small separating stations, in isolated areas where, as Senator Honan quite rightly pointed out, they are the only source of employment.  Some method will have to be found of making good the loss of employment in those isolated country areas.</P>
      <P>Amalgamation offers tremendous advantages. Apart from rationalising production methods, it will assist in the purchase of very expensive equipment, which is becoming more and more expensive as time goes on.  Such advanced equipment must be purchased if the full benefits of rationalisation are to be achieved but it can only be purchased by big units.  I should like to support the Senator who spoke in favour of the Government setting an example with regard to the question of amalgamation and mergers of the various co-operative dairy societies.  I am particularly concerned here because one of the biggest, if not the biggest, co-operative dairying industry in the country is situated in my native city of Limerick.  It was one of the dairying industries taken over at the time the Dairy Disposal Board was set up in the 1920s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Senator Honan and Senator Quinlan are right in what they said, although they approached the problem differently.  Senator Honan was right in saying that the dairying industry in the early 1920s was in a deplorable state. The Government had to step in at that <Col N="1635" /> time to rescue it, but it was the intention that in due time those dairy disposal co-operative creameries would be transferred to groups of farmers.  I think the time for this has now arrived.  However, I see a danger to the Condensed Milk Company in Limerick.  If we are to have mass amalgamations on the perimiter of that company's supply area there is a very real danger that the Lansdowne factory may be isolated and that some of the amalgamations at present taking place, literally on its borders, may encroach on its areas of supply.  That would be a very serious danger to the Limerick factory which is giving very substantial employment and has an export industry which is tremendous value to the Port of Limerick and to the transport agencies in that city generally.</P>
    <P>I would urge the present Minister, or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, if he is to take the initiative now and go ahead with the rationalisation of the Dairy Disposal Company creameries, to take a very close look at the position of the Condensed Milk Company in Limerick.  It must be assured of regular and expanding supplies of milk from its contiguous area, which is a large area. Any form of amalgamation or rationalisation which interferes with that supply will create very grave difficulties for the dairying industry in the Limerick area and for the continuation of employment in Limerick city.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there was no other way of giving an impetus to the amalgamation of co-operative dairy societies except by doing away with the provision that it required a 75 per cent vote to carry an extraordinary or special resolution to this effect.  However, I have some regrets that a well established commercial practice is being departed from in this case.  In saying that, I appreciate that you cannot apply the same standards or the same rules to the agricultural industry as can be applied to commerce and industry.  I am sure the business community would be very slow to depart from the procedure whereby they require a 75 per cent majority to carry a special or extraordinary resolution and they would resist such a departure very strongly.  Obviously, there are special <Col N="1636" /> circumstances in the dairy industry where, as was pointed out, all votes are not equal.  Some departure at this stage was necessary and having regard to the eventual good this will bring to the industry I am prepared to join with other Senators in welcoming it.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute here to a very far-thinking man who recently went to his eternal reward, the late David O'Loughlin, general manager of the Golden Vale Creameries.  He was a farseeing man who built up a tremendous industry in a small country town.  He was a man of vision and a man of enterprise who worked very hard indeed.  It is a pity that the dairying industry has not got more David O'Loughlins to help it on its way.  I am sorry that he did not survive long enough to see this Bill come into effect and to see the impetus it will give to the dairying industry and to farmers generally.</P>
    <P>I do not think there should be any delay in the passing of this Bill in the House.  It has been given a general welcome in both Houses and I, too, welcome it.  I hope it will bring tremendous expansion and greater prosperity to the dairying industry and the agricultural industry generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other Senators who have spoken, I welcome the Bill.  Senator Nash has sounded a cautionary note which we would be well advised to heed.  After amalgamations which the Bill proposes to assist, the situation will be that we will have some extremely large creamery units.  We may well find, as Senator Nash has pointed out, that some of the legislation, which at present deals with the smaller units will be entirely outmoded when it comes to be applied to the very large units which we hope will grow up in Ireland. They are very necessary.  We have only to think of our proposed entry into the European Economic Community to realise the essential nature of large units in our agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Nash has dealt with the problems of audits and the legislation pertaining thereto, as far as friendly societies are concerned.  I should like to ask the Minister and his advisers not just to look at the legislation dealing with one section of the creamery business, <Col N="1637" /> such as the audit.  I should like them to look at all the legislation because there is a danger that the legislation on the Statute Book will prove to be outmoded when it deals with these very much bigger units.  They can have a tremendous amount of power and they will totally change our situation as regards membership of an individual in a creamery society, seeing that the society are so big.  I should like the Minister to look very carefully at the legislation because bigger units will certainly cause problems which we had not to face before. I am in no way against them. Indeed, I am very much for them.  However, I should like the Minister to look at the total legislation concerning the creameries which we hope will grow and develop.</P>
    <P>In common with Senators Quinlan and Russell, I should like to pay tribute to the work of the late Dave O'Loughlin He was a pioneer in building up a society such as we envisage will be built up in more parts of the country when this Bill has been passed.  In a sense Senator Quinlan hit the right note when he said that Dave O'Loughlin was, in some way, a victim of the system.  He found problems in running a very large society inside the present legislation, and the lessons to be learned from his work could well be taken into account by the Minister when he is looking at the problems of drawing up further legislation relating to creamery societies.</P>
    <P>I should also like to support an idea of Senator Quinlan when he spoke about the problems that will arise in some country areas when the smaller units are closed down, as they inevitably will be, as a consequence of amalgamations. There will be a problem and, like Senator Quinlan, I should like to see that the people who find themselves redundant in this situation would be helped to remain in the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of the industry in my vacations in the south&mdash;which are not nearly long enough.  I spent quite some time working in a dairy with 100 cows.  It is a unit that has increased considerably in size.  It deals with one of the creameries which will be coming under the scope of the Bill.  The man who owns this dairy&mdash;or milk parlour, <Col N="1638" /> which is the correct term nowadays&mdash; realises that if he is to compete on a realistic scale in the European Economic Community he will need to double the number of his cows and he will need to more than double his milk output.  As Senator Russell said, the dairying industry is not just the same as any other commercial enterprise.  First, it must be manned day and night.  There are two routines per day and there is a tremendous problem of manning in the dairying industry.  Anybody who works in this industry must not merely be someone who can deal with cows and their particular problems; nowadays he must be a skilled engineer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I should like to explain that I am talking about the relief policy which I hope will come about when the smaller creamery units will be closed, as inevitably they will be after amalgamation. What I am trying to explain is that the people who are working in these small creamery units, which will be closed, could easily be used in relief work in the dairying industry as it now exists.  This could be done if there was some encouragement from the Government. I should like to see the Minister, in conjunction with the Department, looking into this problem of people who will be made redundant when amalgamations occur.  This is important; we do not want to see those people leaving the dairying industry and coming to work in the towns: we want to see them staying in agriculture.  This is one problem that we will have to face.  I am a countryman and I am sure other Senators coming from the country would agree with me that this is a way in which the Minister could keep people in the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly welcome the Bill.  I hope that the points which Senator Nash has made&mdash;and which I have made&mdash;about looking at legislation affecting these societies as a whole will be borne in mind by the Minister.  I welcome the Government's attempt to help amalgamations which will ensure that the <Col N="1639" /> creamery units will be large enough to compete with those in the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald said I had arrived from the Dáil with news that there had not been any criticism there of the Bill, and he opened by saying he would offer criticism.  This opened the door to a very constructive discussion in relation to this amending Bill.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that when dealing with a Bill designed solely to change an Act to allow a co-operative dairy society to amalgamate with a group of others in an easier way, it is difficult for speakers to find ways and means of making a useful contribution without at the same time finding themselves being hauled over the coals for being off the mark.  In my efforts to deal with the observations which have been made I will possibly find myself a bit out of line also.  I do not know how to seek your indulgence in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald spoke of having a second special resolution. The necessity for the amendment to this section of the original Act is so pronounced that I do not expect any complications with regard to the provision of this facility for dairy societies. The Senator cannot have been too serious when he suggested that not alone would it be difficult for the ordinary man to comprehend, but even for a solicitor.  It is a simple amendment and it is specifically applied to dairy societies as such.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators addressed me as if I were the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The effect of this Bill, which is to amend the original Act, is to benefit the dairying industry.  As explained in moving the Second Reading, I was moving on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some useful contributions on the question of rationalisation. It was stressed by Senator Quinlan that there should be a special <Col N="1640" /> committee to look into this rationalisation scheme.  Later on, he pointed out that there had been a number of reports presented relating to the co-operative movement, about which he alleged nothing was being done.  I thought it extraordinary that the Senator should suggest a further committee in view of the fact that we have a rationalisation scheme which both the Department of Agriculture and the IAOS have been endeavouring to sell to the various co-operative societies for a number of years.  It is because of the difficulty encountered in getting across the message to three-quarters of the membership of the various societies that this Bill to amend the original Act is here before this House tonight and the creation of a further committee to look into rationalisation is not called for.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators contributed to the idea that individual societies should be allowed to amalgamate with which ever group they desire, but, while under the terms of my legislation and under the terms of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, the type of amalgamation visualised by the various speakers here this evening is allowable, there is nothing to stop a society in Kerry from amalgamating with a society in Wicklow.  It is obvious that that would be non-productive, but apart from that, while it would be legal under this Bill, there is the necessity for rational amalgamation from the point of view of the Department of Agriculture and the IAOS.</P>
    <P>Senators McDonald, Butler and Quinlan all subscribed to the idea that individual societies should be allowed to amalgamate with societies which at the present time seem to be doing well.  I can visualise that you could finish up with two big overall societies.  I cannot speak with the same authority as the Minister for Agriculture on this subject, but I can imagine there is the one extremely attractive, sizeable co-operative in the Munster area to which possibly every society would want to amalgamate.  The same could happen in the Cavan area, perhaps, with which the people in the north of the country would wish to amalgamate.  If that type of development remained uninhibited, you would finish up with something which would <Col N="1641" /> not be for the overall benefit of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash spoke of the ideal society from the point of view of the through-put of milk and spoke of an overall society, catering for a throughput of 25 million gallons per year.  The rationalisation schemes as presented by the IAOS.  and backed by the Department of Agriculture are very much on those lines.  In the long term, if the type of development which was subscribed to in the contributions made by the three Senators mentioned were allowed to develop, you would have small, individual societies which the big fellow would not want and they would have to sell themselves cheaply or try to buy themselves in cheaply without having the proper representation they should have if the present rationalisation recommended by the Department of Agriculture were acceptable to all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>The IAOS have stated this.  I should like to ask the Minister is it a disadvantage to have suppliers passing one another on the road going from one creamery to another?  That is the position regarding Kilross and Mitchelstown.  I do not propose the amalgamation of creameries in Kilkenny with Mitchelstown.  I had in mind the amalgamation of creameries surrounding the large creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that in mentioning the possible amalgamation of a creamery society in Kerry with one in Wicklow, I was talking about what technically would be possible under the amendment we have here this afternoon <Col N="1642" /> but that would be most irrational from the point of view of a rationalisation programme.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk on this subject.  We have had the Knapp Report and the Cooke-Sprague Report on the rationalisation of the creamery industry and a great deal of talk has gone into the rationalisation programme which is at present, I think, jointly being sponsored and pressed by both the IAOS and the Department of Agriculture. While a Senator may speak to me this afternoon about a situation in his own county of which I am specifically unaware, I know myself as a rural Deputy that most irrational applications are made by parents of schoolchildren seeking school transport to pass one school and go on to another.  Rationalisation of a programme of that nature is not too easy to define on a national basis when one is trying to pinpoint the experiences in a particular local area.</P>
      <P>Let me say that the contribution made by Senator Nash in this regard, in which he joins with all the other speakers who have contributed to this debate, had the effect of welcoming the introduction of this Bill.  I think every Senator did this. Senator Nash, on the other hand, stressed that the Bill did not go far enough.  Then he mentioned two or three experiences or instances in which I as Minister could look at the overall legislation dealing with industrial and provident societies with a view to improving or updating the legislation in this regard and bringing in further amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I should inform the House that it is the intention to make changes in the law relating to co-operative societies in general.  There are, however, a number of items pressing in my Department and this is one of the things I have been looking at for some time and we are having an overall look at the legislation dealing with co-operative societies.  There were points mentioned this evening that certainly appeal to me but I think, as the House will be aware, there was a degree of urgency which demanded that I take this amendment and try to put it to both Houses with a view to having the legislation enacted so that the rationalisation of the dairying industry should not be held <Col N="1643" /> up any longer.  Senator Russell said we should make haste cautiously in this regard.  The reason why this Bill is in the House as late as this evening is because we have been making haste too cautiously as far as the rationalisation of the dairy industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash, certainly had a point with regard to the auditing of various society accounts.  On the other hand, I am afraid I would argue a bit with him on the advisability of making it too cheap for ten members of any society to make application to the Registrar of Friendly Societies to hold a special audit.  If it were too easy to get this type of facility it might be asked for too often.  On the other hand, I appreciate that things may not have been, at co-operative society level, as correct as they should have been.  Nevertheless, and I think Senator Nash himself made this point, we have a new generation of young farmers, a new generation of people who have come on to those co-operative societies, even if they are the sons of the parents who formerly occupied those honoured positions.  With the benefits that have come to the rural areas, arising from association with Macra na Feirme and Macra na Tuaithe, those young farmers are more aware of what is going on than their fathers were before them.  I know that, even though some of these committees are still quite large, they are possibly more productive than those committees were ten, 15, or 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>In addition, Senator Nash suggested that another amendment should be included which might provide for a smaller board rather than the big committees they have at the present time. Nobody would know this better than the Senator himself.  I am sure quite a few of the Senators here will appreciate the fact that to legislate in that way&mdash;we will call it dictatorial way&mdash;to the rural agricultural community, would not be something that would be acceptable.  I have no doubt that at the present time if the committee or the society so decided, they could reduce their numbers and they themselves could see the effective result of such a reduction in numbers and of that committee appointing a board of six to superintend the management of <Col N="1644" /> the society.  I think this is certainly possible within the existing regulations and it is something that will possibly come voluntarily, rather than arising from legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator West suggested we should have another look at the legislation covering co-operative societies.  What I have said in reply to Senator Nash, I would also say to Senator West.</P>
    <P>Senator West, Senator Russell and other Senators mentioned that the closing down, following amalgamation, of the small rural creamery had the effect of creating disemployment in a small area and said this justified the maintaining of a rural creamery.  One of the purposes behind the amalgamation and rationalisation of the dairy industry is to make the project more profitable from the dairy farmer's point of view.  At present the implication is that is has become too expensive to transport milk, to process it and to retransport it for further processing.</P>
    <P>With rationalisation the position would be be that the farmer would be getting a far greater return for the milk produced.  This is one of the reasons why a number of societies want to opt into one creamery group rather than another because the price that applies in one area is that little bit more than the price that applies in another.  This is why there is the anxiety to go like the bee to where the honey is.  I as Minister for Industry and Commerce can take cognisance of the contribution made in an endeavour to encourage small industries to replace the creamery closed down.  On the other hand, Senator McDonald in his contribution drew attention to the duties and responsibilities of co-operative societies. Their duty is not so much to indulge in competition with the local merchant as a retailer but to be genuinely a co-operative society operating on behalf of farmers and providing a service very much on the lines Senator West had in mind.  This would be an agricultural machinery service not alone dealing with agricultural machinery but stocking, holding, lending it and allocating manpower.</P>

      <P>When you have to provide plant and machinery you must have manpower to operate it.  In my personal view our co-operative societies have been a bit negligent from that point of view down through the years.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators spoke about the Dairy Disposal Company and the necessity to hand it back to the farmer. This is strictly a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I know he has repeatedly stressed that the Dairy Disposal Company properties are and would be available for transfer to co-operative ownership at an adequate price in the context of rationalisation. There is no question of the Dairy Disposal Company acting as a deterrent to rationalisation.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, is most anxious that it should be in the forefront of such a development.</P>
      <P>I was more than surprised to find Senator Quinlan suggesting that the big farmer with 100, 60 or 50 cows should have more votes as a member of a co-operative society.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to cover all the points which have been raised as comprehensively as possible. In general, all the contributions made were very constructive.  In relation to legislation dealing with industrial and provident societies as a whole, there is further active examination of this legislation within my Department under a number of different headings.  I can take cognisance of what has been contributed in this debate when this is being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>Could I raise one query arising out of what the Minister has said?</P>

      <P>It is only proper to ask if the matter could not be dealt with on Committee Stage.  The House is slipping into the habit of having a short Committee debate at the end of Second Stage.</P>

      <P>One question could elicit an answer.  The Minister made a statement.  He was referring to the policy that is enshrined in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The policy enshrined in the Bill refers to amalgamation. The Minister said the Government would hand over the Dairy Disposal <Col N="1647" /> Company at an adequate price.  That seems rather strange because when co-operative societies are amalgamated no money passes.  Does the Minister take it as Government policy that money must pass in handing over the Dairy Disposal Company creameries and that this money will pass out of the district?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the benefit of the full co-operative passes.  All of the assets of the members in that society pass into a collective society.  What the Senator is suggesting in this regard is that a State asset be handed over free <i>gratis</i> to some co-operative society?</P>

      <P>The State asset has been accumulated over a long period.  The co-operative societies' assets have been accumulated.  They have both accumulated in the same way. The State is very wrong in following that policy.  It is the policy they have followed in Coachford and elsewhere.</P>
