    <P>SECTION 11 (Resumed)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) That an tÚdarás send annually to the principals of secondary schools such information as may be deemed necessary and should include inter alia the state of overcrowding in the various faculties and the numbers rejected in that year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was put down to enable the principals of secondary schools to have some information as to conditions in the various institutions of higher education, especially overcrowding or lack of overcrowding in the various faculties and disciplines.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly's amendment No. 8 has a somewhat similar intent.  I have left out of it the two words &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; and &ldquo;forecasts&rdquo; which were discussed at length on amendment No. 8.  The Minister did not feel that &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; would be correct and the ability to forecast was not something that he would like to accept.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the words &ldquo;principals of secondary schools&rdquo;.  If this amendment is passed and if it is agreed that the Higher Education Authority should substitute &ldquo;supply of the information&rdquo; that is suggested in this amendment the proper people to send this information to would be the principals of the secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> It is evident to everybody here that the principal of a secondary school may not necessarily be the principal teacher. I am assuming, in this amendment, that when the principals of secondary schools get the information that I am seeking here they will hand it over to the principal teacher of that school.</P>
    <P>The principle behind this amendment is that there should be available through the principals or the principal teachers of secondary schools such information as will enable pupils of secondary schools, and maybe their parents, to have some guidance as to what they should do in the post-secondary years.</P>
    <P>It is true that some pupils will have made up their minds what career they will follow when they leave secondary school, but there will be quite a large number who will not have made up their minds, and either the pupil or their parents will seek guidance from the principal teacher or principal of the secondary school.  The information I suggest, which should be given through the principals down to the principal teacher of secondary schools, should guide them as to which faculty the pupil should enter or, if necessary, guide them to a different institution. Take, for instance, people living in the midlands who find that in Dublin there is overcrowding in the profession they wish to follow.  The Authority could say to them, not necessarily direct them, that another institution of higher education somewhere else in the country may have vacancies.</P>
    <P>A choice of subjects for a pupil has to be determined in the penultimate year.  By penultimate year I mean the fifth and sixth year in a secondary school.  After the fourth year they have to make a decision and drop some subjects because on entering the fifth year they have to determine their course.  In that year information such as I am seeking here, which should be provided to the principals or principal teachers of secondary schools, would be of some advantage.</P>
    <P>Again, I repeat that the pupil or the parents may have to make up their minds as to which course they will follow after leaving the secondary school.  Quite a large number, however, <Col N="1450" /> would like some direction from their teacher.</P>
    <P>I have worded this amendment carefully and have not included the word &ldquo;forecast&rdquo;.  I have only said that information should be given; I do not suggest for a moment that any forecast should be given.  I also included the phrase &ldquo;as may be deemed necessary&rdquo;. In other words, I do not intend that all the information at the disposal of the Higher Education Authority should be given to the principals of the secondary schools, but only that which pertains to the guidance of pupils after leaving secondary schools.</P>
    <P>It appears to me to be a reasonable amendment.  It is asking An tÚdarás to supply some information in a particular year.  It would then be up to the principals or principal teachers of secondary schools to impart that information to the pupils or their parents so that it may be a guide-line as to what subjects they will take up during their last two years at that school and especially what they intend doing when they leave secondary school.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in replying to Senator Kelly's amendment No. 8, mentioned the question of career guidance agencies. I do not think this completely covers the situation.  Career guidance, as I know it, explains what a career really means and what subjects would be necessary for a particular career.  It means that when a pupil has made his decision as to what career he might take up, career guidance will explain to him what it entails; but it does not tell him anything about the availability of places in the institutions of higher education.  The Higher Education Authority, in my opinion, should be the body which would co-ordinate the information that would be available from the institutions of higher education, especially in regard to the placing of pupils in the various institutions or in special faculties in any particular institution.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider this because it is a reasonable amendment and non-contentious.  The relationship between the Higher Education Authority and secondary education would be improved by such liaison. The principals of secondary schools <Col N="1451" /> may wish to discuss from time to time certain aspects of the curriculum in secondary schools with the Higher Education Authority, and by implication this might also apply here.  Because a lot depends upon the trends in education over a period of a few years, overcrowding cannot be forecasted exactly, but certain trends can be forecasted.  Therefore, if the principals of the secondary schools decide to consult the Higher Education Authority, the Authority may be able to give information of value regarding the curriculum for the last two years at school.  I commend this amendment to the House and I hope it will be considered favourably by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I think we have discussed this matter on amendment No. 8, but I should like to ask Senator Belton a question.  Why did he not refer to the other post-primary schools? Why did he refer only to secondary schools and why did he refer only to faculties in our universities?  There are schools of technology, comprehensive schools and post-primary schools. Nobody considers these schools.  The leaving certificate is done in the vocational schools as well as in the secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Senator Ahearne has stated.  I have said the same thing as she has just said.  It may be of advantage to the principals of secondary schools to indicate that there are openings in some fields other than those I have suggested.  It was implicit in this amendment that some pupil's aptitude may be such to render him unsuitable for a university education; his talents may lie somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Uí Eachthéirn is perfectly right in saying that the question of career guidance is equally important for people at junior levels.  The point behind Senator Belton's amendment and my amendment yesterday is that so far as the functions of the Higher Education Authority are concerned&mdash;which, after all, deals only with institutions of higher education; if the Minister in due course designates a college of <Col N="1452" /> technology as such then that would be automatically included&mdash;it would be appropriate for such an Authority to concern itself with the national problem of directing large masses of children into the right sphere or at least preventing them from going into the wrong one in so far as they can.  I do not wish to go over all the arguments which I advanced here yesterday with my own amendment.  All I wish to do is to express the hope that the Minister, having slept on this problem as well as on his other problems, will be more disposed to accept Senator Belton's amendment than he was in regard to mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can agree with many of the things said by Senator Belton here this morning I do not accept that it should be the duty of An tÚdarás.  The point raised by Senator Uí Eachthéirn did strike me in relation to the fact that only principals of secondary schools were mentioned.  However, I am not making any point of that.  I feel that the arguments which I put forward here yesterday against accepting amendment No. 8 apply with perhaps even greater force in the case of this amendment.</P>
      <P>As I have already pointed out, it would be for An tÚdarás, under section 6 to assess the demand and need for higher education.  Assessing need, as I think everybody agreed here yesterday, is a highly sophisticated task.  An tÚdarás will have to rely largely, as I said yesterday, on other agencies connected with manpower forecasting to help them in making their assessments.  Agencies like AnCO will be involved in this, as will my Department, for example, in the matter of forecasting teacher requirements. The demand springs from the number of qualified potential higher education students leaving the post-primary sector. It is inevitable that there will be a central agency for processing applications for entry to institutions of higher education.  I believe that it is an agency of this kind rather than An tÚdarás that would be in a position to inform post-primary schools as to the demand for places on the one hand and in regard to the availability of places on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> I think that another effect of the establishment of such an agency would be that prospective students would not be applying for admission to three or four different institutions.  Last year, for example, we had a position where students were being offered places in more than one institution and in more than one faculty while at the same time the other students were, as a result of this, being needlessly refused places.  Furthermore, I would say that a central agency could channel students into the technological and technical institutes.  It is no secret that the demands for the products of these institutions is very great.  I feel, then, that it would be for the career guidance teachers in the post-primary schools to obtain from this central agency and from other sources information which would help them in offering guidance to the pupils in post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>I did mention yesterday that I was speaking to a member of a university authority who informed me that his college was having discussions this year with guidance teachers from not only the south but also from the north.  I feel that what they are doing as an individual effort could, with very considerable advantage, be done by a combined effort of the various institutions. For all these reasons I feel that the compilation and the dissemination of information of the nature referred to in this amendment would not be a task which should be assigned to an tÚdarás or which, in fact, in my belief they could perform.  Therefore, at I say, while I agree with a lot of what the Senator has said, I have put forward yesterday and today my own suggestion as to the way in which this should be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a few statements which I do not understand. He mentioned about this being a function.  I do not mean it to be a function.  All that is entailed in this amendment is that they would inform the principals of secondary schools in regard to overcrowding in the various faculties and the numbers rejected in that year.  I cannot understand that it would entail any extra work.  Surely the assessing of the conditions and numbers <Col N="1454" /> in institutions of higher education would already be available to them.  All they would have to do would be to send this relevant information to the principals of secondary schools.  It would not entail any extra work and would not entail any forecasting or direction.  My amendment refers only to plain information, and the principals of the schools themselves can seek further information from any source they like after that.  This entails no extra work on the part of an tÚdarás except sending out letters.  That is all it means.</P>
      <P>I fail to see why the Minister does not accept this amendment.  In his reply he envisages the setting up of another type of agency, a central agency, to disseminate information of this nature, including information concerning any institution of higher education or even information at the post-primary level. Are we going to have another agency to do this when we can use the Higher Education Authority for the purpose? If the Minister is going to have another agency to do what is suggested here and what Senator Kelly suggested in amendment No. 8, it is going to cost a lot more money.  I cannot see why we cannot use an tÚdarás to disseminate the information we seek here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat what Senator Belton has said in his closing remarks and to do so with even greater force.  We have been debating this Bill now for something like 12 or 13 hours and, unless I missed something the Minister said momentarily when I was out of the House, this is the first I heard of a new central agency.  I do not remember the Minister saying before&mdash;and I do not mind his contradicting me at once if I am wrong about this&mdash;that we were inevitably to have what he described as a central agency, if I have got him accurately, for processing entries to institutions of higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister realise what he is telling the House now?  Does he envisage a separate central agency for processing, whatever that means, entries to institutions of higher education? Surely the House ought to have been told about this?  This is something quite <Col N="1455" /> different from the Higher Education Authority.  Does he envisage that this is going to be an <i>ad hoc</i> body?  Is he going to introduce legislation to set this thing up?  Is it going to mean that the existing colleges are not going to be able to accept whatever students they like and that their freedom in regard to accepting or rejecting students for particular faculties is going to be curtailed? What does it mean?  I am anxious to press the Minister on this.  I do not think it should be left hanging in the air.  It is a matter of extreme importance to the institutions of higher education and I do not think it would be good enough for them to be told when the thing comes to pass that the Minister adverted to it in this debate in this oblique way on the Committee Stage in reply to an amendment which did not bear on this thing at all.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned so much with the question Senator Belton argued about disseminating information. Senator Belton is perfectly right, and I think the Minister is entirely wrong. I see no reason why An tÚdarás should not pass on, in some simple easily understood form, to the schools and parents the information which it has which would enable them to form a judgment on which way to advise their children.  We have been over that ground and I realise that the Minister's mind is made up and that nothing Senator Belton or I can say will make him change it.  But I would like the Minister to say something more about the new concept which he has introduced here out of a hat within the last five minutes of a central agency for processing entrants to institutions.  Does he envisage that this agency is going to have some controlling force or merely some persuasive force?  Does he envisage that it is going to have some actual powers in regard to controlling entry to these various institutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did say here today and yesterday was in regard to a body of this kind&mdash;<i>ad hoc</i> or otherwise; probably <i>ad hoc</i>&mdash;in which all the universities would be involved. The initiative for something of this kind has already come from one particular quarter where the suggestion <Col N="1456" /> was made that they would come together with the authorities in the institutes of higher education and that they would concern themselves in this matter.  I did not say that we were setting it up.  I simply said that I would envisage that in my belief this would be a much more reasonable and sensible way in which the matter which Senator Belton has mentioned could be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say from which quarter this initiative has come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It has come from the President of University College, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Minister on what I suppose is a private correspondence or something of that nature, but could the Minister tell the House whether it is envisaged that this agency, in which I can see some advantages, is going to supersede the present freedom of the colleges to take and refuse whom they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I cannot see where it will.  An tÚdarás, of course, will have some concern here; but in so far as this matter is concerned it is something that I suggested would be a much better means of dealing with what Senator Belton has in mind than An tÚdarás itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly see some advantages in having an agency like this but I think it is not right for the Minister to mention this thing for the first time in this offhand way.  If we are going to have an agency of this kind&mdash;the Minister says it may be an <i>ad hoc</i> agency&mdash;the House and the Dáil and the people should be told who is going to control this agency, who is going to set it up, who is going to run it, what are the criteria it is going to use in processing students as he puts it.  Is it going to have the effect that it is going to make the students minds up for them whether they should be admitted to a particular course or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are all matters that are of <Col N="1457" /> great importance and interest to the people who work in institutions of higher education.  They are far more important than some of the matters which we have been discussing here in the abstract yesterday and this morning. If the Minister is serious about this he should make some kind of public statement, either here or at a press conference, about his intention in this regard.  This is one of the most important things that has been mentioned here since we started yesterday morning and I am most unhappy that it should be left hanging in the air in reply to a Committee Stage amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is proposing the setting up of any agency.  What he is trying to say is that this is a matter which concerns the universities and the institutions of higher education and probably involves a discussion with An tÚdarás.  The upshot of it might be that the different universities might say to An tÚdarás: &ldquo;This is how we would like it done.&rdquo; I agree with Senator Belton that information should be available, but I do not think that one should be putting the onus in a specific way on An tÚdarás because, in the working of it, it should be a matter between the different institutes and An tÚdarás itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three elements in this particular situation and there is a danger of getting confused between these three elements. First, in the years to come undoubtedly university applications will have to be made even before the results of examinations are known, even before the examinations have been sat for. In regard to this it would be necessary in the future for any intending student of higher education to indicate a range of preferences in regard to institutions and in regard to faculties within those institutions.  The pressures will be such that all the people will not be able to get a place in the faculty of their first choice.  Senator Belton's amendment is concerned with assisting children and their parents to make out this particular application in a way that will be in the best interests of the child.  That is <Col N="1458" /> what is the concern of this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wrong when he says that the existence of a central body for processing replaces in any way the function of Senator Belton's amendment. All a certain agency can do, leaving aside for the moment its nature, is to process these applications&mdash;to co-ordinate the application which has been made and which indicates the choices and the preferences of the child made in consultation with the parents and the teachers.  There is room for co-ordination in this particular regard.  It is being discussed in all the universities at the moment.  It is extremely likely that the universities, of their own initiative, will work out between them a satisfactory system here.</P>
      <P>But these are only two of the three elements.  The third one is the actual admission of a student to a particular faculty.  It is highly likely that the universities, although co-operating on the exchange of information, having perhaps a high degree of harmonisation of entry requirements and of ranking procedures in regard to the merits of intending students, will wish to remain master in their own house in regard to the final acceptance of students. Therefore we have these three elements &mdash;the making of a choice; a list of preferences by the intending applicants and the processing of these, which will be facilitated by harmonisation; and finally the actual acceptance into a faculty.  We have been in danger, in this debate, of confusing the three. Senator Belton's amendment is concerned with assisting the child.  Anything that is done in regard to the processing of applications is to my mind far too late to be of any assistance in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether the agency which he has in mind would eventually aspire to the same kind of powers that similar agencies in existence in Britain at the moment have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly.  It is in operation in Britain because of a very large multiplicity of institutions. I have been wondering from the very <Col N="1459" /> beginning, if in our circumstances, where we have not got so many institutions, it would be necessary; but, if we take into consideration the other institutions of higher education which will be designated as well as the universities, we will have a considerable number of these institutions.  It might possibly happen that an agency or something of this sort might be established. Senator Kelly read into what I said much more than that I intended when I said that it was inevitable that such an agency would ultimately process applications for entry to institutes of higher education.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge said he believed that it would be likely that the universities would work out some sort of suitable system, which is exactly what I was saying, except that I would include the other institutions of higher education as well as the universities in this. It is equally important that our young people in all our post-primary schools, both secondary and vocational, should have the information available to them. The only grounds on which I disagree with the arguments put forward is on the basis that I do not believe that An tÚdarás is the proper body to deal with it.  I think I put very cogent arguments forward as to why it should be done in the manner which I have suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House with this.  I do not think that I read in the Minister's words anything more than he actually said.  I took them down as well as I could and the impression he left with me was that he thought it would be inevitable that we would have a central agency.  I took that to mean that this would be something proceeding from the Minister or from the Government. If the Minister assures us now that what he has got in mind is simply the likelihood that the universities or the institutions of higher education will themselves voluntarily set up such an agency, that is quite a different matter. I want to be clear, and I think the House should ask the Minister to make it clear that he has not got at the back of his mind any form of compulsion <Col N="1460" /> imposed from the top on these institutions.</P>

      <P>I am, to some extent, disappointed that the Minister is not accepting this.  This is non-contentious amendment in every way.  It is in no sense trying to undermine the Minister, and I am sure he will accept that this was a constructive idea.</P>
      <P>I have accepted the point made by Senator Ahearne.  I thought that would be implicit.  All I was asking was that the information be sent to the heads, whether they be principals or principal teachers, of secondary schools and from the information they would get from An tÚdarás they could advise students whether they should go to a university or not, to another institution of higher education, or maybe not an institution of higher education at all.  Maybe their interests would lie in craftmanship or something else.  Such advise could then be given on the basis of the information got from An tÚdarás.</P>
      <P>I fail to see why the Minister should suggest that An tÚdarás should not get itself involved in anything of that nature.  The involvement is simple: An tÚdarás would merely send information. There is no question of a directive or anything of that nature.  I still think An tÚdarás is the body that will be in existence to deal with this.  What the Minister means by &ldquo;another agency&rdquo; is not clear to me, but it has been pointed out to Senator Dooge that such an agency will process applications. It will not deal with the parents or the pupils at the stage at which it is necessary to do so: that is when the children are trying to form an idea as to what their future will be.  If this information from An tÚdarás were available to the principals of secondary schools it might help in those cases where the pupils or the parents have not made up their minds as to what the pupils should do.  It would help at that stage, and it would help them also to decide on the various subjects to take in the fifth and sixth years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> However, as I have accepted the point made by Senator Mrs. Ahearne, if I would be allowed to put down an amendment on Report Stage clarifying what is in this by implication and what Senator Ahearne said, and incorporate it with this amendment, I would be willing to withdraw this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept that.  I did not take the point that Senator Ahearne made, but I did not make an argument of it.  I put forward all the reasons why I felt An tÚdarás was not the proper body to deal with this.  It is a body which is in no sense geared to perform this type of work.  I accept that the Senator put down his amendment in good faith.  I never questioned that.  I simply say that we differ on a fundamental issue in so far as I do not accept that An tÚdarás is the proper body.  I have given all the reasons why I do not accept it.  In relation to the schools getting information, I would foresee it being done by a particular institution as a joint effort. A somewhat similar type of business could be operated by an agency such as we have already discussed.  They could have discussions with the guidance teachers and they would get very much more direct information in that sense.</P>
      <P>I would not be willing to accept an amendment simply because it included the vocational aspect of it.  While I felt that the discussion was orientated towards university education, nevertheless I did not make a point of that.  I made my own arguments as to why I did not feel that I could accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister uses a phrase there which I fail to understand. He said An tÚdarás was not &ldquo;geared&rdquo; for this.  Any competent higher education authority is surely geared for what is contained in this amendment.  All that is asked for in this amendment is that certain information should be given, and this information should be to hand to an education authority.  This information could be collected from the different institutions, including what Senator Ahearne mentioned.  It should be available at any time to the Higher Education Authority and all they have to do is to transfer this information to <Col N="1462" /> the principal teachers of secondary schools.  I do not understand the Minister's phrase that An tÚdarás would not be geared to it.</P>

      <P>It refers to such information as may be deemed necessary. There is very little difference between that and forecasting.  Senator Belton says pupils would then know which faculties to enter or not to enter.  That to my mind is forecasting and is a dangerous thing to do.  In my opinion it would bind An tÚdarás to giving out information and might change the outlook in some faculties.  We heard Senator Quinlan say yesterday that five years ago he told his pupils to go forward for BAs in order to obtain teaching posts.  Look at the situation we have today.</P>

      <P>With the teacher guidance we have today those people should be able to get better information.  The onus should be on the parents to get whatever information they need as regards job opportunities.  A boy may have an aptitude for one particular subject or profession and he should be encouraged to go forward for it.  If he is among the top pupils in his school he will make a success of such a career. If a boy is interested in a particular subject I would not like to be the person or board that would change him to another profession that he might not make a success of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in public life are all aware of many people who are not suited for the professions they have.  There was a <Col N="1463" /> notorious situation in the teaching profession long ago in which people went forward for jobs as national school teachers just because the salary was attractive and without having any regard for their ability to do such a job. I once knew of a girl who, when asked at an interview for a teacher post why she wanted to become a teacher, said: &ldquo;My mother wants me to become a teacher.&rdquo;  We all know what difficulties that type of person could create if she were given such a post.  If this amendment were accepted it might affect the children's outlook.  I believe the information will be readily available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>At the centre of the debate on this amendment there seems to be the question of career guidance.  An tÚdarás has, and will continue to have, more than enough on its hands besides entering into a very specialised area such as career guidance.  The question of career guidance is a very dicey business. By nature, and by our natural characteristics, we are very often loath to take advice from anybody.  Those of us who have experience in this field can bear me out on that.  We have often given good advice to find that the wise have taken it but the majority have not.  We seem to love our freedom so intensely that we want our complete freedom of choice in everything we do.</P>
      <P>As far as career guidance here is concerned it seems to be a matter that will have to grow in the passing of time. We cannot make it by instant regulation or legislation.  The oldest form of career guidance is that of the parents themselves who decide on what they feel is best for their child.  In latter years primary and post-primary schools have made it their business&mdash;it is good educational and social practice&mdash;to acquaint themselves with all the openings in careers and have informed their pupils accordingly.</P>
      <P>I take it that Senator Belton had the highest motives in mind when he put down this amendment.  Under it he intends to include all post-primary schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&mdash;and institutions other than universities, although the word &ldquo;faculties&rdquo; would seem to suggest that the only institutions he had in mind at the time were the universities.  <i>A propos</i> of that there seems to be an overtone, since this debate on Committee Stage started, that there is no third-level institution but the universities and to a lesser extent that there are no post-primary schools but secondary schools.  This is an alarming tendency.  I take it that it is not deliberate and just occurred by way of accident because of the preponderance of university men here.  It is something of which we should be very wary.</P>
      <P>There are more than universities involved in third-level institutions.  There are colleges of technology, schools and colleges of music, colleges of art, training colleges for national teachers and so on, and they must be taken into consideration also.  We should rid our minds of the idea that there can be nothing outside of a university.  The question of status probably comes in here and, in my opinion, one of the main reasons for overcrowding is the fact that so many people regard attendance at a university as a status symbol and are inclined to send their children to a university whether or not those children are fitted for it.  As I listened to the debate yesterday and this morning the Latin phrase <i>odi profanum vulgus</i> kept running through my mind.  Maybe that attitude of mind is still with us today.</P>
      <P>Following all the suggestions that have been put forward I take it that by now we are of the opinion that An tÚdarás has more than enough on its plate in getting properly established.  I wish to make no suggestion as to what form a central agency for career guidance should take.  My opinion is that it must develop slowly over the years. It will have to grow of its own volition. Parents and schools at all levels will have to have a say in it and the industrial arm of the country will have to have a say in it.  At this stage it would be disastrous to think of the formation, by regulation or otherwise, of a central agency to deal with this very vexed question of career guidance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider what Senator Crinion has said to be quite irrelevant to the amendment before us.  He said that parents should tell their children what career to choose, but this in a way has been contradicted by Senator Cranitch himself.  There are quite a number of points on which I agree with Senator Cranitch.  There are other types of education than university education. Senator Uí Eachthéirn brought this point out at the outset and I accept what she said.  The Minister and Senator Cranitch implied that this would entail extra work.  What extra work does it entail on the Higher Education Authority? None whatever, except sending out a few letters.  All this information must be available to the Higher Education Authority already, and all they have to do is send it to the principals of secondary schools.  By implication, this amendment accepts that there are forms of higher education other than the ones that have been discussed by the academics in this House.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority which the Minister proposes to set up very quickly will be the body that will be in existence long before any body that he has suggested, such as the central agency, which he mentioned for the first time today.  It may be years before this agency is set up.  If he does set it up and it proves to be a better source of information, let us examine it and transfer the function to it.  I am trying to elicit information from the Higher Education Authority in favour of the people I have mentioned.  However, we have no such agency at the moment, and we have proposed legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime I suggest that the Minister accept this amendment with the addition of something that could be produced at Report Stage.  There is no suggestion in this amendment that the Authority should publish or forecast anything but merely issue information without any comment.  It is up to the principals of secondary schools, in consultation with pupils and parents, to assess the information that is before them.  I am not suggesting that there should be a directive from the Higher Education Authority to the principals of secondary schools but it should make available to the principals of secondary <Col N="1466" /> schools information that may be of some value to them in their discussions with their pupils and with the parents of pupils.  I cannot see how this can be contentious.  I should have thought that the Minister would accept this; it would not prejudice in any way any central agency that might be set up.  He could set up a central agency afterwards and make provision for transferring what I suggest here to that agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has not had the benefit of either secondary or third level education, I hesitate to become involved in a debate of this kind.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, as proposed by Senator Belton, at least he should give an assurance that some effort will be made to prevent turning out, year after year, graduates from our universities who perhaps find that they are marked for export We should make some effort to ensure that students who have had the benefit of university education and who acquire degrees will be utilised in this country, and that some country across the water will not have the advantage of those students.  It takes a lot of money to keep a student in a university, and a big proportion of it is paid by the taxpayer.  We should therefore ensure that the taxpayer gets value for the products of our universities.</P>
      <P>I can accept the Minister's plea that it is difficult and that, perhaps, it is unfair to impose this task on An tÚdarás, that it would be outside their terms of reference.  However, a body should be set up to ensure that parents and pupils get career guidance and are informed what the prospects are of procuring employment in Ireland.  In this rapidly changing world, it will be a difficult task for any agency.  It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to give a reasonably accurate guess at what the position is likely to be three, four or five years' hence, when a particular student graduates and prepares to take up a position in life.</P>
      <P>I should like to see, and I am sure the taxpayers would also like to see, that our country and not a foreign one benefits from the talents of the graduates of our universities, who are being heavily subsidised.</P>

      <P>This amendment reads:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás shall send annually to the principals of secondary schools such information as may be deemed necessary...</P>
      <P>That may be anything, it may be nothing; it may be an enormous amount or it may be a detail, but that is the actual wording of the amendment. It goes on:</P>
      <P>...it should include inter alia the state of overcrowding in the various faculties and the numbers rejected in that year.</P>
      <P>That is suggested as an amendment to this Bill.  The Bill sets out the functions of An tÚdarás, and sets out special functions under section 5: &ldquo;...it shall advise the Minister on the need or otherwise for the establishment of new institutions.&rdquo;  That is one specific function of the Authority.  &ldquo;That it shall recommend to the Minister the overall provision of student places to be made within the higher education system having regard to the need to maintain a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students.&rdquo; That is another specific function.  &ldquo;That it shall assess the amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education.&rdquo; That is its third specific provision.</P>
      <P>Those are the specific functions of An tÚdarás.  In addition to that, it has a further specific function: &ldquo;To bear constantly in mind the national aim of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture.&rdquo;  Then it has general functions under section 3:</P>
      <P>(a) furthering the development of higher education,</P>
      <P>(b) assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment,</P>
      <P>(c) promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research, ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two other functions are to promote the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education and the <Col N="1468" /> democratisation of the structure.  This amendment does not appear to fit in anywhere in the specific functions of An tÚdarás or even within its general functions.  If there is an amendment to a Bill, it must fit into the general framework of the Bill.  I agree wholeheartedly with what Senator Fitzgerald has said. I agree with the idea behind it, but I do not think this is the place for that.</P>
    <P>Consider this amendment in greater detail to see where it could possibly fit in.  An tÚdarás, according to this, is supposed to be able to tell the principal of any secondary school how many pupils failed, say, in Bolton Street in doing a course in electronics and how many were rejected; how many pupils failed in doing a course in domestic economy in some third level school; how many law students failed to pass their exams for the Incorporated Law Society; likewise, how many law students failed the Bar; how many students failed in the College of Surgeons in third medicine and so on. This is all statistical data which An tÚdarás would not have.  They could get this statistical data but it would require a lot of time and a lot of effort and a lot of money.  It would detract from their main functions and their main purposes.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fitzgerald said, there is no use in spending a vast amount of the taxpayers' money in educating third level students for export.  I am not sure that it comes within the function of the Minister for Education.  This is something that should be included in a Bill coming under the control of the Minister for Labour, something in relation to manpower policy.</P>
    <P>I think that where Senator Belton has gone wrong in his argument is that he has assumed that An tÚdarás would have all this statistical information, when they would not have one iota of it.  If they wanted to find out from the Bar Council how many rejects they had in the year and how many entrants they had in the year and so on they would have to write to them to find out.  They would have to do likewise if they wanted to find out the same information from Bolton Street, from the college in Limerick, from the new college that is being set up in <Col N="1469" /> Sligo, from the College of Surgeons or from anywhere else.</P>
    <P>If the principal of a secondary school wanted this information he could write to these schools himself and get it.  Then he would be able to give that information.  One must realise the immense responsibility that we are throwing upon An tÚdarás.  If they made one single slip in any of this vast statistical information they could be held up to odium.  That is my opinion, despite the fact that I agree wholeheartedly with what Senator Fitzgerald has said.  I would agree with what Senator Belton has said if the statistical information were available but it would not be there.  It is something that would have to be searched for.</P>
    <P>All An tÚdarás can do, if it can deal with the overall provision of student places in the totality of our institutions of higher education, is to recommend to the Minister if further schools are needed for any purposes such as business guidance, management training or for anything else that is necessary. It would not have this statistical information, and it would not come within its purview at all.  It would be a complete misplacement of functions if this were to be placed under the control of the Minister for Education.  It is something for the Minister for Labour who has the responsibility for manpower policy and for the programming of manpower policy for the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I do not want to offend Senator Nash, but I sometimes wonder when I hear arguments from the other side of the House on a point like this if he would be saying the same thing if the amendment had come from a Fianna Fáil Senator to a proposal by a Fine Gael Minister.  The people on the far side of the House seem to jump in automatically when they could quite easily remain silent&mdash;and no doubt would be facilitating their Minister by doing so&mdash;to support a point of view which I am sure they would not necessarily be supporting if it were the other way around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Nash has gone over ground that was thrashed out here yesterday. He has told the House at great length that the Authority would not have <Col N="1470" /> statistical information at its disposal. If Senator Nash would look at section 6 he will find that the Authority is required to get statistical information and keep it at its disposal.  It is required to maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education. I am damned if I can see how it can do that unless it gathers the kind of information that Senator Nash was talking about.</P>
    <P>If it is in the state of childish ignorance which Senator Nash assumes, with no knowledge of how many people are failing exams, with no knowledge of how many are being refused admission to institutions, it will not be able to do its job.  Section 6 positively requires it to gather the necessary information so that it can do its job. Senator Nash's arguments completely fall to the ground.  What Senator Belton and I have been pressing for in vain&mdash;I hope that the purpose of this is being understood by this House and those outside it&mdash;is for the Authority, in some shape or form, to make available whatever knowledge it has about the general pattern of employment for graduates to the people who need it, namely, parents of children entering higher education and the people who direct the schools in which these children are studying.  I do not care if it is under Senator Belton's amendment or my amendment or under the amendment in section 6 that it is done.  I do not care how it is done.</P>
    <P>I also agree with what the Minister said a while ago that if we had such a thing as a central agency, this body which is conjured out of a hat, that agency might be able to do this job; but we have not got a central agency at the moment and when we have it is not clear what its functions will be.  What we have got is a Bill before us creating an Authority which is directed by section 6 to do something which necessarily involves its gathering statistical information.  I want that information to be made available to the people who need it.  I cannot see why the Minister will not go an inch of the way to meet us on this, and it is not only &ldquo;us&rdquo;.  This is not a point on which Fine Gael will stump the country.  It is not because I am in Fine Gael that I am <Col N="1471" /> making this point.  I would be making it if I were on the other side as well.  I am sure that in their heart of hearts, Senators Cranitch, Keery and Crinion know perfectly well that this is a sensible amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot allow the last remarks to pass without answering them.  One way of countering an argument is to attribute to somebody insincere motives.  It is a matter of regret to me that Senator Kelly has seen fit to attribute to me motives of that nature.  He has told us that all this statistical information should be in the hands of An tÚdarás because of the provision in section 6(1):</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás shall maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education.</P>
      <P>The demand and need for higher education is a very general thing.  It is a very different thing from having, as required by this amendment, the state of overcrowding of the various faculties &mdash;not of the various universities, not of higher education in general even, but the various faculties&mdash;the numbers rejected in a year whether it is in law, medicine, engineering, science, electricity, plumbing, domestic economy or anything else.  It would not need all that information to keep this continuous review.  I do not care what Minister or what party is in power I should still feel the same about that amendment. It is something that should not be in this Bill.  It is something that would hamper and interfere with what should be the proper functions of An tÚdarás. Furthermore, I should go so far as to say that this other function should not be under the control of the Minister for Education but under the control of the Minister for Labour who should have the overall picture regarding manpower policy.</P>

      <P>I think we should look at this from the point of view of the great responsibility placed on the principals of secondary schools when they are consulted by the pupils or their parents as to which post-secondary institutions they should attend.  It is a <Col N="1472" /> great responsibility for these people to advise students as to which faculty they should enter.  In helping them to reach the right decision we should ensure they are supplied with the fullest possible information.  Under the free education scheme there are large numbers of students attending secondary or other post-primary courses.  This means there is overcrowding in some of the schools and colleges.  The post-secondary institutions are unable to cater for the greatly increased numbers attending.</P>
      <P>When the principal of a school is recommending a particular faculty to a pupil he must take into account the student's ability and also the accommodation available in that faculty.  It often happens that numbers of students cannot go beyond the first year, not because they do not pass the first year examination but because there is no accommodation available.  I think we could accept Senator Belton's amendment and have the information supplied by An tÚdarás, as there is no other authority.  The information should be made available somehow.</P>
      <P>There are, under the free educational system, large numbers of children attending post-primary schools whose parents have no educational background and who are not well-informed as to the different outlets for their children.  That adds to the burden placed on the principals of these schools.  I strongly support the effort to ensure that the principals of schools are supplied with the most up-to-date information by An tÚdarás or any other body to help them to advise the students which subjects suit them best. It is possible to visualise, in remote parts of the country where secondary education was not available to the same numbers of people heretofore as now, the frustration of parents whose children, having attended the secondary school, seek to attend the university and due to getting the wrong advice or, perhaps, no advice are turned down because of lack of accommodation.  If Senator Belton's amendment prevents this happening it will serve a good purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point to be made in connection with this amendment is a terminological one.  I believe &mdash;and I think perhaps the Minister is of the same opinion on this&mdash;that one of the ambiguities which the Bill still contains, and which should be rectified before it becomes an Act of the Oireachtas, is in connection with the <Col N="1474" /> alternate use of the phrase &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;higher education and research&rdquo;.  There does not seem to be any pattern in the use of these phrases throughout the Bill and part of the motivation behind this amendment is to ask the Minister to standardise the wording.  I think the wording should be the same in all cases and should be &ldquo;higher education and research&rdquo; in all cases rather than just &ldquo;higher education&rdquo;, to avoid any misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>The main burden of amendment No. 15 is related to the ambiguity in the wording of section 12(1) as it stands now.  The Minister will, no doubt, heave a great sigh when he sees this coming up again, as he spent so much time on it in the other House. We believe that, while the section has been improved, this ambiguity remains in the text of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In my Second Reading speech I referred to this and I asked the Minister to clarify what he had in mind.  In his reply to the Second Reading debate the Minister, in my estimation, went further than he has gone at any stage to date in clarifying this and made it quite clear that, as far as he was concerned, the Authority would have the power to vary the allocation of money as between different institutes of higher education and that the printing of projected allocations in the estimates would be solely for information.</P>
      <P>It is true that, when he said this, the Minister seemed to be under the impression that the kind of situation in which this might arise was one in which some of the institutions of higher education might have more money than they needed for their requirements and in which the Authority might be anxious to spread the surplus around.  The Minister can rest assured that in nine cases out of ten, if not in all cases, it will not be a question of spreading round a surplus but of sharing a deficit.  If the Minister's reaction to the first report of the Authority is any guide, it will be a question of seeing where cuts can be made, not who is going to get any extra money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Authority will have the power to vary the amounts available to the <Col N="1475" /> various institutions of higher education, depending on the amount of money that is made available to them by the Oireachtas through the Minister for Education, why should this not be in the Bill?  It seems to me that the present wording of the Bill is still guilty of the original ambiguity and that the amendment which we propose would have the effect of removing it.</P>
    <P>Again, I fail to see why the details of the amounts to be made available to various institutions should be published in the Book of Estimates.  The simplest reason I can think of why the Minister has this in mind is that this is a legacy from a long period of direct funding of the universities.  The amounts made available to the universities and, indeed, other institutions of higher education, from the Department of Finance through the Department of Education both as regards capital and current expenditure have always appeared in the Estimates.  The only reason I can assume that the Minister desires to continue this practice is because of a sort of conservatism, an unwillingness to change the existing state of affairs. I believe that very many people in the area of higher education generally would agree with me that the proper place for this kind of information is in the annual report of An tÚdarás.  It sounds a small change, but I think it is a psychologically important one.  The Government, for instance, do not require publication in the Book of Estimates of the way in which sums of money made available to RTE under various Acts have been distributed.</P>
    <P>In a country as small as ours, where relationships tend to be intense and hostilities can often break out and in which Parliament very often is used to attack people who are not there to defend themselves, I think it is important that this sort of information, which could lead to an unhappy debate in Parliament, should be removed from the Book of Estimates and put in the annual report of the Authority&mdash;which will, of course, ultimately be presented to Parliament itself.  We have a fundamental difficulty here in that, while we want to make some inroads into the rather old-fashioned 19th century idea <Col N="1476" /> of university autonomy, we cannot at the same time go to the other extreme. We cannot go for the idea that, because the old idea of university autonomy was restrictive and in many ways reactionary, the only and obvious alternative to it is to have total State control.  We have to set up a sort of balancing mechanism, and ideally this balancing mechanism should be located in An tÚdarás.  The ambiguity of section 10, subsection (1) unbalances An tÚdarás psychologically, and I feel that our amendment would give them an extra degree of psychological independence which would be absolutely vital for the early years of their existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment for the reasons given by Senator Horgan and some additional reasons that I will mention. First of all, I should like to preface my remarks by saying that I have read the debate which took place in the Dáil on this matter and I realise that the subject is one with which the Minister must be familiar.  I think it is important &mdash;and I say this bearing in mind what Senator Cranitch said a while ago&mdash; that higher education is receiving a very full debate in this House.  It is important that the debate be full because the people taking part, apart from some Senators, are the representatives of the universities.  This amendment is put forward by two Senators who represent universities, Senator Horgan represents the National University of Ireland and I represent Dublin University.  We are putting forward this amendment out of our own conviction and also because it corresponds to the view of IFUT.  I think this is not to be decried; I think this is speaking authoritatively from the point of view of the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point that I should like to make is that I was rather chilled by the prevention of Senator Belton's attempt to withdraw the last amendment.  He wanted to re-introduce it on Report Stage.  I would not like to think that this was going to happen, if anybody else wanted to withdraw an amendment and re-introduce it on Report, on the grounds that the Minister does not wish to have a separate Report Stage but wants to steamroll the Bill through <Col N="1477" /> at this sitting.  I would not like to think that that was the Minister's attitude.</P>
    <P>This is a very important piece of legislation, one which is receiving thoughtful consideration in this House. We have had a number of amendments put forward and the Minister, to his credit, has listened with great attention to every amendment.  He has dealt with them reasonably, but he has uniformly refused every amendment.  I hope that this does not mean a closed mind, that the Minister is not just being patient with what we are saying with no intention, at any stage, of acceding to any of our requests.  I think he will realise from the length of the debate in the Dáil and for the reasons put forward by Senator Horgan, that this is perhaps the most important amendment put forward on this Bill, and that it is put forward not for frivolous but for extremely serious reasons, reasons which relate to university autonomy but which also relate to an awareness by the community of the importance to the community of university funds being properly administered.</P>
    <P>As Senator Horgan has said, there are really two aspects to this amendment. The first is to include the higher education and research in the amendment. The second is in relation to exchanging the words &ldquo;amounts to institutions&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;such amount&rdquo;&mdash;a total amount.  If I might refer to what the Minister said on the Committee Stage in the Dáil in relation to efforts by Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley to put down, a similar amendment, I quote from the Dáil Official Report of 1st April, 1971, in which the Minister said in relation to the question of the amounts:</P>
    <P>When I refer here to amounts for institutions of higher education, I am referring to the two sums that will be voted annually by Dáil Éireann. There will be a global sum by way of grant-in-aid to An tÚdarás out of which An tÚdarás will pay the current grants to these institutions.  There will be a second global sum also by way of grant-in-aid out of which An tÚdarás will recoup the institutions their expenditure on capital works <Col N="1478" /> for which approval will already have been given by An tÚdarás.  Therefore, when I refer to amounts, I am not referring to specific amounts for various institutions as such but to global amounts, both current and capital.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister went on:</P>
    <P>These are the amounts which will appear in the appropriate subheads in the Book of Estimates but as an appendix to the relevant vote there will be shown the sums proposed for each institution and which, in total, add up to the sums provided in the subheads.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister concedes that the amounts will be global amounts and then says that these will be particularised in an appendix to the Book of Estimates.  In the debate in the Dáil it was pointed out that this was a very novel idea&mdash;an appendix to the Book of Estimates.  As Senator Horgan has said, there is no itemisation of this sort in grants to other bodies such as RTE which he mentioned.  I would mention, even more relevantly in this context, Bord Fáilte, which gets grants-in-aid which are not broken down in this way. The proper place for a detailed account of expenditure is surely in the report of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out in the Dáil&mdash; and I agree with this&mdash;that, if the method of financial control is what it appears to be on the reading of this, then what has happened as a result of setting up the Higher Education Authority is to make the machinery more cumbersome without solving any of the problems which it was supposed to solve.  I am reinforced in this view by the Minister's further statement in col. 2014 of the Dáil Report where he says, in regard to the method of distributing the amount:</P>
    <P>The various institutions would make an application for finance and An tÚdarás would consult with each of them before making recommendations to the Minister.  Then the Minister could, if he felt it necessary, have consultations with An tÚdarás and then, when the total amount available had been determined, it <Col N="1479" /> would be for An tÚdarás and the Minister to agree generally in relation to its apportionment and it would be open to An tÚdarás in regard to such apportionment to carry out any consultation with any institution which they might consider necessary.  This would be done prior to the production of the Book of Estimates and the amounts in the Appendix would then be agreed on.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to mean that the institutions would come to An tÚdarás. They would work out an agreement with An tÚdarás in regard to the amount that would be paid.  An tÚdarás would then go to the Government. The Government, if it was not prepared to give the total sum, would give a lesser sum and would work out with An tÚdarás where the cutbacks would be.  Then An tÚdarás would go back and explain to the institutions where the cutbacks would be.  In other words, you would have a further complication in the process of bargaining. The Department would have direct control of cutbacks in both capital and terms of expenditure and An tÚdarás would not be autonomous in any sense. There would be more direct interference by the Department, but in a more cumbersome form than hitherto.</P>
    <P>There is great apprehension in the universities about the wording of this amendment.  Senator Horgan, myself and others who spoke to this amendment do not wish to either disguise or minimise the role of the university and the Government's relationship to the universities in regard to the funding of university activity.  But there is an important principle involved, which is, that the Higher Education Authority is the proper body, if there has to be any cutback in the total amount granted to the universities, to decide how this cutback will take effect and to report on the current expenditure of the university.  That is the proper function of An tÚdarás, and unless it has this function it is not an autonomous body, it is not a proper body, and it will not have respect from the institution who are trying to bargain direct with the Minister because they will know it is the Minister who will finally call the <Col N="1480" /> tune.  That would defeat the purpose of setting up a Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to have an open mind on this and to consider how strongly it has been pressed in the Dáil and how strongly it has been pressed here by representatives of the two universities.  If the Minister wants to give authority and credibility to the Higher Education Authority, he might at least consider accepting this amendment to section 12, even if he is not prepared to accept any other amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 3, paragraph <i>(c)</i> spells out very clearly that one of the functions of the institutions of higher education is to promote research. It is very clear to me that those institutions will spend some of the money which they get on research when they deem that research is necessary.  I think it is as simple as that.</P>

I have read the Dáil Reports exhaustively and I want to say that I agree with Senator Horgan that this particular section is crucial.  But I would like the Minister to clarify what Senator Robinson quoted him on there, because I do not want to misinterpret the Minister.  Perhaps Senator Robinson may have, I am not quite sure.

      <P>The Chair is conscious of the difficulty.  The House has, however, agreed to discuss them separately.  It may be unavoidable that reference be made to amendment No. 16 while discussing amendment No. 15. That may be permissible, but there will be an occasion to discuss matters not already raised when amendment No. 16 is moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me say in relation to what Senator Robinson has said about the question of accepting amendments that I am sure the Senator will agree that I have given very considerable study to this whole Bill, both in its formulation and later in relation to the discussion in the Dáil and again in the discussion in the Seanad.  Therefore I do not take any decision lightly. If I feel that an amendment will improve the Bill in any way then I accept it, but if I feel that its effect would, in my view, not help the Bill then of course I could not possibly accept it.</P>
      <P>I will repeat again what I said in the Dáil in relation to this question of amounts rather than amount.  Firstly, the amounts for institutes of higher education which will be paid to An tÚdarás will be two sums that will be voted annually by Dáil Éireann.  One is a global sum by way of grant-in-aid to An tÚdarás, out of which An tÚdarás will pay recurrent grants and the second will be a global sum by way of grant-in-aid out of which An tÚdarás will recoup to institutions the expenditure on capital works to which it has already given approval.  The Book of Estimates will also contain in an appendix, for the information of the House and for the information of anybody concerned, particulars of the recurrent grants and the capital grants which An tÚdarás would propose to make to the individual institution should the global sums be voted.</P>
      <P>Senator Horgan suggests that this is simply because we do not want to make a change.  First of all I might say that we do not always follow the British example, but in this particular case this is the manner in which these sums are dealt with in Britain.  There are separate global amounts for current and capital.  I think that in any democratic State it is only right that the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas should have knowledge of the individual amount allocated by An tÚdarás to the various institutions of higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be dealing in a sense with the second amendment, but Senator Brugha has asked me again to repeat the manner in which An tÚdarás and the various institutions and the Minister <Col N="1482" /> for Education and the Government will deal with the allocation of the moneys. I shall repeat more or less what I said in the Dáil in relation to this.  Firstly, all of the institutions concerned will submit their demands to An tÚdarás in an agreed form.  I do not have to explain that aspect of it.  An tÚdarás will then have any discussions it deems necessary with the various institutions. It is inevitable that an tÚdarás will have discussions with the various institutions. In fact, it would be very difficult for them to carry out their functions properly unless they had discussions in some detail in relation to the demands made on them.</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás will then present to the Department of Education the total amount of the sums it feels should be made available.  Discussions may or may not ensure between the Higher Education Authority and the Department on this, but I have no doubt that in normal circumstances this will happen, because it would be a rare occasion on which any Government would be able to provide the total that would be demanded of them.  After consideration had been made of the demands from An tÚdarás by the Department of Education and the Department of Finance and, quite possibly, by the Government, An tÚdarás will then be informed as to the sums it was proposed to make available for current and capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>It will then be for the Higher Education Authority, in the light of the money being made available, to have whatever discussions it might think necessary with the various institutions, with a view to determining the amount which it will propose to allocate to each institution.  This will not be referred in any way to the Minister.  I want to make that clear.  Perhaps I was not sufficiently clear in my reply in the Dáil, but when the Higher Education Authority are informed of the money that will be made available to them they will have the discussions with the institutions and they will determine the amount which it is proposed to allocate to each.</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás will then inform the Minister as to the allocation it proposes to make to each institution and this is <Col N="1483" /> the information which will be in the appendix to the Estimate.  It is not for any other purpose; it is simply so that it will be possible for the Minister to include in an appendix to the Estimates the various sums being allocated to each institution.  In any democratic country it would not be accepted that very considerable sums were being allocated to institutions and that the Houses of the Oireachtas would know nothing about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's further information.  I still do not understand why we should be doing something in this matter of the appendices, despite the fact that the Government has consistently refused, I think rightly, to make the same kind of information available in respect of funds which are disposed of by other Government Departments in an almost identical way to State-sponsored bodies. This seems to be a basic contradiction in the Government's policy.  If there is not, we should be grateful for an explanation of it.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it is absolutely necessary, and if it is actually impossible to have it in any other way, to have two Votes in the Oireachtas for capital and current expenditure to the institutions of higher education.  It seems to me that the question of whether one uses the words &ldquo;amount&rdquo; or &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; is bound up with this. While I appreciate that the procedure involved in the appendices is as obtains in Britain, I would urge on the Minister the difference between the two countries. In Britain there is a much greater multiplicity of institutions than there is in this country and things are rarely debated in Parliament at the same level of personal intensity that they tend to be here.  I feel that adopting the British practice here might make it more difficult for the Authority and for the Minister to plan the development of higher education on the national basis that they hope to.  It might make the Authority and the Minister more susceptible to local pressures of a kind that cannot be easily reconciled with the national interest.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, I <Col N="1484" /> agree with Senator Horgan that this section is crucial.  Anybody who has read the Dáil debates will understand that.  Almost the whole discussion of higher education hinged on this situation regarding money.  As I understand it, the whole idea in setting up the Higher Education Authority is to take education out of the hands of the Minister, to take the ordering of it from him and to hand it over to a completely responsible independent authority, so that you would avoid the situation where one institution is looking for this and another would say &ldquo;You gave so much to so-and-so&rdquo; and so on.</P>
      <P>This is a principle of which I approve, as I think it is very necessary.  It is very difficult to deal with the first amendment without overlapping.  The first amendment refers more to the difference between &ldquo;amount&rdquo; and &ldquo;amounts&rdquo;. You have to leave it in the plural because you are dealing with capital and current allocations, the two global amounts to which the Minister referred.</P>
      <P>Senator Horgan referred to the 19th century approach, but I am sure the Senator understands just as well as I do that the whole situation regarding institutions of education, universities and so on, has changed since the 19th century.  We heard Senator Jack Fitzgerald referring to the cost to the taxpayer and this is what we have to answer for as legislators.  I agree that Senator Robinson and Senator Horgan represent particular institutions and it is their function to argue on behalf of those institutions.  However, those of us who approach this from the point of view of what is happening to the taxpayers' money must, naturally, look at it in a different light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum cost per student is around £460 to £480 to the taxpayers; that is in the case of fee-paying students. The cost in the case of grant or scholarship students is in the area of £650 to £700 per annum.  The Minister said earlier that no democratic society can be left in ignorance of what is happening to its money and what results we are getting from such expenditure. Senator Horgan has, in some detail, referred to RTE and Bord Failte.  I agree with him to some extent in relation to Bord Fáilte but not in relation <Col N="1485" /> to RTE.  RTE does not have to account, although it does give an account, for its revenue.  Its revenue is derived from two different areas: one from licences and the other from advertising.  It does, however, account for specific grants when they are made by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am wrong there.  It is quite some time since I read them.  I am not altogether happy about the manner in which any of the semi-State bodies are producing their accounts. As I see it in relation to our higher education institution situation, the idea of the appendix is a very good one.  It gets around a difficulty here where if you were to insert specific amounts into the Estimates you would be trying the hands of each institution and of the Higher Education Authority itself.  Am I going over the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I can take the point up on subsection (2) when it comes up for discussion.  However, I believe the appendix will provide information without necessarily tying the different allocations of expenditure rigidly, particularly on the capital side, as they would have to be in the Book of Estimates.  An appendix would provide the information to which the taxpayers would be entitled and yet leave flexibility to the Higher Education Authority. As the Minister has pointed out&mdash; and it was a point I wanted to draw from him&mdash;once the two global amounts have been decided upon and handed over to the Authority that is the end of the matter so far as the Minister is concerned.  It will then be a matter between the Higher Education Authority and all the institutions concerned. As I understand from earlier discussions what can happen is that on the capital side the Higher Education Authority can reallocate capital where it has not been used to an area where it is needed. This is a very useful and flexible situation to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to the amendment, I do <Col N="1486" /> not think the point made by Senator Horgan is strong enough to make a fundamental change.  By &ldquo;such amounts&rdquo; is meant two double amounts. It is not amounts to each institution, as I understand it.  If you put this in the singular you are going to create a further difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to some of the points mentioned by Senator Brugha, although we represent the universities we would go all the way with him because universities must account for every penny they spend. It is a matter of great interest and concern to the community how the universities spend their funds.  Having a subhead with two global amounts, as the Minister has mentioned, and then a breakdown in the Book of Estimates would impose enormous practical difficulties. The argument was very well put by Deputy FitzGerald in the Dáil Official Report of 1st April, 1971, column 2110, where he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Quite apart from the question of principle involved, there is the practical question.  The procedure the Minister proposes is one which, working backwards from the date on which the money has to be paid out, would involve so many stages that it would be necessary for the universities to state their requirements so far in advance of the year to which the requirements related that the chances of their making an accurate estimate would be greatly diminished.  Already we are being pushed back and back to an earlier date because of the inability of the public administration to do its job speedily enough.</P>
      <P>As it is, we are asked in June, I think, to submit our requirements for a year beginning nine months later. With the procedure the Minister is suggesting just when does he think this process would have to start?</P>
      <P>That is another reason why it seems to me very difficult to have the appendix to the Book of Estimates and why it would be all the more appropriate that a very detailed and thorough breakdown would be in the report of An tÚdarás</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting forward this amendment, <Col N="1487" /> I do not think it is suggested that there would be any attempt to disguise the way in which the money would be spent by the universities.  It would be the proper function of An tÚdarás to allot the amount, depending on the total amount which the Government, having regard for other community interests, could see would be available for university expenditure.  An tÚdarás would put in a detailed report of this.  I agree that there is some problem in dealing with these amendments separately.</P>
    <P>I have here the Book of Estimates and it is significant, particularly in relation to Bord Fáilte, that there is no attempt to break down the grants-in-aid. I shall read briefly from the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power in relation to Bord Fáilte.  There is a grant under section 2 of the Tourist Traffic Act of £4,080,000, a resort development grant-in-aid of £250,000 &mdash;no attempt to particularise the resorts; development of holiday accommodation grant-in-aid £1,800,000; development of supplementary holiday accommodation in western counties grant-in-aid £100,000, with no attempt to particularise the counties concerned. I think it would be very difficult for Bord Fáilte, at the stage of the Estimates, to particularise.  I also think it would be extremely difficult and unrealistic for the universities to have credible estimates at the stage where all this complicated process would go on.  As well as the two global amounts, the breakdown of these grants-in-aid would be in the Book of Estimates.  In relation to the final point raised by Senator Brugha, it would be possible for the total amount to be broken in two.  It could be <i>(a)</i> for capital expenditure and <i>(b)</i> for current expenditure and could be done easily.</P>

      <P>With regard to the amounts, any business always has a capital allocation as well as a current one.  The universities should be treated in the same manner because there is always a large amount of capital expenditure laid out in connection with universities, involving new buildings, equipment, and so on. Therefore, it would be necessary to have a capital allocation as well as a current one for ordinary expenditure. If the current allocation became exhausted, money could be taken from the capital in order to keep going. Because of that, it would be dangerous not to separate the two allocations.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Book of Estimates, the Oireachtas, which provides the amount of money that will be required for education, should be able to see, in some form, what way the money has been spent.  The Minister is in duty bound to get that information.  It should be shown in the appendix of the Book of Estimates how the money has been allocated to An tÚdarás.</P>

      <P>Not wishing to dissociate myself from my university colleagues, I wish to state that I am quite satisfied with what the Minister has said in justifying the word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; as distinct from the word &ldquo;amount&rdquo; in this Bill.  I can see the reason why the Minister wants to have a separate capital and current allocation, and to see that these are separated from each other so that An tÚdarás can make its allocations accordingly, and that there can be no pressure back on the universities for varying the amounts that go to make up this total sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I am at one with Senator Horgan and Senator Robinson about the inclusion of the word <Col N="1489" />&ldquo;research&rdquo; here.  As was mentioned yesterday, I find it difficult to see why this word was put in in some sections of the Bill&mdash;three in all, I think&mdash;and left out in others, where it is equally relevant.  I agree that there are many institutions which are concerned entirely with research and do no teaching at all. There are others in which the emphasis is almost entirely on teaching and in which the amount of research done is very small indeed.  There is very close co-ordination between research and higher education, obviously, and one should not be separated from the other.  However, research can be done in institutions that are not involved in teaching.  I should like the obligation of this Higher Education Authority in relation to research to be emphasised a bit more, and I should therefore like to see this word &ldquo;research&rdquo; included, wherever possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I did not intervene before Senator Robinson, because I have great regard for her as a lawyer.  I am wondering&mdash;and am subject to correction by her&mdash;if she has not been guilty of somewhat of an oversight.</P>
      <P>The first amendment is that &ldquo;such amounts for institutions of higher education&rdquo; should be omitted, and include instead &ldquo;such an amount for higher education and research&rdquo;.  It will be noted that throughout the Bill there is no definition whatsoever of &ldquo;higher education and research&rdquo;.  Money cannot be paid, especially where large amounts are involved, unless there is a definition. There is a definition of &ldquo;institutions of higher education.&rdquo;  It is defined in subsection (1) of section 1 as:</P>
      <P>(a)  a university,</P>
      <P>(b)  a college of a university, or</P>
      <P>(c)  an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>There is a clear definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was listening to the debate yesterday and it was made quite clear that such institutions include institutions of <Col N="1490" /> research, where research would be carried out.  As has already been pointed out, you can have an institution that is doing research only and no teaching. However, that does not preclude it from being designated as an institution for higher education and coming within this definition.  It is for the benefit of institutions such as are defined here that this money may be expended.  This is where I differ from Senator Robinson. I should like her to correct me, if I am wrong.  In my view, there must be an explicit definition clause before large amounts of money can be applied.  The mere fact that the definition clause does not say &ldquo;institutions of higher education and research means such-and such&rdquo;, and simply says &ldquo;institutions of higher education&rdquo;, does not exclude institutions of research as well.  The definition clause includes every university, every college of the university, and also all institutions which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Act.  I am afraid that Senator Robinson is under a misapprehension there.</P>
    <P>In the next amendment&mdash;and also in this amendment to some extent&mdash;the objection is to the breaking down of payments into capital payments and current payments.</P>
    <P>I feel that unless all payments are broken down into capital payments and current payments nobody can know where they are going.  After all, the Government are probably the biggest money expender in so far as this State is concerned.  There is no doubt whatsoever about that.  No business could carry on unless they could break down their expenditure between capital expenditure and current expenditure or, as is sometimes denoted, capital and revenue expenditure.  What is expended in capital is expended in buildings, something that stays permanently, or on machinery as in the case of ESB.  It is something to which the taxpayer perhaps would not take exception, just as it is something in ordinary business to which the shareholder would not take exception.  It is not a wasting asset because it is something that is always there.  For that reason, the running of <Col N="1491" /> the universities is a very big business in itself, there must be some discrimination between capital expenditure and current expenditure.  Current expenditure can be a wasting asset.  It is something that if spent may not give any return.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it may put a certain burden on the universities to prepare their proposed capital and current expenditures in advance, but this is a problem that every business has.  Many a county council would expend as much money in the year as one of our universities.  They have to prepare well in advance their capital expenditure and their current expenditure.  They must know nearly 12 months in advance the amount which they will expend on roads, housing and so on.  They cannot wait until they are striking the rates.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why there is so much discussion about <Col N="1492" /> the question of the division of the two global sums into capital and current.  If I might hazard a guess, it is simply that those who are interested from outside these Houses originally thought that when we mentioned amounts we were referring to specific amounts for individual institutions.  I explained very clearly not only here but in the other House, what was involved.  I have gone into that again today.</P>
      <P>Many worthwhile arguments are being put forward in relation to the fact that capital must be segregated from current.  I think it is only right that An tÚdarás should be in a position to show that they have nothing to hide from any institution and they are not afraid to justify their allocation to one institution <i>vis-à-vis</i> another.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson quoted Deputy FitzGerald in relation to the manner in which it would be possible to have discussions between An tÚdarás, the Department and the various institutions. My view is that these discussions must start considerably earlier.  I should say that nine months would give ample time as most of the information required would be gathered beforehand by An tÚdarás.  Furthermore, forward budgeting and forecasting will be a feature of Estimates in the future.  The universities have already accepted and acted on the fact that they will have to furnish their own estimates much earlier than heretofore.</P>
      <P>One matter which Senator Nash dealt with is that it is suggested we delete &ldquo;such amounts for institutions of higher education&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;such an amount for higher education and research&rdquo;.  What is involved here is the amount for institutions of higher education.  These institutions will engage in higher education in its various aspects which will include research. That goes without question.</P>
      <P>The reference to institutions in this section is absolutely necessary so as to ensure that An tÚdarás carries out its functions which relate only to institutions of higher education.  If the Bill is studied carefully it will be found that this is so.  It would not be possible to accept this amendment in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can accept the necessity for the breakdown of the total amount of capital and current.  I am still very worried about the means by which the Minister gets back from An tÚdarás its apportionment of these individual sums or the sums to the individual institutions under its control, and if these are then to be entered in the Book of Estimates.  If it is the case that they will appear&mdash;so much for University College, Galway, so much for University College, Cork and so on&mdash;these figures will be in a unique position in the Book of Estimates because they will be the only single figure in the whole Book of Estimates for which a Department have not the responsibility and for which a Department cannot answer a parliamentary question.  The Minister can be queried as to why the grant to Bord Fáilte has changed from last year and any other item, even a subhead, could be the subject of a query and indeed would have to be justified to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>Why this departure?  As I read the Bill there is nothing in it that makes legal what the Minister stated his intentions are.  Once the Bill leaves this House and has become an Act, then what the Minister has said regarding the intentions of his Department or what we have said in the House will not matter.  All that matters is what is in the Bill itself.  Accordingly, if the Minister is to make this radical departure by which he wants these sums recorded in the Book of Estimates, there should be an amendment written into section 12 on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Any payment to an institution which An tÚdarás makes out of the amount it receives under the foregoing subsection shall, with respect to capital grants, be made in such manner and subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit.  Any payment for current expenditure shall be made in the form of block grants.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will be very brief on this.  I am anxious to hear the Minister in more detail.  He spoke earlier about the link, which in his mind existed between the two amendments and, I presume therefore, between the two subsections.  It seems to me that our amendment on this subsection is one if anything of greater substance than the one which we framed on the first subsection.</P>
      <P>After listening to the debate this morning it seemed to me that certainly the framing of our amendment on the first subsection could do with improvement. I am not at all certain that this is the case in regard to the amendment on the second subsection.  It seems to me to be quite obvious and worthwhile. What we propose is, in effect, to tie the hands of An tÚdarás in a certain way. While the Bill, as framed, does not necessarily prevent An tÚdarás from making block grants for current expenditure, it does enable An tÚdarás, if it so wishes, to control the current expenditure of institutions of higher education in a way which we do not believe is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Robbins Report on Higher Education in Britain stated on page 275 that it was in favour of control of higher education through general block grants administered through an independent committee or commission appointed for its expert qualifications and not for its political affiliations.  In An tÚdarás I would hope we would have this independent committee or commission.  I do not see why we should not also have the administration involving the use of general block grants which the Robbins Committee also thought was worthwhile.  Obviously there has to be a balance between the <Col N="1496" /> co-ordination of university and other higher institutions generally and the need to safeguard some form of autonomy within these higher institutions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the present section is dangerously ambiguous in that it makes it possible for the authority to apply all sorts of conditions to the granting of moneys for current expenditure.  There is always a sanction open to An tÚdarás if institutions of higher education become awkward in their requests for money for current expenditure or in their allocation of moneys which they receive under a block grant for current expenditure.  There is always the sanction of the capital grant.  If the institutions prove awkward on current expenditure the Authority, by trimming capital grants appropriately, can ensure more or less directly that the institutions concerned come to heel or at least acquire some sense of proportion in what they are doing.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the only alternative to the kind of amendment we are proposing is to do away completely with the concept of autonomy as it affects institutions of higher education and have direct control.  We are not in favour of this.  We are in favour of an intermediary stage.  We do not believe that this intermediary stage finds adequate expression in the subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to support this amendment for the reason that Senator Horgan has given and the importance of giving a certain flexibility to the universities in relation to current expenditure.  As is pointed out in the Dáil Debates and as is evident to anybody who has any knowledge of the universities, there is a certain area in which it might not be on a manpower basis, that they might not be incredibly efficient in their current expenditure, and yet it is part of the meaning of the university and there must be economy in this area and there must be flexibility.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a statement made by the Minister in the Dáil on Committee Stage.  The reference is the Dáil Official Report for 1st April, 1971, column 2014.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the matter of the right of An tÚdarás to attach conditions to <Col N="1497" /> payment of the recurring grant.  This is included so that An tÚdarás may, in consultation with an institution, agree to fund some new activity or area of study on an experimental basis.  Such an arrangement might be associated with the development of a particular centre of excellence in the institution concerned.  An tÚdarás and the institution could consult closely in such a case during a trial period of several years when the value and desirability of proceeding with the experiment could be assessed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I do not thing that this attaching of conditions of current expenditure is necessarily confined to that. As the wording of the section now stands, I think An tÚdarás would be entitled to attach all sorts of conditions to current expenditure and could emasculate the autonomy of the universities in relation to this.  This is a danger that the universities appreciate.  An tÚdarás would be able to declare certain departments, certain small faculties, certain rather rarified research in universities, not to be sufficiently related to Irish life or Irish employment to be worthwhile continuing.  I do not think this is a function the Higher Education Authority ought to have but by the present wording of section 12 it would be possible for the Higher Education Authority to do this.  Perhaps this second amendment is one which the Minister might be prepared to accept on the grounds that it would give the Authority the power to grant capital expenditure with whatever conditions it sees fit attached to it, but to give flexibility in relation to the working out of and speeding of the current grant because the amount has been given in the form of a block grant and not an itemised grant with conditions attached.</P>
    <P>The Minister must appreciate this as a very important principle in the university.  It is one which is at the centre of university autonomy.  It is one which is very important for the development of research in this country.  It is one thing to decide that a particular type of study or research or teaching is fairly far from the employment possibilities in this country.  Even the teaching of <Col N="1498" /> classics or research in classics might be said to be remote from the Irish scene; yet if the condition were to be attached to this&mdash;that either they must have more students next year or some such condition&mdash;if a particular faculty were run down it could probably never be built up again.  This would be very bad for the university, very bad for the concept of teaching and autonomy in the university.  There is a great difference between the flexibility necessary in relation to current grants and the control desirable in relation to capital grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment suggested might give a greater feeling of autonomy to the university but it might in fact have a bad result for the university because it might mean that they would get less.  I can see many cases in which An tÚdarás would be willing to give an additional amount of money provided certain conditions, provided their point of view about a certain thing were recognised, but if they are not allowed to do this they would give a smaller block grant.</P>
      <P>What the university has to weigh up in circumstances such as this is the importance of autonomy on the one hand and on the other hand whether it is worth while having a certain dialogue with An tÚdarás and by agreeing to certain conditions get some extra money. If they feel the conditions are onerous they need not agree but it may mean they will get considerably less money. On balance this might be a disadvantage to the universities and I am not so sure that they would want this amendment if, in the long run, it meant that they would get less money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow up what Senator Ryan has said because it is the heart of this particular amendment.  He has suggested that the universities might end up, if this amendment were passed, getting less money than they might otherwise have. What is attempted to be preserved here is the autonomy of the universities which in the past has allowed universities to make the decision to take less money rather than do what central authority wanted them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that the Bill as it <Col N="1499" /> stands would allow them to do this. No matter how much or how little money they get under the section as it stands, An tÚdarás can attach conditions to the spending of it. Universities have in the past, on occasions, under the university grants committee, as I mentioned during the Second Stage, refused to follow recommendations and guidelines of the university grants committee.  They have in consequence suffered financial cuts. It is this freedom to make up their minds in a particular instance, to forego certain funds rather than to be told they must do certain things, which is the concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>If this amendment were passed it would not mean that there would be no sanction at all in the hands of An tÚdarás.  An tÚdarás will annually be able to control, be able, in the light of what a university has done in the past year, to make up its mind how much it should properly be given for the ensuing year or longer period.  It is empowered under this Bill to look for information in regard to the way in which last year's grant has been spent.  But if this section as it stands is passed without this amendment, quite irrespective of the level, it does not merely permit a certain portion or a small portion of the current grant to be earmarked but it would allow the whole of the current grant to be earmarked.  That is the position that the universities feel may lead to a restriction of their freedom far beyond what is required in the interests of the common good at the moment.  Universities are quite content that there should be some restriction of their autonomy in this regard but not the extent of this section as it stands in its unamended form.</P>

      <P>As I see it, the main part of this subsection relates to block grants.  I take it that you do not get <i>carte blanche</i> for the expenditure of an amount of money without any allocation, whether it is for capital or current expenditure.  It would be bad to have something like that in the universities. This section is one which gives An tÚdarás some power to deal with different faculties in the universities. If they did not have this it would be <Col N="1500" /> taking away a good deal of their power. They could just wave them goodbye and refuse to give any information that should be forthcoming.  This amendment would not only be taking away their power but also would be getting away from having two allocations, one for capital and the other for current expenditure.  This would be a very bad business.  This is a very important section because it is giving a fair amount of power to An tÚdarás and it needs no amendment.  This amendment, if agreed to, would certainly weaken An tÚdarás.</P>

The distinction between capital and current which Senator Crinion is urging is in the amendment and not in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the case made by my colleagues here on the necessity for this.  It is at the very centre of university autonomy: the autonomy in a given period to spend their current grant as they think fit. This does not mean that there is any element of wrongdoing, or of taking money from one desirable project and putting it into another that is less desirable, because at the end of the year it has to be accounted for.  It is the normal freedom that universities always require in dealing with current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been on the board of some bodies, the Institute for Advanced Studies in particular, which is supposed to have certain features of university autonomy but which is tied hand and foot to the Department of Education. All sorts of day-to-day decisions on using money to the best advantage have to be checked back in a way that no university would tolerate.  What is asked for here is in line with what the University Grants Committee in England recognise as normal practice.  If <Col N="1501" /> that has been good enough in socialist Britain with all its managerial tendencies, then surely it is good enough here.  Might I ask the Minister to show that the Seanad is making some contribution to this Bill by going some way to meet our suggestions here. Otherwise we will be inclined to feel that the consultations with various bodies which are embodied in the Bill are much like the consultations that are going on between the Minister and the personnel of the Seanad.  We are advancing cases and at all times we are simply being refused.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to show a bit of give and take in this&mdash; give and take that is in line with what we enjoyed when the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley brought an Education Bill before us, or when Mr. de Valera himself piloted the Agricultural Institute Bill through this House.  In both instances the Seanad was treated as a mature body and the opinions expressed were regarded as opinions genuinely held as coming from people who had some competence in the subject of education.  I would appeal to the Minister to treat the House in this adult fashion.</P>

      <P>The debate in the Seanad on the various amendments to sections of this Bill has been an exceptionally good one and will be of considerable assistance to An tÚdarás when they become a statutory body. This does not mean that I should accept amendments if I do not feel that they should be accepted.  Many of these amendments are amendments which have been thrashed out at considerable length in the Dáil.  Prior to the debate there I had a part in the formulation of the Bill.  I studied the sections of the Bill very carefully.  I studied them also in relation to the discussion in the Dáil and I have since made it my business to examine very carefully the amendments put forward.  If I have not accepted them it is not that I do not take it that Senators opposite have put them down in good faith, but simply that I do not think that they improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very interested in one aspect.  I find on the one hand amendments <Col N="1502" /> put down here where Senators have spoken very strongly of An tÚdarás having freedom of action, and on the other hand I find amendments put down to curtail this freedom. The purport of this amendment is to remove in regard to current grants to institutions the proviso that such grants, as well as capital grants, be made in such manner and under such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit. The anxiety of the Senators who have proposed this amendment is, apparently, to ensure that there will be no element of earmarking in the recurrent grant paid to any particular institution; that is to say, that An tÚdarás will not specify that any particular amount in the total recurrent grant be applied to any particular purpose or activity.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of this allegedly sacred principle that there must be no earmarking in relation to recurrent grants.  It has been stated here that this is an invasion of the autonomy of an institution.  This, of course, is not so. Under the present system of payment of recurrent grants to universities there is already an element of earmarking which is quite acceptable to those institutions.  For example, in relation to equipment renewals, repairs, adaptation and such like payment is made only on receipt of vouchers for expenditure incurred.  I do not see any reason why An tÚdarás could not have the same discretion in this matter as my Department has had up to the present and which the institutions concerned have accepted as reasonable and normal.</P>
    <P>It is possible that, for example, an institution of higher education might propose a new course for a limited or trial period.  I have mentioned such cases already in the Dáil.  In such instances it would be normal for the institution concerned to seek a definite sum for such a project.  It is also normal when the total amount for current expenditure is being notified to an institution to state that it contains a sum for a particular project.  Earmarking of this nature has always been accepted. It has been welcomed in so far as it ensures that the money will be available for the project and not spent on something else.</P>
    <P>I would add, as I did in the Dáil, <Col N="1503" /> that there could be no question of interference with the day-to-day running of the institutions of higher education. I am sure Senators are aware that the vast bulk of the current money would be committed in such a way as to allow even the institutions of higher education themselves very little discretion in regard to it.  In relation to the number of points I have mentioned where earmarking could be useful, and is useful and accepted, we should not tie the hands of An tÚdarás.  There can be no question of An tÚdarás interfering with the day-to-day running of the institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, in the case of capital sums, it could happen that because one institution did not proceed as rapidly as expected with a project and another institution proceeded more rapidly than expected a transfer of money would be necessary and proper in such a case and that, I accept, is included in the amendment. Nevertheless, I feel, from a study I have made of this matter, that we should not tie the hands of An tÚdarás here.  It would be only in very exceptional circumstances that they would interfere in any way with the spending of current money.  As I have already said, it would be very difficult for them to do so. Basically, I think they are entitled to and should have a right in the instances I have mentioned, and in relation to other small items that might crop up from time to time, to have a certain discretion in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not strike me as being a particularly arrogant man and yet I find his conviction that this is a perfect Bill in a sense an arrogant conviction.  The Minister said these matters in relation to section 12 were raised in the Dáil. We have read the relevant portions of the Dáil Official Report, and, in fact, some of it will be on the record of the Seanad as well.  The Minister says he has thought about this matter.  Has he consulted the universities?  Has he consulted the <i>ad hoc</i> HEA that exists at present?  He seems to look into his own heart, decides the section is perfect as it stands and that he will not consider any amendment to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> The argument has been very well made here that there is an important difference between capital and current expenditure in relation to the universities and that the proper method for the payment of current expenditure is by means of a block grant.  I do not accept that the Minister has given adequate reply to this argument when he says that in relation to some matters of current expenditure now they are itemised and the bills are presented.  These can be presented to An tÚdarás when they are deciding the size of the block grant to the university.</P>
    <P>This is, I think, a detail and it does not answer the argument that what is sought here is essential to university autonomy, essential to the general principle of the university being allowed to decide its own priorities in current expenditure and its own distribution of current expenditure when the block amount, the amount that the community is prepared to give the university for education, for current expenditure has been decided.  Capital grants can be itemised and conditions attached to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not really accepted this very important principle.  His mind is not as open as he would have us believe in regard to this matter.  He has not consulted those who will be implementing the scheme and those to whom it is a matter of great concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if we were to accept the Minister's point that it might at times be desirable to earmark a portion of the recurrent grant to an institution for higher education, the section, as he proposes it, goes far beyond this.  The section indicates that any payment to an institution which An tÚdarás makes out of the amounts that they receive &ldquo;shall be made in such manner and subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit.&rdquo;  If there is a conflict between an institution for higher education and An tÚdarás this makes it possible for An tÚdarás to dictate completely to the institution in regard to the courses that it runs and the academic activities which it carries out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as it stands, would allow An tÚdarás to attach a condition that <Col N="1505" /> the university should do a certain thing and make such a condition precedent to the receipt of any money for any purpose outside the particular one that is in dispute between An tÚdarás and the university.  Even if the Minister is not willing to accept the amendment in this form, would he be willing to consider an amendment which would ensure that any conditions attached by An tÚdarás to a grant would be conditions relating only to that particular sum and that particular part of the grant?  The section is absolutely wide open as it stands.  It enables An tÚdarás to decide that there should be a particular course of a specific type in an institution and allows them to force that institution to carry out that course.</P>
    <P>If an amendment of this type were put into the Bill it would not be possible for an institution to divert funds from one project to another.  It would, at least, entitle an institution to say: &ldquo;We do not believe that it is academically desirable for this institution at this time to run this course or carry out this particular activity and we do not want the money for it.  We want to continue on with what we have been doing.  We want to carry out the various other activities on which there has been agreement between An tÚdarás and the institution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister will come back with his old argument that we must expect An tÚdarás to be reasonable in this regard.  However, I think we have to allow in legislation of this kind for the fact that there might well be the temptation to An tÚdarás at any time where there is a sharp conflict of opinion.  They might, in their enthusiasm to see something done, put an academic burden on to an institution of higher education which they did not want to bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An tÚdarás has certain functions under which they are not only entitled, in certain circumstances, to make conditions but they would be obliged, if needs be, to lay down conditions.  If we take general function (d) &ldquo;promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education&rdquo; An tÚdarás might consider that universities should have night classes <Col N="1506" /> but the university in question might resist such a proposal.  An tÚdarás in such a situation would not only be entitled, but obliged, if they had come to the conclusion that this was an essential part of the carrying out of that aim, to make a condition.  That is just one case where An tÚdarás would be obliged, because of its duties and because they are obliged to carry out certain functions, to make conditions in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge has conceded in his contribution just now that there may be certain situations in which conditions would be necessary.  He is arguing that it may be permissible in certain circumstances but that it should not be attached to the whole grant.  If you agree that in certain circumstances&mdash;I merely mentioned one case but I think there must be many cases&mdash;the functions of An tÚdarás would put them in a situation, having made a decision in principle, that they must insist that a university does a certain thing, then they would be under an obligation to lay down conditions.  One should concede the principle that in certain circumstances this may be necessary.  The amendment that has been introduced would not deal with that situation.  You must have in certain cases conditions laid down.</P>

      <P>Could I suggest, in answer to the question that Senator Dooge has asked, that there are various areas of higher education, professional education in particular, that have been subjects of controversy between the university institutions, particularly in Dublin.  However, certain areas have also been agreed: two of these are dental education and veterinary education. It has been agreed that we should have only one veterinary school in Dublin and one dental school.  For the sake of argument, suppose that in a few years' time one of the two universities, or one of the two university institutions in Dublin were to say to An tÚdarás &ldquo;We are going to have a second dental school&rdquo;, surely An tÚdarás would have to have some means of coming back in that situation and saying: &ldquo;No, you cannot, because we shall not give you the money for it&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I can see a great deal of merit from the point of view of the academic institutions in this amendment, but I can also see the Minister's difficulty and the difficulty that An tÚdarás will be in if such an amendment were made.  A phrase should be added to the end of that amendment, such as: &ldquo;Any payment for current expenditure shall be made in the form of block grants in accordance with such developments as have been agreed between the institution and An tÚdarás&rdquo;, so that they may agree on a pattern of development and get a block grant to develop that in the way desired.</P>

      <P>The suggestion ade by Senator Jessop is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> It relates to a development plan. However, you want to safeguard the day-to-day running, over the current period which, in most cases is a year&mdash; An tÚdarás itself or the <i>ad hoc</i> body do not want this power.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has discussed this with them and if they have insisted that they want this power.  No reasonable body of men would look for this power, because it would encourage them to interfere with university affairs beyond what would be good for the university or for the nation.  The body set up is not a university body: it is for all third level education, and the university members, as classified, are in a minority of possibly as little as seven out of 18.  It is therefore, quite possible that the tendency to treat universities in the way that technical schools have been treated in the past&mdash;with all this mania for close control&mdash;could spread to such a body. This would have disastrous effects for the Irish university system.  There is a mania among all for control, and the only person who is reasonable is he who has all the control.  In the case of An tÚdarás versus the Government, the Government have all the power.  Would they always be reasonable in the use of that power?</P>
    <P>At the next level An tÚdarás must have all this absolute and unnecessary power over their bodies and, in turn, we should be depending on their reasonableness.  For a change, why not take it that the universities concerned would be reasonable bodies, and would have to behave in a reasonable way? Consequently, if they put up development schemes, the schemes would have to be discussed with An tÚdarás and, we hope, with the Council of Irish Universities, when that is in the system, and therefore approved of and money given for it.  Having worked out an arrangement in that manner, would anybody be so unreasonable or foolish as to say: &ldquo;Now that we have that money, we shall not spend it on that project this year: we shall spend it on something else, may be on a new dental school&rdquo;.  It is so far-fetched that it should not be advanced in such a serious assembly as Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the present amendment and to accept the <Col N="1509" /> fact that in development schemes both sides will behave reasonably.  Alternatively, I ask him to accept on Report Stage an amendment along the lines suggested by Senator Jessop.</P>

      <P>Some of the remarks made by Senator Quinlan remind me of a number of amendments which, if taken as a whole and accepted, would mean that An tÚdarás would be absolutely free of any interference by the Minister, and the universities would be absolutely free of any interference by An tÚdarás.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though Senator Dooge has anticipated me, we must accept that An tÚdarás will be composed of responsible people.  There could be no question of forcing an institution to undertake a burden that it does not want to bear.  On the other hand, if an institution accepts such a burden subject to certain conditions An tÚdarás should be empowered to see that the conditions are carried out. There is no point in saying that An tÚdarás would have information available to it at the end of the year: that is tantamount to locking the stable door after the horse had gone.</P>
      <P>I consider that the case I have put up here in favour of the section, as opposed to the amendment, is a reasonable one. I have pointed out that, insofar as current expenditure is concerned, there could be very little interference with it in any case.  It is purely theoretical to suggest that An tÚdarás could interfere with any section of it.  On the other hand, An tÚdarás should have the right to ensure that money allocated for a particular purpose, and earmarked for that purpose, should be used for that purpose.  I cannot therefore accept the amendment.</P>

I note in section 17 (2):</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás shall not accept a gift if the conditions attached by the donor are inconsistent with the functions of An tÚdarás.</P>
      <P>We might give the same flexibility to the universities.  The universities need not accept a grant if the conditions attached are contrary to the views of the institution itself.</P>

      <P>We had a discussion this morning as to whether the amounts to be paid to An tÚdarás should be a single amount or two amounts.  I am sorry to confuse the issue by bringing in the question of a third amount which might be itemised in the Estimates. The financial provision to be made for education and institutions of higher education does consist of three parts. It consists of firstly, the payment of capital grant, secondly, the payment to the institutions for current grants and, thirdly, it consists of the payment of scholarships and support grants to those attending the institutions of higher education.</P>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister has said in the other House and in this House that it is the intention that the payment of such grants, the conditions and administration for such grants are to continue to be the concern of the Department if not of An tÚdarás.  I believe that there is a case to be made&mdash; I am not saying it is a compelling case&mdash; in the interests of co-ordination that perhaps sometime in the future it might be desirable that these payments should be made through An tÚdarás. They would, in their planning of educational development have regard to their objective, to which Senator Ryan referred a few moments ago, of the equalisation of opportunity in regard to higher education.  They will be advising the Minister in this regard.  I should like to ask the Minister does this Bill and this section as they stand exclude the possibility that at some time in the future the handling of these payments will be by An tÚdarás.</P>

      <P>I realise there are certain advantages in the county councils being involved.  The universities themselves were able to deal with the county councils under the old universities scholarship scheme.  The registrars of the colleges were continually in communication with the county councils in regard to scholarships and the progress of students.  But if that were the only reason for this retention it is not a very compelling reason.</P>
      <P>If we look at the financing of the current expenses of higher education we are in the position that the recurrent grants which are covered by this section are given to the universities for the carrying out of certain activities in regard to research and also for the financing of the teaching activities of the universities&mdash;not for the complete amount of this financing because we still have fees and in the case of students in certain categories these fees are met by portion of their grants. These things are intertwined.  I would ask the Minister to keep an open mind on this and not to assume that for the convenience of administration, which might well mean in the end for the sake of not having to change the administrative scheme, he should not close his mind to possible changes in this regard.</P>

      <P>Arising out of this section regarding the money provided by the Oireachtas and the Minister's scheme, which does not have statutory sanction yet, by which he agrees to give a certain block grant to An tÚdarás for capital and for current, I understand that in that case An tÚdarás would proceed to make subdivisions and would notify the amounts to the Minister and have them published in the Book of Estimates.  That is the procedure, is it not?</P>
      <P>Everything is done in a hurry when the Book of Estimates comes.  There is only a short interval between the notification of the grants and it would seem that An tÚdarás would have a very short interval in which to assign the grants.  If they get what they ask for they will have no difficulty in assigning it but, on the other hand, if the national economy creates a situation in which they will have a severe cutback on what they have asked it would then become a very difficult task to know how should the money be apportioned.  It is something that could take quite a long time. It would certainly be longer than the short interval between the notification to An tÚdarás of what they are to receive and the publication in the Book of Estimates.  Is there any provision for changing those figures.  An tÚdarás might not be in a position to allocate all they had and might decide to leave it over some for a few months until they had made some further investigations.</P>

It is all right where what has been agreed between the various institutions and an tÚdarás is granted, what will happen if the exigencies demand, as happened this year, an increase of £200,000 and we are given only £120,000 without any guidance as to how we are to bridge the gap?

      <P>On the Second Reading I mentioned that there was a deficiency in the amount granted by the Government to pay for An tÚdarás.  As an example I quote a figure of £500,000. This money is allocated for capital purposes and certain works have been on foot.  &ldquo;On foot&rdquo; can have different meanings.  It can mean that a project is just at the planning stage or that building is in progress.  Under section 12, money is allocated to An tÚdarás, and if money is to be spent economically on projects, it should grant the necessary money to any institution that has work on foot.  If it gets a block grant which is less than the amount requested, it will, under section 12, have to reduce either capital sums to other institutions or sums allocated for current expenditure. If the Department will not give to An tÚdarás the money it is looking for how is a project which is in progress to be dealt with?  Will it be delayed for another year or two?</P>

      <P>The amendment is to ensure that when An tÚdarás, under section 13, institutes and conducts studies on such problems as higher education and research as they consider appropriate they shall publish reports of such studies.  On the Second Reading of the Bill Senator Nash put forward the idea that there ought to be an obligation on An tÚdarás to publish, and I heartily agreed with him on this. It is to be welcomed that An tÚdarás has the power to initiate studies both on problems of higher education and research.  It is the appropriate body to initiate studies.  It will have the wealth of exchange of views from its various members.  It will presuambly conduct these studies in the areas where it is necessary and it will have the better resources with which to do it, which will be voted under a separate section of this Bill.  This could be a fruitful field in relation to both higher education and research.  We must impose on An tÚdarás a duty to publish these reports. There is a tendency in setting up certain bodies not to impose a duty to publish. Thinking in my own narrow context, I bring to mind the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  I do not think it had a duty to publish its various reports and certainly not all of them have been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few people will deny that there is too little research taking place in this country, too little study being made into various problems and there is a need for <Col N="1517" /> information, particularly in relation to higher education.  If we are funding a particular research project, if we are allowing the Higher Education Authority either to commission outsiders to carry on research, or to have it done in one of the institutions of higher education, there ought to be a duty to report.  There ought to be this communication with the people.  It ought to be possible to buy this report and to study it.  The cost of this report would be much less than the cost of various studies being conducted and no finished report being made on them.  It would to some extent be a guarantee that there would be a conclusive study done, that there would be a finished project on which there might be a report.  As the section stands at the moment it is merely an enabling section.  &ldquo;An tÚdarás may institute and conduct studies&rdquo;, and then a further clause, &ldquo;may publish reports on such studies&rdquo;, so that one might have a series of studies on which there was no evidence to which one could look.</P>
    <P>One reason to give a discretion as to whether to publish reports in this area might be if it was felt that there was a necessity for secrecy.  I do not think that this could possibly operate in education.  I would hate to think that we considered that An tÚdarás might conduct private studies into higher education or research in this country which were not in the public interest. I think the Minister and all the Senators will accept that higher education and research in this country are very much matters of public interest.  It is impossible to conceive of An tÚdarás instituting a study under section 13 which was not a matter which ought to be reported on.  Therefore there should be this duty to report, a duty which can be enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like again to support Senator Robinson and also speak in support of the amendment which is down in the name of Senator Kelly.  I think it is better than the one which we originally framed.  My concern in this&mdash;and I will not repeat any of Senator Robinson's arguments; indeed I agree with them&mdash;is on a fairly narrow focus.  In the situation in which we exist at the moment in which <Col N="1518" /> the whole business of higher education generally is becoming increasingly complex, information is at a premium.  In this situation it becomes very difficult for anybody who is not in possession of adequate information and of all the information available to make plans. I would hold that the right to make plans and proposals for higher education should not be restricted to the Government or, indeed, even to An tÚdarás.  This is particularly relevant at a time in which the financial provision for the staffing of the Houses of the Oireachtas has come in for such criticism.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that political parties and certainly Members of the Oireachtas are entitled to the statistical information which may be gathered by An tÚdarás under this section and which should not be withheld simply because it may prove an embarrassment to the Government in power or, indeed, to any political party.  I am not concerned how this information is made available, but I am concerned that it should not be kept secret.  I would certainly be prepared to relax at least my opposition to the section in its present form if we got an assurance from the Minister or, better still, an amendment from him, which would establish the right of Members of the Oireachtas at least to access to the statistical information which has been assembled by An tÚdarás by the spending of public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like on behalf of Senator Kelly to put forward the second of these amendments.  As far as I know this section, as it stands, is an improvement on the section as originally introduced, but I still find myself a little doubtful when I hear from the ministerial seat in Bill after Bill that there is really no point is discussing the difference between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because, apparently, according to the draftsman, there is no real difference between them.  Although there does not appear to be any real difference between them, it is always &ldquo;may&rdquo; that is put in the Bill and left in it.  One would think that, if there was no real difference between them, we might get &ldquo;may&rdquo; 50 per cent of the <Col N="1519" /> time and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; 50 per cent of the time. If only in the interests of statistical variety I might suggest to the Minister that he might put &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in in this particular regard.  In the amendment in the form proposed by Senator Kelly there is also included the phrase &ldquo;shall as soon as may be&rdquo;.  There is no desire here to insist on immediate publication, but the purpose of the amendment is that within a reasonable time publication should be made.</P>
      <P>Public funds will be spent on all the activities of An tÚdarás and if it is to make these studies it is, I think, reasonable that the public and those sections of the public who are particularly interested in these problems should have the full benefit of the results.  Again, it can be said that this can all be left to the discretion of An tÚdarás, that it will publish 95 per cent of the time and that the five per cent of the time they do not publish there will be good reason for it. As far as one can gather the present <i>ad hoc</i> HEA has shown itself determined to publish even when there were voices counselling that publication should not be made.  It is probable that the final statutory body would also be in favour of publication.  Nevertheless, on balance I think there is a case here that this work is so important and of such great public interest that we should, in fact, in this section not merely permit An tÚdarás to do something but we should give them a public commission to investigate these problems, giving them with due regard to their academic autonomy, a free choice of the subject of investigation but no choice to keep the results to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If this section were amended as proposed it could mean, as I have said on many occasions in the Dáil, that An tÚdarás would be obliged to publish a report on every minor investigation which it carried out and which might and could be construed as a study.  We must take it that An tÚdarás can be relied upon to publish the results of every study of major or worthwhile character and that it will act in accordance with the principles and integrity to which all genuine workers in research adhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> Nobody can suggest that the <i>ad hoc</i> body has been averse to publishing reports.  It has, in fact, published quite a number of reports although it is only in existence a relatively short time.  I do not know what voices were raised against the publication of any of the reports.  Certainly mine was not one of them, but I would like to underline the fact that An tÚdarás can publish whether the Minister likes it or not.  I am not sure if I understood Senator Horgan correctly when he said that political pressure might be put on them to refrain from publishing something the Government did not like.  I made some reference to this in relation to its first report when I pointed out that, despite the fact that I felt a certain sum of money was sufficient to do the work and that it felt that a considerably higher sum was needed for this purpose, it published what it believed to be the correct amount.  This in itself, apart from any other consideration, underlines the autonomy of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>It has published quite a considerable number of reports: the first report was discussed on the Second Stage of this Bill here, there were also the teacher training report and the report on the Higher Institute of Education in Limerick.  It has also furnished a report on Ballymun which will be published. If we were to make the change that is suggested here in the amendment it would mean that it would have to publish all sorts of minor matters, studies perhaps of some consequence to a direct problem but of relatively little consequence generally.</P>
    <P>We can be assured that the new statutory body, when it is set up, will be equally anxious to make available to the public all the investigations it makes.  I could not accept that we should make a change here because it would mean that An tÚdarás would have to publish every relatively minor study. I might also say, for Senator Horgan's information, that it is intended that it should publish statistical information annually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for that clarification from the Minister.  I sympathise with the Minister's unwillingness to commit the Authority to anything enormously troublesome like this, but I see it as rather unlikely that <Col N="1521" /> the Authority, which is a national body operating on a national scale, should commission any studies or investigations which would not have some national relevance.  It will not commission a study on the number of first art students in the year 1963, because this sort of information is already available.  The sort of study which it seems to me it is likely to commission is one which will have both a local and a national relevance.  I would be interested, indeed, in more information from the Minister about this statistical information which he says will be available, whether it will be available simply as an appendix to the report.  What I had in mind is that the Authority should perhaps make available copies of whatever reports it may commission in the Library of the Oireachtas or elsewhere, so that at least the facts, which in themselves are neutral, would be available for people whose duty it is to study them and to make plans in relation to them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 4, to delete &ldquo;such and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put forward this amendment on behalf of Senator Kelly.  It is concerned with a point which arose on the Second Stage.  Subsection (1) says:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any real point of principle between the Minister and ourselves on this matter.  The Minister has indicated that the intention is that the establishment of the staff of An tÚdarás should be subject to his approval, that the number of persons to be appointed, and possibly the classes of persons to be appointed, should be matters on which An tÚdarás should have the approval of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If An tÚdarás were to be a really autonomous body in the sense of our State-sponsored bodies, this of course would not be the condition.  Nevertheless, for the purposes of the discussion of this amendment I want to leave that matter aside.  What I am concerned with on this amendment is whether the <Col N="1524" /> phrase which is used &ldquo;such and so many persons&rdquo; is the most appropriate phrasing to give effect to what the Minister says his intention is.  It would seem to me that this phrase could very easily be interpreted that An tÚdarás may appoint such persons as it thinks fit, subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>If this is not to refer to the imposition of ministerial sanction on the appointment of any particular individual, surely it would be better to use some phrase such as &ldquo;An tÚdarás may appoint such classes of persons and so many persons in each class, subject to the approval of the Minister if he thinks this proper&rdquo;. I do not think there is any point of principle at issue here.  What we are concerned with is whether in fact the phrasing here &ldquo;such and so many persons&rdquo; gives real effect to what the Minister wants to see in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kelly, on the Second Reading of this Bill, mentioned this and so did I.  I said that the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; was an unfortunate word, because it some minds it might refer to specific people.  I am giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt in this&mdash; that what he really meant is what Senator Dooge has said; &ldquo;the grades or classes of people to be appointed&rdquo;.  It is such an ambiguous phrase in this context that I think it should be removed and some other words should be substituted for &ldquo;classes or grades&rdquo; of persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another objection that I see and I referred to this also on Second Reading.  Towards the end of section 14, in the last line of subsection (1) the words &ldquo;from time to time thinks proper&rdquo; appear.  I said at the time that the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; conflicted with the Minister's statements in winding up the Second Reading.  He said then that it referred only to the first appointments.  This phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; seems to me to conflict with the statements of the Minister when he was answering the debate on the Second Reading in the Dáil because &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;on the first occasion&rdquo;&mdash;it means that he can at any time interfere in the appointment of the officers or servants.  Those are the two points I wanted to bring out here.  The Minister <Col N="1525" /> did not reply to me on the Second Reading here in the Seanad about my bringing out these two particular points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, in fact, refer to this particular matter in replying on the Second Stage.  This subsection empowers An tÚdarás to appoint such and so many persons to be officers and servants, and so on, as they from time to time think proper and to exercise that power subject to the approval of the Minister.  I think I mentioned when replying to the Second Stage that &ldquo;such and so many&rdquo; in this legal context refers to types and numbers of posts and not to individual appointees.  I am informed that it is the normal practice with regard to statutory bodies of this type that the categories or grades of posts and the number of posts to be created in the different categories or grades will be decided by the body concerned, subject to the approval of the appropriate Minister.  I want to em-phasise that &ldquo;such and so many&rdquo; does not refer to the actual individual persons to be appointed, but to the types of posts and the number of posts of each type to be filled.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly's amendment would mean that, while the approval of the Minister would be required as to the number of persons to be appointed, it would not be needed in relation to the grading of the different posts, and I do not think that is logical.  With regard to the second part of Senator Belton's query about &ldquo;from time to time thinks fit&rdquo;; this refers to An tÚdarás.  It could mean that after the first appointments are made at some stage or other An tÚdarás might feel that they wanted further types or numbers of officers or servants and that they would then come to me and ask for my approval for this.  It is not the Minister; it is An tÚdarás.</P>

      <P>There might be a misunderstanding here, because what I was concerned with there was that when the posts would be first created I would be consulted in relation to them.  I <Col N="1526" /> would not be consulted in relation to the individuals to be appointed to those posts.  In the creation of different types of posts it might be possible that An tÚdarás would feel that something new was necessary in relation to creation of the posts and they would come to me in regard to that.</P>

      <P>The Minister more or less said that this has been going on and that there is a precedent, in fact.  This has been going on for such a time that such a meaning is given to the word &ldquo;such&rdquo;.  The longer we perpetuate it, the more the argument will be in favour of the Minister.  It is time &ldquo;such&rdquo; were changed.  The longer it goes on the greater flexibility it will gather.</P>
      <P>I should like the drafting of all sections and subsections in any legislation to be clear and unambiguous.  The phrasing of certain legislation that we have had before us recently is such that there are lawyers around the country who could drive a horse and cart through it.  It is words like &ldquo;such&rdquo; in this context that enables them to make their money.</P>

      <P>If this is something that has been accepted on a number of occasions recently, I think I have every reason for putting it in.  If the Senator is waiting for the time when we will be able to bring legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas so perfect that nobody will be able to find a loophole somewhere or other in it, he will be waiting for a long time.  I have pointed out that in this legal context the phrase <Col N="1527" /> refers to types and numbers of posts. This is to be found in a number of other Acts and therefore it cannot be interpreted in any other way.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consult with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and arrange for either one or other of two types of seminars to be held&mdash;one on parliamentary drafting for legislators or, alternatively, one in plain English for parliamentary draftsmen.  A burden is put upon us in the House.  The fact that this has gone on and has been subject, in their own words, to an effluxion of time is no reason why we should continue in this fashion.  The plain reading of this is that it refers to individuals.  Yet the Minister has said what is concerned with here are posts.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the parliamentary draftsman could not have drafted this in some way to say that &ldquo;An tÚdarás may establish such and so many posts as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it may from time to time think proper and may appoint to such posts such persons as it thinks proper&rdquo;. This, I feel, would be closer to the Minister's intention.  I would ask the Minister to be brave in this regard.  Let him go back to the draftsman and ask if this paragraph could be brought a little closer to plain meaning without danger to the constitutional fabric of the State.</P>

      <P>I must come to the defence of the parliamentary draftsman in this case.  I do not see anything wrong with this.  If the draftsman wanted to do so he could spell it out in detail and say &ldquo;An tÚdarás may appoint such persons as have passed certain examinations, have certain qualifications and appear in one way or other to be proper&rdquo;.  In that sense it means &ldquo;such persons as have the qualifications that are necessary&rdquo; so that An tÚdarás may appoint such persons and so many of these persons <Col N="1528" /> as it thinks have the required qualifications.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he does not wish to have the power of approval of disapproval of the individual appointments.  This is what the point at issue is.  In fact, the Minister wishes to have power over the establishment of the posts but not over the appointment of the persons.  To my mind whether he exercises that power or not, the plain reading of this section is that the Minister has power over the appointment of the persons.</P>

If I were to interfere with the individual appointments I am certain I could be pulled up quickly on the basis of the section at present in the Bill.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Dooge in relation to the use of plain English but in this particular circumstance&mdash;as this is the legal interpretation I have received&mdash;I had better stand by this.  The very fact that I have interpreted it here as in the Dáil will ensure that this is the manner in which the appointments will be carried out.  If any Minister&mdash;be it myself or any of my successors&mdash;were to try to interfere in a matter such as this one would not only be able to rely on the legal definition of the words but could also rely on the interpretation put on it by me here.</P>

      <P>On section 15, I should like to return to a point which I raised on Second Stage.  While the Minister has indicated that it is an open question as to whether or not the chairman of An tÚdarás should be full-time or part-time there is a possibility that, at some time in the future there would be a full-time chairman.  I <Col N="1529" /> take it that the chairman would not be an officer or servant and accordingly would not be covered by the superannuation scheme.  In the event of a chairman serving for a long period of time would his superannuation have to be the subject of personal legislation? Also, is it the intention that An tÚdarás would be designated under the Superannuation Act, 1963&mdash;which I would call the mobility Superannuation Act&mdash; so that pension rights may be carried from the Civil Service, semi-State bodies or institutions of higher education?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My trouble is that I can see this point in regard to everyone else but the chairman.  Can the chairman come under the superannuation scheme of section 15?  If he comes as chairman and serves ten years his previous service would be the subject of a transfer under the Superannuation Act, 1963, but what about his service under An tÚdarás?  Can the chairman come under this superannuation scheme?  The real nub of the question is whether, in fact, he can be considered as part of the permanent staff under section 15 (1).</P>

      <Col N="1531" /> An tÚdarás may appoint a committee or person to advise it on matters relating to its functions.</P>
    <P>The people who constitute An tÚdarás are supposed to be some of the best educated people, and I am not sure of the necessity of appointing a subcommittee to advise them on matters relating to their functions.  Surely a Higher Education Authority ought to have sufficient ability without needing anybody to advise them on matters relating to their functions?  If they step outside their functions, either the Minister or the institutions of higher education will soon point that out to An tÚdarás.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that An tÚdarás would consist of very highly qualified people, however, it would be physically impossible for all the members to be involved in all the investigations that they would carry out in relation to their functions.  There would be matters which would best be investigated by means of advisory committees, or through the employment of expert consultants on a fee basis.  Already there are two advisory committees operating under the terms of reference given to the existing <i>ad hoc</i> Authority.  One of them is examining the question of organising a regular flow of statistical information to An tÚdarás from higher educational institutions. The data will cover students, staff, costs and so on.  The committee is examining the possibility of getting these statistics in a common form from all the institutions through the computer centres in the universities and the technological colleges.  They are also considering how computer centres in higher educational institutions generally might develop in the future.  Another advisory committee is considering the question of the adoption of a common accounting year and a common form of accounts by all the institutions funded by An tÚdarás.  The members of these committees are drawn from the universities, from technological colleges, Government Departments, An tÚdarás itself and so on.  This section empowers An tÚdarás to appoint committees or persons to advise on matters of the <Col N="1532" /> kind described, to pay fees and allowances in respect of services.</P>

      <P>To add to paragraph 2 the following sub-paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;()  No vacancy among the members of An tÚdarás shall remain unfilled for longer than six calendar months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was making my Second Reading speech I referred to this matter and <Col N="1535" /> said that I would put down an amendment. This is an area in which many of the people who are in the institutions of higher education and perhaps the Higher Education Authority are interested. The section reads:</P>
    <P>The members of An tÚdarás shall be a chairman and not more than eighteen ordinary members of whom at least seven shall be academic members and at least seven shall be other than academic members.</P>
    <P>It then goes on to specify certain things about the chairman of An tÚdarás.  At present the <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority consists of 14 members.  It seems likely that when the full Authority is set up under this Bill the Minister will appoint at least 14 members also.</P>
    <P>However, I do not agree that it is wise to leave the Minister with as many as four vacant seats out of a total of 18. The Minister will plead good faith and, like Senator Kelly, I can agree with him.  I am not the only person who sees in this a sort of threat to the independence of An tÚdarás.  My amendment may perhaps be framed a little strictly. It is possible that an alternative amendment might read:</P>
    <P>At no time shall there be any more than two vacancies among members of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>That might be more acceptable to the Minister.  I am open to suggestion on this.</P>
    <P>To have 30 per cent or more of the membership of An tÚdarás in the gift of a Minister for Education is too great a temptation for any Minister or for any Government.  If An tÚdarás, as is almost certain, crosses swords with this Minister or some other Minister for Education on any issue, it might do so in the knowledge that the Minister might be able to swing the balance by appointing people favourable to his point of view.</P>
    <P>The origin of this sense of our needs can be traced to the circumstances in which the <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority was originally appointed.  It was widely rumoured then, and there has been no conclusive evidence to the <Col N="1536" /> contrary, that the people who accepted appointment to the membership of the HEA did so on the assumption that they accepted in advance the broad outlines of Government policy towards the universities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not think that subsequent events can substantiate a charge of servility against members of the Authority.  The circumstances in which these first appointments were made have definitely left a bad taste in many people's mouths.  It is the sort of bad taste that could be reactivated by the suspicion that the Minister could do the same thing again.  I think it only fair to point out that under other sections of this Bill the Minister has all the power he needs to remove members of the Authority, indeed too much power.  It can be argued that if the Minister desires the Authority to adopt a certain course of action the onus should be directly on him, by removing members who are contrary to his point of view and appointing others in their place, to get this course of action accepted by the Authority.  He should not be allowed to adopt a sort of sleight of hand method of keeping a couple of cards up his sleeve to produce them at the appropriate moment.</P>
    <P>This is central to the independence of An tÚdarás.  They would always operate under the shadow of dismissal.  They should not be asked to operate also under the threat that their membership may suddenly and without warning be weighted against the concensus that operates within the Authority itself.</P>

There must be seven academic members and seven members other than academic.  The provision for a maximum membership of 18 in addition to the chairman has been made in the paragraph so that if at any time it were felt desirable that an additional member or members having special competence in particular fields shoul be appointed this could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing <i>ad hoc</i> body consisting of a chairman and 14 ordinary members <Col N="1537" /> has functioned very satisfactorily and has done remarkably good work.  I was not Minister when they were appointed but I am informed that it is not true that the present members were appointed because they accepted the Government view regarding the Dublin university position.  I do not know what their attitude was towards it at the time.  They have, since their appointment, shown themselves to be very independent people.</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás has done remarkably good work and I am not convinced that its efficiency would necessarily be enhanced and its achievements improved if the membership were bigger.  Having considered this matter very carefully I thought it would be well to increase the potential membership of the statutory body to 18 to provide for the contingency I have mentioned.  The Senator suggested that this might be used so that the Minister could add members to the authority to enforce his own viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The Senator suggested that it might be better, if the Minister wished to enforce his viewpoint, that he could remove members who did not agree with him.  I would not accept that the Minister should make changes simply to get his own point of view across.  I am not prepared to agree that there should be a statutory obligation to appoint the full quota of 18, as this is what the acceptance of this amendment would mean in effect.  On the other hand, if I had only 14 members the onus would be on me, in accordance with the Act, to fill a vacancy as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the contingency situations to which he refers can be very adequately dealt with under section 16 (1) and (2) of the Bill.  As I said earlier, perhaps it was a bit much to insist on every vacancy being filled within six months.  If there were even a statutory duty on the Minister to fill at least 17 of the 18 places, this would give some flexibility and quite enough so far as I am concerned.</P>

      <P>Two separate points arise out of amendment No. 21.  There is the question of increasing the complement from 14 to 18.  The Minister has stated there is provision for 18 members on this Authority but he intends to appoint only 14 at the start.  The question arises how much time is he giving himself to bring the complement up to 18.  Is it to be an indefinite period?  What may be more pertinent to the amendment under the names of Senators Horgan and Robinson is this: of the 14 the Minister is initially appointing, supposing vacancies occur among those 14?  The reason for appointing seven academic members is to maintain a certain equilibrium between academics and others on this body.  If the academic representation, either due to death, retirement, dismissal or some other reason, is reduced to six, then disequilibrium will occur on this board. That should not be allowed to continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Senator Horgan mentioned six months and said he was aiming at a fixed time if the Minister would agree. The Minister should have a fixed time in mind when the number would be brought up again to 14.  A fixed time should be inserted there.  The vacancy should not be left indefinitely.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned earlier if I had the 14 members only, the onus would be on me, in accordance with the Act, to fill the vacancy as soon as possible and I would anticipate the filling of the vacancy, in such circumstances, very much more quickly than within six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>Yes.  I have pointed out that, if a vacancy occurs and there are only 14 members of the Authority, I <Col N="1539" /> would anticipate filling the vacancy much sooner than within the time specified by the Senator.  I would feel that the onus was on me to fill it almost immediately.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22.</P>
      <P>To add to paragraph 2 the following sub-paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;()  No more than two academic members of An tÚdarás shall be drawn from the staff of any existing institution of higher education.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment with some hesitation because, like the Minister, I believe strongly that although people should be appointed to An tÚdarás to represent broad areas of interest, they should not be appointed to represent individual institutions or organisations. I will even go so far as to say that this amendment, if it were accepted, might have the affect of encouraging the wrong kind of representative frame of mind among members of An tÚdarás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a political problem that the various institutions of higher education are in a political relationship with each <Col N="1540" /> other and the credibility of an tÚdarás is to some extent weakened if it is thought that any particular institution has an over-weaning influence in An tÚdarás.  Therefore, I have drafted this amendment, not to introduce the principle of representation into the Bill but to ensure equitable distribution geographically if no other way, among the members of An tÚdarás and to make it a more nationally-minded organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I was rather surprised to see this amendment coming from Senator Horgan, because he agreed with my attitude towards this particular body that it should be unrepresentative.  I feel that this amendment would place a restriction on the Government as to the range of persons from which the academic members might be selected.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to state again that the criterion for membership of An tÚdarás should be, and will be as far as the present Government are concerned, the contribution that the individual is likely to make to the work of An tÚdarás having regard to his experience, his knowledge and his ability.  This criterion will apply in the selection of those who are academic members as well as those members who are other than academic. I would not be prepared to accept an amendment which would in any way restrict the range of selection and would debar from membership, for reasons which in my view are not relevant to the work of An tÚdarás, persons who might be eminently suitable and desirable as members.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment in a sense would seem to imply&mdash;I know that this is not the intention of the Senator&mdash; that the academics could not be trusted to act in an objective and unbiased manner as members of An tÚdarás, that they would be influenced by their connections with particular institutions of higher education.  This I do not believe and I must say that my experience of the work of the members of the <i>ad hoc</i> body confirms this view.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-paragraph 6 (1), lines 15 and 16 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;()  The Government, with the prior consent of An tÚdarás, may remove the Chairman or an ordinary member of An tÚdarás from office.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am distressed at this paragraph in its present form and I know that many people who are by no means opponents of Government policy, who include many Government supporters in the university, are equally distressed by it. Its import is clear as indeed is the import of the amendment.</P>
      <P>We have here a straight clash between two ideas.  I can see from the Minister's point of view that he has to maintain some ultimate form of sanction on the control of higher education in this country but it seems to me that to exercise this sanction in terms of membership and personnel of the Authority itself is a very wrong way of doing it.  The sanction that is exercised by any Minister for Education on the control of any sector of the education system in this country is ultimately that sanction which is exercised by the Government through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not see any reason for the introduction of such a provision into the Bill as is here introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> There are two possible motivations behind this of which I would prefer to believe the more innocent one.  The more innocent one is just that the Minister has decided to keep all power in his hands for as long as possible. There is also the malicious interpretation of the facts in that this proviso is yet another instance of the creeping authoritarianism that I referred to earlier, of the unwillingness of the Government to trust people, to put it in no more complicated language.</P>
    <P>I am not as well instructed as I might be in the sort of arrangements that exist for the University Grants Council in Britain but I would doubt very much that they are as draconian as this.  I would be very interested to hear if the Minister can supply any precedents for his action in this section, not in Irish legislation because we have not had any Irish legislation to do with our higher education for quite a long time, but in comparable legislation in other countries.  It is quite possible that the Minister may retain this power with regard to the chairman and members of the Pigs and Bacon Commission or this or that other body, but I doubt very much that he retains it in connection with the board members, for instance, of Bord Fáilte.  Even if he did, I would not regard this as an adequate precedent for the principle that is introduced in this Bill.  I should be interested to hear where there is any other precedent in educational legislation of a comparable nature in any other country for this practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge the Minister to consider softening this paragraph.  The Minister has on quite a few occasions yesterday and today resisted amendments on the grounds of the reasonableness of the persons who would constitute An tÚdarás.  He has told us repeatedly it would be unthinkable that reasonable people such as the members of An tÚdarás would do this or that.  He appears in this part of the Bill to have suddenly lost his confidence in the reasonableness of the members of the Authority.  He appears to wish to give himself power here to remove members of An tÚdarás in bulk because that is the only real difference between the <Col N="1543" /> original proposition and the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his reply on the Second Stage that the situation might arise that any member of An tÚdarás would become so unreasonable, so obstructive that he was a distinct hindrance to the work of the Authority. If that is so, surely nobody would recognise this more clearly than his fellow-members, because nobody would suffer from it more sharply than his fellow-members.  If this situation did occur the Minister should have no difficulty in getting the concurrence of the other members of An tÚdarás in the removal of this obstructive member.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has in his original version taken far too wide a power in this regard.  If such a power is necessary &mdash;I do not wish to concede that&mdash;then surely it is a power which should only be exercised when a member is grossly inefficient, or grossly obstructive, or acting or not acting in a particular way, so as to be a distinct hindrance to the good work of the Authority.  No body of people recognise this more clearly than the members of the Authority who have remained reasonable.</P>

      <P>Is it not putting rather a lot of responsibility, in an unpleasant situation, on the members of An tÚdarás to have to have a vote on this kind of situation?  I do not think that the future members will thank the Seanad for making an amendment placing on them the decision of removing one of their own members.  It seems to me that they would much prefer that the Minister would take that responsibility himself.  As the Minister has the responsibility for putting the member on the board, it is his responsibility, after consultation with the chairman, to take him off.  It is something that the members should not be asked to do.  They are not responsible, were not responsible for putting the man there, and should not have to take the responsibility of voting for or against the proposition to remove him as a member of An tÚdarás.  It is not part of the obligation they undertook in acting on this board and I do not think <Col N="1544" /> it is the kind of obligation that should be placed on them.</P>

Following on this, it seems to me that perhaps it might be sensible if, in the opinion of the majority of the members of An tÚdarás, any member, including the chairman, ceased to be a member of An tÚdarás, this should be certified to the Minister by An tÚdarás and that the Minister should be free either to accept or to reject this advice.

They can tell the Minister that if this man is taken off they are resigning.  That is quite sufficient sanction to deal with that kind of thing.</P>

      <P>Senator E. Ryan has made the case here in relation to these amendments.  I should also like to add that the first and most important aspect of this amendment is that it would place the Government in what would be tantamount to being in a subservient position to An tÚdarás. That is a situation which of course no democratic government could accept. If members of An tÚdarás are appointed by the Government, as provided for in subparagraph 3(1) of the Schedule in the case of the chairman and subparagraph 4(1) in the case of ordinary members, then it is surely logical that the Government should have the authority to remove them from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelly's amendment is very similar to that put forward by Senator Robinson and Senator Horgan except that it is slightly different in wording. But it would mean that the Government, having appointed the members of An tÚdarás, could not remove any member <Col N="1545" /> for any reason whatsoever unless An tÚdarás concurred in his removal. It would in this respect mean that the Government could not act on their own decision without the consent or concurrence of a statutory body of their own creation.  I feel that such a situation would be a negation of the principles of democratically elected Government. For these reasons, as well as for the points put forward by Senator Ryan, I could not accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is right in saying that this is a negation of democracy.  We have a particular form of democracy in this country.  The form of democracy under which the Government are appointed is that they are elected at a general election and then allowed a certain term to prove themselves before they again come before the people.  The same situation would exist if there were no right of removal at all of members of An tÚdarás.  They would be appointed by the Minister and judged, not on part of a term, but on their performance over a full term.  There have been democrats, from the Chartists down to Sun Yat Sen, who held that there was no true democracy without the right of recall of a member at any time.  It is the right of recall which the Minister is seeking to impose here.  It is something which is not present in our ordinary democratic usages and I do not see why it should be imposed here in this particular regard.  I do not think it derogates anything from the authority of the Government that they should have to have the concurrence of the majority of members in coming to the conclusion that an individual, who, within a period of five years, had been thought by them to be eminently suitable for membership of An tÚdarás, is no longer so.  The only thing that can have changed in that period is the way in which this person carries out his duty.  The people who know that best are the other members who have been members of the Authority with the person under discussion.</P>

      <P>This is a very simple and obvious amendment.  It seems to me in a Bill of this kind, the establishment of a body such as An tÚdarás um Ard Oideachas, that you either have an age limit with teeth or you simply do not have one at all.  It seems to me that the age limit of 70 is not one with teeth.  I would not think that 65 has got very much more than a good set of dentures, but at least it is an improvement.  Education at the moment is not only changing rapidly in itself, but the rate of change is increasing in geometric progression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would seriously urge that the age limit be lowered to 65.  This is no great reflection on the over 65's but it is meant to ensure that the persons on the Authority are people who will be in a position to cope adequately with the presumably many demands that will be made on them.  There is the additional difficulty that in this country, especially as people leave middle age and head towards the 60's and 70's, they tend to acquire directorships and all sorts of ancillary obligations which prepare them quite adequately for a very well-cushioned retirement.  In a sense the ancillary, and to some extent, honorary functions, which people acquire as they grow older could inhibit their functions <Col N="1547" /> as a member of a body as exacting as An tÚdarás.  Indeed, this is especially so when we add to this the reflection that, quite simply, their physical powers may be waning.  I would ask the Minister whether the introduction of the word &ldquo;seventy&rdquo; here is simply in line with other legislative instruments of this kind and, even if it is, whether he would not consider that the special demands of An tÚdarás would make 65 a better age limit.</P>

      <P>One very heavy responsibility in this country is that of a High Court judge or a Supreme Court judge. The Supreme Court judges have even from time to time to review the legislation of this House and see whether it is within the provisions of the Constitution. They are considered quite competent to do all their work up to the age of 70; they are considered to have the maturity.  In fact, usually they are at their peak at 65 in many cases.  I think to be limited to 65 years of age for An tÚdarás would be unnecessarily delimiting and perhaps, on occasion, excluding somebody who would be eminently suitable.</P>

I doubt if it is in the minds of the Government that all the members of An tÚdarás should be whole-time members.  I am concerned about the occupational structure of men over 60 in public life in this country who, in many cases, have a vast number of occupations.  I just wonder whether in these circumstances, which are quite distinct from the circumstances of the judges of the Supreme Court who do nothing else and who may in fact in some cases not be doing enough, the two cases can be sharply distinguished.</P>

I do not think we should have an age limit of 65, because many of the people who have been appointed recently are quite bright and can only be on for ten years.  I should <Col N="1548" /> think that when the Minister is appointing members he would take the health aspect into account.  If a man of 65 is healthy and has the necessary experience he should be allowed to go on.  I think most professors continue on for quite a while too.  There are not that many people in the country who are in a position to be appointed or have the ability to be appointed to An tÚdarás and we should hold them as long as we can.  I think 70 is a very reasonable age.</P>

      <P>I might say, first of all, that I was rather intrigued when I saw the original source of this amendment. We had it in the Dáil as well as in this House.  I had also seen it previous to that.  I should like to say to Senator Horgan when he asks what I had in mind in regard to the age of 70, the answer is that, although the age of retirement for university academics starts at 65, in fact they are usually retained on extension to the age of 70. This was one of the matters I had in mind when I fixed the age of 70.</P>
      <P>I think there is no reason to believe that persons who have been appointed to An tÚdarás because of their knowledge, experience and ability in the first instance, would lose effectiveness after the age of 65.  In the present day and age it is accepted that people are not regarded as particularly old at 65 or at 70.  It is also true to say that individuals differ and some people are old at 50 and others are young at 80.  Senator Crinion has said it will not be an easy matter to get an individual who will fit this particular position.  For that reason I feel that a man who is appointed because of his knowledge, experience and ability should be retained to the age of 70.</P>

What we are concerned with here is the unusual circumstances in which we would have seven Irish academics who were absolutely united in their opinion.</P>
    <P>Some regard should be had to miracles of this sort.  If you get this situation there would have to be a remarkably strong reason that would unite these people together.  It is common knowledge that academics are individualistic people, and this is quite proper.  They are people who are, in a way, always eccentric because they have decided to devote their lives to one particular subject and they believe that this is the most important thing there is. When you get a group such as these absolutely firm on one idea, then there must be some underlying principle that transcends all their interests and transcends all their discipline.  What this amendment asks for is that some recognition should be given for this. This amendment is not put forward with any sort of notion that this is something that would happen regularly.  It might never happen.</P>
    <P>One would hope that, even though there is full provision here in the Schedule for the way in which An tÚdarás would vote and the way in which the chairman would give, if necessary, a casting vote, An tÚdarás would rarely vote, rarely decide issues by counting heads.  If this body is to be an effective body and do the job it is charged with doing, then it will only do this by studying the facts and coming to a measure of agreement on what should be done.  I would hope that voting would be rare in An tÚdarás and it would be rarer still that you would have in An tÚdarás a situation where all seven academics were outvoted on a particular issue.  It is these most rare circumstances among the rare that is the subject of this amendment.</P>

      <P>Quite apart from the fact that I do not agree with this, it seems this amendment leaves a question mark. It merely says &ldquo;provided however that no question shall be so determined&rdquo;.  In that case how is it to be determined? The paragraph states that it will be determined by a majority and this merely says that it shall not be so determined.  This leaves the position with the question mark that there is no means of determining the question where all the academics are on one side.</P>

      <P>If the proposer of this amendment, possibly infected by the systems which exist in the European Community of weighted votes and so on, had proposed some workable alternative of determining the question if the way in which it is proposed in the Bill is not acceptable to him, then at least it would make sense.  Merely to say that it shall not be so determined and, in fact, that it shall not be capable of being determined at all, is surely a very unsatisfactory position.  In any event, I see no reason why this should be introduced.  I think it is tantamount to saying that the intelligence and good judgment of the non-academics is not of the same calibre as that of the academics.  It is tantamount to saying what some motor car advertisement of some time ago said: &ldquo;This seven is better than any other ten.&rdquo;  Why should you say that the seven votes of the academics are better than the remaining 11 votes?  I do not think that any self-respecting person would act on An tÚdarás if he was faced with the situation that he could be outvoted by a minority.</P>

      <P>When replying to the Second Reading debate on this Bill I replied to this matter which was raised by Senator Kelly.  He spoke of the academic members of An tÚdarás, when voting together on a particular <Col N="1551" /> matter, as constituting what he called a qualified majority even though they would be in a numerical minority of those voting.  This amendment is designed to give legal force to that concept of a qualified majority.  What, in fact, the amendment proposes is that when all the academic members vote in a particular way they would carry whatever proposition was being voted on, no matter how votes were cast on the opposite side.  This, of course, would mean, as I said in my reply to the Second Stage debate, that if the academic members decided to form a bloc, either permanently or on a particular issue, they could, literally, disfranchise and render powerless the other members of An tÚdarás.  This is a proposal which, in my view, conflicts violently with democratic principles and as such I could not accept it.</P>
      <P>As all members of An tÚdarás will be selected for appointment on the basis of their experience and ability it would be somewhat of an insult to the non-academic members that they should be, as it were, lower grade members of An tÚdarás than their academic colleagues As Senator Ryan has said, I could not imagine the other members of An tÚdarás accepting membership on this basis.  I would hope that, as I have mentioned in my reply on the Second Reading debate, An tÚdarás would not form themselves into blocs of academic and non-academic members.  Accordingly, I feel from all the points I have put forward that I could not possibly accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the Minister in this.  When I first saw the amendment I felt some sympathy with it, but on reflection, my sympathy rapidly dwindled and evaporated.  Such an amendment would, if accepted encourage the seven academic members to act as a bloc.  This is very far from the Minister's intention in appointing them to represent a certain section of the community, namely the academic section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What really turned me against this amendment were the words &ldquo;or include&rdquo;.  While it might be arguable that the Authority which was set up, <Col N="1552" /> basically, to look after institutions of higher education should not take a certain course of action against the united opposition of people from those institutions who are on the Authority, the idea that the inclusion of the votes of those members against a simple majority should negative that majority seems to me to be quite unsustainable The simplest reason of all why this amendment can be opposed is that it basically, does not make any sense.</P>
    <P>Academic members of An tÚdarás, in a sense, shed some of their academic aura once they are appointed.  They are appointed because they are academics but, once they are appointed, they become full members of An tÚdarás.  It would make just as much sense to introduce amendments stating that &ldquo;No question shall be so determined if the minority of the votes consist of or include the votes of all the Catholics of An tÚdarás&rdquo; or &ldquo;the votes of all the left-handed members of An tÚdarás&rdquo; or &ldquo;the votes of winkle pickers of An tÚdarás&rdquo;.  I do not agree with setting up bloc divisions within An tÚdarás on this basis.</P>

If we had this in our own Constitution it would mean that, if all the members of Fine Gael or the Labour Party voted against anything, we could not have a decision.  As Senator Horgan said, it would tend to get people into a bloc and they would control everything. In doing so you would be taking control away from An tÚdarás and getting completely away from the democratic principle which has been accepted in every committee, board and organisation in the country.  It would be even more amazing coming from the Parliament of any country.  I am astonished to find a Member of a House of our Parliament putting forward an amendment like this which implies that the majority vote does not count.</P>

    <P>The last three lines in the section seem to me to be unusually sinister in their implication. I may be very wrong about this, and I would be delighted if the Minister would reassure me on it.  This section, as presently framed, introduces the idea that the authorities of the various institutions of higher education can be made accountable for every penny they spent, not only to An tÚdarás but, in a sense, to the Minister for Education and even to the Minister for Finance. I fail to see why the legislation which is laid down in the first four lines of this section, which seem to me to be quite adequate, should be extended to give the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance, combined, such arbitrary power of direction of the institutions of higher education.

The addition of these words &mdash;the words he wishes to omit from this in his amendment&mdash;seem to be sinister.  I am not referring here to any particular person.  The paragraph reads: ...shall keep in such form as aforesaid all such special accounts as the Minister, on his own motion, or at the request of the Minister for Finance, may from time to time direct.&rdquo;  In other words, it means that, in addition to doing what is correctly set out in the first four lines of paragraph 20, the Minister may request An tÚdarás to keep accounts in a special way even though they have kept accounts in the normal practice as set out in the first four lines.  I do not like the last three lines of paragraph 20 and I agree thoroughly with Senator Horgan that they should be deleted.</P>

They disclose very little, so little as to be practically negative in their effect. If one wanted to know how money was being expended, one would have to see <Col N="1554" /> the actual audited account, which is a completely different thing.  These are the sort of accounts that are provided for here.  Not only must they keep the income and expenditure account and the balance sheet, but they must also keep such special accounts as he requires. That is to say that he can provide that the audited accounts be kept, which deal with the various aspects, and that they can be submitted to him, and they must be submitted in such form as he requires.  Otherwise, he would not have the faintest idea how millions of taxpayers' money is being spent and if it is being spent to advantage. If he is asked to explain to either Houses of the Oireachtas, he could not possibly do so, nor could he stand over it and say: &ldquo;I, personally, as Minister for Education, am satisfied that the taxpayers are getting good value for their money and we, as the Government, stand over it, and stand over this expenditure and accept full responsibility for it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Let me assure Senator Horgan and Senator Belton that there is nothing sinister in these particular lines of the section.  The lines in question provide that An tÚdarás, in addition to keeping all proper and usual accounts of all moneys received and expended by it, shall in particular keep in such form as aforesaid all such special accounts as the Minister, on his own motion, or at the request of Finance, may from time to time direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a requirement which is laid <Col N="1555" /> down in similar forms in the enactments relating to other statutory bodies.  I have a list of them here.  For example, An Chomhairle Oiliúna, under the Industrial Training Act, 1967; Córas Iompair Éireann, under the Transport Act, 1950; the Radio Éireann Authority, under the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960; the National Building Agency, under the National Building Agency Act, 1963.  There are other examples, but it is not necessary to give an exhaustive list.</P>
    <P>I do not see how anyone could read anything unreasonable into this requirement. It is obviously desirable that, in the case of bodies which receive all or the greater portion of their income from public funds, the responsible Minister, or the Minister for Finance should be in a position to require, if necessary, that the accounts should be kept in such form as would give to the Oireachtas the fullest information which is desirable.  This provision would place no restriction on An tÚdarás in the performance of its functions.  No reasonable Minister would operate this subsection in such a manner as to place unnecessary or unreasonable or restrictive burdens on An tÚdarás.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 23, to insert after &ldquo;proper&rdquo;, line 51, the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(not being the function of making payments, or of determining the manner or conditions of such payments, under section 12, subsection (2) of this Act)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that in delegating its functions to its officers and servants An tÚdarás does not delegate certain functions which should properly be exercised only by them as an Authority.</P>
      <P>One finds in legislation, from time to time, provisions which restrict the Minister to acting in his personal capacity under his personal seal as against the exercise of his general functions which under the Ministers and Secretaries Act can be exercised on his behalf by an officer who has been deputed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here I am appealing to precedent which the Minister has not hesitated to do throughout the discussions today, in regard to decisions made by the acts of Ministers.  The functions of making payments, of deciding the amounts which will be given to various institutions of higher education, of determining the manner or conditions of these <Col N="1558" /> particular payments are matters of such prime importance and of such central concern to the Authority's functions that they should not be delegated to an officer or servant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 of the Schedule appears in the Bill in order that An tÚdarás may be empowered to delegate day-to-day tasks to a member or members of their staff.  There could be no question of An tÚdarás extending delegation of this type to cover any of their major functions.  This is a normal type of provision in legislation relating to statutory organisations.</P>
      <P>In this amendment Senator Kelly wishes to ensure that An tÚdarás will not authorise any of their officers or servants to make payments or to determine the manner or condition of such payments under section 12 (2) of this Bill.  As I have pointed out, there could be no question of An tÚdarás delegating any of their powers in relation to their major functions.  The trouble about specifying what may not be done under a provision of this kind is that you imply that what is not specifically prohibited may and perhaps should be done.  If this amendment were to be adopted there would be a definite implication that An tÚdarás could or should delegate the performance of others of their important functions to members of their staff. Again, I emphasise that we must accept that An tÚdarás will be a responsible body.</P>

We appear to agree that it would not be proper for An tÚdarás to delegate the things which this amendment would prohibit it to delegate.  The Minister appears to be saying that because there may be other things which An tÚdarás should not delegate we should not specify these particular ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the debate Senator Brugha mentioned that section 12 was the kernel of this Bill.  That is why this section and the functions under it have been highlighted in this amendment. This section stands out so much as a  among the actual specific functions, <Col N="1559" /> apart from the general functions, of An tÚdarás, that it is proper to make this specification.</P>

      <P>To add to paragraph 23 the following: &ldquo;and may at any time revoke any such authorisation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This was put down in case it is necessary for the removal of doubt.  The paragraph, as it stands, says that An tÚdarás may authorise any of its officers or servants to do something.  It is clearly implied, beyond any legal doubt, that authorisation of somebody to do something includes the power to revoke this order.  If the Minister can assure me that he is advised on this point then there is no need for this amendment, but it has been put down for the purpose of having the point clarified.  One wishes to guard against the danger that a delegation might be made to an officer of An tÚdarás who would then claim that this function had been delegated to him and that there was no power of revocation.</P>

      <P>The first point I want to raise on the Schedule is on paragraph 2.  It is tied in with section 1 of the Bill and some of the points which I raised then are relevant to paragraph 2 of the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the definition of an <Col N="1560" /> academic post I mentioned that the position was that the Minister had intruded among the members of the <i>ad hoc</i> Authority such registrars of university institutions as were available for appointment at that time.  I made the suggestion that these people had been appointed on what was virtually an <i>ex officio</i> basis.  The Minister contended that they had been appointed as being the best people available among all those who were available to serve. I find this difficult to accept.  The coincidence that among all those who were available should turn up all three available registrars is stretching it a bit too far.  The Minister is apparently convinced that they were among the best available people.  These people who are part-academics, part-administrators, have now served on this body for a number of years and it is quite natural for the Minister to think they are now even more highly qualified to be members of the Authority.  I wonder how many people among the seven academic members who are authorised here under paragraph 2 of the Schedule are going to be people holding academic staff positions in a full-time capacity, whose whole lives are devoted to academic subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of the discussions on this Bill, rejected the idea of making a separate category of student members but did not rule out the possibility of nominating students as members of the Authority.  It was pointed out that it was quite likely in this instance that these students might be post-graduate students.  Virtually all post-graduate students hold a post of research demonstrator or some such type of post from the university.  This is a post part of the duties of which are the carrying out of research and the giving of instruction to students.  Accordingly, if the Minister is to appoint students to the Higher Education Authority, it would appear that these students, if they held research demonstratorships from the university, even though the sums involved might be small, because of the wide definition in section 1, these students would have to be counted among the academic members, if the Minister is appointing an Authority of only 14.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> We might well end up here with the academic half of this team of 14 consisting, on the one hand, of people who have passed from full-time academic commitment to university administration and, on the other hand, of student representatives who are still in apprenticeship to the academic life.</P>

      <P>They are employed by the college.  My post-graduate students doing a master's degree are receiving grants from the Department of Education and are also employed as research demonstrators in the college working six hours per week, with the full permission of the Department of Education.  As such they could well come under the definition of holding an academic post unless we either make an exclusion of them in paragraph 2 of the Schedule or make an adjustment to the definition of &ldquo;academic post&rdquo; in section 1 of the Bill.  I raise this point because, due to the particular definition which is now in the Bill and which the Minister is not willing to amend, there may be real difficulty in maintaining a true balance in accordance with what was the original intention of paragraph 2 of the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I should like to repeat what I have stated in replying to the Second Stage debate, that the registrars of the universities are not appointed in an <i>ex officio</i> capacity.  They were appointed for the same reasons as the other members, because of their experience, their expertise, knowledge, personal qualities, etc.  I do not want this to be taken as a precedent, but it could be said that they had both academic and administrative experience which would make them suitable for inclusion in a body such as An tÚdarás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the students, I have already pointed out, and I think this was accepted by most Members of the House, that we did not intend including students in any capacity as academic members.  During my reply to the debate on the question of the admission of students to membership of An tÚdarás, I pointed out that <Col N="1562" /> if they were, at some future date appointed to An tÚdarás, it would be those who are not from the academic side, either the seven non-academics or to the four places which remain to be filled after we have set up this body statutorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point my argument was that, in regard to students who are post-graduate students, the Minister would not be entitled to appoint them as non-academic members, because a non-academic member is defined as a person who does not hold an academic post, part of the duties of which are to teach any students in the institution or to carry out research.  My point is that the holders of research demonstrator posts and minor assistantships in the universities would, by definition, under this Bill qualify as academic members. Unless the Minister makes them part of his floating four he will not be able to make them two of his non-academic seven.</P>

      <P>I cannot argue with the Senator on this matter because I have not sufficient knowledge to do so.  If it were the intention to appoint a student he could be appointed to one of the four places that remain.  I do not, at this stage, intend appointing students.

I feel they would not have as much to contribute as they would quite obviously have in relation to governing bodies of universities.  I also said that if I should change my mind in the future, or some other Minister who would succeed me decided to appoint students, there was nothing in the section which would prevent this.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question about section 21 of the Schedule.  It is provided that An tÚdarás shall report every five years, which seems a very long period in relation to its functions, or sooner and as often as the Minister may direct. Does the Minister intend to ask An tÚdarás to report more often than every five years and will he ask it to report in relation to each of its general functions?  Is there not to some extent the possibility that the Minister may call the tune here too, if he asks them to report within six months in relation to a particular activity?  Is this not guaranteeing that that activity will be researched during that period at the expense of others.  I am not sure what the relationship would be under that section at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>Section 21 states:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás shall, at the end of each quinquennium or at such other time or times as the Minister may direct, make a report to the Minister of its proceedings under this Act during the preceding quinquennium or during whatever other period the Minister may appoint.</P>
      <P>What I had in mind was that it would report to me at the mid-stage of the quinquennium, say, after 2½ years.  I feel also that they would make some report in connection with what Senator Horgan raised earlier in relation to the statistical matter each year.  If, for any reason, I felt that I needed a report about something I could always ask to have that report.  They would also report at the end of the quinquennium and at that stage, or possibly sometime prior to that, put forward their proposals for a further five year period.</P>

      <P>The point I wish to raise is on paragraph 6.  Perhaps I should hastily assure the Minister that it is on paragraph 6 (2) rather than on paragraph 6 (1).  Paragraph 6 (2) says:</P>
      <P>An ordinary member of An tÚdarás may resign his office as a member by letter addressed to the Minister and the resignation shall take effect when the letter is received.</P>
      <P>We had a discussion on this in a recent Bill.  My memory is that it was discussed on the Nuclear Energy Bill, but I am not sure about this.  It was pointed out that, in fact, this provision for which the Minister can cite precedent may well produce an effect which the Minister would not welcome.  It would appear that the meaning of this is that as soon as the letter of resignation is received in the Minister's office the resignation then takes effect and nothing can be done about it.  I do not know whether this means that, as soon as the letter is stamped in the registry in the Department of Education, the person has then resigned.  Paragraph 6 (1) of the Schedule gives the Minister great powers to remove an ordinary member. Paragraph 6 (2) of the Schedule does not give him any power to request or persuade a member to remain as a member of the Authority when he feels inclined to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was discussed at some length on recent legislation and a more appropriate formula was adopted on that occasion.  While nothing should be <Col N="1565" /> done to interfere with the freedom of a member to resign, there might be cases in which reconsideration and a discussion with the Minister or a discussion at the Minister's request between the member and the chairman of An tÚdarás might be the best way out of the situation.  Perhaps a provision to the effect that the resignation would take effect on the date of the next meeting of An tÚdarás might be more appropriate. I raise the matter now and ask the Minister if he would look at this particular point between now and the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it would be necessary to look at this or not, but I certainly can look at it.  The only point I would make is that I am almost certain that, if an ordinary member wished to resign, he would be most likely to discuss this with somebody, possibly with the chairman or possibly with the Minister, before he would actually send in his letter of resignation.  For that reason it could be possible to have some sort of discussion prior to his writing this letter.  I could not imagine, unless for some reason which would involve the member not being likely to change his mind, that he would just simply sit down and write a letter to the Minister and say: &ldquo;I have resigned&rdquo;, rather than that he would discuss with the chairman, or possibly with the Minister, his situation and his reasons for wishing to resign.  In that case, if the chairman or the Minister thought that he could be persuaded to remain on, it could be done at that time.</P>

      <P>I might say, indeed, that the chairman might be one of the reasons why he wished to resign.  I would ask the Minister to look at this in order, perhaps, to provide for an occasional hastiness or imprudence on the part of one of the members of the Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are to provide statutory authority for the payment of £10 million Government subsidy to the Electricity Supply Board in respect of a programme of expenditure of £18 million on rural electrification during the four years ending 31st March, 1975, and to increase the limit of authorised capital expenditure by the board for all purposes, including rural electrification, from the existing combined limit of £340 million to a new figure of £450 million.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware rural electrification has been in progress now since 1946, a period of 25 years, and the time has come for an all out effort to complete the programme.  A brief review of the situation is, therefore, not out of place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original programme for rural electrification was on the assumption that, given a subsidy of 50 per cent of the capital cost, supply could be offered at standard rates to about 86 per cent of rural homes and that about 70 per cent of the total rural households would accept supply on these terms.  Among <Col N="1567" /> the 14 per cent to whom standard rates could not be quoted, because of the high cost of connection, there were many who wished to have supply and the ESB programme provided for connections to them if the persons concerned were prepared to pay an extra charge, over and above the standard charge, sufficient to bring the return up to the minimum acceptable as sufficient at the time after taking account of subsidy.  This was, in fact, the origin of the special service charges.  The distribution networks for the scheme were designed with a view to connecting the maximum possible number of consumers with the money available and expenditure on distribution capacity unlikely to be used for many years ahead was avoided.</P>
    <P>By the time the original rural electrification scheme was nearing completion in 1962 about 75 per cent of total rural households had already been connected compared with the original target of about 70 per cent.  The Government at that time decided that a second comprehensive scheme, known as the post-development programme, should be carried out to give a further opportunity to obtain supply to all those houses which, for one reason or another, were still without electricity. Since most of the households qualifying for standard charges had by then been connected, the post-development programme required relatively greater capital expenditure to connect houses to the system.  Consequently, under the Electricity Supply Amendment Act, 1962, the rate of subsidy was increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent with a limit of £75 per house for domestic connections.  This financial limitation had the effect of increasing substantially the level of special service charges for the very high cost connections while qualifying a greater number for standard charges.  To cater for such households, a scheme for the payment of grants of up to £10 for the installation of bottled gas as a more economical alternative source of power for lighting, cooking and heating was introduced.</P>
    <P>The rural electrification programme was reviewed prior to the introduction of the Electricity Supply Amendment <Col N="1568" /> Act, 1968.  This Act extended the limit of capital expenditure on rural electrification to £50 million which then was considered sufficient to complete the post-development scheme by 31st March, 1973.  At the same time as the Act was enacted, arrangements were made to effect substantial reductions in the higher special service charges to be effective from 1st June, 1968, the cost being borne by the ESB.  In addition, the maximum grant for bottle gas installations was increased from £10 to £35.</P>
    <P>At the time of the commencement of the original rural electrification scheme in 1946, only about 14,000 rural households had electricity installed.  At the 31st March, 1962, when the original rural electrification scheme was virtually completed, a total of almost 280,000 rural houses were connected to the supply.  At the end of March, 1967, 325,000 houses had been connected and the estimate then made was that a further 26,000 connections only would be required to complete the scheme, bringing the total estimated number of rural connections to just over 350,000 houses.  It was planned to achieve this total by March, 1973.</P>
    <P>The 1967 forecast of 350,000 rural connections proved in practice to be an underestimate.  The substantial reduction in special service charges in 1968 made electricity supply a much more attractive proposition for many households and this added up to a considerable increase in demand for connections. Increasing prosperity and a growing demand for television reception increased the numbers seeking supply.  As a consequence, progress on the completion of the programme in the different areas fell well behind schedule and the backlog was increased by new houses constructed in the meantime and seeking connection.  The position was aggravated by the need to allocate an ever-growing proportion of the capital provided for rural electrification to system improvement, that is to strengthening the distribution network in order to improve the standard of supply sufficiently to keep up with increased demand.</P>
    <P>The rate of growth in consumption of electricity in rural areas is now about <Col N="1569" /> 13 per cent as compared with an increase rate of about 9 per cent in urban areas.  This growth in demand which is continuing at a high rate has necessitated considerable investment in strengthening the distribution system to maintain adequate supply.  The development of rural industries and the growth in rural areas of new hotels, registered guesthouses and new homes built by existing consumers as well as new installations for the mechanisation of farms have all added to the problem of completing the scheme of rural electrification within the programme planned from 1968.</P>
    <P>The 1967 estimate of the number of further rural connections required to complete the scheme was 26,000.  In fact, in the period from April, 1967 to March, 1971, about 34,000 connections had been made under the scheme and, as Senators are very well aware, the rural electrification programme is still far from complete in many areas.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, requested the ESB to carry out a further detailed study of the position, district by district, throughout the country so as to be able to forecast as accurately as possible not alone existing requirements for electricity connections, but to take into account also new house building programmes and developments likely to require priority connections for new rural industries, guesthouses, etc., as well as farming developments.  The ESB have recently completed this review and they have proposed a four-year programme designed to achieve by 31st March, 1975, connection of all outstanding connections at the present time, estimated at 14,000 together with other demands for new connections, estimated to amount to a further 14,000, likely to arise in the four-year period. The cost of these 28,000 new connections is estimated at £7 million.  At the same time, the ESB realise the necessity to improve substantially the whole rural electrification network and they will need to spend £11 million on system improvements in this four-year period. The total cost of this programme is, therefore, £18 million from 1st April, 1971, which will bring total expenditure by the board on rural electrification to £67 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> The Government have accepted this programme and the provisions in the Bill are designed as, what I might term, a crash programme to enable rural electrification to be completed within the next four years.  The capital provisions for expenditure by the ESB on rural electrification in each of these four years have already been determined and notified to the board so that there should be no obstacle to the ESB achieving success in completing this scheme as planned.  The board are already planning on this basis and I earnestly hope that all parts of the plan can be achieved according to schedule. This should eliminate entirely the unfortunate situation we have had for some years past where the commencement of work in particular areas has had to be deferred time and again because of the heavy work programmes developing in areas getting prior attention.</P>
    <P>For comparison purposes I might mention that the total expenditure on rural electrification in the 25 years of its operation up to 31st March last was about £49 million, including Government subsidy of £17 million.  We are now proposing expenditure in the next four years totalling £18 million, including subsidy of £10 million.  In the past four years' annual capital expenditure on rural electrification has ranged from about £2 million in 1968 to £3.1 million in 1970-71.  The new programme envisages expenditure of £3.7 million this year, £4.1 million next year, £4.7 million in 1973-74 and no less than £5.5 million in the fourth and final year of the programme.</P>
    <P>Our existing level of rural connections to the electricity supply system is very high by international standards, more particularly when account is taken of the very many scattered households in rural Ireland&mdash;a position that does not obtain in most other countries where rural households are concentrated in small villages or townships.  By the time the new programme is completed, we expect to have total rural connections of about 386,000 houses or something approaching 98 per cent of total rural households.  Such an achievement is something that I think we can be proud of.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> In the new programme of bringing supply to those households not yet connected it is not intended to make any change in the existing reduced rates of special service charges which will continue to be calculated on the same basis as has obtained since the Government arranged for a reduction in these charges in mid-1968.  This reduction was designed to reduce particularly the highest special service charges and electricity is now available to rural dwellers at very reasonable terms. While special service charges are necessary in some form or another in every electricity distribution tariff I can assure the House that those who are asked to pay these special charges are, in fact, paying very much less than the cost of the service they are getting.  The availability of grants of up to £35 for the installation of bottle gas equipment for lighting, cooking and heating is an alternative available to those liable to very high special service charges.  I might mention that in the past three years, that is, since the new rate of subsidy was introduced, over 1,600 bottled gas grants have been given, so far, at a total cost of about £46,000.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the new programme of rural electrification which we are introducing is not a mere continuation of the scheme which has been proceeding on an area by area basis for some years past.  This is a scheme to complete the original programme once and for all by provision of the increased finances which I have mentioned.  Under the existing planned post-development scheme, something like 520 areas have been completed out of a total of 792 rural areas.  It is planned not alone to re-canvass and re-develop the remaining 272 areas, but also to offer electricity again at subsidised rates to all un-supplied households in the 520 or so areas where the post-development scheme has been completed.  There will not be an individual canvass in these 520 areas.  Supply will be offered by way of local advertisement and it will be a matter for householders in the areas concerned to apply immediately for connection.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the four-year plan which this Bill is intended to <Col N="1572" /> finance is aimed at completing the massive task of rural electrification on which we embarked in 1946.  It is aimed at bringing electricity to all rural homes which it is possible to connect at any kind of reasonable cost.  To keep down costs the ESB propose, as I have explained, to tackle the job area by area. After each area is completed the connection of rural homes for electricity in such area will have to be made on an economic basis without the benefit of subsidy.  Rural dwellers, concerned to ensure that they are connected for electricity, should apply immediately for connection whenever the ESB announce the provision of supply in each of the 520 areas in which the rural electrification planned post-development scheme has already been completed.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to deal with non-domestic connections such as industrial consumers, registered hotels and guesthouses and farming activities requiring supply on commercial or industrial tariffs on the basis of completing the programme in each separate area. Subsidy will be available therefore in respect of such connections up to the end of the four-year programme.  After the end of the programme we will have achieved one of the highest levels of rural electrification to be found anywhere, and it should then be possible to provide and extend the supply of electricity on the same self-supporting basis as in urban areas and, indeed, the growth of the economy throughout the country which has itself been fostered by the spread of electricity supply should help to put rural electricity supply on a sound financial basis.</P>
    <P>Completion of the proposed programme will require an additional £18 million over and above the £49 million expended by 31st March, 1971. This means a total provision of £67 million as compared with the existing statutory limit on capital expenditure by the ESB on rural electrification of £50 million.  It is necessary, therefore, to increase the limit of expenditure by £17 million to £67 million.  Because of the acceleration of the programme and the very considerably increased expenditure on system improvements now being provided, a new approach is <Col N="1573" /> being made to the amount of subsidy to be made available.  Instead of the old arrangement of 75 per cent with a maximum of £75 per house the Government have agreed to make a global £10 million available as subsidy in respect of this programme and the ESB will complete the programme with this amount of subsidy but will maintain the 1968 terms to householders for new connections.  Total subsidy payments up to 31st March, 1971, amounted to £17 million so that the total Government provision by way of subsidy towards the cost of the £67 million programme will amount to £27 million in all.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one more comment before I leave rural electrification.  The ESB now have firm plans to offer electricity in all rural areas over the next four years.  It is essential that they plan their programme on an orderly basis in order to keep costs at the lowest level possible as well as achieving the maximum progress on the scheme. Any departure from the planned scheme can only increase costs and delay progress.  It is clearly impossible to connect at once all who are seeking supply.  Some areas must be at the end of the board's plan.  I would ask Senators, therefore, not to be impatient if areas in which they are interested are not high up in the board's timetable. The longest any householder should have to wait will be the 31st March, 1975, but the great majority of rural households will have connection long before that date.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provision of capital for general purposes for the ESB.  Under existing legislation, the ESB are entitled to incur capital expenditure for all purposes other than the electrification of rural areas up to a limit of £290 million as fixed by the Electricity Supply Amendment Act, 1970.  At present, the board have approved expenditure under this head amounting to £240 million and the balance remaining would be sufficient to cover general expenditure likely to arise for approval up to about March, 1973.  In order to avoid coming back to the Oireachtas again within such a short time, it is now proposed to extend the statutory limit to cover expenditure <Col N="1574" /> likely to arise for approval in the period to 31st March, 1975, that is for the period covered by the programme for completion of rural electrification now proposed.</P>
    <P>During the next four years, the ESB expect to approve of expenditure for purposes other than rural electrification amounting to about £140 million.  Of this total about £85 million will be required for additional generating plant. The plant already programmed for commissioning in the next four years will comprise two 120 megawatt plants at Pigeon House B, another 120 megawatt plant at Great Island, the pumped storage plants totalling 280 megawatts at Turlough Hill and the 40 megawatt extension to Shannon-bridge milled peat plant.  It will also be necessary to proceed with the erection of the first 250 megawatt units to be installed in our system.  Two of these will be at Tarbert and the third at Pigeon House B.  A small 25 megawatt extension to the Erne Station is also planned.  This plant programme will be necessary to meet increased demand for electricity which has been growing for some years past at between 10 per cent and 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that no provision is made in this programme for the construction of a nuclear generating station.  As I have already stated elsewhere no final decision has yet been taken to build a nuclear station.  The ESB have for some time past been training engineers in nuclear work and have got together a special project team to examine in detail all the technical, economic, social and financial problems connected with the installation and operation of a nuclear station. The board will need to consider all aspects of the project before coming to a decision to recommend such an installation to the Government.  The advice of the new Nuclear Energy Board will be required by the Government before any decision is taken on this project.  If a decision is taken to proceed with the commissioning of such a station which, as I have already indicated elsewhere, could cost up to £70 million at current cost levels then additional capital will need to be provided for the ESB but, of course, <Col N="1575" /> such expenditure would not arise for some years to come.</P>
    <P>In addition to expenditure on generating plant, a sum of about £55 million is estimated to be required for other essential items, mainly transmission and distribution networks.  The total required for approval by 31st March, 1975, will, therefore, amount to about £380 million.</P>
    <P>Increasing the limit on ESB capital expenditure will not involve demands on the Central Fund.  Since 1955, the board have raised their own capital without recourse to the Exchequer, except, of course, for the State contribution to the capital cost of rural electrification.  The board's programme for capital expenditure within the statutory limit is required to be submitted in detail for my approval from time to time.</P>
    <P>At present, the ESB maintain separate rural and non-rural accounts and separate provision has been made by statute from time to time for the capital necessary for rural electrification and for other purposes.  Now that well over 90 per cent of potential rural customers have already connected to the electricity supply and that we are making provision for accelerated connection of the remaining rural households, I consider that the time has come to integrate the two separate accounts and to make one general provision for total capital expenditure. Integration of the accounts and of the statutory provisions will not affect rural subsidy arrangements, but it should help to simplify ESB account procedures and thus to some extent at least reduce costs.  As I have already stated, expenditure on rural electrification by the ESB is expected to reach £67 million by 31st March, 1975, while expenditure required for general purposes by the same date is expected to be £380 million.  The combined total of requirements is, therefore, £447 million and the Bill proposes to fix the limit of £450 million.</P>
    <P>One of the main difficulties of any electricity supply authority is the variable rate of demand for current arising during any 24-hour period.  In Ireland, so far, due to the absence of any substantial three-shift industrial base, <Col N="1576" /> the daily load curve has had a high peak and low valley.  The erection of pumped storage plants of the type being commissioned at Turlough Hill will enable cheap electrical current from the valley period to be used to pump water to the upper reservoir which will then be available to generate current during the high cost peak demand periods. This operation is, therefore, obviously designed to flatten the demand curve to some extent.  An electricity authority have to have available sufficient plant to meet peak demand together with sufficient reserves to cope with plant outages.  This means at any one time an electricity authority must have far more plant capacity than is necessary to meet average demand.</P>
    <P>I might illustrate the point by stating that in the year ended 31st March, 1970, the ESB had total plant capacity of 1,410 megawatts to meet a peak demand of 1,128 megawatts, while the average demand during that year was just under the equivalent of 600 megawatts. It is essential, therefore, that the ESB should do all in their power to increase valley hour usage while reducing peak hour usage.  In recent years, there is definite evidence of progress in this regard by the board.  In the year ended March, 1967, for example, peak usage was 5.21 times valley usage.  This figure was reduced progressively each year in the next four years so that the peak in the year to March, 1971 was reduced to 3.78 times valley usage.</P>
    <P>It is because of the need not alone to meet peak demand, but to have a reserve or security margin in addition and because it is not practicable to store electricity in large quantity that such very large capital investment is necessary in an electricity system. Ireland is not unique in having peaks and valleys in the daily demand curves for electricity and indeed neither are we unique in having to invest an ever growing proportion of our national resources in electricity generation.  Electricity has, of course, become the most acceptable of all types of energy and the ever-growing demand for it is evidence of increased national prosperity and an index of our continuing industrial and commercial growth.</P>
    <P>I think the capital expenditure figure <Col N="1577" /> I have given should bring home to Senators the extent of the growth of this our largest industrial unit and the extent to which this industry has grown and requires to grow in order to supply power to our growing industrial, agricultural, commercial and domestic needs.  The necessity to approve of expenditure as high as £157 million by one semi-State body in the short period of four years poses very considerable problems for the Government and for the board.  The sums of money now involved are such as to require the ESB to have recourse to foreign borrowing to an increasing extent.  Common prudence apart, resort to borrowing from financial institutions abroad requires that the affairs of the ESB be managed as efficiently and as economically as possible.  It is essential that the board be enabled to balance their accounts taking one year with another as any action to unduly depress prices or force the board into a position where they are not able to recover their costs could be disastrous not alone for the ESB themselves, but for the success of any development programme we may wish to undertake in coming years.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, very concerned that the ESB continue to supply electricity at the cheapest possible cost and in the most efficient manner possible.  I have already indicated that I am personally quite satisfied that the ESB are in the forefront of electricity authorities throughout the world in supplying cheap electricity, but to ensure that the affairs of the ESB continue to be conducted efficiently, I am as already announced arranging to have a special investigation made into the efficiency of the board's operations.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill commends itself to the Seanad.  The Minister in the course of his introductory statement has given us a review of the history of electrification in this country and has outlined the plans for the last lap of this job.  I think it only right to point out that, whereas the story of actual work on rural electrification began in 1946, the idea of rural electrification was there right from the very beginning. The original reports on the basis of <Col N="1578" /> which the Shannon Scheme was set up, and on the basis of which the ESB were established, envisaged at that time that there would be progressive development for an electrical network and supply system starting in the cities and towns and spreading out to the rural areas.</P>
      <P>The work of the ESB, the completion of which we are asked to facilitate by passing this Bill, is a culmination of the whole history of the ESB.  It will mark a very important point in that history.  The ESB started with a system based only on the Ardnacrusha station. They then grew from that system to the multi-station system and that was an important stage in their development. The completion of the rural electrification scheme that can now be foreseen is another important stage on the road.</P>
      <P>It is very heartening to hear from the Minister of the rate of increase of electricity consumption in the rural areas.  The fact that the annual rate of increase appears to be of the order of 13 per cent against something of the order of 9 per cent is very heartening. This is not entirely due to the factor of television which the Minister mentioned in his speech.  We can recognise it as being a reflection of an increased use of machinery around the farmyard and, as such, a reflection of the improvement of many of the techniques on the farm.</P>
      <P>In describing what is to be done in this last lap, the Minister mentioned the strategy that will be adopted for economic reasons of moving into an area, mopping up that area and moving on. I have no doubt that the board will give adequate publicity to this aspect of the scheme.  I would urge the Minister to act, on behalf of the Oireachtas and the public, as our watchdog in this respect to make sure that the ESB do not underestimate the amount of publicity which may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a habit as people&mdash;it is one of our main faults&mdash;of awakening too late in many respects.  We realise when it is too late that the opportunity was there to do something and we start bemoaning it when the time has passed. We could easily run into a situation, quite apart from the complaints of those who have not been connected and who live in areas that have not a high priority in the scheme which the Minister <Col N="1579" /> mentioned, where we may have an equal number of complaints from those whose areas have been completed and who, for some reason or other, failed to avail of the opportunity.  As I understand it from what the Minister has said, those people will lose their opportunity and they will not be able to be picked up again.  Maybe I misunderstood the Minister on this point.</P>

      <P>For this reason the publicity campaign must be greater than normal.  It must be very clearly brought home to the people that this is the last opportunity to have this done on the basis to which they are accustomed.  We need here something far more than adequate publicity and far more than the formal publicity of planning notices and so forth.  We need a real campaign now.  It may be that the great spirit and fervour of the early rural electrification days will now be necessary in the last phase.  This was a great period in regard to the development of the ESB and of rural development in this country.  The early days of the canvassing of areas and co-operation in the first rural electrification schemes was the greatest period in the history of the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point which the Bill brings up is the extension of the amount of general capital and the proposal by the Minister, in section 2 of the Bill, that there should be an amalgamation of the capital accounts for rural and non-rural purposes.  The Minister said this should ensure that there would be a certain economy but there are some dangers here.  We are going to pass this Bill not because the ESB can produce cheap electricity in rural areas at the rural outlets but because we wish, for social reasons, that the ESB should make available cheap electricity at the rural outlets just as in the urban centres.  In other words, the money which we are <Col N="1580" /> proposing to give here in order to subsidise this work is given not merely as an investment in the production of electricity in an economic sense but as a real social contribution.  I think it is important, and I have talked of this many times in this House, that when we have objectives which are mixed in the sense that they are partially economic and partially social, we should not lose sight of the relationship between the true economic costs and the amount of social subsidy which is involved.</P>
    <P>I would be a little perturbed that an amalgamation of the board's accounts would make it impossible for legislators, members of the public or anybody interested to disentangle the social element in the moneys that are being provided for rural electrification.  I understand that the amendment of section 2 of the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1954, which is the subject of this Bill, relates only to capital purposes.  I should like to ask the Minister does this mean that in the annual report of the ESB we will now have an amalgamation of their revenue accounts which are now separate?  We shall still continue to have separate revenue accounts, rural and non-rural?</P>

      <P>The Minister's assurance on this point perhaps tends to remove a great deal of force from what I have been saying.  However, this Bill is one that commends itself to the House and is one that will be welcomed. The Minister is right to say that the ESB have done a good job.  Given our natural conditions and our natural resources, the ESB are producing electricity at a remarkably economic cost.  We forget that when the charges are raised we feel only the immediate increase.  Perhaps it may be true that the ESB have shown themselves somewhat uneven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If in their public and industrial relations they could achieve the same success that they have in regard to their economic planning and their technical expertise, then we should have very little fault to find with them.  Down through the years they have not shown the same level of achievement or <Col N="1581" /> expertise, even in regard to their own internal industrial relations or, on a number of occasions, the public relations aspect of their work.  Nevertheless, their work on the whole is work that must commend itself to the House and, accordingly, we support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  In common with Senator Dooge and with every Member of the House, I welcome any effort to bring rural electrification to all parts of the country.  Many parts of rural Ireland have been left too long without electrification, and they find that it is only by paying very high special charges that they can avail of electrification.  For this reason this Bill is to be welcomed, because it means that all parts of the country will have electrification.  However, I am rather disappointed with that portion of the Minister's introductory speech, in which he says:</P>
      <P>In the new programme of bringing supply to those households not yet connected, it is not intended to make any change in the existing reduced rates of special service charges, which will continue to be calculated on the basis that has obtained since the Government arranged for a reduction in these charges in mid-1968. This reduction was designed to reduce particularly the highest special service charges and electricity is now available to rural dwellers at very very reasonable terms.  While special service charges are necessary in some form or another in every electricity distribution tariff I can assure the House that those who are asked to pay these special charges are, in fact, paying very much less than the cost of the service they are getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to question the Minister on the last sentence&mdash;that they are paying very much less than the service they are getting.  They are paying very much more than, perhaps, the service being given to their next-door neighbours. This is one of the anomalies that I find in relation to rural electrification. Two neighbours of mine live in an area, and have built new houses, where rural electrification has been installed since 1953.  In one case where the house is already connected to a temporary <Col N="1582" /> supply, the fixed charge based on floorspace is £1.50, which is reasonable, but the service charge is £2.59, making a total two-monthly rental of £4.09.</P>
    <P>In another case, where it takes five poles to take the supply from the existing transformer to a person's house, the service charge is approximately £3 in addition to the fixed charge. This is an anomaly that should be overcome.  There is very little encouragement there.  People who are building houses under SDA schemes will have to be careful about where they purchase the site in relation to ESB connections because they may find that when they have purchased the site and built the house, they will be faced with a very heavy extra charge.  This is causing a certain amount of disquiet.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would assure us that this trend will not continue.  If an area has been wired for rural electrification, it is wrong that, if you build a house in a field where there is an existing ESB pole, you should be charged a sum of 50s every two months for a service charge.</P>
    <P>With these reservations, I welcome the Bill, and I hope that the Minister will be able to use his considerable influence with the ESB to see that this blackmail&mdash;I cannot find a better word &mdash;ends.  If you do not get your electricity supply from the ESB you do not get it at all, and you would not even qualify for the grant for bottled gas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill for many many reasons.  Indeed I and all other Senators are very very grateful to the Minister and his staff for this excellent and informative statement.  It is very informative and, in the ESB context, most enlightening.  However, it is also rather terrifying when we look at the <Col N="1583" /> colossal sums of money involved.  I note that by the time we reached page 10 we were speaking in terms of £380 million and, by the time we reached page 11, we had gone on to £450 million.  I did not look for any further figure after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes to show the way the cost of these things is rising. With any commodity, especially commodities such as are provided by semi-State bodies like the ESB, if we want to get a service we must pay for it.  It is not a question of saying: &ldquo;Let there be light, and there would be light&rdquo;.  It is not as simple as all that.</P>
      <P>Senator Jack Fitzgerald dealt with many of the points that I had in mind. I suppose it was inevitable that he should: we come from similar areas. He spoke about what I consider to be an exhorbitant service charge which has caused great annoyance and suffering to people throughout the country.  When I hear complaints about it I often think of the 1916 Proclamation which promised to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  It is very hard to convince a rural dweller who must pay an exhorbitant sum for getting electric power that he is as cherished as his cousins in the towns and cities.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that something cannot be done to abolish this service charge.  If the Minister should bear this in mind there might be found, some time or other, some formula to ease the problem.  It would remove a great anomaly and the sense of injustice that people are suffering from.  Everybody knows that electricity is no longer considered a luxury but a necessity. The two great necessities as far as living is concerned are light and water. While we commend the great job the ESB are doing, especially as far as their engineering and service staffs are concerned, that annoying service charge still remains with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the admission was made in the Minister's speech that there is gross underestimation regarding the <Col N="1584" /> number of rural connections required. The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>The 1967 forecast of 350,000 rural connections proved in practice to be an underestimate.</P>
    <P>It is a gross underestimate.  It would seem that the fact that new houses are being built and that there is a great growth in the promotion of guest houses at reasonable rates for tourists was overlooked.  Every care should be taken in future to see that there should not be any further underestimation by any State or semi-State body.</P>
    <P>Somebody made the point regarding making an all out drive to make sure that no household will be left out this time in the new four-year plan which will end on 31st March, 1975.  I am sure appeals will be made to all parochial organisations to do their best to ensure that people, through inadvertence, neglect or forgetfulness, will not be without a supply of electricity, because when this four-year plan ends I am sure it cannot be repeated.</P>
    <P>I remember when rural electrification began in a big way and how we went from house to house canvassing.  We did what I consider to have been very rewarding work: we tried to convince people of the advantages of taking the supply early.  Many of those who refused to come in at that time came on bended knees afterwards asking if anything could be done to bring it in.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way since that time.  Every effort should be made through advertising and through encouragement as far as rural organisations are concerned to make sure that everybody will be included this time.</P>
    <P>I was glad to find from the Minister's speech that a special investigation is being made into the efficiency of the board's operations.  While I can commend the excellence of their engineering staff, I could, if I wished, enlighten the House and the Minister in regard to some extraordinary things that have happened and are happening as far as other sections of the ESB complex are concerned.  I am sure that the investigation will bring some of these things to light.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that carelessness and indifference on the part of some <Col N="1585" /> employees have given the ESB a bad image, an image which no-semi-State body should have.  I hope that when the results of this investigation are made available there will be a general tightening up.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred to industrial relations.  That was a very sore point when as a result of an industrial dispute in the ESB, the farmer could not get his cows milked and there was no light in the house.  I live in an intensive dairy farming area and at times I have heard protests and very strong language being used against the ESB and the members of the Government. Something will have to be done at some stage at get over this dreadful danger that is hanging over us like the sword of Damocles.  Some system will have to be devised whereby people will be assured of their supply of power.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when he is replying to speak more on the point of the nuclear power station which he referred to in the course of his speech:</P>
    <P>As I have already stated elsewhere, no final decision has yet been taken to build a nuclear station.  The ESB have, for some time, being training engineers in nuclear power and have got together a special project team to examine in detail all the technical, economic, social and financial problems connected with the installation and operation of a nuclear station.</P>
    <P>We spent quite a long time discussing the Nuclear Energy Bill here and I think everybody agreed that it was a thing that would have to be done and the sooner it was done the better.  I know a lot of investigation must be done beforehand but it is also apparent that the longer one delays in building such a station the costlier it will become.  With the supplies of fuel and fossil fuel running out, it is a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for his great enthusiasm for first-class service in the ESB.  He is deeply interested in their operation and is deeply committed to providing the best possible service for the people.  I hope it can be said five years from now:</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senators who have welcomed the introduction of this Bill and extend my congratulations to the Minister on its introduction.  It would be a mistake to let this occasion pass without paying due tribute to the foresight and vision of Mr. Paddy McGilligan and Dr. McLoughlin in the early days of this State when they introduced the Shannon Scheme and prepared this country for development in electrification.  Not only should we pay due tribute to these people in this House of the Oireachtas but we should remember the people who rendered such a great service to this country, by naming some of the electrical generating stations after one or other of these men.</P>
      <P>We have, by reason of our history, developed the custom, with which I find no fault, of naming streets, avenues, military barracks etc. in memory of those who fought for the freedom of the country.  I take no exception whatever to that.  I join with all those who pay respect to the memory of those who rendered service to the country in the past.  We should never forget people who have led us on with great strides in other phases of our life, whether they be great medical men, great authors, great industrialists or people like Mr. McGilligan or Dr. McLoughlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without the development of rural electrification we would be in a sorry state.  We regret the continuous flight from the land but we often do not think how much greater that flight would be if we did not have the advantages of rural electrification which bring to the rural dweller many of the amenities of urban life and without which rural life would be intolerable to the coming generations. I believe rural electrification has stemmed the flight from the land to some degree.  It has also helped to increase production in rural areas.  We have the intensive pig farms, chicken farms, broilers, etc. that could not exist without electricity.  For that we are grateful to the Minister present in so far as he has helped and his predecessors <Col N="1587" /> down along the line who have helped to bring this about.</P>
    <P>Hotels can now be built in the most scenic parts of our country far away from towns and cities and this could not have taken place without rural electrification.  There are a number of small industries in areas, where, without electricity, it would be impossible to have them.  We should still keep our sights on the development of our skills in all parts of the country and aim for the day when we can, as the Swiss do, produce goods demanding a lesser amount of raw material and more skill. With advance in education and with power available in new areas, we can look forward to further development. We can maintain the pattern of life which has been traditional.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the executive, engineers and staff in the ESB in so far as they have played their part in the electrification of the country. I will join with Senator Cranitch in saying that it causes a great deal of annoyance and frustration when the supply of electricity is suddenly terminated, whether it be as a result of industrial action or otherwise.  I do not have to go into the pros and the cons of these various disputes that occur but I should like to say that too many of them have occurred.  It will always be a source of regret to me that an organisation such as the ESB with so much goodwill behind it, has not down the years developed a better system of relations between management and workers.  In the sphere of industrial relations they could have given the same headline to the rest of the country as they have done otherwise.  I hope an improvement will be evident in the years to come in this connection.</P>
    <P>Something which caused great resentment amongst rural populations down the years was the fact that the electrical current came so far and somebody living 100 yards up the road could not get it without a special service charge. There were probably economic reasons for this.  I am sure every Senator here has from time to time made representations on behalf of people who were in that position.  If you made representations to your district engineer or office you received a reply which was very <Col N="1588" /> convincing on economic grounds.  It could not be done as it entailed this, that and the other&mdash;as Senator Dooge pointed out, there was a tendency to forget the social aspect of this development.</P>
    <P>The Government have, down the years, given attention to the social aspect of transport, education and various other activities, but the point is that the social aspect of this problem was just written off.  If it did not match up economically, it was dropped.  I do not think sufficient thought was given to the annoyance, the frustration and the sense of being left to one side that this caused in rural areas.  I am glad to see that we now have hope that within the next three to four years this will have been eliminated and people who did not have much hope of being connected will, in the near future, be connected and will have an opportunity of sharing in the amenities.  They will be allowed to take that significant step forward to attaining the standard of living we wish to have for all our people.</P>
    <P>We should never lose sight of the fact that the standard of living in this country is not to be measured by the standard that prevails in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway or Waterford.  It should be the average standard of comfort provided to the citizens all over the country whether he be in a remote rural area or in a city.  I know it is easier to supply services to a large concentration of people, but anybody who thinks in terms of providing the optimum to Dublin and the minimum, or a shade less, to the people on the west coast of Ireland has got a wrong slant.  We should endeavour to reach a high average for all our people rather than have the optimum in one part and neglect in other parts.  In so far as that was done&mdash;I do not think it was done on a very wide scale&mdash;it was wrong.</P>
    <P>I should like to support what was said here by Senator J. Fitzgerald in regard to the supply of current to houses being erected in parts of this country.  Even in cases where the county council decided that two or three cottages should be built in a certain area to solve the housing problem, very often in the past they have been forced to change their minds because of the <Col N="1589" /> outlandish charges asked by the ESB to connect power to those houses.  I hope that that will disappear in the future and that we will have more consultation between local authorities and ESB officials and that if a local authority, with its knowledge of local conditions, decides to site three or four cottages in a certain place the ESB will fall in and co-operate with them rather than frustrate them in their efforts.</P>
    <P>The ESB has been a remarkably efficient organisation.  Some of our engineers, I am quite sure, compare very favourably with the best electricians in the world today.  I have always been at a loss to understand how the ESB can fall down so badly with regard to the question of sales.  I know that if the ESB goes into competition with ordinary commercial firms in regard to selling heaters, fridges, etc., that creates a certain amount of resentment; but we are here to speak on behalf of the taxpayers who have built up the ESB and who subsidise it.</P>
    <P>The point is this.  A person goes in to buy a fridge, a washing machine or some such appliance.  It is bought in some shop in the town for maybe £1 or £2 less or maybe perhaps as the same price as the ESB charges.  The person buying that appliance is led to believe that it will be serviced by ESB technicians. If that machine were bought through the ESB, it would be serviced by ESB technicians; but the other merchant gives the impression that his customers will get the same service from the ESB.  In that way, I believe that the ESB have fallen down on the sales end.  That is a point on which I am well informed.</P>
    <P>These are the two criticisms I have: failure with regard to the development of greater harmony in industrial relations, and failure as modern salesmen with the proper know-how and approach to the public.  Apart from that, I am an admirer of what the ESB have done.  I admire their efficiency, their know-how and skill and I join with those who complimented the Minister on introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>At the outset I said that I would like to see people who took the initiative in launching electricity in this country <Col N="1590" /> honoured in time to come.  If the Minister makes an equally great contribution to the development of rural electrification and the extension of electrification generally, I would not have the slightest objection to seeing a &ldquo;Stáisiún Lenihan&rdquo; in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and regard it as a special effort to complete the programme of rural electrification throughout Ireland.  Those of us who live in the rural areas know only too well what rural electrification has meant to many thousands of people.  It is one important project which has done a great deal to encourage families to stay in rural Ireland.  Urban living standards can now be had in the remotest of rural areas.  That, in itself, has been made possible because of the foresight of the Government of the time in embarking on such a huge programme&mdash;that of rural electrification.</P>
      <P>It has helped to increase farm income as well as farm output.  When we complain of the high service charges we must bear in mind that electricity is a highly subsidised commodity, subsidised to the tune of £75 per house in the past.  The present charges do not relate to real costs.  At the same time, we must bear in mind that, had it not been subsidised, the scheme would not have been a success in rural Ireland because the rural dweller would not be in a position to pay the full economic cost of the installation.</P>
      <P>One problem which is very noticeable is that there is need for a better breakdown repair service, especially at weekends. A breakdown in supply can be very costly to a farmer who is depending on it, especially at weekends.  Apart from having to milk his cows by hand, he may lose a batch of bonhams, or his wife may lose a clutch of chickens or turkeys.  We all must bear in mind that rural electrification is now part of our everyday lives.  We depend on it for heating our boilers and so on, apart from the fact that in more recent years we have gone a long way in the installation of central heating and again it has meant further use for electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One very disturbing problem at the present time is the fact that when people build new houses grants will not <Col N="1591" /> be paid to those people, either by the Government or the local authority, until the electricity is already connected. Grants have been held back for as long as 12 months because of the failure of the ESB to carry out the necessary installation.  I feel that something will have to be done so that a stand-by gang will always be available to carry out speedy connection of supplies.  It must be borne in mind that great hardships have been endured by people who have had homes built and who have spent a great deal of money on those homes only to find that they cannot avail of the grants until the ESB have carried out their work.  I would appeal to the Minister to urge the ESB to exercise greater co-operation with the contractors or private individuals and the Department of Local Government in an effort to alleviate this serious and urgent problem.</P>
    <P>The most controversial problem today is, of course, the special service charge for new connections.  While we could argue the pros and cons of that particular item until the cows come home, we must bear in mind that it is, in fact, penalising somebody who may not have resided in the area when the area was being wired up in the first instance.  We can see, of course, from the ESB's point of view, that when they come back to carry out extensions it proves very costly.  At the same time it is very hard to get the message across to the man who purchases a farm in any particular area that he has to pay more than his next door neighbour just because he did not reside in that area or because the particular house or farmyard was not built when the area was being connected up in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The ESB has become part of our lives. It has done a great deal for tourism.  It has done a great deal in every facet of our day-to-day lives.  Apart altogether from that, of course, is the fact that it is a great source of employment and will be for many more years to come.</P>
    <P>The ESB now find it necessary to go back and carry out maintenance on equipment which they installed when the scheme was started in 1946 or 1947. That again is a very costly scheme with <Col N="1592" /> the replacement of poles, wires and crossbeams, etc.  While people may from time to time have reason to complain, we must all agree that the ESB is now part of our system and we cannot do without it.  We will always have little problems but I must compliment the Minister and his Department on making this extra sum of money available and I wish their efforts in finalising the problem of bringing electricity to every part of rural Ireland every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to briefly welcome this Bill.  It is most appropriate because it will help the people who are in the more remote areas of rural Ireland, and perhaps people who were not convinced of the advantages of rural electrification when it was first introduced.  I should hope, now that the Oireachtas are giving the ESB this considerable amount of money, that perhaps they would have an opportunity of taking another look at the special service charges and the bi-monthly charges also.  This has been the bone of contention with me over a decade in the House and I feel it is time that the problem was tackled.</P>
      <P>We now find, if I am interpreting the Minister's speech correctly, that the people who opted out of the original electrification scheme throughout the country, thereby making the installation dearer for the people who wanted to avail of the service, are now getting more favourable terms than those of us throughout the country who cooperated with the ESB 20 years ago. This is something that should be taken into account at this time.  The special service charges already levied for the past ten or 15 years should now benefit from the moneys about to be spent or, if not, the Minister should include an additional few million pounds to cover this contingency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support Senator Fitzgerald's plea on this but he did not develop it as far as I would wish.  When Deputy Childers was Minister for Transport and Power I remember going into this and we had the very famous problem of the large Georgian mansions acquired by the Irish Land Commission. These were allocated to farmers <Col N="1593" /> with what was then considered to be a viable economic holding of 45 or 50 acres of land.  In one place in my own county the bi-monthly charge was something in the region of £6.  This of course was altogether uneconomic for a man who had acquired a holding.  This is something which we could go into.</P>
    <P>It is most inequitable and unjust to have an overhead charged on the floor area of a house when nowadays large houses are more of a hindrance than a help.  Surely this is the last opportunity we will get of putting a ceiling of, say, £2 on the fixed charge?  I know one case of a family who have what could be described as a Georgian dwelling with about eight or nine rooms in it, but yet they are only one farming family. This one farmer, with a family, pays more in overhead charges than the families living in 12 adjacent county council cottages.  This is surely unjust and the ESB now have an onus on them to look at this again.  The extra money being voted to the ESB should be devoted towards easing the burden on those paying overhead charges in excess of £2.50.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to people who pioneered the rural electrification Scheme&mdash;people such as Canon Hayes and his organisation.  At that time, or prior to that, people in the country had not thought of these advantages or had not expected them to come their way.  It would be a pity now if the people who were public spirited enough to go out and canvass their neighbours to avail of the rural electrification scheme should have to pay higher charges in 1971 than the people who sat on the fence and criticised the more public spirited members of the rural community who not only availed of the service but believed in staying in the rural areas and making country life more attractive for their families.  This is the Minister's last opportunity of redressing this grievance.</P>
    <P>I, too, should like to avail of this opportunity of paying a tribute to the ESB for their service.  From my own experience the men who man the 24-hour breakdown service, who are perhaps near the bottom rung of the ladder in the ESB, do a tremendous job. Many ordinary members of the public <Col N="1594" /> like ourselves do not appreciate the difficulties and dangers under which these people work.</P>
    <P>I should also like to compliment the professional section of the ESB, the engineering staff, on the work which they have carried out over the years.  In the ESB's house magazine, I have noted over the years the tremendous inventions and innovations which our people in the ESB have perfected.  New techniques in handling lines and the development of the school in Portlaoise should be a great help towards maintaining a very efficient service for the public.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why the ESB do not pay a little more attention to public relations.  Maybe it is because they do not feel too friendly towards the customers who forget to pay their bills on time.  When customers forget to pay in time I see no reason why the ESB accounts section cannot just write out and say &ldquo;Dear Customer&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo;, perhaps would be a better word, instead of this peculiar phrase &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam&rdquo; right under the name of the customer.  I think this is wrong.  This kind of thing is unnecessary and the Department are quite happy to use &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo;.  I find it annoying when I find a letter addressed to me with the first words &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam&rdquo;. They use this phrase on all their circulars.  Maybe they want to be a little different from the rest.</P>
    <P>With regard to development, I feel that the ESB are giving a very good service and the number of complaints that people make against the service are few and far between.  I note that the ESB, because they are a large organisation, are particularly lucky and they can afford to pick and choose the personnel they have working for them. The young men who represent the company are a very good type.</P>
    <P>As regards the advertising of this final phase of the rural electrification scheme I feel that the company could go a little easy on television, because obviously people with television sets will already be customers of the ESB. Therefore, I think it is important that the advertising on which the ESB embark to ask for customers should go through the provincial press especially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> This should be done on three or four consecutive weeks, because it can happen that a family will miss out on a paper one week, but it is unlikely that they will miss three or four weeks running.</P>
    <P>The ESB should also endeavour to put service lines in new housing estates underground.  In some schemes this practice is adopted and in others it is not.  Whether the onus is on the builder, be it the local authority or a private developer, to pay extra for this I do not know.  For safety reasons I think the ESB should at this stage insist that all new service lines for new houses should go underground.</P>
    <P>With those few remarks I wish to welcome this Bill.  I am very happy to see rural electrification being extended to the last remaining people in the country who are without supply and I sincerely hope that the board will have every success in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with Senator McDonald's remarks.  I was a little bit annoyed when I saw him getting up, thinking he might steal my thunder, and he did.</P>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly about the charges to the rural dwellers on a floor area basis.  It is entirely unjust and it means that the ordinary consumer in a rural area is paying far more for his electricity than the people in the urban areas.  About two years ago the ICA did an enormous amount of research into the problem and at a council meeting which was held in Limerick they had an ESB official in attendance.  He was unable to refute the statements that were made, and at that time the file was sent to the Minister's office.  The Minister should look into this matter and see what is happening. We want the people to stay in rural Ireland and yet we penalise them in every way possible, even charging them more than we do the urban dwellers for electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the advertising which is now being done, I would suggest that when there is a district-by-district census being taken of the number of <Col N="1596" /> people not yet connected, the names and addresses of all these people should be available.  Even if the ESB only sends out a letter saying &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam&rdquo;, it will be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Seanad for a very constructive debate. This is a measure which has been generally welcomed in both Dáil and Seanad because the intention is a very desirable one from the social point of view: to finally achieve total rural electrification, or as much as it is possible to get.  The target is 98 per cent rural coverage by March, 1975.</P>
      <P>Senators Dooge, McDonald, Mrs. Farrell and other Senators spoke about the necessity for having a thorough advertising campaign in connection with this final drive.  I agree with this. As I said in my opening remarks, the ESB have divided the country into a total of 792 areas.  In 520 of these the scheme has been completed.  There are therefore 272 areas where rural electrification has not been completed. In these 272 areas, which are mainly in the more remote parts of the country, such as Cork, Kerry, Galway, Mayo and Wicklow, there will be a total house-by-house re-canvass done, so as to bring this message home to the consumers.</P>
      <P>In the balance of the 520 areas that have been completed but where there are individual people who have not been connected for one reason or another, there will be an intensive advertising and publicity campaign carried out by the ESB in co-operation with local voluntary and rural organisations and with the churches, as well as the provincial press.  This will be an intensive campaign to bring home to the people the fact that this is, as Senator Dooge said, their last chance to avail of the subsidised rates which obtain at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that aspect of the subsidised rate for rural dwellers in particular, because of the remarks made by Senator McDonald and Senator Mrs. Farrell about the charges in rural areas.  The charges in rural areas are substantially subsidised at present.  The special service charge reduction that <Col N="1597" /> was introduced in June, 1968, meant a reduction of as much as two-thirds of the service charge which operated until 1968.  The very success of that reduction in the special service charge in attracting new applicants for rural areas is proven by the fact that the target set in 1968 was missed&mdash;to the extent it was missed&mdash;because of the increased demand stimulated by the reduction in the special service charge in 1968.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that the ESB underestimated substantially the number of rural houses to be connected.  The reason for that underestimation was that, side by side with this plan of connection in 1968, came the reduction in the special service charge that stimulated far more rural applicants than anticipated by the ESB. Senator Fitzgerald also raised this point and what I have just said is relevant to the point mentioned by him.</P>
    <P>I shall give a practical example concerning the special service charge which, in fact, never covers the ESB's extra costs.  The example is of a house costing £1,000 to connect.  In respect of this house, it would require £90 a year in fixed charges or £15 per two-month period to cover interest charges alone without taking into account depreciation and maintenance costs.  The normal fixed charge includes a special service charge in such cases of only £6 5s, instead of the £90 a year for a house costing £1,000 to connect.  I mention that to emphasise the fact that rural connection is a highly expensive business.</P>

      <P>It is a popular misconception that because a pole is near a house being erected the cost of connection should be lower on that account.  A connection to that pole may not be feasible in such a case.  Some other type of connection may be involved.  I want to emphasise this, because it is all-important for people, when planning a house and before they commence building it, to consult the ESB as to the most economic location. They should get expert advice from the ESB on the location of the house so as to get the connection at minimum cost. This makes for commonsense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I grant the Senator that.  We cannot plan for everything.  I am only offering a helpful piece of advice.  The ESB find that many problems on their side could be obviated in regard to cost by simple consultation with them prior to the construction of a house.  I am offering this advice particularly to people who may have an alternative site.  This applies in the country, particularly where a farmer is not tied down to any particular site.  He would have an area of land from which to choose and it is advisable for him in such a case, before he commences construction of the new house, to consult the ESB and obtain proper advice.  He should not go on the visual, amateur notion that because there is a pole there the house can be stuck down beside the pole and the connection made at low cost.  It is not as easy as that.  There are more complex, technical matters involved in connection with the appropriate system, <Col N="1599" /> the load that the system where the house is being built can bear, and a number of other matters that can be ironed out between the applicant and the ESB.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald has, obviously, got special cases in mind.  He mentioned this to me on a man-to-man basis recently. I would like particulars of these cases and I certainly will look into them.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made by Senator McDonald and other speakers of the question of underground supply.  I want to emphasise that the ESB have pioneered investigation and research into underground electricity distribution. A new type of underground residential distribution called URD which enables a 10KV supply with underground transformers to be brought to urban housing development at a reasonable cost has now been undertaken in a number of new housing estates.  This is the first time the system has been developed in Europe.  The special transformers used in the system have been supplied by Irish manufactures and it is a pioneering development.</P>
      <P>The board have decided, as a matter of general policy, that all supply to new major housing developments will in future be placed underground.  This decision has been influenced by the board's desire to contribute to environmental improvement and the implementation has been made possible by the development of new techniques in the provision of such supply.  I want to emphasise that point because the ESB are often criticised by people who are concerned with preservation and conservation. This is a practical example of a large, technological corporation which is taking a practical interest in the environmental aspect.  Because of this interest the board has developed this new type of underground distribution system which is unique not alone in Europe but in the world.  Certainly this is the first time it has been attempted in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point raised by several Senators, including Senator Cranitch and Senator O'Brien, was that industrial relations within the ESB were not as they should be.  This has not been the case since the new restructuring of the ESB has <Col N="1600" /> taken place.  Because of a very real desire to improve industrial relations within the ESB, I employed McKinsey and Company two years ago.  They brought in their report around 15 months ago and in it recommended a complete restructuring of the management system in the ESB.  This has been done and now we have a proper management structure at the top and delegation of responsibility right down through the organisation.  This has resulted in a substantially improved effect on the morale within the ESB. We have had no serious industrial relations trouble within the board since this recommendation has been implemented.  In an organisation with over 11,000 employees industrial relations are all-important.  The new management structure has been generally welcomed within the board I understand that relations are much better and there is greater liaison and a more flexible attitude taken towards decision-making in regard to any potential industrial troubles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the management consultants found, in effect, was that the ESB was too rigidly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The main findings of the consultants was that the ESB was too hierarchically structured. There was no dispersed system of management structure at the top running down through the organisation. Decision-making was not dispersed sufficiently through the organisation. Since their findings were made known to the ESB a complete restructuring of the ESB organisation has taken place with a view to enabling decisions to be taken right down along the line.  The result is that much of the friction that existed and was causing unnecessary industrial troubles has been removed. That has been our experience over the past 15 months within the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> Senator Keegan raised the point about the inadequacy of the breakdown service in rural areas.  I shall certainly have this investigated.  That is one of the reasons why, of the £18 million provided for this crash rural electrification programme in the next few years, £11 million will go towards the improvement of the existing distribution system, to improve the breakdown service and all aspects of the existing system.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to refer concerns the special service charge.  Senator McDonald appears to be under the misconception that the people who have come into the reduced special service charge in mid-summer, 1968, are in some way at an advantage, as against people who, prior to that had to pay the heavier special service charge.  That is not the case.  The new reduced special service charge introduced in June, 1968, applied to all existing consumers, as well as to consumers since then.  It was made retrospective to people who had been connected prior to 1968.</P>

      <P>No.  In this Bill I am providing more finance to enable rural electrification to be completed within four years.  That is one leg of the Bill. The other leg is to raise the capital limit from £350 million to £450 million to enable the capital investment sought by the ESB to be carried out over the next four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the nub of the Bill and it is an objective that needs to be achieved because of the backlog that was arising in regard to rural connections.  We are proceeding on a year-to-year basis instead of on a planned basis.  We now have a planned four-year basis of attack on this problem, with the capital moneys allocated every year for the next four years, so that the board can <Col N="1602" /> go ahead on a planned intensive basis, to complete this job, rather than be dependent on the year-in, year-out, vagaries of the Exchequer.  The important aspect of Bill is that whereas last year we spent £3.1 million on rural electrification, this year, as a result of this Bill, we shall be spending £3.7 million; next year we shall spend £4.1 million; in the third year, £4.7 million; and in the fifth year, £5.5 million. These moneys are being allocated; we can plan accordingly and complete this great task which was commenced 25 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to participate in an international scheme to collect charges from airlines for en-route air navigation services which we supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other aeronautical authorities, we incur expenditure under two broad classifications in respect of air traffic control, radio navigation, communications and meteorological services provided for air transport.  The first head comprises terminal services at airports such as approach and take-off control, instrument landing aids, radar <Col N="1603" /> monitoring and meteorological and general information.  The second type of service comprises those provided to aircraft en-route to ensure safe and accurate navigation and these are provided not only for aircraft travelling to and from our airports but for aircraft crossing our airspace on their way to other destinations.  These services, generally described as en-route air navigation services include air traffic control, radio aids, radar, telecommunications and meteorological services.  Up to the present the only charges we have made are landing charges for aircraft using our airports and a special telecommunication charge per contact for aircraft on the North Atlantic route using our telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>The recovery of en-route costs by an individual state presents difficulties where the air routes traverse the control area of several states and/or vertical sectors of routes subject to control by different authorities.  In such cases the only satisfactory means of recoupment is on the basis of inter-state co-operation. Such co-operation is possible under the aegis of the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, known as Eurocontrol. This organisation, of which Ireland is a member, together with Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, was set up with the object of controlling air traffic in the upper airspace of the seven member states&mdash;above 25,000 feet in the case of Ireland&mdash;while the member states are directly responsible for these services in their respective lower airspaces.  Meteorological services in both the upper and lower airspaces are the direct responsibility of the member states.</P>
    <P>The cost of route air navigation facilities and services has been constantly increasing and will rise considerably in the years ahead owing to the automation of control services which will be necessary to cope with the growth and density of air traffic in Western Europe.  Eurocontrol member states have been considering the ways in which they could recover the cost of these facilities in the form of charges levieb on the users.  Following lengthy <Col N="1604" /> study of the problem, the member states eventually decided that Eurocontrol should introduce a charging system which is in line with recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organisation which has also carried out a study of the problem.</P>
    <P>Under the charging scheme proposed, there will be a single charge for each flight calculated according to the distance traversed and the weight of the aircraft.  The scheme will come into effect from 1st November, 1971.  Eurocontrol will operate the scheme and collect the receipts.  The receipts less the actual cost of collection will be distributed to the member states in proportion to their costs in providing these services.  For the first two years it is aimed to collect only 15 per cent of costs plus the cost of collection, but the long-term aim is that the full costs of these services should be met by the air transport industry for whom they are provided.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1963, provides for the making of regulations for the payment of fees to Eurocontrol, or to the Minister for Transport and Power for transmission to Eurocontrol, in respect of air navigation services provided by Eurocontrol.  The section also covers payment of fees to the Minister in respect of services provided by the Minister.  The section, however, would not enable Eurocontrol to act as agent for the Minister in the collection of route charges.  The purpose of the Bill is to replace section 12 by a new provision which will enable the making of regulations to provide adequately for the new system of charges.  Regulations, as provided for under the Bill, will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Because the proposed charge will be a single one applying to the lower airspace, which is the responsibility of member states, as well as to the upper airspace it is necessary that a multilateral agreement be entered into by the member states, the main provision of which is to require the member states to establish the proposed charge in the airspace falling within their competence. For the collection of the charge it was necessary to complete a series of bilateral agreements between each <Col N="1605" /> member state and the Eurocontrol organisation, the main provisions of which are that each member state entrusts to the organisation the collection of the charge on its behalf and undertakes to take statutory powers to make it obligatory on airlines to pay the charge to the organisation.  The organisation is required to distribute the receipts to the member states less the cost of collection.</P>
    <P>These agreements were signed by the Irish Ambassador in Brussels in September, 1970.  The multilateral agreement was signed with reservation as to ratification, to be followed by ratification when this Bill becomes law.  The bilateral agreement with Eurocontrol will not become operative until the multilateral agreement enters into force following ratification by all member states.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill will be welcomed by the House for a number of reasons, not the least of these is that it is a pleasant change to those who are ratifying an agreement to find that the Bill has actually been introduced before the agreement is supposed to come into force.  There are many <i>post hoc</i> Bills of this sort and I congratulate the Minister on having brought in this Bill in due time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is to be welcomed also because it gives us an opportunity of paying tribute to the very high standard of the navigational and meteorological services which are provided in this country.  I have very great pleasure in paying such a tribute.  On occasions when we are travelling by air we sometimes wish that other aspects, such as the handling of baggage, would reach the same level of efficiency as the handling of navigational control.  On more sober reflection, we are glad that <Col N="1606" /> the priority is given to the question of navigational control.</P>
    <P>When one looks at this section and compares it with the old section 10, at first sight it seems as if a lot has been done.  In the Bill the Minister is replacing an original section of three subsections by a new section with ten subsections.  On a closer look one finds a reflection in the new section 1 of the Bill of the growth in complexity since 1963 in regard to air navigation.  There is need for multilateral controls because of the greater extent of overflying of national territories, and the introduction of provision for such matters as records, which were probably not part of the navigational aid at the time the original Bill was passed.</P>
    <P>On a quick reading of the Bill, it is not possible to see any aspect in which one could suggest an alternative way of doing it.  The enactment of an agreement entered into after negotiation is a technical business.  Accordingly, the Bill is welcomed and the House will be happy to pass it with due despatch.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any more for me to say.  This is an enabling Bill and it marks another step in the growing Europeanisation of our institutions.  Eurocontrol will be the organisation concerned with the collection of these charges over the whole Western area.  Each member state to that extent will have delegated through this European organisation the function of carrying out this job.</P>
