      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to raise the limit of the aggregate potential liability I may assume in respect of export credit guarantees from £10 million to £30 million.  The extent of the increase is due partly to normal expansion in the demand for export credit insurance and partly to the introduction, on 1st February last, of a new State-backed scheme of export credit insurance.</P>
      <P>Export credit insurance enables exporters to insure against loss the risks entailed in selling goods abroad on credit terms.  These risks fall into two main classes: commercial risks, arising from default or insolvency of the buyer, and political risks, arising from the outbreak of war or revolution in the buyer's country or from Government action in the buyer's country which would prevent the goods being delivered or paid for.  Examples of such action would be the introduction of new import controls or restrictions on payment transfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most western European countries, and indeed elsewhere too, export credit insurance, covering both commercial and political risks, is provided by the State.  In Ireland, up to recently, only political risks insurance was guaranteed by the State, but under the new scheme all export credit insurance will <Col N="312" /> be so guaranteed.  I think it would be helpful at this point to explain to the Seanad the background to this development.</P>
    <P>In 1955, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, by virtue of his powers under the Insurance Act, 1953, concluded an agreement with a group of four Irish insurance companies that they would issue political risks insurance policies which would be entirely reinsured with the Minister. The companies would also issue commercial risks policies but these would be issued on their own account.</P>
    <P>The system was quite satisfactory and for a long time provided exporters with the insurance backing they needed. However, by the late 1960s Irish exports had expanded enormously.  They now included an increasing proportion of sophisticated capital and engineering goods, normally sold on longer credit terms than the simpler kinds of consumer goods.  Exporters were exploring new markets where satisfactory commercial information was harder to get. They were finding it harder to compete with exporters from other countries whose State-backed credit insurance schemes gave them facilities which it would be impossible for a commercial insurer, operating on normal commercial insurance principles, to provide.</P>
    <P>A working group set up by my predecessor to examine the adequacy of existing Irish export credit insurance facilities confirmed this situation.  The group, which included representatives of the insurance companies and of exporters, as well as Córas Tráchtála and Government Departments, concluded that Irish exporters needed the same export credit insurance facilities as their competitors from other countries and at premiums broadly comparable with those paid by their competitors. They recommended that State support should be given for a scheme covering both commercial and political risks and that the insurance facilities provided and the premiums payable should be reasonably comparable with those of other countries.  The recommendations of the group were accepted and it was decided that the best method of setting up the new system would be to arrange with an existing Irish owned <Col N="313" /> insurance company to administer the scheme, as my agent, in return for an agreed commission.  At that time there were two Irish owned and controlled insurance companies, which either were engaged in export credit insurance, or had experience of it.  The two companies were approached.  One company, after some discussion, indicated that it did not wish to handle the scheme and agreement was finally reached with the other company, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd.  This company has been engaged in export credit insurance for 15 years continuously, on its own account for commercial export credit risks insurance and on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for political risks insurance.  Under the new scheme, when dealing with export credit insurance, the company will be acting solely on my behalf and solely as my agent.  I consider myself fortunate to have secured the services of a company with so much experience and technical knowledge in this field as the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. have.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the exporter, the new scheme of export credit insurance provides, in a single policy, cover for the commercial and political risks attendant on selling goods abroad on credit terms.  Similar cover is available for design and planning services carried out in Ireland in connection with engineering or constructional works executed outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>The general terms of the export credit insurance cover now available and the premium rates charged are reasonably comparable with the terms of such cover and the premium rates charged in other countries.</P>
    <P>The new scheme of export credit insurance will result in an immediate increase in the aggregate amount of my potential liability for export credit guarantees, since I will be taking on the provision of cover for commercial export credit risks, formerly outside the scope of the State scheme.  It is to be expected, in addition, that the new and improved facilities will attract considerable additional business as exporters realise the support they can get from export credit insurance.  Indeed, one of the considerations mentioned in the report of the working group was <Col N="314" /> the necessity that exporters should be fully informed of the benefits of export credit insurance, so that the expansion of exports and the diversification of export markets could thus be promoted.</P>
    <P>A scheme of credit at preferential rates for exporters of capital goods has been in preparation by the banks for some time.  The introduction of the scheme, which I hope will not long be delayed, will lead to a considerably increased demand for export credit insurance.</P>
    <P>Because of all the factors mentioned, the present limit of £10 million on the aggregate liability which I may assume for export credit guarantees will be too low and under this Bill I am seeking to have it raised to £30 million.  It is, of course, hardly necessary to state that what is involved is a maximum potential liability.  The aggregate amount of the liability at any time for principal moneys in respect of export credit guarantees would become an actual liability only if risks covered by all the insurance policies in operation at the time materialised together.  It will be appreciated that this is an extremely unlikely contingency.  In fact, it is my intention that, taking one year with another, the State scheme of export credit insurance should involve no net loss to State funds.  I commend the scheme to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall start the few remarks I have to make with a comment on the last words of the Minister, which relate to the assurance that he gives the House&mdash;not an assurance, that is not a fair word to use&mdash; the belief that a State scheme for export credit insurance should involve no net loss to the State.  Since 1953 we have had in existence a provision&mdash; section 2, subsection (3) of the Insurance Act, 1953&mdash;for export credit insurance. The amount provided in subsection (3) of that Act is £2 million and I think that was amended to £10 million in 1969.  The House should have been told by the Minister before this debate began whether any net loss has been suffered by the State by virtue of this provision of the original Act, which is being amended simply, as I understand what is being proposed to <Col N="315" /> the House, by an extension of the amount of the liability that the State can take on.</P>
      <P>That is a relevant consideration where we are dealing with realities, and among the realities with which we have to deal are the resources available to the community.  I am sure that the Minister, in reply, will be able to tell me that this is a figure that, if I were knowing enough, I should already know.  However, I do not know, and perhaps at this point in the debate he could tell us what loss has been suffered by virtue of the provision&mdash;a provision which, having been produced in 1953, was, I should have thought, introduced about 30 years too late.</P>
      <P>A similar sort of provision has existed in Britain since the termination of the Great War.  It was introduced in 1918, 1919 or 1920.  We have only lately realised that exporters need to be insured against political and commercial risks and that there is the matter of having to pay a premium to secure the benefit of the insurance given.  I do not know anything about the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. except that they are quoted as an Irish Stock Exchange company.  I do not see why, speaking with absolute detachment from that company, they should be given the singular position that the Bill seems to propose to give to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned at the beginning of his speech the agreement which was made with four Irish insurance companies.  Would the Minister tell us who or which were the four Irish insurance companies?  He used a phrase at another stage that there were two Irish owned and controlled insurance companies. Has that got a special significance? Are there old Irish insurance companies or an old Irish insurance company?  Perhaps the oldest of them all is the one that is no longer Irish owned in the sense that the shares are held in Ireland but are excluded from being described as Irish, although wholly controlled in Ireland.  I should like to know, and I think it is only fair that the House should be told, which were the two companies that were approached and which is the second company which refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> I am wholly in favour of export credit insurance.  It is a necessary and significant arm in the matter of developing our exports.  I am only sorry that it has come later than it should have come.  I know that in another country the premium which the supplier, the Irish exporter in this case, pays is not paid to a company which is on the Dublin Stock Exchange but which is owned by the State.  The State gets the premium and the buyer abroad pays for his goods by issuing promissory notes which are taken up by a bank or banks who take a turn on the operation and take a lower rate of interest for the benefit of the customer and therefore for the encouragement of the exporter.  This is done because there is a guarantee from a Government body, not from the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd., whose accounts might well be before the House today when we are considering how a foreign purchaser might value that guarantee of which the Government are guarantors.  We have a provision for a counter-guarantee, if I understand section 2 (3) of the Insurance Act, 1953, subsequently amended in 1969 and now proposed to be amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>If I were a gnome of Zurich I would tend to estimate the value of a direct guarantee in terms of the value of the direct guarantor.  If the Government were not the direct guarantor I would value the direct guarantee less by a percentage which is this cost to the exporter. There is a lot to be said for a State-owned insurance company with the authority of the Government behind them dealing with this matter. The resources of the Government would be made available to the company taking and guaranteeing the risks which are proposed to be guaranteed to the extended limit proposed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is open to us to propose an amendment of this kind to this section, which was already amended by another Act to deal with this. The Minister and his advisers could have a look at the whole scheme for the guarantee of exports here to see if the State is making enough money out of it or if the exporters are getting encouragement by this method to <Col N="317" /> achieve a sufficiently high level of exports, because the customer who is buying the goods is not satisfied with the machinery that is proposed to him as being his guarantee against the fault of the exporter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I should like to welcome this Bill.  I regret that in discussing the Bill, which is described as the Insurance Bill, 1971, we are so restricted in what we can say about insurance in general. I am sure that there are many aspects of insurance that Senators would like to refer to and to discuss if they had the opportunity.  Those who read the Dáil debates on this Bill found that it was very easy to go outside the scope of the Bill and so bring the wrath of the Chair down on one.  As a result there was practically no discussion on any other aspect of insurance.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made here of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland which are a company that give what is known as an insurance bond to building contractors.  Those of us in public life will realise that because of the apparent delays in the issuing of bonds to building contractors, it is found that the building of houses has been greatly restricted as a result.  Having made that point I do not wish to debate any other aspect of insurance.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Bill in the other House the Minister pointed out that export credit insurance was introduced in this country in 1955 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce. He also pointed out&mdash;although I think no mention of this is made in his introductory speech here&mdash;that in the 15 years since the drawing up of the present scheme Irish exports have increased from £110 million to £468 million per year.  Therefore, the 1955 scheme no longer provides the facilities needed by exporters today.</P>
      <P>Some doubt and concern seem to have been created by the handing over of this scheme to one insurance company, namely the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald seems to have some doubts on this and I agree with him in some ways.  In his introductory speech the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time there were two Irish owned and controlled insurance <Col N="318" /> companies, which either were engaged in export credit insurance, or had experience of it.  The two companies were approached&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think we can all accept the Minister's word on that.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;One company, after some discussion, indicated that it did not wish to handle the scheme and agreement was finally reached with the other company, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd.  This company has been engaged in export credit insurance for 15 years continuously, on its own account for commercial export credit risks insurance and on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for political risks insurance. Under the new scheme, when dealing with export credit insurance, the company will be acting solely on my behalf and solely as my agent. I consider myself fortunate to have secured the services of a company with so much experience and technical knowledge in this field as the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. have.</P>
    <P>We can all accept that the Minister did not lightly hand over this very good business.  I believe&mdash;and Senator Alexis FitzGerald has pointed this out &mdash;that there is no risk involved for the insurance company because the political risks are being underwritten by the State.  The Minister, when he is replying, can correct me on that if I am wrong, but I feel that this is a good business risk for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  However, I am also satisfied that the Minister did not hand it over to a particular insurance company without first having consulted other insurance companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make only a few brief remarks because most of what I intended to say has been covered by either Senator Alexis FitzGerald or Senator Jack Fitzgerald.  I notice from the Minister's introductory statement that in 1955 an agreement was reached with four Irish companies under which the Minister underwrote the political risks, and the commercial risks remained with the four companies concerned. If the same situation could have been continued, whereby the Minister <Col N="319" /> would continue to underwrite the political risks, more than one Irish insurance company would have been interested in continuing to underwrite the commercial risks.  It was because of the change in the circumstances surrounding commercial risks that the Irish companies, with the exception of one apparently, decided to withdraw from the scheme.  That was a pity.  As has already been said, it removes the essential ingredient of competition which is very desirable when operating through commercial companies.  Of course, it would have been a different situation if the Minister had decided to set up a State-owned company of his own.  We could then appreciate the reasons for having a monopoly of this type of insurance.</P>
      <P>In his introductory statement the Minister went on to say that on an unspecified date&mdash;and perhaps he will give us the date when replying&mdash;a working group set up by his predecessor to examine the adequacy of existing Irish export credit insurance facilities confirmed the then situation.  In other words, it would be necessary to insure commercial as well as political risks.  This group recommended that the risks concerned should be dealt through one Irish owned and controlled company. The actual wording is: &ldquo;with an existing Irish owned company&rdquo;. Two companies who qualified under that heading were approached and one declined.  What would the situation have been if both companies had been interested?  Would the Minister have gone against the recommendation of the working party that only one existing Irish insurance company would undertake the administration of the scheme as his agent, or would he have accepted two, or possibly more, Irish insurance companies if they were interested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance business is quite a substantial business nowadays.  I do not pretend to know what the rates of commission are but I would imagine they are quite small.  The Minister speaks of &ldquo;competitive terms&rdquo; and perhaps he would give us some idea of what the commissions are.  The insurance business has grown very rapidly and it is a very heartening indication of the growth in Irish exports when one <Col N="320" /> considers that the risks have trebled in a short number of years and are likely to continue to expand.  I should like to ask the Minister what will be the position with regard to this particular type of scheme when free trade conditions obtain and when the protection, which the Irish insurance companies still enjoy under the 1936 Act, goes by the board?  Will foreign insurance companies have the right to compete for this type of political and commercial insurance business or will it still be confined to a particular nation's companies within the enlarged European Economic Community?</P>
    <P>Since the working party made the recommendation that the scheme should be administered by one Irish company, has the situation changed? In the intervening period has the situation with regard to Irish insurance companies changed?  In other words, has any subsequent approach been made to any other Irish insurance company to find out if they would be interested in the scheme?  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to clarify those points when he is replying. I should like to join with other Senators who have spoken in welcoming this Bill.  I welcome the reasons for the Bill.  The points I have referred to the Minister for clarification are merely made to ensure that all possible avenues in regard to ensuring competitive tenders will be explored by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and in particular I welcome the philosophy behind it.  The reasons for introducing it are obvious.  However, there is one point on which all of us should be clear.  Any exporter who wants to export is not bound to insure with an Irish company if he does not so wish. Quite obviously the purpose of this Bill is to enable him to obtain his insurance at rates which will ensure that his exports are competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The export of goods involves very considerable risks.  First of all, the goods must be up to sample, which may lead to disputes.  They may well be up to sample but a bad foreign importer, knowing the difficulty facing an Irishman in litigating in foreign countries, may argue that the goods <Col N="321" /> are not up to standard and may refuse to pay for them.  The exporter also must be assured of the creditworthiness of the customer who is importing the goods from Ireland.  That means a need for any insurance company to have a vast range of knowledge and expertise.  It means they must be in touch with agencies in countries all over the world.  It obviously would be quite uneconomic for two Irish companies to endeavour to have this expertise in competition.  It would mean the duplication of expenses.  In so far as political risks are concerned, some knowledge as regards the political state of a country is necessary.  If, for example, one is exporting to certain African countries, countries where one is likely to have revolutions of one kind or another, this knowledge is necessary.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the Irish Insurance Corporation&mdash;and as I say an Irish exporter was not bound to insure with them if he did not wish to&mdash;issued policies to protect the Irish exporter who wished to insure with them.  As I understand it, that was a completely commercial venture on their part.  They endeavoured to quote competitive rates, and subject to correction by the Minister, I do not think they were entitled to any subvention in so far as that is concerned.  I may be wrong.</P>
    <P>They also insured against political risk but in so far as that was concerned, as I understand it and again I may be wrong, they were completely indemnified by the Minister.  Therefore, as far as the political risks were concerned they were acting to a great extent as insurance brokers do today and were really taking no risk.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable an Irish company quote at rates which will be competitive with those which are being quoted by other Western European countries.  In those countries the insurance companies who are covering are subvented and assisted by the State.  If the exporters in this country are to be able to export competitively their rates also must be competitive. Therefore, I welcome not only the philosophy of the Bill but I welcome the Minister's handling of it, because to get two different companies doing it would simply double expense <Col N="322" /> no matter how you set about it.  It tends to competitive rates.  It is quite simple to compare the rates which are being charged by a company in Ireland with those which are being charged by companies in other countries. There is not really very much risk of a company making money at the expense of the State by undertaking an insurance of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one brief point in connection with this Bill.  The Minister has referred to the increase in exports.  I think it is worth recording, and I should like the Minister's assent to record this, that by and large the notable increase in exports to which the Minister refers has been brought into being&mdash;and hence the necessity for this Bill&mdash;by reason of the success of the export incentives which were created by the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956. I say this is a non-partisan way because it is necessary that people should know from time to time that there are different political parties in this State, that there have been different Governments in this State, but that the work of progress is not confined to the workings of any one political party in the State.  Certainly the export incentives which were created by the late Deputy Gerry Sweetman as Minister for Finance in 1956 have led in a very dramatic way to the expansion in exports, which the Minister, not unnaturally, feels is a very satisfactory position.  I think that should go on the record here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially, I should like to say that I am glad this Bill has been welcomed in this House.  It is the type of legislation which normally one would expect the Seanad to welcome. This was my experience in the Dáil also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said the necessity for this Bill was brought about by reason of the expansion we have had in exports down the years.  Every piece of legislation in relation to the encouragement of industry has contributed to this.  Senator Jack Fitzgerald pointed out that it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1955 who made <Col N="323" /> the original arrangement with the insurance companies which was found necessary at that time.  I do not want to take away from that in any way.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald referred to the fact that my introductory speech did not include any statement on the experience of the State in relation to political risks up to now.  It is my intention that, taking one year with another, the State scheme of export credit insurance should not involve any net loss to State funds.  This is stated in the last sentence of my introductory remarks.  Up to now there has not been any loss to State funds.  The position is that the total premium receipts on political risks insurance up to now has been £127,803&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the entire period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;over the entire period&mdash;and the claims paid amounted of £112,539 leaving an excess of £15,000 odd.  That has been the experience up to now.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash pointed out it was only natural that I should select one company because of the overheads. The hypothetical question was asked; if one of the two companies that had been approached in relation to this had not withdrawn, what would the Minister have done?  The company that did not participate was one of the four companies with whom the arrangement had been come to by the Minister at that time, but it dropped the credit insurance business during the years in between.  It had not been conducting any of this business at all in the mean-lime. They were not attracted towards this scheme.  The Insurance Corporation of Ireland is, in this instance, acting simply and solely as agent for me as Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As agent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As agent for me as Minister for Industry and Commerce. I think it was Senator FitzGerald who mentioned that unless this company were State guaranteed the potential purchaser at the far end would not be anxious to be insured under it. The whole object of this is to ensure <Col N="324" /> it is not the potential purchaser or the purchaser or the person who has placed the order who will be insured : it is the manufacturer or the exporter who will be sending out the goods who must insure against the commercial and the political risk of being paid, and the State has stepped in here to guarantee against the premium which the manufacturer or exporter here will pay.  There is no question of the recipient at the far end insuring himself against non-delivery.  The whole operation is for the exporter here to provide a facility.</P>
      <P>As I explained in my introductory remarks, the position is that a situation was being reached where our exporters were competing against other foreign companies in a market place where they were able to get a better insurance cover than was capable of being operated here.  We have now come up with a scheme whereby our exporter, or manufacturer who is exporting, can get quoted at a comparable rate with that which is available in other countries.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash drew attention to the great advantage of using one company as an agent in this regard and suggested that it would sound ridiculous and would be ridiculous to operate two different companies because each would have their respective overheads. As he said, there is necessity for expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Senator Russell who drew attention to, and read from, my opening remarks that the working group which had been set up by my predecessor, Deputy Colley, had recommended that this type of business be offered to insurance companies.  The principal recommendation of the working group&mdash;the working group did not recommend any individual insurance company&mdash;was that State support should be provided for a scheme of export credit insurance covering commercial risks in addition to the political risks covered by the existing scheme.  The second recommendation was that the scheme should provide for the issue of a unified policy covering both commercial and political risks at premium rates reasonably comparable with those charged in other countries. The third recommendation was <Col N="325" /> that the new arrangement should provide for a responsible body which would launch an active campaign of selling export credit insurance so that exporters might be fully informed of the benefits of credit insurance and that the diversification of export markets could thus be promoted.  This is what I propose to do in relation to this whole matter and this is why I am before the House&mdash;to be enabled to have this amount of money of State guarantee stepped up from £10 million to £30 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell asked what the situation might be following our entry into the EEC.  The situation would not change in any shape or form.  As Senator Nash says, there is no restriction on the exporter getting insurance coverage wherever he would wish.  Naturally, he is more than likely to operate through the Insurance Corporation of Ireland because from the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, as my agent in this regard, he can get comparable terms with anything he might get elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald asked why not establish a State company.  The situation here is that I do not feel it justifies the creation of a State insurance company to cover the demands in this regard.  This could be something that could be reviewed in due course arising from the use that is made of this scheme.  One of the things of which we are aware is that the percentage of user of this at the present time is pretty small.  Indeed, we will have to sell the scheme because of the necessity to ensure that our manufacturers and exporters are encouraged to insure so that they will be covered against the serious losses that could put them out of business in the event of their not being properly insured against this type of risk.</P>
    <P>Senator Jack Fitzgerald drew my attention, by way of criticism, taking it from the reference that was made in the Dáil, to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland in relation to a completely different matter which is, I suggest, not appropriate to this Bill.  The position is that a scheme has been drawn up whereby Irish exporters can be insured at comparable rates with others.  If <Col N="326" /> the State would appear to be turning over or earning too much profit out of this scheme, then naturally the premium adjustment would be made whereby the premiums would be reduced because, as I stated in my opening remarks, the object of the exercise here is to try to offer an insurance with State backing that will not lose money to the State.  On the other hand, it is not the object to make profit from it. Therefore, if a profit is created it means that the State would then be in a position to reduce the premium rates. A surfeit of failures involving compensation payments on the commercial or political sides would, of course, result in increased premiums.  The situation at the present time is that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland are able to offer terms comparable with, and in a number of cases better than, a number of State-sponsored organisations outside. I have endeavoured to cover most of the points that have been raised during the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can talk about is the extension from £10 million to £30 million.  It worries me to find that only one insurance company were prepared to take the direct risk.  I am worried also about the extent to which the Minister has considered the degree of risk he is taking on because of this.</P>
      <P>I regret that while the Minister was speaking I was chatting for a moment or two with my colleague on my left about what we are discussing here today.  We all know that we are trying to improve the position of our exporters.  I was endeavouring to clarify my mind as to the nature of the insurance that was being given&mdash;not by virtue of statute because the Minister can make altogether different arrangements. Here he is simply looking for power to increase his counter-guarantee liability to a sum of £30 million. One would have thought that his existing liability of £10 million covered by a net profit situation of £40,000 would have covered him for a reasonable period.  Presumably documents will emanate from the Minister and go to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd., armed with which they will be able to make attractive their proposals to insure the risk of the exporter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to be clear on what is the risk.  We seem here to be agreed that we are allowing the Minister to counter-guarantee, and he has told the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. to insure against the risk that the Irish exporter would not be paid on the export of his goods.  It would be helpful to me, as I go on, to get confirmation that I am right in that.  We are proposing to cover by counter-guarantee the risk that the Irish company which enters into a contract to supply goods abroad is able to get an assurance from the buyer that the buyer will pay. The buyer will pay a premium for that, which would be received by the Insurance <Col N="328" /> Corporation of Ireland.  Is this correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The exporter pays the premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is quite right.  The exporter is taking the risk when he enters into his contract for sale.  He pays the premium, which is got by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd.  There is no statutory right in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland to get this premium.  It is simply the company, as the Minister has told us frankly in this House today, with which he is proposing to do this business.  If the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. go out of business tomorrow, the Minister is free to enter into this arrangement with any other company.</P>
      <P>The quality and the strength of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. seem to me to be of enormous importance. There is the question of the rates of interest which will be charged to the purchaser and which the purchaser pays, as he will pay, by promissory notes, which under existing systems are taken up by banks or a bank. Because there is a direct Government guarantee, the rates of interest to the purchaser are lower.  This type of precision in the measurement of risk goes on in financial circles.  People take ¼ per cent on £10 million, for instance, and this is taking a risk.  They measure what their percentage charge ought to be on the basis of the person who is directly obliged to make the payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when he is considering recommending to this House an extension of the limit from £10 million to £30 million, ought to consider whether it should be a counter-guarantee or whether he ought to put himself in the position of, to put it frankly, the Board of Trade.  The Board of Trade in Britain does not operate through a publicly-quoted stock exchange company to do this business, giving that company a turn; they do the business themselves. Because they are in the market directly as the insurer of exports the buyer can get his money.  The rate of interest at which he has to pay <Col N="329" /> on the promisory note is less because it is the British Government who are guaranteeing.  It will not be the Irish Government who will be guaranteeing this.  It will be the Irish Government counter-guaranteeing it, which is one remove, and we all know the difficulties of operating when something goes wrong with an intermediary, such as relying on counter-guarantees.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being invidious. I certainly do not intend to take in the Minister or any members of his Department, or anyone.  The Minister should look at the quotation of the shares of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. in the last 12 months and ask himself whether the expectancy of this legislation has not affected the value of those shares to the benefit of informed persons within the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd.  I am not here to be clapped for making that point.  The creation, in effect, by ministerial decision, of a monopoly position for one publicly-quoted company is worthy of consideration by and on behalf of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect to my colleague, credit insurance is not a thing that any company willingly invite.  If Senator Alexis FitzGerald can get any of his clients to look for credit insurance, even in this country, where they are selling goods and want to be protected against bad debts, he will not find many insurance companies rushing for that kind of business. There are certain types of insurance which need so much expertise and so much internal machinery set up that unless it is on a very large plane it will not pay at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit insurance abroad needs still more expertise.  In all probability I should imagine that if an exporter in Ireland were selling to an importer in Germany, what an insurance company in Ireland would do is arrange an under-insurance with a company in Germany, because the first thing they have to be sure of and about which there must be no dispute is that the exported goods are up to sample. Otherwise, you will have the importer saying that the goods are not up to sample.  Of course, they may be up to <Col N="330" /> sample, but the point will be raised. As a result an offer to pay less will be made; the exporter will be kept out of his money.  I should imagine that there would be an arrangement with a company in the import country who would examine the goods there, come to a decision about them, arrange whether payment is made or not and decide &ldquo;You have re-insured with us; we shall settle up with you anyway.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald will also know that there are certain risks that are reasonably good ones, but they are not willingly undertaken unless they can be undertaken on a large scale. If I may be personal in something that affects both of us: for instance, take the insurance of professional liability by various professions.  It is something that you get only one company&mdash;and one company only&mdash;to do, and to do very well.  It is not something that the State could do without underwriting. It would be inadvisable for the State even to attempt it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Only to a limited extent. Lloyds cover a vast amount of the insurance business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this particular matter it is done by the Board of Trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to correction, I think that Lloyds in Britain do a very considerable amount of it.  As far as I know, even an exporter in Ireland can insure with Lloyds against it.  For example, at one time the livestock exports were done exclusively by Lloyds and they were charging up to 30s per cent for them.  Then a company was started here and, as far as I know, the present rates are about only 5s per cent, that is one-sixth, which makes a big difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exporter in Ireland will know that, although he is insuring with the insurance company in question, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd., for all practical purposes they are little better than brokers; and if he has a <i>bona fide</i> claim, ultimately the claim must be met by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Above all, it <Col N="331" /> is important that it should be with the company, because there are various things that could arise.  For instance, there is the exporter here&mdash;the exporter who is careless and who is not very particular about his own good name or the good name of his goods&mdash;who will export goods which are not up to standard and which are bound to give rise to trouble.  There is the exporter who, knowing that it is a direct State insurance and that he is insuring with the State will not take the least trouble to inquire about the creditworthiness of the customer abroad.  He is careless and slovenly in his whole approach to his business.  This is the sort of contest in which the State could not possibly enter because to the State all citizens must be equal: the lazy man, the careless man and the industrious man must all be treated as equal.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot see that the State could do better than it has done in the interests not only of the good name of our export trade and exported goods, but in the interests of business generally. That is why I particularly welcome the Bill.  I hold no brief whatever for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  I could not even think of their name a moment ago.  I particularly welcome the fact that it has been done through an insurance company who will be supervised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to raise a few points with the Minister.  This credit insurance scheme applies only to goods exported: it does not apply to services of any kind.  As the Minister knows, the term &ldquo;exports&rdquo; covers a very wide field other than purely physical goods.  Even insurance itself is a form of export: shipping, tourism, certain financial deals or policies include invisible exports.  I take it that these are not covered by the form of credit insurance.  This refers purely to physical goods, machinery, and many items manufactured here or exported from this country.  If that is so, is there any type of credit insurance for invisible exports of the type I have just mentioned and, if not, are they not worthy of consideration, too, having regard to their very important contribution to the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> In order that this scheme be effective it must be operated on a substantial volume, and I agree with Senator Nash in this regard.  If the terms to the exporter are going to be competitive, they must be done on a very big volume.  In his reply the Minister has not indicated what the rate of commission is.  He might give us that information because there is a very substantial sum involved.  I take it that this arrangement will be open, from time to time, to participation by other Irish-owned companies if they so desire. Some Irish companies may not participate, because they honestly feel that they have not the necessary expertise, which apparently the Insurance Corporation have in this business.  But times are changing, the economy is growing and the insurance business is growing with it; and I should like to think that at some future date the Minister will be free to broaden the basis of his agents, either by a consortium of Irish-owned companies, or else by inviting another individual Irish company to do the business as his agent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I pointed out in my introductory remarks on the Second Stage that, in addition to cover for commercial and political risks attendant on selling goods abroad on credit terms, similar cover was available for design and planning services carried out in Ireland in connection with engineering or constructional works executed outside Ireland.  This is covered in addition to the selling of goods abroad on credit terms.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Senator FitzGerald made reference to the necessity for increasing the limit from £10 million to £30 million at this stage, in relation to the volume of business done. With reference to that, the volume of business at present would appear not to be sufficient to justify the raising of this ceiling now.  The potential liability naturally fluctuates from time to time as policies expire and new policies are issued.  As at 30th March, 1970, the aggregate potential liability under the policies in force at that time was £3.6 million, and it was £3.9 million on 30th September, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though the statutory limit of £10 million seems to leave a considerable <Col N="333" /> margin for expansion, there is the necessity to raise it still further as the result of this new State-backed scheme which I have recently announced.</P>
    <P>The commitment has changed quite considerably with the announcement of this new scheme.  Originally only political risks were covered, but my liability will now include commercial credit risks as well as political risks, and this alone will raise the figure by another £2 million or £3 million.  In addition, it is expected that the improved terms and conditions offered under the new scheme, particularly when they are effectively brought to the notice of exporters through the reorganised scheme of publicity which is an integral part of the working group's recommendation, should lead rapidly to an increase in the volume of exports insured.</P>
    <P>I also referred on Second Reading to the hoped-for introduction by the banks in the near future of a scheme of favourable interest rates for exports of capital and durable goods.  This bank scheme will require that the goods be covered by export credit insurance. Therefore, there is no doubt that demand for this cover should escalate and quickly exceed the £10 million limit within the next 12-month period.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell wanted to know if the door is still open for any other insurance company.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald pointed out that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Minister from reviewing the position at any time.  The arrangement that I have made with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland is reviewable at 12-monthly intervals.  In relation to what Senator Nash said a few moments ago, the position is that if there were two separate insurance companies involved, both splitting the cake in half with overheads the same, the amount of commission to be paid by me to them would have to be increased. The only alternative to opening the door to other companies would be the one that has been hinted at by Senator Alexis FitzGerald&mdash;the creation of a consortium whereby they would all get together, because the cost to the State in commission of a scheme which would have to be <Col N="334" /> divided between two or three insurance companies would be greater than the cost of the one that I have arranged with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald made the point that somebody somewhere looking at stock exchange returns noticed that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. are in for a bonanza because of this arrangement they have with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not want to say: &ldquo;Not at all; they will be put to the skin of their teeth to operate this&rdquo; because this could interfere in any negotiations or dealings I might have with them in an effort to close the gap or to arrange a commission.  I am satisfied that I have made a reasonable commission arrangement at the present time.  I do not think that it would be proper for me to spell that out, as Senator Russell asked me to do. It is subject to annual review in the light of how the scheme is operating. Anybody with experience of the normal operations of a Government Department would realise that I, through my officials, would be endeavouring to get the scheme done, not at the cheapest price, but with the greatest return to the State.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the scheme we have in operation is quite satisfactory. It will be subject to annual review. This is quite satisfactory in view of the fact that, even at this stage, it would be impossible for me to say what my liability will be in 12 months time, because it all depends on how it appeals to exporters.  Our object is to try to get as much cover for our exporters as possible in order that they will be covered against any potential commercial and political risks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about a number of points.  I am sure the Minister will be able to clarify my mind and the minds of other members of the House.  Am I correct in thinking that the agent here, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, Ltd., will be the payer of the commission, because they are getting the counter-guarantee under section 3 of the Insurance Act, 1953, which we are proposing <Col N="335" /> to amend?  The State are going into business, and have been in business and are extending their business, and will be getting a return for being in business, which I trust will be profitable and will appear in the public accounts. If I had the energy and sufficient wit I could have discovered, on examination of previous public accounts, the returns being received from insuring the political risk.</P>
      <P>Should the Minister not be completely satisfied that his agent, even though he has a 12-monthly review arrangement, has the capacity to discern a good risk from a bad risk and to know what to exclude him from as a counter-guarantor, such as selling goods to some crook in Scotland?  It is to be noted that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. will not do this willingly, because there would be no benefit received through being involved in that; but what is the degree of experience of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. in the matter of insurance of export relief?  Why did the other companies get out of it?  What is the cost of the monopolistic position which the Minister has chosen to establish?</P>
      <P>Senator Nash spoke about the splitting of the commission.  Where is the commission being split here?  The commission, if I understand correctly, is being paid here to the Government.  It is not a question of splitting commission that is being received; it is splitting commission that is being paid, which is an entirely different matter.  It is a question of persons remaining in competition with each other in relation to a particular type of business.  We must all recognise insurance business as a risky business.  It is a case of knowing so much about your neighbour's child that you will not allow him to succeed.  However, you know more about your neighbour's child than you do about a foreigner's child.  There is obviously more risk in the insurance of the supply of goods or the proper payment for goods by a foreigner than there is in the insurance of Irish exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits of disappearing competition are very dubious to me.  It raises questions as to why competitiveness has disappeared and what the <Col N="336" /> effect of the monopoly position will be on the premium to be charged to the Irish supplier in relation to his exports.  I think the Minister is right in not disclosing to the public what his arrangements are with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd.  It would not be fair to that company and I do not think it is for the Minister to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash considered that the insurance business was not a business in which the Government should be involved.  The British Government is very much involved in this business. It is not involved exclusively or in a monopolistic way but it is involved in a very significant way.  It has developed, within the Board of Trade, the expertise which is directly available to the State because of the enormous liabilities that are undertaken by the State in relation to exports. Has the Minister carried out any examination of the degree of expertise available to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland which would justify him letting that company charge a premium to the Irish exporter which is not subject to any control?  This is of great benefit to that company.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned the insurance of exporters of goods.  The Minister, quite rightly, drew attention to his observation that insurance cover was available for design and planning services carried out in Ireland in connection with engineering and construction work executed outside Ireland. Why has the Minister limited cover solely to that activity?  Section 2 (1) of the Insurance Act, 1953, entitles him to&mdash;</P>
    <P>make arrangements for the giving to, or for the benefit of, persons carrying on a business or profession in the State, guarantees in connection with the export, manufacture, treatment or distribution of goods, the rendering of services or any other matter which appears to the Minister conducive to that purpose.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to tourism.  Take an equivalent case to Shannon Travel. The company, having booked many people into Irish hotels and having received moneys, becomes the ultimate debtor to the hotel with which it has <Col N="337" /> made the booking.  The Minister has power under section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1953, which is now being amended, to insure such persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I develop that point a little further for the benefit of Senator FitzGerald?  I intended to come back to that point.  However, the Minister made a very courteous reply to my question about a non-goods type of risk, but it did not quite cover what I had in mind, which was the tourist industry.  We are endeavouring to develop our tourist industry and have succeeded very well to date but nowadays many Irish people are going abroad on holidays.  A situation could arise in which an Irish tourist company could book people into hotels in Austria but for some political or other reason&mdash;their bookings may have been disrupted or they may have suffered some financial loss or physical injury &mdash;they may not be able to honour that commitment.  Can they be covered under this scheme?</P>
      <P>Is shipping, which is an expanding service, included in the scheme?  Shipping is a service which greatly aids exports and which we are trying to encourage very substantially.  Unfortunately, our cargo shipping trade has gone completely.  We are endeavouring to earn more income through the expansion of our shipping fleet and we have been very successful in this regard.  Is our shipping service covered by this type of insurance?  Let me return again to a point which Senator FitzGerald and myself have made.  Are services, as distinct from goods, covered by this insurance scheme?</P>

      <P>The short answer to the point made by Senators FitzGerald and Russell is &ldquo;no.&rdquo; However, that answer might turn out to be too short and be described as discourteous.

      <P>In relation to the arrangement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1955 when the scheme was started, there were four companies involved.  After the very early stages two of these four companies withdrew completely.  Down through the 1960s the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was the only company which was issuing policies in respect of both commercial and political risks.  The State stepped in and accepted the transfer of the political risk and the company carried the commercial risk.  This new operation is to carry both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Insurance Corporation of Irelnad has 15 years of constant experience of doing this type of job.  One could logically assume that, arising out of that 15 years, that company has experience and expertise which no other company has at the present time.  This is the straightforward answer to the point made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald. On the other point, the purpose of the 1953 Act is to encourage exports.  This extra £20 million being <Col N="339" /> provided at this stage is for the purpose of encouraging exports and not for anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, in the exercise of the expertise which the Minister refers to as having accumulated during the years as the sole trader in this business, been making profit from the employment of this expertise?  What are the comparable rates of premiums?  Does the arrangement which the Minister made, or proposes to make with the Insurance Corporation, put him in a position to prevent the monopoly which the Minister has very frankly told me he is giving the Insurance Corporation of Ireland being used to the disadvantage of the exporters and therefore to the disadvantage of the State?  There is another point which occurs to me at the very last moment and which can be discussed at greater length on the Report Stage if that is thought desirable. There is a Bill going through, or has gone through, perhaps, with regard to guarantees in relation to foreign currencies.  Is there any problem of this kind which can arise in this situation?  I am really thinking aloud, which is a big mistake to make except in your family sitting room. Is there any possibility that this could involve any liability on the Minister?</P>
      <P>It is the Minister's case really because we are not worried about the Insurance Corporation of Ireland as they will have to get consent from the Central Bank anyhow for any liability.  Is there any possibility that under a counter guarantee the Minister may find himself asked to take up a position that he cannot take up because he has no power to pay in foreign currency?  My impression is that this cannot arise. What he is going to count a guarantee is a receipt in Irish currency provided he takes control as to the type of guarantee he is giving to the exporter who may he required to take on liabilities in his contract which will be expressed to have to be discharged in foreign currencies, in which case the Minister will not have power under the legislation, as I find it, to pay the foreign currencies.</P>

    <Title>Firearms Bill, 1971: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first object of the Bill is to amend the definition of &ldquo;firearms&rdquo; in the Firearms Act, 1925, so as to bring component parts of a firearm within it.  The main intention is to ensure that the fact that a part of a firearm has been removed or that there is a defect, perhaps a slight and easily remedied one, in the weapon will not result in a person who is deliberately in unauthorised possession of the firearm escaping scot free, as he might under the law as it stands.  Any possible hardship to persons who are innocently in possession of component parts will be avoided by provisions in sections 3 and 5 of the Bill.  They provide that a person who holds a firearm certificate in respect of a firearm may, without further authorisation, be in possession of any component part which is a replacement, a spare or extra part in respect of the firearm and, <Col N="342" /> additionally, that the local superintendent of the Garda Síochána may authorise any person in his district to be in possession of any other component part, for example, a firearm that has been rendered ineffective.</P>
      <P>One effect of the proposed provisions will be that the penalty for the unauthorised possession of a component part will be the same as that for the firearm of which it is part but I have no doubt that the Garda and the courts will ensure that minor breaches of the law arising from the possession of component parts will be dealt with as such.</P>
      <P>The second object of the Bill is to differentiate between the penalties for the unauthorised possession of, on the one hand, sporting firearms and firearms that have been held under firearm certificates that have expired but have not been revoked and, on the other hand, any other kind of firearm.  The proposal is to reduce the present maximum penalties in the case of the former and to increase them in the case of the latter.  The proposed penalties for the unauthorised possession of ammunition are the same as those for the corresponding firearm.  The point was made in the course of the debate on the Bill in the Dáil that firearms which the Bill classifies as sporting firearms, that is, in particular, shotguns and .22 rifles, can be and have been used in the course of armed robberies and other illegal activities.  I do not deny that this may be so, but there are large numbers of ordinary shotguns and small calibre rifles in the country and they are used for legitimate sporting and recreational purposes.  The use of such weapons in the course of the commission of offences is fairly rare. Military type weapons are in an entirely different class and, as I said in the Dáil, the Government take a most serious view of the unauthorised possession of such weapons.  They hope that the Oireachtas by enacting the proposals will express the determination of the elected representatives of the people not to tolerate the deliberate unauthorised possession of such weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third object of the Bill is to put beyond doubt that the provisions of <Col N="343" /> section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1925, which make it an indictable offence for a person to be in possession of a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, relate to life and property outside as well as inside the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to mention that I shall be arranging for a Government amendment to be moved on the Committee Stage that will complement provisions in section 51 of the Finance Bill relating to fees for the registration of firearms dealers.  Those provisions envisage a new category of dealer, namely, one who confines his business as firearms dealer to the sale and purchase of ammunition for shotguns, airguns and rifled firearms of a calibre not exceeding .22 inches.  The provisions in question and the proposed amendment to this Bill form part of the Government's proposal in relation to the safe keeping of stocks of firearms and ammunition in the hands of dealers.  They will be accompanied by increased Garda supervision.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill is one that has the general support of the community as an effort to tighten up the existing statutory controls on firearms and I have every confidence that it will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's hope in the last sentence he uttered will be justified.  When the Minister comes in and expresses the hope that the Oireachtas by enacting the proposals will express the determination of the elected representatives of the people not to tolerate the deliberate unauthorised possession of such weapons as the Minister has been referring to, I can say to the Minister that so far as the party for which I speak are concerned the record of the Fine Gael Party from the establishment of the State down to this day would justify the Minister's confidence so far as the reception of those sentiments which he has expressed by this party is concerned It is true to say that it could be regarded as virtually certain that this party would support legislation which was designed to tighten up the law in this respect.  It is also fair to say that it <Col N="344" /> should not be assumed that there will be automatic support for a Bill merely because of those expressions by the Minister.  I support this Bill for what it is worth, but I do not think this Bill is worth a whole lot because it leaves so many loopholes in the law which the Minister is setting out to tighten up that it may very well create a paradise for criminal lawyers if the Minister seeks to implement some of the provisions in this amending legislation.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has not taken more time to consider this problem and that he has not come to the Houses of the Oireachtas with a consolidated Bill in which the entire question of the possession of and the use of firearms could be considered rather than that he should come along with an amending Bill of this sort which may be worth something but which does not go nearly far enough.</P>
      <P>In the eyes of many the Minister probably shows a certain amount of courage in coming into the Houses of the Oireachtas as a Fianna Fáil Minister with this Bill, because, and I want to say this bluntly, the public image of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to matters such as this is not good, and were it not for the fact that Fianna Fáil have a bad public image in relation to law enforcement in connection with such matters as firearms, it probably would not be necessary for the Minister to introduce legislation of this sort today and particularly legislation which contains such a provision as section 4 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are some general remarks which I felt it was necessary to make. I want to make some more particular remarks in reference to the Bill.  I understand the reasons why the Minister should differentiate, as he does in this Bill, between the penalties for the unauthorised possession&mdash;it might be regarded as accidental unauthorised possession&mdash;of sporting firearms and other firearms, but I really do not understand why the Minister should feel it necessary to reduce the penalty in respect of one category of firearms that is, the sporting category.  Having put in a maximum in the Bill&mdash;a maximum as it stands in the 1925 Act&mdash;it <Col N="345" /> would seem to me that it would be preferable to leave to the discretion of the court the imposition of the actual penalty and to make the penalty measure up to the offence.  Quite obviously, if a person slides into the first or second week of August without renewing the certificate for a shotgun, and if that is an oversight, there seems no reason why any court would impose a penalty even the reduced penalty that is provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have often thought it a pity that firearms certificates expire on the 31st July.  Probably the reason for that was that the former shooting season opened on the 12th August.  That has gone for many years and both July and August are holiday months and as I go on holidays on the 1st August I frequently forget that my certificate expires on the 31st July.  I am sure many people find themselves in a similar position, and I agree there is no reason for treating this kind of forgetfulness or inadvertence as an offence which should be punished with heavy penalties provided for in either the 1925 Act or in this Act.  I do not think it is a step in the right direction to reduce penalties.  The 1925 Act which originally laid down the penalties was passed nearly 50 years ago.  The position was that on summary conviction a person could be fined £50 or sent to prison for six months or maybe both. On indictment the fine could be £100 and the term of imprisonment two years.</P>
    <P>Forty-five or 50 years ago, the £50 as laid down by law was a steep financial penalty.  It is not now in terms of money values, and if we are talking about updating, that penalty should be increased rather than left at a flat £50 for the first offence and £50 and/or three months in prison for a second offence.  However, this is not particularly important.  I want to make the point that I do not appreciate why there should be a reduction, but I do appreciate why there should be a distinction between the offence of not having the sporting gun certificate and the offence in relation to the more dangerous type of firearm.  I agree with the Minister when he makes that distinction <Col N="346" /> and provides heavier penalties for the second type of firearm.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's definition of firearm.  The defintion in the 1925 Act was: &ldquo;The word &lsquo;firearm&rsquo; means a lethal firearm or other lethal weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged.&rdquo;  The Minister proposes amending that by adding the words &ldquo;and, save where the context otherwise requires, includes a component part of a firearm&rdquo;.  There are a number of points arising on this which might be better discussed on Committee, but I should like to mention that I am not entirely satisfied that the test of a firearm is still whether or not a missile can be discharged from it, and that we may have the ridiculous position, if this proposed definition of the Minister is accepted, that this is still the operative part of the definition and that someone will argue successfully that because a component part cannot, of itself, discharge a missile, it is still not a firearm, under even the expanded definition.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like the Minister to consider in this connection is what is the definition of &ldquo;component part&rdquo;.  We know what a part is.  I would have thought that component part meant a part which had been a part of a whole.  If the Minister insists on the use of the word &ldquo;component&rdquo; part of a firearm, it would seem to me that this indicates that that particular part must, at some stage, have been part of a firearm; otherwise it would not have been a component part of a firearm.  What the Minister means is quite clear from the context of the other section of the Bill.  He means a part which was either actually or potentially a component part of a firearm.</P>
    <P>On section 4 of the Bill I should like to know from the Minister what doubt existed with regard to the meaning of section 15 of the Act of 1925.  I have read and re-read that section and do not see what clarification is necessary. It seems to me abundantly clear that, if in section 15 of the 1925 Act, it sets out that</P>
    <P>Any person who after the passing of this Act has in his possession or <Col N="347" /> under his control any firearms or ammunition&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, or</P>
    <P>(b)  with intent to enable any other person by means of such firearm or ammunition to endanger life or cause serious injury to property,</P>
    <P>shall, whether any injury to person or property has or has not been caused thereby, be guilty of a felony...</P>
    <P>There is no geographical limit set there in section 15 of the 1925 Act. It is clear that it is applicable wherever it was intended to use the firearm. There is the difficulty that the question of intent arises, but why is it necessary to spell out in section 4 of the Act that references to life and property include reference to life and property outside the area of application of the laws enacted by the Oireachtas?  What has called section 15 of the 1925 Act into doubt?  Presumably the Minister has some information on this matter. Either the applicability of section 15 to particular circumstances has arisen which has called it into doubt, or else the Minister may be aware of particular sets of circumstances which have arisen and in respect of which he would like to bring proceedings or against which the authorities would like to take proceedings and somewhere along the line it has been questioned as to whether or not proceedings can be brought.  The Minister should take the House into his confidence in this matter, tell us what the doubts are and how they have arisen.  Personally I have no doubts.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister spelled out in section 4 what the intentions of the Government are in this connection.  It is quite clear that in present circumstances, section 4 of the Bill relates to the possibility of persons based here using firearms or supplying firearms for the North of Ireland.  I should like to know if I am correct in that.  I presume that is the purpose of this section and that the Minister wants to make it quite clear so that there will be no mistake as to where he and the Government <Col N="348" /> and the Houses of the Oireachtas stand. If that is so, I applaud the Minister for doing it.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 5 of the Bill, again this is a matter which should be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage, but it seems to me that greater care must be paid to definition. Section 5 envisages that it will not be unlawful for a person to sell part of a firearm&mdash;note that it is not called a component part of a firearm.  This supports the view I expressed earlier as to the distinction between a component part and a part, being a replacement spare or extra part.</P>
    <P>If the Minister knows anything about firearms, he will agree with me that it is possible to get a replacement for any part of a firearm.  I could go in with my shotgun and get a second set of barrels made for it.  I then have a shotgun with two sets of barrels, which is not at all an uncommon thing.  I could then go in with a second pair of barrels and ask to have a stock made for it.  Then I should have the best part of a second shotgun.  All I should need would be the trigger and the trigger mechanism.  Under this Bill I could go in then and get the trigger and the trigger mechanism and then I would have a second shotgun, the stock, the trigger, the trigger mechanism and the barrel&mdash;and I would be entitled to have it, as I read section 5 of this Bill.  That is a matter which requires tightening up and which the Minister would need to consider.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to refer is the tightening up of section 26 of the Principal Act, which is not dealt with here at all.  The Minister will probably remember that, under section 26 of the Principal Act, antique weapons are completely exempt from the application of the Act.  I take it that the reason for that was that under the definition in the 1925 Act the test of whether or not an article was a firearm depended on whether or not it could discharge missiles.  Presumably, the type of antique weapons that are generally regarded as antiques would not be capable of discharging missiles and, therefore, under the definition in the <Col N="349" /> 1925 Act, the Act in any event would not apply to them.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is updating the law in this regard and trying to tighten it up, he could have another look at that question as well.  The complete exemption of what are described as antiques in section 26 of the Principal Act will continue under this Bill.  As I read section 26 of the Principal Act, the test of what is or is not an antique is the purpose for which the weapon was sold: if it was sold as a curiosity or ornament, then it comes within the definition of antiques.  The test as to whether or not they are usable, whether or not they can discharge missiles, is not applicable to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer finally to something which arises only incidentally from the wording of section 6, subsection (4) of this Bill, which provides that this Bill should come into operation on the 14th day after its passing. As I understood the remarks made by the Minister in the Dáil in reference to this particular provision, that is being done for the purpose of providing an amnesty period to enable people to hand in weapons without being caught by the heavier penalties which are included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> in this but I should like to say quite bluntly that this kind of arrangement is useless so far as getting in any illegally held weapons is concerned.  If the Minister wants to allow an amnesty for a particular period and to appeal to people who hold arms illegally to to hand them up within that period, without penalty, let him do just that. That kind of appeal will get all the backing and support we can give it from these benches.  We shall certainly do what we can to exhort people who hold weapons illegally to hand them in. That I should regard as an amnesty but you say to people who hold arms illegally: &ldquo;If you hand them in within ten days there will be no prosecution either under this Act or under the 1925 Act or under any other Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is not doing that because the provisions of the 1925 Act and the penalties provided for in it will still be applicable, or will be in operation until they are replaced by this Bill.  So, let us forget this talk of <Col N="350" /> an amnesty, if there is no amnesty. All the Minister is doing is expressing pious hope that, in order to avoid the heavier penalties provided in this Bill, people will hand in their weapons within the 14-day period between the passing of the Bill and its coming into operation.  I should like the Minister to think again on this question of an amnesty.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I support this Bill.  I support it as a matter of principle and because of the record of this party in relation to these matters.  I support it because we in the Fine Gael Party believe that in this State we can have only one Parliament and one Army under that Parliament.  Any action that this Government or any other Government take to ensure that that position will obtain and that the law in that regard will be properly enforced will certainly have my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins mentioned this as a Bill that could perhaps be better discussed on Committee Stage.  He has covered a lot of the ground that I intended to cover and I do not propose to detain the House very long with my remarks.</P>
      <P>In introducing this Bill to the House, the Minister referred to three objects. The first one I agree with, and perhaps also with the second.  Like other Senators, I am particularly concerned about one weapon which can be designated as a sporting firearm, that is, the .22 rifle.  I am disappointed that there is nothing in this Bill to make it a little bit more difficult for people to become licence holders of the .22 rifle.  This is a lethal weapon and can be very dangerous.  It is often found in the hands of young people who are not sufficiently capable of using that weapon.  I feel disappointed that no effort has been made to tighten up on the issuing of licences to the type of young person to whom I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that many of us who live in the country can, on a fine summer evening, see young people travelling around in cars and perhaps getting up on a bank and taking a shot at a rabbit about 50, 60 or 100 yards away in a field.  Knowing the <Col N="351" /> travelling capacity of a bullet from a .22 rifle I think this is not the way in which it should be used.  It is disappointing that no effort has been made in this Bill to tighten up on the issuing of licences to that type of person.</P>
    <P>The third object of the Bill, which was referred to by Senator O'Higgins, is to put beyond doubt that the provisions of section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1925, which made it an indictable offence for a person to be in possession of a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, relate to life and property outside as well as inside the State.  I do not know what &ldquo;relate to life and property outside as well as inside the State&rdquo; refers to, but it appears that after 45 years somebody has awakened to the fact that there was a doubt about the provisions of section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1925.  We all thought it was an indictable offence for a person to be in the possession of a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister on section 4.  Apart from these few reservations, I, too, welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to ask myself, when I see this Bill, what its purpose is.  The purpose of a Bill is by no means always, or even regularly, revealed by the explanatory memorandum which goes with it.  I recall being in a public controversy about three years ago in connection with the Criminal Justice Bill in which the Private Secretary to the then Minister wrote to the papers stating that it was no purpose of an explanatory memorandum to say what the objects behind a Bill really were.  According to him, and presumably according to the Minister standing behind him, the purpose of the explanatory memorandum was simply to paraphrase in simple language the provisions of the Bill itself.  I was able to show that there were many explanatory memoranda in which the public official concerned had gone a bit further and, whether by accident or otherwise, had explained in clear language what the purpose of the Bill was.  I was contradicted by the <Col N="352" /> Minister's Private Secretary in a second letter which said that, if this was ever the case, it was merely a slip. Apparently it was not public policy for the Department of Justice or any other Government Department to say in their explanatory memoranda just what Bills are intended to effect.  That means that, in spite of the expense and trouble involved in issuing an explanatory memorandum, every Member of both Houses and every member of the public must do his best to read between the lines to see what the Bill is getting at.</P>
      <P>I look at this Bill and I am told in the explanatory memorandum that its first purpose&mdash;I am not alleging that any attempt is being made to pretend that it is the main purpose&mdash;is to adjust the scheme of penalties so as to differentiate between fowling-pieces, as one might call them, and lethal or military-type weapons.  I have no objection to reducing or perhaps even doing away entirely with the penalty in a case where the penalty serves no purpose, but I see no point in going to the trouble of reducing a penalty here when it is within the discretion of a district justice to impose a penalty far under the maximum.  It is a discretion that is regularly used in this and in many other offences.</P>
      <P>When I look at the Department of Justice and look at the colossal logjam of law reform announced in their programme in 1962, a programme which they are not getting ahead with, when I think of the State Proceedings Bill that we have been promised, the Deserted Wives Bill and the Courts Bill that we have been promised, the Marriages Bill that we have been promised&mdash;when I find these things being put on the long finger and this Bill introduced into the House quickly, I have to ask myself what is behind it?  Can it really be that there is a public necessity to reduce the penalties for the more innocent form of retention of firearms without a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is not that, can it be then that the main purpose of this Bill is to increase the penalties for the holding of the more lethal forms of firearms without a licence?  That, on the face of it, might we a plausible reason for the introduction of this Bill.  But I have to <Col N="353" /> ask myself here again how much diligence the State has shown in recent years in prosecuting offences under the existing law?  How many convictions has the State succeeded in getting under the existing law?  Does the State really think that to increase the penalties of the existing law will be an effective deterrent to people who really intend to secure and keep firearms in order to endanger the lives and property of others?</P>
    <P>I have no statistics at my disposal but I would be interested if the Minister would tell the House at some later stage how many prosecutions under the section we are dealing with, which penalises the unauthorised possession of firearms, have been initiated here in the last three years and how many of these prosecutions have been followed by convictions?  Does the Minister seriously think that the situation will be changed in the slightest degree by merely intensifying the penalties in regard to one particular kind of maintaining firearms without licence?  In other words, that ostensible purpose behind this Bill I regard as eye-wash.</P>
    <P>I am not against the Bill.  I see nothing objectionable in this proposal to reduce these penalties and to increase the others, but I regard them as eye-wash or so much window dressing. The real point of this Bill&mdash;and let us spell it out for the people north and south so that they can hear it&mdash; is contained in section 4.  It is to enable the courts in this jurisdiction to operate beyond any shadow of doubt when they are confronted with a situation in which somebody is charged with an offence under the Act but who is able to say to the justice, as has happened in a recent case: &ldquo;These guns are for use in the North of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to be accused of rocking the boat, and I think that all parties in both Houses of this Parliament are at one, and have declared themselves as being at one, in their desire to use peaceful means and only peaceful means in their approach to the North.  I hope that anything I say will not be interpreted as meaning that I believe the existing Government or the existing ruling clique in the Government <Col N="354" /> not to be sincere in that approach. I believe that the Taoiseach and those of his existing Ministers who are at present on top of the heap believe sincerely that that is the right approach.  I in no way wish to cast doubt on their sincerity in this regard. They wish to prevent violence in the North so far as they can do so.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill will not do it.  It is a slovenly Bill and a Bill which is intended merely as a piece of window dressing to impress the people in Belfast, or perhaps the people in West-minister from whom the pressures may come, and to impress people outside the boundaries of the State.  Not enough care has been devoted to it, within the State, to make sure that it will be really effective for this purpose, namely, to reduce violence in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I shall now point to three <i>lacunae</i> in this Bill which convince me that it will fail in its main purpose.  I believe its main purpose is hidden behind the carefully drafted words of section 4.  First of all, this Bill in no respect whatever&mdash;unless I have misread it or unless I have overlooked other legislation which should be taken in conjunction with it &mdash;tightens up the law regarding explosives as distinct from weapons, firearms or ammunition.  The definition of ammunition in the Firearms Act is something on which one could argue. I do not want to hold up the House unduly but let me read the definition:</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;ammunition&rdquo;, except where used in relation to a prohibited weapon, means ammunition for a firearm but also includes grenades, bombs and other similar missiles whether the same are or are not capable of being used as a firearm and also includes any ingredient or component part of any such ammunition or missile.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that two pounds of plastic explosives or six sticks of gelignite fall under that definition, but it is by no means clear to me that they do. The word &ldquo;missile&rdquo; seems to mean something which achieves its lethal effect by being despatched through the air.  It is a word which, I think, is not very far away from projectile.  I would be, if I were a district justice or a judge, in severe difficulty if I were <Col N="355" /> asked by the State to say that a satchel of plastic explosives or gelignite fell within the definition of &ldquo;ammunition&rdquo; in the Firearms Act.  I want to point out to the House and the Minister that there is nothing in this Bill that I am aware of&mdash;naturally, no more than anyone else.  I am not infallible; I may have missed some point&mdash;which tightens up the law in regard to explosives other than ammunition for firearms.</P>
    <P>Not alone does the Bill not contain a satisfactory amendment of the definition of &ldquo;ammunition&rdquo;, but the Bill does not contain any clarification of, or extension of, the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, which is the Act still in force here in regard to the possession of explosives.  This old Act, passed four years before Queen Victoria's golden jubilee and still in force here, except for a minor repeal in section 7, provides punishments for persons who have in their possession explosive substances unless they can show that it is for a lawful object.  In my view section 15 of the 1925 Firearms Act requires clarification in the way that section 4 of the present Bill proposes to provide it.  Equally, section 4 of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act requires the same clarification. When we mean &ldquo;endangering life and limb&rdquo; we mean endangering life and limb outside the Republic as well as inside it.  It is equally necessary to say that the possession of explosives inside the Republic is an offence if it is intended to cause damage or to cause danger to life and limb with these explosives outside the Republic.</P>
    <P>I have no particular partisan feeling about this because my party, as Senator O'Higgins has said, believe, and have always believed, in a peaceful approach to the North and in law and order within our own boundaries and outside of them.  I, in no way, wish to say that my objections to this Bill represent a core of Fine Gael thinking which is opposed to what Fianna Fáil are thinking.  My objection to it is that not enough thought, of any kind, has gone into this Bill.  It is a mere going through the motions to satisfy, perhaps, the Government in Belfast or <Col N="356" /> the Government in London that the Government here mean what they say. I think the Government do mean what they say.  At least those who are at the top of the heap at the moment mean what they say about a peaceful solution in the North.  I do not think, for a moment, that the Taoiseach or Deputy O'Malley desire bloodshed in the North but this Bill will do next to nothing to prevent it.  I want to make that perfectly clear to the House and to the people.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that a Bill like this, amending the Firearms Act, would have devoted some thought not merely to the question of possessing firearms but also to the question of importing firearms, a delicate subject litigated not very long ago in this city.  The section dealing with the importation of firearms is section 17.  That section is not touched at all by this amending Bill.  If the Government are seriously concerned with what I believe the purpose of this Bill is supposed to be, preventing or forestalling bloodshed in the North, it should be possible to extend this Bill by a section which would make it an offence for someone in this jurisdiction to procure, conspire to procure or incite the importation of firearms, ammunition or explosives into the North of Ireland, whether through the Republic or directly into the North of Ireland.  That should be an offence. All of us here condemn it.  All here would condemn any citizen of the Republic who, no matter what his motives were, imported lethal objects into the North of Ireland.  Why not say so in this Bill, which is supposed to reform and amend our firearms law?</P>
    <P>The section about importation of firearms has been left unamended by this Bill.  If we are so concerned about making it plain that the prohibition and penalty attached to section 14 for possession of firearms with intent to endanger life includes endangering life in the North of Ireland we ought, in logic, to extend section 17 to make it clear that we also regard as an offence the action of anybody here who conspires to have firearms imported into the North of Ireland or procures or incites their importation there.  It will only be when the Department, and <Col N="357" /> the Minister in charge of it, take their responsibilities seriously and give this matter serious thought that we will impress the people we so genuinely wish to impress with our intentions in regard to peace in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another matter which seems to deserve attention in a Bill amending the Firearms Act is the question of collections of firearms.  By &ldquo;collection of firearms&rdquo; I do not mean the blunderbusses, antique jezebels or roaring megs that Senator O'Higgins spoke about.  I mean the kind of people&mdash; and there are some of them in the country&mdash;whose hobby it is to collect fairly modern firearms.  A few short months ago a man in the Republic&mdash; I am speaking from memory now but I think he was a dancehall owner&mdash;was robbed of a very large and lethal collection of modern firearms which he was keeping, no doubt perfectly lawfully, as his own hobby.  A Bill which proposes to amend our law on firearms ought to impose some kind of limitation on these collections, not because I think it wrong for a man to have such a hobby, but because it represents a temptation to the kind of subversive group we are dealing with in this country to rob him and get possession of a large quantity of usable, modern weapons.</P>
    <P>A Bill which proposes to amend our law on firearms is not doing its job in this respect any more than in the other respects I have mentioned unless it deals with this question of collections and imposes some limit on the degree to which a private citizen, who has no particular means of looking after weapons, is allowed to amass in his house a collection of submachine-guns, pistols or rifles.  I cannot remember precisely what the collection of weapons was in the case I have just quoted but I recall that a private citizen who, no doubt quite lawfully, was in possession of firearms was robbed of those firearms.</P>
    <P>It would not be unseemly or unfitting if this Bill were amended to contain a further section giving the police an additional discretion in the case where a person held more than two or three licences for firearms to apply stricter standards to the issue <Col N="358" /> of the licences.  In other words, the police authorities would have, for example, to be satisfied that these were kept in such a way as to make their robbery extremely unlikely.  Of course there are very few citizens who can say that about their houses, and the effect of that might be to kill these private collections of firearms.  I would be sorry if people's legitimate hobbies were interfered with in that way, but it seems to me that there is something deadly at stake here.  It would be no harm if hobbies of this kind, which are potentially lethal to others, were sat on by the State.  I am amazed at the fact that a Minister coming in here &mdash;with a long string stretching back to 1962 of law reform measures piling up in his Department&mdash;coming in here with this measure supposed to reform our law on firearms should have overlooked this thing which was occupying the headlines here only two or three months ago.</P>
    <P>The last thing I should like to say&mdash; perhaps it is more a Committee Stage point, and if I mention it now, I sincerely mean this, it is only to give the Minister's advisers a chance to look at it.  I am not sure whether I am correct about this, I am far from being an expert on firearms, and I may be wrong, but I thought I should mention it. Section 3 proposes to insert new subsections which take out of the category of newly controlled arms shotguns having a barrel of not less than 24 inches in length or an unrifled airgun or a rifled firearm of a calibre not exceeding .22 of an inch.  I am not an expert on this but my impression is that there are such things as .22 pistols which are lethal.  Whether they are rifled or not I cannot say, but it is conceivable that there might be hereafter produced such a thing as a rifled .22 pistol or a rifled pistol of a lesser calibre than that.  If I am right about that, and I may be wrong&mdash;obviously the Minister has got better advice at his disposal than my own fleeting recollections from the reading of thrillers and from general knowledge&mdash;but if I am right in thinking that there are such things as pistols of a .22 calibre or a smaller calibre, whether rifled or not, then I think this subsection should be extended in such a way as to impose <Col N="359" /> a minimum length on the permissible weapon.  I am bearing in mind what Senator Jack Fitzgerald said about the .22 sporting rifle.  But even having regard to his objection, I think this subsection should be extended or changed in such a way as to leave within the area of stricter control even .22 firearms which are of a lesser length than the ordinary .22 sporting rifle.  I am completely out of my depth here, and I may be wasting the time of the House by mentioning it, but I would like the Minister to ask his officials at least if there was any substance in that point.</P>
    <P>These, then, are my comments on the Bill.  This party has no objection to the Bill.  I have tried to tell the House my view on what the main purpose of the Bill appears to me to be, and I have tried to explain to the House why this Bill is not going to achieve that purpose, because it is missing at least three components which I would have thought vital if it is to achieve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall only comment on the Bill and observe it as I see it.  Any Senator is quite entitled to assume that the Bill means more than it reads.  I have read it and I have listened to the Minister being interviewed on it and I am perfectly satisfied that the Bill has a good purpose. I would agree with Senator Jack Fitzgerald that there is quite a lot of tidying up to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this as a measure that will give control.  It is very easy for the State and all its Departments to be out of touch in areas like this.  Like other representatives in rural areas, I know that you have far too many defective old type weapons, whether they be a .22 rifle or shotguns.  All of us, especially those who have used these weapons as sporting weapons, see far too often how careless people are and are well aware of tragic circumstances that can result from this type of misuse and lack of control.  About two weeks ago I met a young lad carrying a .22 rifle.  I asked him if it was loaded and he told me that it was not.  It is generally the &ldquo;unloaded&rdquo; gun that <Col N="360" /> has most accidents.  I took the weapon from him to find it was ready for use, an automatic .22.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Had he a licence for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask him that.  I fully appreciate the Minister's intentions in this Bill and strongly support it.  Somebody said that the Bill should be wider in scope.  However, I think it is adequate to do what it intends to do, but it could cover a lot more.  I have been out with men over 60 years of age and the way in which they handle a gun or loaned it to others frightened me.  They displayed a total lack of knowledge of the dangers of a weapon and of how to care for it.</P>
      <P>This Bill should have as its aim the making of all users of guns more conscious of the dangers of such weapons. It should ensure that when a man applies for a certificate for a gun he is made aware of the dangers that go with it, especially where the gun is an automatic, a .22 or a shotgun.  All too often the people who have automatic weapons do not fully realise how dangerous they are.</P>
      <P>This does not apply to farmers alone.  All of us read recently of the tragic accident involving a professional man who had a loaded gun carelessly placed in the back of his car which resulted in the death of a 13 year old girl.  Before issuing a licence the Garda should be satisfied that the person getting it is aware of the dangers of a gun and should be able to care for it properly.  All guns, whether shotguns or .22 rifles, are capable of killing people.  In particular, this should be so in the case of young people.  You will find a young man about 20 years old who thinks it is good sport to lend his .22 rifle to somebody else who has not had one in his hand previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be 101 interpretations of the Bill and other Senators might have different views on it.  In my opinion, we have had too many serious accidents and too many nearly serious accidents.  We have too many defective guns, sporting guns or weapons of any type.  I would make a simple recommendation to the Minister at this <Col N="361" /> stage.  When making a licence available a pamphlet should be issued with it telling a person how to handle his gun, never to point it at somebody else. I am not giving a lecture on this at all as I am not qualified to do this, but I am well aware of the dangers involved. You get a handbook when you are getting a licence to drive your car, and I think it is much more important to get a handbook showing all the dangers of these weapons.  The gun could be loaded when the owner or user thinks it is not loaded.  It should contain all the simple rules of handling a gun.  The Garda authorities and those issuing licences should satisfy themselves that the person will not misuse it accidentally or in any other way.  I certainly welcome this measure of control and I feel the general public will also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to approach this measure from a rather special point of view.  First of all, I think the reservations which have been made in relation to the Bill are reservations which I would accept but do not wish to repeat or press.  I do not think that this is a Bill to be thought of in the context of accidents, because this is not a Bill designed to deal with accidents, if I understand the observations of the Minister when introducing it.  I should also like to say that the Minister, as I think Senator O'Higgins has said, has shown courage in coming into both Houses in relation to this measure and in other of his pronouncements in relation to the problem with which our country is faced.  I should like to take this opportunity to express the opinion that, if we who are in public life do not express ourselves with absolute truthfulness and with absolute fidelity to the State, then the State is in a situation of danger greater than it has been in since it was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no intention whatever of going back into an analysis of the rights and the wrongs of the Civil War.  I think it has been a good convention that one does not do this anyhow.  It is a convention that I would propose if it were not already there, because I am not an historian; I really know nothing about it.  I found myself in one particular tradition, of which I am proud to <Col N="362" /> continue to be a member of, and I allow other people their prides which they have paid for&mdash;many of them by their lives or their parents' or brothers' lives.  I am not, therefore, concerned to discuss that matter.  I am, however, anxious to get on the records of the House the saying that any measure which is designed to strengthen the forces of the security of this State against those who endanger it will be welcomed.  Those who endanger it are those who, whatever labels they claim to be rightfully attached to them, in fact try to usurp the authority of the State and take the authority from the Government of this country.  Whatever its nature may be, however we may criticise it, it is the Government elected by the people and, as such, I think will have in all circumstances the fullest support of the party to which I belong.</P>
    <P>I allow the Minister to know much more about this than I do.  I hope the Minister is exercising all the power that it is open to him to exercise to put down people who are laying claim to a tradition which has great attraction for the imaginations of even my generation and the generations after me.  I hope the Minister is doing everything to see the reputation of the State, the Army and the police force is maintained and exercised and that these powers are exercised.  It is only if they are exercised that people will believe they truly exist. I know that public people tend to avoid discussing subjects that have danger for themselves and their families.  Public people should recognise it as an obligation of public life that they should take on these dangers, whatever they may be, and follow them through to the end.</P>
    <P>There is fear in the country, and it is absolutely ignoring the facts if we do not recognise the fact that there is fear in the country.  There is fear in the country because there are lawless forces.  I do not know how many of them there are; I would like to get a particularised list of them somewhere from somebody.  I suppose I know of three lawless forces.  I know certainly of some quite diabolical ones, and I am not thinking in terms of social claims. I am thinking in terms of people who want to use firearms, however defined, not to shoot birds or not to run the risk <Col N="363" /> of accidents but to kill their fellow Irishmen or Englishmen, their fellow human beings, for their view about how this country's problems are to be solved.</P>
    <P>I feel that the truth in relation to this is not spoken about openly enough or often enough.  I give credit to the Minister.  He has done so.  I give credit, looking at the Dáil Debates on this Firearms Bill&mdash;I am not being a sort of august dispenser of credits when I am doing this; I am simply looking at the records&mdash;to Deputy FitzPatrick on behalf of Fine Gael and Deputy Tully on behalf of the Labour Party.  I thought the remarks of all three were insufficiently reported.  If I may say so, it would be better if they were more adequately repeated and if we were all on record more firmly, more openly, more determinedly, to see that a kind of moral force is mustered against these people.</P>
    <P>Who the blazes are they?  What right have they to make the claims they are making, to be exercising powers that are only properly powers to be exercised by the State, to use firearms on the people of the Six Counties or on other people here or to threaten other people here in any circumstances.  I do not think there is a sufficient recognition by our public people of the necessity to speak out publicly against them and take whatever consequences come from that.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this.  I feel also this should be said, and the Seanad is the proper place to say it.  We are here dealing with objective things.  We can talk for hours about when this State was founded, the declaration of 1919, the years 1916, 1921 and 1922. That will all be worked out by the historians.  There is a State.  It is established by the consent of the people now, whatever doubt there might have been about it at some stage.  My party believe in a just society and the first element of justice is that the State's authority, as such, should be recognised and is entitled to the loyalty of all the members of the society.  If this first attribute of general justice is not recognised socially, is not accepted by the <Col N="364" /> people, then there is a deficiency of justice in the State and in the society.</P>
    <P>The people will suffer most from the consequences of any defect in the administration, any failure in courage of public representatives, any misjudgment of people who are applying the force that should be applied, and let us face it, force has got to be applied to beat force.  If people have guns and firearms, they must be taken from them forcibly and I think this should be recognised as part of the necessary first step for re-establishing a just society.  An unjust society has been allowed to grow&mdash;unjust in the sense that people feel free, feel patriotic, feel a lovely quiver behind their knees, feel they are doing marvellous things if they reject the Irish Army and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which invites the Seanad to look back on the thinking behind all this.  We have a State now and our people are under the influence of people who were expressing their opinions at a time when we had not a State.  If we are to be bound by the observations of James Connolly, Pádraig Pearse or any others of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation or of anyone else who preceded them, or succeeded them, however well justified they may have been in their time, we are to be as slaven as the Russians who contrive to express the language of the predecessors of the Russian revolution in terms of modern realities. We have to live with modern realities and we have to think in terms of solving our real problems.  I am still talking about firearms.  There would be much more value to be got from the study of their performance and an admiration of the performance of the civil servants of this country since the State was founded than is to be gathered from commemorations of persons who gave their lives bravely &mdash;in a way I would not pretend to be prepared to do&mdash;for the principles to which they were dedicated.  I would simply say&mdash;reservations have been been made by my colleagues&mdash;that the Minister receives my wholehearted welcome for this measure.</P>

    <Col N="365" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the suspension of business, Senator Alexis FitzGerald made what I consider to be an interesting observation.  Speaking of illegal organisations, he said that if it should take force to stop force this should be done, and that if firearms were necessary to prevent the use of firearms, they should be used by the State, of course.  I agree entirely with Senator FitzGerald.  It is a view that I have held ever since I entered public life, and indeed it is a view I am on record as expressing as a very young councillor in 1955 and 1956, when the Coalition Government were in office.</P>
      <P>However, I would ask Senator FitzGerald to consider for a moment the situation that existed across the Border in August, 1969, when law and order broke down in the Six Counties, and the RUC, the B Specials and the Paisleyites came together and ran amok.  It has been admitted in the Scarman Tribunal that the RUC and B Specials handed over arms to the Paisleyites to use on the minority in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Would Senator FitzGerald not believe that some of that minority thought that they, too, needed force to beat force and that they, too, needed firearms, not to shoot their fellow Irishmen, or Englishmen, or anyone else, but that they needed firearms to defeat firearms?  Would Senator FitzGerald not agree that there are many people on the borders of the Six Counties who held similar views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12th August, 1969, a man stood at a public meeting in the Literary Institute in Letterkenny.  He called on anyone in the audience who had arms to hand them over, because they would be needed in the Six Counties. That man was not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He was president of the Fine Gael Executive in my constituency and a former Fine Gael Deputy. He gave distinguished service to this country.  He believes in peace. But he believed in August, 1969, living just 17 miles from the Border, that a situation had developed in which the minority needed arms.  Indeed, if this Bill had been law then, not only he but those who listened to him would be liable to a five-year jail sentence. <Col N="366" /> The only appeal I would make to people is this: before expressing views on this particular period, do not conflict the present illegal organisations in this country and the situation where it was felt by a section of the minority in the Six Counties that arms were needed to protect their wives and families.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly once again repeated the claim that Fine Gael have been making for the last 18 months.  It is that Fine Gael believe in law and order. I should like to say to Senator Kelly that when Fine Gael had an opportunity of ensuring that there was law and order in this country during the reign of the Coalition Government from 1954 to 1957, they failed to do so.  Fine Gael believed then, just as Labour did, that political expediency was more important than law and order.  It was during this period that the strength of the IRA grew.  It was during this period that members of the IRA marched publicly in this country with their arms over their shoulders, and not a dog barked in the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>To those who might dispute this I should like to give a few examples.  In 1956 on the County Leitrim border a Garda squad car arrived at a house one night.  They entered.  In that house were members of the IRA cleaning their arms.  The gardaí told them that they had received a report that arms had been stolen from a British major living in County Leitrim and that they regretted they would have to take them down to the barracks to examine the arms they had.  Those arms were put in the squad car, taken to the Garda barracks and sure enough the major's arms were among them.  These were retained.  The gardaí handed back the remainder of the arms, put the boys into the squad car and drove them back to their training camp on the County Leitrim border.</P>
    <P>A lorryload of arms was stopped one night following the raid on a barracks outside Dundalk.  A garda asked the driver of the lorry what he intended to do with them.  He told him that they were for use in the Six Counties. The garda went to the nearest telephone kiosk and made a call and then told the lorry to move on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Anyone who would dispute either of these stories I have just told I would invite to read the secret hearing of the Lawless case in Strasbourg when Mr. Lawless gave evidence that has never been challenged since.  We read in newspapers just a year ago that when the late Collie Green was injured in the Rossleigh Barracks he was taken into County Monaghan and was treated there and died there.  When the matter was reported to the coroner he rang a Minister of the Coalition Government in Dublin and was told that the inquest was not to be held publicly.  This was known to Fianna Fáil at that time but Fianna Fáil believed that it was in the national interest and the interests of national security that it should not be publicised.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation with the very people who failed to quell the IRA rising in 1956, who allowed them to march openly around the Border counties and in my county.  They are the people who today are preaching their policy of law and order.  They are the people who would like us to think that when they were in office nothing of this kind occurred.  I am holding no brief whatsoever for any member of any illegal organisation, because I believe that there can be only one army in this country, the army of the Irish State.  I consider that when the wailings of Fine Gael Deputies kept Dáil Éireann sitting for two or three days to make their points, when they had the opportunity to do what they now advocate they failed because they had not the political guts to do so.  The shadow of Seán MacBride was lurking in the background and as long as he was there and keeping them in office they were not prepared to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I agree that this Bill is very necessary.  I agree that steps must be taken to ensure that this country is not turned into another Chicago.  But I should like to make one point to the Minister.  We all know that when the B Specials handed over their arms in the Six Counties many of them were allowed to retain certain arms.  I do not know if they were all allowed to retain them, but if they had been then we <Col N="368" /> would have an interesting situation, or we have an interesting situation.  We all know that for many years members of the B Specials residing in County Donegal crossed the Border to participate in the activities of B Specials and that there were many members of the B Specials from my county.  The question that I should like to ask is whether they are in possession of arms that were issued by the Stormont Government? If they are, what steps will be taken to ensure that they are handed over?</P>
    <P>Even though arms are licensed it does not follow that they are in safe hands.  If I came into the House this evening and placed on the desk in front of me a loaded revolver and if I said that I was placing it there because my life and property had been threatened I wonder, Sir, what you would have to say about it.</P>

A man entered the front gates of Leinster House. There were armed military to the left of him, armed Special Branch to the right of him and members of the Garda in front of him.  He walked up the corridors of Leinster House&mdash; I read this in <i>The Irish Press</i>&mdash;entered a session of the Public Accounts Committee, a private session, and sitting round him were Deputies from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour and that man considered it necessary to take out a loaded revolver and place it on the desk.  Was he afraid that Deputy FitzGerald was going to assassinate him?  Was he afraid that perhaps Deputy Justin Keating was going to assassinate him?</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir, but I have made my point. I feel that there should be some provision in this Bill to prevent the abuse of firearms even though they may be licensed.  That is why I raised this issue.  I think it is a very serious one and one that has surprised me very much.  What surprised me, in particular, was that only one newspaper carried it once and not another newspaper in this country referred to it.  It surprised me just as much that in Fine Gael or Labour circles, members of which for 18 months have been loud in their condemnation of others, considered that it was not worth commenting on.  Indeed I must admit that when I heard of it I was amazed that in the Fine Gael or Labour circles not a dog barked.  I, personally, as a Member of the Oireachtas, would like tonight to lodge my protest that anyone, be it an ex-civil servant or otherwise, should be allowed to enter this building with a gun and that his licence is retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the points made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald on this Bill. which I welcome.  I do not think we can divorce such a Bill from our present political situation in this country.  I feel it is the duty of Members of this House to put on <Col N="371" /> record, as Senator FitzGerald has done, the fact that they support the forces of law and order in this country.  They should put on record the fact that they totally condemn subversive organisations which are operating in the part of the country under our jurisdiction and that activities of an illegal nature which disturb the peace of the whole country should be condemned by the public representatives.</P>
      <P>It is most important that it be seen where we stand on this issue.  I do not feel that it is right for me to talk at any length about the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the North because that is not the matter under discussion.  However, the points of contact with the situation in the North are obvious.</P>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill because I feel that it is an attempt on behalf of the Government to tighten up legislation dealing with dangerous weapons.  I hope that Members of this House, as I do, stand behind the Taoiseach in his attempts, on behalf of this part of the country, to lower the temperature, and to take an objective and unemotional look at our total Irish situation.  This is most important, because even in moments of crisis if we let our emotions run away with us we will make decisions which we will later regret.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that it is most important that decisions taken which affect North-South relations should be taken democratically, that the place to take them is in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Small groups who claim, under some flag or some name or other, to represent the Irish people or their ideals, should be actively discouraged. We must create an atmosphere in which the illegal activities of small groups are not condoned.  This entails creating an atmosphere of confidence and an atmosphere in which any decisions taken relative to Northern Ireland are made in a fully democratic way by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I would like to firmly support Senator Alexis Fitzgerald in his stand for true democracy.  As public representatives, it is our duty to state <Col N="372" /> quite clearly and firmly that we fully support the forces of law and order in this country, that we have no connections, emotional or otherwise, with any other organisations and that it is our duty to see that any moves that are made are only made through the correct channels.  I refer to any military moves, any moves of a nature involving the police forces, which should be made only through the Garda Síochána.  Only in this way can we act responsibly, <i>vis-à-vis</i> our fellow-Irishmen in the North.  I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo.  Sílim gur Bille maith é. Tugadh an-aire do na haltanna atá sa Bhille agus an smaoineamh a bhí laistir de.  Is maith an smaoineamh é cosc a chur ar usáid airm-teine go neamhdleathach. Ach más maith is mithid.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer in any sense of the word, and so it appears to me at any rate that this Bill is, indeed, well framed and as watertight as one could expect an amending Bill to be.  If we look at the Minister's speech we see that the first objective of the Bill is to amend the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; in the Firearms Act, 1925, so as to bring component parts of a firearm within it. That is a very important point because any whole thing is made up of its parts. A lethal weapon, a firearm, is no more or no less than the sum of the parts that go to make it.  This section is most praiseworthy because it shows that great thinking went into the framing of this legislation to close that door which up to now was wide open.  There are many other good sections in this Bill which we will go through when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>At this stage I should like to make a few general remarks on the question of firearms in so far as they concern us, the Irish people.  We cannot escape the facts of history.  For the best part of 250 years, that is two and half centuries, our fighting forces had to stay underground, our warlike activities had to be clandestine, our arms had to be held in secret and a great deal of what we achieved was achieved by what one would call the clandestine use of arms, or arms used in guerilla war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain attitude of mind has <Col N="373" /> developed as a result and even today we have a certain mental toleration of those who would be inclined to use arms illegally or to have possession of arms clandestinely.  It is a question of a frame of mind and of an attitude. We cannot expect the people of the country to snap out of that attitude of mind overnight.  It is quite a while now since we had the Truce and the subsequent ceasefire of 1923 and we ought to be growing out of it.</P>
    <P>As I was listening to the debate develop, I could not help thinking of the words of Thomas Davis.  I have not got them with me, but from memory they ran like this when he was comparing the successes of the Irish soldiers on the Continent with their failures at home.  He said something like this:</P>
    <P>It is true that the Irish fought better on the Continent.  They fought with the advantages of French discipline and equipment.  They fought as soldiers with the rights of war, not as rebels with halters around their necks.</P>
    <P>I suppose that is the dreadful effect that underground warfare has on the mind of a nation when that warfare continues for two and a half centuries. There are no halters around anyone's neck now, thank God, but I am afraid that in a great number of cases we have halters around many people's minds, Some are trying to escape from these halters but I am afraid that in other minds the noose is pulled very tightly.</P>
    <P>How can we help expedite the change of mind from assuming that all warfare must be conducted underground and that any good to be achieved for the nation must be achieved by the private gunman?  How are we to achieve that?  I think one of the ways that could expedite it would be compulsory military training.  This, if you like, is a hobbyhorse of my own. I have held that view for years.  I think it would bring many great benefits socially, mentally, and above all psychologically.  The people who speak least about guns, explosives, warfare and killing are the professional soldiers. Those of us who have had military <Col N="374" /> training know what these things are.  We know what guns can do.  We have handled them.  We know the horrors of war.  We have studied them. There came a stage when we had to make up our minds that if the day came we would have to prepare our minds mentally to do this.  If we had not prepared our minds beforehand we would not be able to do it when the time came.  So the best man, the man who can take the most normal view of a thing, is a man who has been trained in the use of weapons at some stage during his life.  He will have respect for guns.  He will know what guns can do.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned earlier today the dangers of firearms, and in particular of .22 rifles.  I have seen some very narrow escapes from death where .22 rifles are concerned.  I have also seen very narrow escapes as far as .303's were concerned.  That was during the Emergency of 1940-45, but certainly if the enrolment in the LDF at that particular time did nothing more than give people respect for arms and a certain knowledge of what war was like then the setting up of that Force was more than justified.</P>
    <P>The man who is the most careful of guns and ammunition is the man who has been trained in their use. The man who knows very little about guns is the most dangerous man you can give a gun to.  I can quite understand the apprehension of the Senators who have spoken on those lines about the danger of young people having .22 rifles.  They have just a superficial knowledge of the weapon, they know how to pull the trigger, but they could be a public danger to life in whatever area they are operating.  At another time I will raise this question of compulsory military training.  Even if it only lasted for one year it would give a knowledge of weapons and of their power, of their use, of the safety precautions that are absolutely necessary. It would give a very healthy respect for weapons.  It would take away this glamourisation people have of weapons in secret, and this boasting about what guns they handled and what guns they saw here and there. It would take away from guns the mystery <Col N="375" /> and the glamour that very often is attached to them.  It would also give the Irish nation and those who are growing up in it a sense of discipline. &ldquo;Ní bhíonn an rath mura mbíonn an smacht&rdquo;.  If you want real proof of what discipline can do for a nation you can always turn to the example of Israel, where a little nation with a discipline such as we could probably never submit to, was able not alone to defend itself but to bring to the dust of humiliation nations more than five times its size.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a little about the amnesty section.  I would appeal to the Minister to make that amnesty clause in its application as generous as possible. Personally, I have no doubt but that many people hold arms today in the sincere belief that they are doing what is right.  Again, it is the question of a mental attitude.  If these people are convinced that they are doing right in holding these arms, legislation will hardly make them give them up.  It is our duty as Members of the Oireachtas to try to get that message across.</P>
    <P>Life has advanced from the days when we had to fight underground. Let us remember that two and a half centuries have passed.  We now have an independent State.  Our Army is one of the finest in the world.  Let us be worthy of the great traditions of the armies of the past&mdash;the armies of Brian Boru, of Red Hugh O'Donnell, of the great Hugh O'Neill, and of Sarsfield. If we do that, we will have mental discipline, physical discipline, and military discipline.  We will have very little problem in putting an end to what could be a very dangerous situation, where there are guns in the possession of people who believe that they are justified before God in using them to conduct what we call a private, immoral war, or what some of these people consider an expression of patriotism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take the same liberties as some of my predecessors.  It is true to say that, if this Bill had been introduced two years ago, it would have had a very different reaction than what it has had in the House here this afternoon and this evening.  As Senator Cranitch said in a very sensible and very understanding speech, it is impossible to divorce the substance of what appears to be a very simple measure from the long history of this country.</P>
      <P>I suppose many people would subscribe to the saying that gun-running has never been an offence in this country.  Senator McGlinchey spoke at great length.  I did not hear what he said before the interval but I listened with interest to his speech after the interval.  I found it difficult to understand in the ultimate his attitude to the Bill&mdash;although he did, I think, give it general assent.  Most of his time seemed to be taken up with criticising what he described as the Coalition Government of 1954 to 1957, because &ldquo;no dogs barked&rdquo; when they were in office. If that is a fair comment.  It is equally fair to say that since 1957 we have had the Fianna Fáil Party in office.  I do not recall many dogs barking during the past 14 years, until the events of the past 18 months created a very different situation in our minds.  The fundamental point to remember in all this is the fact that the only people who have the right to carry arms, outside those licensed to do so for sporting purposes, are the Army of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It behoves us, as public representatives, at every opportunity to persuade young men&mdash;and I believe in many cases they are genuinely-moved young men&mdash;that the illegal use of arms, or the illegal carrying of arms is not the answer to the problem which they hold so dear to their hearts.  I find it very hard on occasions to condemn an idealistic young man.  One disagrees with an idealist or with his methods, but it is very hard to impute to him unworthy motives.  If the Minister, in his Bill, has taken a sensible step forward <Col N="377" /> in trying to limit the illegal use of arms, he has taken a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>We would be foolish to believe because this Bill has been introduced and will undoubtedly get the support of every Member of the Seanad, as it did in the other House, that this is the answer to the illegal carrying of arms. If we, as public representatives, believing that in the Government and in the Army of the State rests the sole authority to carry arms, can do our part in persuading others that this is the only proper course to follow, we will have done a useful service to the State.</P>
    <P>Many people are tempted to talk in emotive terms just now.  We, as public representatives, have a special duty to be careful in what we say and not to say one thing and mean another.  There is a good deal of double-talk taking place.  There are groups in public life who, while apparently decrying the use of arms and the illegal carrying of arms or the keeping of arms without authority or licence, at the same time look over their left shoulder in the hope that in the next general election they will get the support of certain elements. It would be better if the representatives of every political party, irrespective of their disagreements on matters of policy, were of one mind in decrying the use of arms and in putting down with whatever force is necessary, the use or the carrying of arms within the State.  This would have a better effect than some of the hypocritical talk which takes place from time to time.</P>
    <P>There is only one Government, whether we agree or disagree with them.  The members of that Government went before the people and they were properly elected.  If there is any group or any party or individual who feel that they are not pursuing the right policy in regard to matters either inside or outside the State, there is a simple way of deciding the issue and that is to stand for election in a general election.  In the final analysis the people of this country have always shown their wisdom.  I cannot say I have always agreed with their choice of Government, but in the ultimate the Irish people have shown an amazing sense of <Col N="378" /> maturity over the years.  If the people felt that the policies pursued by individuals or groups not represented in what they call the 26 County Parliament were right, they would be voted into office at the next general election.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which is not contained in the Bill but is implied in the Bill and that is the question of the amnesty which the Minister has mentioned. To my mind, it is not at all clear how this will operate.  It appears that, after the President signs the Bill, there will be a sort of half-amnesty for 14 days during which the Garda may or may not proceed under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am wrong in saying this, but I think we should have a definite amnesty or else have no amnesty at all. Once the President signs a Bill, it should immediately become enforceable by law.  If I thought that by suspending the application of this 1971 Bill, shortly to become an Act, for 14 days would do any good, or if suspending the provisions of the existing Act by 14 or 28 days or even longer would do any good, I would ask the Minister to do so, and to take a chance on that.  At the moment it is like the West Clare Railway story&mdash;off again, on again, Hannigan.  It is left completely to the local sergeant to decide whether or not he will proceed against a person who hands in a firearm or firearms.  Perhaps the Minister would have another look at this, as it is rather nebulous at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins mentioned another point earlier where the Minister differentiates in the Bill between penalties for the unauthorised possession of, on the one hand, sporting firearms that have been held under firearms certificates which have expired but have not been revoked, and on the other hand any other kind of firearm.  It is bad policy to reduce the penalty in the first instance.  The Minister concluded his introductory remarks by saying &ldquo;I believe that this Bill is one that has the general support of the community as a method of tightening up the existing statutory controls&rdquo;. In one instance, at least, he is reducing the penalties&mdash;and after a lapse of 45 or 46 years, I do not think the <Col N="379" /> penalties in the first instance are too heavy.  I think the Minister, if he does not mind my saying so, slipped up in that regard.  If the Minister is going to tighten the penalties and the restrictions, he should do so.  There should be no retraction from the existing legislation. Where it is necessary to bring in tighter legislation or to increase the penalties, the Minister should do so, but he should use the existing legislation as a stepping-off ground.  He should not step back from that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope the Minister will achieve the purpose of this Bill. It is not a question of legislation.  It is a question of an attitude of mind.  We, in public life, have a great responsibility in that regard.  I hope all of us, irrespective of party affiliations, will discharge our responsibility honestly and impartially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally an elected representative would merely welcome the provisions contained in this Bill which are intended to protect life from the unauthorised and irresponsible use of arms.  However, this is not a normal country and ours is not a normal history, and the discussion during the afternoon has brought out this point.  It is far too serious a question for anyone to attempt to make political capital out of it.  There is, and there has been, a tradition among some people regarding arms that is not exactly the same kind of tradition that exists in countries that did not have to resort to the use of force to achieve freedom. I, myself, have some knowledge of this tradition because it is the tradition in which I grew up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down the centuries it was believed, and rightly so, that one had a right to act in this way to achieve political freedom.  That was at a time when all power and authority, so far as our country was concerned, lay outside the country.  It could be said that there was no freely elected independent political authority here.  However, this is not so now, at least so far as the Republic is concerned.  We have sovereignty; we have a democratically elected Legislature here in the Twenty-six Counties.  It is because the history of this country was not normal that I feel <Col N="380" /> it necessary to speak on this Bill perhaps in an unusual way.</P>
    <P>There is still a wrong impression given to young people that the use of arms to achieve a patriotic objective is always right.  This cannot be so where there is independent and democratic freedom.  There is no doubt that where you have a freely elected sovereign authority there cannot be a self-appointed right on the part of any person or group to hold or to use arms. The use of arms and the right to hold arms by any group or groups cannot be defended, and it would be wrong to leave any uncertainty in the mind of anyone here in the Republic on this matter.  The right to have and to use arms can be given only by the elected authority and not by anyone else.  I believe that it is wrong and unjust to young people to mislead them into believing that because their ideals are good and pure they have a self-appointed right to resort to arms, because this right exists only under a properly elected authority.  To encourage such thinking among young idealists is irresponsible and can only lead to tragedy, frustration and injustice, and to further setbacks in our efforts to achieve our national aim of unity and peace in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This aim is what should concern us most in a discussion like this.  Those of us who have been elected to public office have a very heavy responsibility now and in the future to ensure that we achieve this ideal by the only means I believe to be practical, that is, by persistent and painstakingly peaceful effort.  Despite the discouragement and the setbacks we have had and will have; despite the prejudices and fears, the intransigence and the confused loyalties that influence our fellow-countrymen in the North of Ireland; despite all these obstacles, we must persist in our efforts.  I support the Bill. It is a necessary measure to ensure the safety of people and to protect young people from irresponsible actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a point which it might be more appropriate to make on the Committee Stage, but I want to put the thought into the Minister's head now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> I agree with the purposes of the Bill.  They have been well expounded here today and I do not want to repeat them.  I share the alarm expressed by Senator FitzGerald at the ready issue of licences for .22 rifles, which have been designated in subsection (2B) (a) of section 3 as being sporting rifles. These look very harmless things but in the hands of the wrong people they might as well be .303s, or any other kind of weapon, because there are various types of ammunition supplied with them.  There are high velocity ones, low velocity ones, and soft-headed ones.  It is well known around the country that these types of weapons are given to young men who have never had any training with them, who do not know their limitations and their dangers.  It is not unusual to find in many parts of the country sheep and cattle being shot and, indeed, a number of people have had very narrow escapes with them.  A look should be taken at the type of ammunition that a young fellow can buy for one of these rifles.</P>
    <P>In the same section there is a provision whereby the Minister can change this by order.  However, the section describes a shotgun as having a barrel of not less than 24 inches. There are many continental guns being made with barrels of under 24 inches.  Because there is a different type of cartridge now, a high velocity cartridge the size of the barrel can be reduced.  It may not be prudent to specify 24 inches, because the Minister may have to make one of these amending orders very soon when he discovers that there are many under 24 inches.</P>
    <P>I am particularly alarmed because I have seen near misses with these .22 rifles and I recommend to the Minister that somebody should look at the type of ammunition that can be bought for them.  I know of three different kinds; one of them gives the rifle a range of 1,000 yards, which is nearly up to the same range as a .303.  Nobody should be allowed to purchase high velocity cartridges for these .22 rifles unless he has a special permit. One thousand yards is too long a range for young fellows to be permitted <Col N="382" /> to shoot birds: they do not know who might be in a field next to them. I mention this now so that, before we come to the Committee Stage, the Minister may be able to think about it.  I consider it to be very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill although I am sorry to have to welcome it.  I am sorry that the stage has been reached at which it has become necessary to introduce such a Bill.  It is a long time since the last Bill was introduced&mdash;1925&mdash;and we have managed to carry on through the years without it.  In recent times there has been such great disrespect for the dignity of human life that it is necessary to help people to protect themselves from perpetrating outrages. I could speak with some authority on the question of safety in the use of firearms.  If it is necessary to pass a driving test and to have a car examined before it is driven, then surely it must be equally necessary for a person to pass a gun test and have his weapon subjected to some type of examination before being allowed to use it.</P>
      <P>The storage of these weapons is very important.  Even the ordinary shotgun. whether it is sawn off or otherwise, is as dangerous at close range as is the revolver.  A man should have some experience of the use of firearms, such as having served in the FCA, before he is given a licence for a weapon.  He should be a member of a registered gun club who would issue to him a certificate of competence with this instrument.  The dangers of a shotgun cannot be over-emphasised.</P>

    <P>Most of us have read accounts in newspapers of accidents with firearms, unfortunate cases in which a friend or a member of a family is killed accidentally through carelessness with a shotgun.  This is something that should be looked into, now that we are on this unfortunate subject of arms.  I agree with all those who welcomed the Bill.  I thought it strange that Senator McGlinchey should mention that some people who served as B Specials in the Six Counties came from the Twenty-six Counties.  It should also be remembered that people came across the Border to serve in the FCA in the <Col N="383" /> Twenty-six Counties.  A Resident Magistrate in the Six Counties was a member of the FCA, and had his house blown up recently.  We should be fair in our treatment of facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome this Bill as far as it goes. I should like to express genuine regret that we have not another Firearms Bill this year.  Last year, Conservation Year, the sporting aspect of firearms was discussed at many seminars under various auspices throughout the country.  I regret that all this was apparently lost on the Department of Justice, because Conservation Year was organised excellently by the Department of Lands.</P>
      <P>I should like to elaborate on a point that the previous speaker has touched on.  It is that the Department of Justice continue to issue sporting licences to people, who are not asked if they have any sporting range or if they intend to use them.  Private ownership has certainly taking a wallop in this country in recent times.  There is room for an increase in sporting licences.  I am not advocating additional revenue to the State, but the Department of Justice should refund the additional gun licence fees to the game councils throughout the country in an effort to preserve our stocks of game, that is, if they are genuinely interested in the sport.</P>
      <P>If we wish to preserve our sporting amenities, from a tourist point of view if nothing else, we should endeavour to train our sportsmen or would-be sportsmen.  This country is beset, on the one hand, by people whom this Bill is endeavouring to bring into line and, on the other hand, by pothunters who have respect for neither the sport in which they partake nor for the property over which they give themselves licence to roam at will.  I have heard many complaints from angry farmers who, throughout autumn or winter, have had to spend a lot of time repairing damage to fences and other property.  This is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the previous speaker said, the people to whom the Department issue sports licences should be compelled to prove that they are members of a <Col N="384" /> sporting club or organisation which has a tract of land reserved for the sport. There have been many instances of people with .22 rifles training to shoot red deer not only in Wicklow but also in my own county and Tipperary and throughout the country.  This cruelty to animals should be tackled.  The Department, after having spent a whole year talking about these problems, now chooses to ignore them.  I do not wish to equate the sporting aspect of this Bill with the problems that I am sure the Minister has on hand, but nevertheless the opportunity should have been taken to bring the situation on more up to date and also to curtail the number of weapons that are in the country.  I would not like to see the situation develop here as it has elsewhere in which there are many thousands of unnecessary weapons in the country.</P>
    <P>The FCA offers tremendous scope for people with an aptitude for firearms. The equipment that has been issued to the FCA in recent years is the very latest, and excellent training is provided.  I know this is not the Minister's responsibility, but nevertheless such people would gain valuable experience of the use of firearms, and if they wished to pursue a sporting pastime later they could do so with the utmost safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was asked in this debate by a number of Senators, namely, why it was proposed to reduce the penalty for committing the offence of having in one's possession without a certificate a sporting type weapon as opposed to the military type weapon and why the penalty proposed for the latter was more than the penalty in the 1925 Act. The reason is that for the first time we will have under this Bill, when enacted, two categories of weapons rather than one.  The penalty in the 1925 Act was designed to cover both categories as we now know them.  Since, quite obviously, the military type weapon is the more dangerous, the greater is the offence in holding it unlawfully.  The penalty set out in the 1925 Act was designed to cover the unlawful possession of such weapons and not just the unlawful possession of the sporting type weapon, <Col N="385" /> which, as Senators on all sides have agreed, is a very much less serious offence.</P>
      <P>Because we have two categories we must also have two sets of penalties. Since the existing penalty covered the more serious offence, it is not unreasonable to have a lower penalty for the new, less serious offence and a very much higher penalty for the more serious offence of possession of military type weapons.  By decreasing the penalty for the possession of sporting type weapons and increasing, very substantially, the penalty for the possession of military type weapons I have tried to accentuate the difference between the two categories.  My particular determination is to try to prevent the unlawful possession of military type weapons.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins, Senator Kelly and others, called into question the necessity for section 4 of this Bill, which specifies that section 15 of the 1925 Act, relating to intention to cause death or serious injury to property, relates to persons and property whether inside or outside the present jurisdiction of the State.  It was alleged quite unfairly by Senator Kelly&mdash;and it was the only party-political speech which was made here today&mdash;that this was done to please Westminster and Stormont.  However, I shall deal with that point in a moment.</P>
      <P>In some recent cases courts in this country have taken the view, in a case under section 15 of the 1925 Firearms Act, that if the defendant satisfies the jury, or, indeed, leaves them in reasonable doubt, that he intended to use the firearm of which he was found in possession outside the jurisdiction of our State, then he was not guilty of an offence under section 15 of the 1925 Act.  I must say that I, in common with a lot of other people, was somewhat surprised to find that this was the law, because on a strict reading of section 15 I would not have thought so.  I think Senator O'Higgins pointed out that there is no geographical limitation set down in section 15.  One would naturally assume that human life and property would be protected by the section whether it was inside or outside our jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> At the circuit criminal court in Letterkenny, on Friday, 23rd October, 1970, before His Honour Judge N. Ryan in the case of The People against Thomas Roderick Carlin the learned judge directed the jury as follows, and I quote part of the official stenographer's certified note of the charge to the jury, page 11:</P>
    <P>The facts of this case, gentlemen, do not come into dispute.  The guards did concede that this man, when he was apprehended, co-operated immediately. There was no evidence whatsoever of any struggle.  When asked, he did hold on to the rifle for a short period but then handed it over; and from the way the evidence was given it seemed to me that he voluntarily then produced this pistol from under his pullover and handed it over&mdash;and handed the ammunition over.  Does that strike you, gentlemen, as being the action of a man who had intent to endanger life in the county Donegal?  If you have any reasonable doubt on that aspect, then you must give him the benefit of that doubt, on the first two counts in particular, where it is one of the necessary ingredients found in the charge of possession&mdash; under section 15, subsection (a)&mdash;of a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life.</P>
    <P>That charge to the jury was given after the defendant in the case had made an unsworn statement to the jury that he had these guns and ammunition but that he did not intend to use them in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The judge seemed to limit it to County Donegal.  I was wondering why the charge referred to County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the reason was that the defendant was arrested about two yards inside the Border and he had been making the case that in fact he was in County Tyrone.  That was the reason for the repeated reference throughout the charge to County Donegal as opposed to County Tyrone. That decision was followed in I think two cases in Dundalk subsequently. While I accept, therefore, that that must be taken as the law at the <Col N="387" /> moment, I feel that that was not the intention of the Legislature in 1925 and that it would not be the wish of the Legislature now that it should continue to be the law.</P>
      <P>The reason that section 4 is part of the Bill and that we are specifying possession of arms or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious damage to property inside or outside the State is the judgment in the Carlin case.  It is not there for the reason given by Senator Kelly, that the Government were anxious, as he put it, to satisfy or to please Westminster or Stormont.  I am happy to tell Senator Kelly that we are a sovereign Government of a sovereign State and that we make our own decisions.  We do not seek advice or take orders from Westminster or Stormont although at some time in the past there might have been a Government in this country which would have taken the orders of Stormont or Westminster.</P>

      <P>The question of explosives was raised by Senator Kelly. He was critical of the Bill on the grounds that it did not seem to cover explosives as opposed to ammunition. Of course there is a completely separate code of law in respect of explosives. There is on the Order Paper of the Dáil at the moment, having received its First Reading there, the Dangerous Substances Bill, which seeks to modernise certain aspects of the law relating to explosives.  I had hoped that I might be able to bring before the Oireachtas a Bill relating to explosives corresponding to, and at much the same time as, this Bill but I find that unfortunately the law on explosives is somewhat more complicated.  At the same time it is pretty clear and there are extremely heavy penalties for the unlawful possession of explosives at the moment.  They are a great deal heavier than the existing penalties or even the proposed penalties for the unlawful possession of guns or ammunition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelly was also critical of what he described as another lacuna in the Bill but which is not a lacuna <Col N="388" /> at all.  He said I was making no effort to deal with the dangers that arise from collections of modern firearms by collectors.  If Senator Kelly had read my opening speech and had read the speech I made in the Dáil and also the Minister for Finance's speech on the Finance Bill he would see that in section 51 of the Finance Bill we are dealing with this precise point.  One of the reasons that there are so many collectors of firearms at the moment and that they have so many arms in circumstances which are not always very secure is that the fee payable on registration as a firearms dealer has never been increased since 1925, when it was fixed at £1.  The price of the ordinary certificates has been raised more than once.  The strange thing at the moment is that a certificate for a shotgun costs a good deal more than registration as a firearms dealer.</P>
    <P>I became concerned as a result of certain robberies and in particular one robbery in the midlands some months ago when I think 10 or 11 shotguns and .22 rifles of modern vintage were stolen from the premises of a registered firearms dealer.  It turns out that this man is not really a registered firearms dealer in the accepted sense that he trades in or deals in firearms.  What he was really was a collector but it was more economic for him as it was for many others to hold his collection as a registered firearms dealer.</P>
    <P>In order to try to discourage the holding of collections of guns the Government decided to raise the fee on registration from £1 to £25 with a proviso that it would only be raised to £3 where the person concerned was only interested in the sale of sporting ammunition.  We hope that this and the Government amendment I referred to in my opening speech will achieve a very considerable reduction in the number of firearms dealers that are registered in the country at the moment. The present figure is approximately 1,100 which seems to me to be abnormally and unnecessarily high. Those, therefore, who will remain registered as firearms dealers will in fact be genuine dealers in the sense that they will be buying and selling guns as a means of livelihood and will take the <Col N="389" /> necessary precautions to safeguard their stock.  The collectors, I am afraid, perhaps were not always in a position to take the necessary precautions to take proper care of weapons in their possession.</P>
    <P>Criticism was also made by Senator Kelly and by some of our Senators that weapons like .22 pistols and certain other types of weapons were not covered by the Bill in the sense that they were not made military weapons although they would be regarded by many people as dangerous.  This is not entirely accurate although Senators could be forgiven for believing that because it is not spelt out in the Bill, But it will be seen in section 3 (2B) (b) that I can make an order declaring a firearm of any specified kind to be especially dangerous and thus bring it under the classification of military weapon.  Any sort of pistol could come into this category except perhaps for a very light airgun pistol or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan made a very good point that some sort of instruction should be given to people who get .22 rifles and similar sort of guns and who get certificates for them under the existing law.  I would like to see some sort of instruction given.  Unfortunately, it would not be feasible for the Garda to do it.  Senator McGowan made the suggestion that a handbook might be issued and I will certainly look into that aspect of it to see if it could be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald, Senator Honan and a number of others made the point that certificates for .22 rifles could be given to very young people and that this point might be considered. I certainly agree and I was surprised to find when I read back through the various Firearms Acts that the minimum age for a firearm certificate is 16 and that that has been so only since as recently as 1964, when the second last Firearms Act was enacted. It had been 15 years of age since 1925.  I do not think there is anything I can do about it in this present Bill, but if the opportunity were to arise again it might well be worth considering a higher age limit.</P>

      <P>Another point raised by a number of Senators was in connection with this proposed amnesty or so-called amnesty.  &ldquo;Amnesty&rdquo; is perhaps not the most accurate description because it might tend to create in the public mind some sort of feeling that there would be a period of no law or some sort of free for all.  The word was used in the Dáil by Deputy Briscoe when he asked me a question on the point and the word, unfortunately, was taken up by myself and by others afterwards, and perhaps it is somewhat misleading in that way.</P>
      <P>What I made clear in the Dáil and what I want to make clear again here is that I do not propose any sort of general amnesty.  All that is proposed is in the Bill itself, in subsection (4) of section 6, and is simply to the effect that this Act shall come into operation on the 14th day after the date of its passing.  The reason for that is not to give an opportunity to members of illegal organisations or others such as that to come along and hand in weapons that they might have without fear of prosecution but rather to give those people in the community&mdash;there must be a very great many of them&mdash; who have in their possession at the moment, component parts, defective weapons and other similar types and parts of weapons that are not covered by the existing law the opportunity to put their house in order, as it were, either to give them up or, alternatively, to get an authorisation that is provided for under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unreasonable, I think, not to give people like that, who are quite within the law at the moment but who will go outside the law as a result of the Bill when it is passed, an opportunity to rectify the situation in the light of the change in the law.  That is why this 14-day period referred to <Col N="391" /> in subsection (4) of section 6 has been specified but it is not really accurate to describe that as an amnesty.  It is simply a preparatory period to enable people to apply to the authorisations from superintendents that will be necessary for certain things that at the moment do no need either a certificate or an authorisation.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the fact that here were certain I think continental shotguns coming in, which he thought might be potentially dangerous, with short barrels.  He will observe that if, under section 3, the barrel of a shotgun is less than 24 inches it is no longer classified as a sporting weapon.  I think that those weapons would in fact be covered by the Bill.</P>

      <P>I see.  Thank you. I think that I have covered most of the points that were raised in the debate.  I should like to express my thanks to the Seanad for their welcome of the Bill and for a very useful, helpful and constructive debate on it.  I find myself in agreement with the sentiments expressed by many Senators on both sides of the House tonight about the need to clamp down completely on the possession of illegal weapons.  I should like to assure the Seanad that this is the determination of the Government and we will do all in our power to see that this unfortunate scourge in our community, namely, the possession of <Col N="392" /> illegal weapons, will be clamped down on to the maximum extent.  The Garda have done very good work in the last few years on this problem.  I gave a comprehensive list to the Dáil a month or so ago of the amount of arms and ammunition they had seized from subversive groups in the past year or 18 months.  Unfortunately I have not got it with me now but it makes fairly impressive reading I think and is a great credit to them in the difficulties that they labour under.</P>
      <P>As Senator Cranitch and a number of other Senators said here tonight, there is unfortunately a sort of legacy in this country that regards the possession of arms as something only faintly criminal.  I am afraid in the context of Ireland today the illegal possession of arms is something a great deal more than faintly criminal.  It is something very seriously criminal.  It would be a good thing if we could change our attitude as a people to this problem because if that attitude were to change more quickly&mdash;it is changing&mdash;I think that the Garda would get more assistance from people who might have information at their disposal at the moment but who for one reason or another are nervous to give it.</P>
      <P>If people like that would come forward to assist the Garda readily, the problem would be much less.  I would say to those people that, if they see property being stolen, property being damaged or persons being injured in assaults, they should regard those activities as criminal and immediately go to the Garda.  I feel we should try to get it across to people that the possession of unlawful arms, the illegal possession of arms, is a very serious criminal matter in the context of Ireland today.  I hope that all people in our community will realise that and do what is very clearly their duty at the present moment, that is, to give every support to the police force and to the one and only official Army in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I sit down I think it is only right that I should say that I regret that the occasion of the Second Reading of this Bill in the Seanad was utilised for an unfair and irrelevant criticism of a retired civil servant who <Col N="393" /> has given long and distinguished service to his country.</P>

    <Title>Redundancy Payments Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purposes of this Bill are: firstly, to provide for a new definition of redundancy to meet the circumstances arising from a decision of the High Court in 1969 which gave a narrower interpretation to the term redundancy than was originally intended and to provide for the compensation of workers adversely affected up to the present by the High Court decision; secondly, to reduce the qualifying period for statutory redundancy payments from four to two years; and, thirdly, to provide for improvements in the rates of redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains a large number of provisions dealing with problems of a technical nature.  I am also proposing to provide for extension of the scope of the resettlement allowances scheme.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that the Redundancy Payments Act came into operation on 1st January, 1968.  The scheme set out in the Act was designed to compensate workers for loss of employment, to alleviate hardship arising for workers affected by redundancy and to facilitate the rationalisation of production which is an essential feature of economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing scheme provides that a qualified worker who is dismissed by reason of redundancy after four years' continuous service with the same employer is entitled to a lump sum and weekly payments related to his age, service and pre-redundancy pay.  The employer is obliged to pay the lump sum in full in the first instance but he <Col N="394" /> may recover part of it, normally 50 per cent but up to 65 per cent depending on the length of notice of dismismisal given, by way of rebate from the Redundancy Fund, which is financed by weekly contributions from employers and workers.  Redundancy weekly payments, which are paid to qualified workers during unemployment following redundancy are met in full from the fund.</P>
    <P>The redundancy payments scheme applies to workers who are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  In effect, therefore, virtually all manual workers are covered by the scheme while non-manual workers with earnings of up to £1,600 are also covered.  The existing scheme also applies to workers for two years after they cease to be compulsorily insurable. The Bill proposes to extend this period to four years.</P>
    <P>The annual income of the Redundancy Fund from the contributions of employers and employees is now about £1¼ million.  In the period from 1st January, 1968, when the Act came into effect, up to 31st May, 1971, the total expenditure from the fund was almost £2,400,000.</P>
    <P>It may perhaps be of assistance to Senators in assessing the usefulness of the redundancy payments scheme if I quote some figures relating to the operation of the scheme.  Since the introduction of the scheme on 1st January, 1968, up to 28th May, 1971, a total of 14,547 redundancies was notified to my Department.  This total was comprised of 11,356 men and 3,191 women.  The number of redundancies in each of the calendar years 1968, 1969 and 1970 was remarkably even &mdash;3,863, 3,696 and 3,896 respectively. This year, in the period up to 28th May, 3,092 redundancies have been notified to my Department, comprising 2,362 men and 730 women.  This figure is almost double the figure for the corresponding period of 1970.</P>
    <P>From the monetary viewpoint, redundant workers have received lump sum payments totalling over £2 million and weekly payments amounting to about £1,400,000 in the period 1st January, 1968&mdash;31st May, 1971.  Lump sums paid in accordance with the scheme <Col N="395" /> have ranged from about £15 to over £1,100 and the average weekly payment has been approximately £7, which is additional to unemployment benefit or other payment to which a worker would be entitled under the social welfare code.  These figures provide, I believe, clear evidence that the redundancy payments scheme has been of great benefit in reducing the hardships resulting from redundancy for many workers and their dependants.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Second Stage on the Bill in Dáil Éireann, I said that the Redundancy Fund from which the scheme is financed was in a financially sound condition and that, despite the substantial outgoings on lump sums and weekly payments since 1st January, 1968, the fund had a credit balance of approximately £1¾ million. I said also that, while it was important to maintain a reserve in the fund against unforeseen contingencies, I believed it was possible with the surplus then in the fund to introduce a number of worthwhile improvements in the benefits available under the scheme. I stated, however, that, in case it should be argued that the Bill did not go far enough in extra benefits, there was a need for prudence to provide for increased demands on the fund.  I think our experience so far this year underlines the need for prudence.  Current income in to the fund is being balanced by current outgoings, even before the introduction of the improvements proposed in the Bill.  In the circumstances, I suggest to the House that it would be unwise to take on any further commiments beyond those provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I shall now briefly describe the main provisions of the Bill.  The decision to amend the definition of redundancy arose following a High Court judment in 1969 which had the effect of interpreting the definition of &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; in a restricted way which was not intended.  If this interpretation were allowed to stand, certain workers dismissed as surplus to their employers' requirements who are redundant in the generally-accepted sense would not be entitled to redundancy payments.  The Government decided to amend the appropriate provision in the <Col N="396" /> Act.  I publicly announced this decision in October, 1969, and that it was proposed to provide for payment from the fund of compensation to workers debarred from receiving redundancy payments following the High Court decision.  Payments have, in effect, been made from the fund to 24 workers in anticipation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The following are the principal improvements proposed in the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  reduction in the period to qualify for benefit from four years' continuous service with the same employer to two years;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the abolition of the 20 weeks' pay maximum on the amount of a lump sum;</P>
    <P>(iii)  years of continuous employment over the age of 41 years to count for two weekly payments&mdash; at present each two years over 41 counts for three weekly payments;</P>
    <P>(iv)  a minimum of four weekly payments contingent on unemployment;</P>
    <P>(v)  an increase in each lump sum payment by the equivalent of one week's pay;</P>
    <P>(vi)  a general 5 per cent increase in the rates of lump sum rebates to employers;</P>
    <P>(vii)  the existing waiting period of two weeks for weekly redundancy payments to be reduced to three days; and, finally, as I already mentioned,</P>
    <P>(viii)  cover by the Act to continue for four years after the insurable limit under the Social Welfare Acts is exceeded instead of for two years at present.</P>
    <P>Every worker who becomes redundant in future will secure some additional benefit under this Bill.  The main emphasis in the new benefits is, however, directed towards older and long service workers who will gain from the abolition of the overriding maximum on the lump sum and the extra weekly payments for service over 41 years of age.  Workers with shorter service will be helped by the reduction in the required period of qualifying service to two years and the minimum <Col N="397" /> of four weekly payments.  The higher rebates will, in effect, reimburse employers for extra cost which they may have to meet as a result of the additional benefits.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil I introduced amendments to allow weekly redundancy payments to be made to persons who became redundant in the Twenty-Six Counties but who are resident in Northern Ireland. I am sure that the Seanad will agree that, if only on grounds of equity, such persons who will have contributed to our Redundancy Fund should be entitled to receive weekly payments as well as lump sum payments.</P>
    <P>As most of the other amendments which I am proposing to the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, are of a technical nature they are more appropriate for discussion on Committee Stage.  In general, they are designed to facilitate the more efficient administration of the Redundancy Scheme, to remove anomalies and to deal with situations not specifically covered in the 1967 Act.  While, as I have said, these amendments will be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage, there are a few which I think are of sufficient importance to merit mention at this point.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a provision extending the time limit for the making of claims by employees.  It also provides additional protection for workers' rights where there are changes of ownership.  There is also provision that in future there shall be a presumption in the worker's favour in the event of a dispute arising as to whether dismissal was due to redundancy or service was continuous.  The Bill also provides that provisions of the 1967 Act or of the new Act that relate to the continuity of an employee's employment shall apply to periods before as well as after 1st January, 1968.  The procedure to be followed by an employee who wishes to claim a redundancy payment from his employer by reason of being kept on lay-off or short-time for a substantial period is being simplified.  The Bill also provides for the award of costs, at the discretion of the court, to be paid by the Redundancy Fund where cases which are <Col N="398" /> dealt with by the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal are brought to the High Court.  The position in relation to eligibility for weekly redundancy payments in the event of a trade dispute is being brought into line with the Social Welfare Acts and some further penalties in relation to fraud are being introduced.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing amendment of the provision in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, relating to resettlement allowances.  Under this scheme various types of financial aids are payable entirely from State funds to unemployed persons or persons about to become redundant to move to new areas to take up employment.  These allowances include interview grants, travel expenses for the worker and his dependants, household removal expenses, settling-in grants, lodging allowances, grants for the worker to visit his family while awaiting their transfer to the new area and grants towards the legal expenses involved in the sale or purchase of a house.  The resettlement allowances scheme came into effect in January, 1968.  The number of persons availing themselves of it is increasing but is still comparatively small&mdash;186 persons throughout the whole of 1970 and 60 in the period from 1st January, 1971, to 31st May, 1971.  There is little tradition of geographical mobility of labour within this country except to the cities&mdash; mainly Dublin&mdash;and there are other factors, such as lack of housing, which inhibit internal mobility.  I think, nevertheless, that this scheme does help to encourage mobility and is worth persevering with and developing.</P>
    <P>I have, accordingly, included a provision in the Bill which will enable the scheme to be extended to persons already in employment and Irish emigrants wishing to return to this country.  I also propose that benefit under the scheme should be available to persons who have to travel to attend for tests for selection for training at approved training centres&mdash;such as those operated by An Chomhairle Oiliúna&mdash;or to undertake courses of training at such centres.  I also want to make clear that the scheme may be applied to persons other than persons who are insured for all benefits <Col N="399" /> under the Social Welfare Acts.  The actual implmentation of these improvements will be effected by regulations when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil I was pressed very strongly to apply some or all of the new benefits retrospectively. There was also some criticism that the new benefits should be more generous.  To anticipate further debate on these aspects in this House I should like to sound a note of warning. The Redundancy Fund is still in a healthy state but, as I have already mentioned, with the increase in the number of redundancies this year it is no longer accumulating a surplus. Wages are going up all the time and higher pay will be reflected in higher benefit payments, while contributions continue to be pegged at the existing flat rates.  The raising of the social insurance limit from £1,200 to £1,600 in May of this year means that many higher paid non-manual employees will in future be eligible to qualify for redundancy benefits and the effect of this on the fund cannot be predicted. The &ldquo;crunch&rdquo; period of the Free Trade Agreement with Britain and the probability of membership of an enlarged EEC are approaching.</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Fund must, in the interests of prudence, be left with a reserve to meet these major contingencies. Apart from the financial aspect I am against rerospection because any there could be no basis in principle for picking one retrospective date rather than another and because any retrospective payments would have to be borne in full by the Redundancy Fund.  It was calculated that he additional benefits in the Bill would cost the fund about £450,000 a year but this estimate may be conservative in view of recent redundancy figures. The benefits could be further improved if contributions were increased substantially but I am most anxious to avoid an increase in indirect charges on employers and workers for redundancy benefits at the present time.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to the Seanad I want to make the point that the redundancy payments legislation is just a part of the Government's overall <Col N="400" /> manpower policy.  Industrial development and increased industrial employment are likely to increase rather than diminish the scale on which we experience redundancy in Ireland.  Technological development, which we must accept if we are to grow in prosperity, sometimes leads to radical and bewildering changes in the employment situation.</P>
    <P>Redundancy can be a near tragic experience for a worker and we must all bend our energies to helping workers who encounter this hazard. The main aim must be to get such workers back into at least as good jobs as they lost as quickly as possible. Towards this end the Government have set up the National Manpower Service to provide improved placement and guidance facilities.  Training and retraining of redundant workers is a function of An Chomhairle Oiliúna set up under the Industrial Training Act, 1967.  AnCO are expanding the number of training places in their training centres as rapidly as possible. The redundancy payments scheme, and the extra benefits now proposed, should be viewed as a part of this major effort by the Government to help workers to cope with this unfortunate, but unavoidable contingency of our modern industrial society.</P>

      <P>The first thing that must strike any Senator in regard to the particular measure that the Minister has recommended to us is its complexity. The Principal Act which it is now proposed to amend was one of some 60 sections.  In the amending measure before us we have a Bill of 20 sections.  As one hopefully reaches section 19 and hopes that most of the main amendments have already been covered in one's study of the Bill, one finds that section 19 is, as it were, an opening to an even more untidy garden than the one through which one has walked in section 1 to 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has listed the eight main improvements in regard to the redundancy scheme.  Seven of these eight improvements are listed among the miscellaneous items in the Schedule to the Bill in a manner in which it is rather difficult to reference them, rather <Col N="401" /> difficult to be specific in regard to which particular amendment.  There may be very good reasons.  Of course, parliamentary draftsmen never fail to have good reasons that convince them that this is the way in which Bills should be presented to legislators.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unduly carping nor do I want to be unduly critical, but I ask the Minister to try to realise the position of legislators if faced with a Bill in the form in which this Bill is before us this evening.  The Minister may not appreciate this because, in difficulty, he can turn o the appropriate page of his nice fat brief, which will guide him through this difficult passage.</P>
    <P>However, those of us who have to write our won briefs find Bills like this difficult to read and, we suspect, unnecessarily difficult to read.  Many of the major amendments to the law, which the Minister is now proposing to us, are contained in the Schedule to this Bill.  You can only beging to make sense of them when you realise that within the Schedule we have amendments to both the sections and to the Schedule of the Principal Act.  This seems to me to be a matter of great difficulty and we are entitled to comment on it, and we are entitled to ask, as the legislators whose judgment is being asked on measures of this type, that something more should be done to present these proposals to us in a more readily assimilative form.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill to the Dáil, the Minister paid the House and those of us who read that first Bill the courtesy of circulating an explanatory memorandum.  We might never have found our way through it without that explanatory memorandum, but the Bill before us is not the Bill that was introduced to the Dáil.  There are two new sections in it which throws all the numbering of the explanatory memorandum out of joint.  When we go to look at paragraph 2 of the Schedule of the original Act we find this has been changed by a later amendment.  I am not saying that the Minister should not accept amendments in the Dáil.  What starts as Ministerial benevolence in the Dáil is liable to become Senatorial confusion later on.  In this debate and the <Col N="402" /> Committee Stage debate we will have to come to grips with his proposals and I ask that he should be indulgent towards those of us who have to pick our way through this particular thicket.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the proposal to amend the code is a welcome one.  Before considering it let us just recall what we mean by the redundancy code.  We are passing the first amendment to the original Act of 1967.  The payment of redundancy allowance is therefore a relatively modern development because it is only relatively recently that the right to such payments has been recognised. We have at last come to the point of view that the man who works in a particular job for a number of years has made a real and sometimes a very much more real investment in that job than anyone who made available to it its working capital.</P>
    <P>It is recognition of this fact which gives rise to the redundancy code.  We must recognise in dealing with this code that this is what we are concerned with: this person has made an investment of a considerable part of his working life in one particular enterprise.  Part of this belongs to him because of what he has given to it.  It is through this point of view that we manage to work out in our legislation the principle that we accepted on paper long ago: that labour is not a commodity.  But it is only recently that we have started to put it into practice through legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>We are glad that the Minister is back with us this evening after a few short years to increase the benefits and to remove the anomalies that have existed.  From what he said in recommending the Bill to us this evening and from the figures he gave us concerning the numbers of persons who have benefited, the amount that has been paid out in lump sums or in weekly payments, it is clear that there are many people who, in the past 3½ years, have had, as he said, the cushioning of the benefits of redundancy payments which otherwise they would not have had.  The Minister has brought in the Bill with improvements because the Redundancy Fund, which is the basis of this particular code, has shown the accumulation of a surplus. <Col N="403" /> Although from what the Minister has said this evening it would appear that that surplus has already been heavily eaten into during the periods of economic difficulty which have become intensified since the beginning of this year, it would appear from the figures which the Minister has given us that there is very little left of cushioning in this fund, as a fund, if these conditions are to continue.</P>
    <P>By my reckoning the position was that up to the end of last year the amount that was being drawn from the fund was something of the order of between £600,000 and £700,000 each year.  It would appear that since the beginning of the year there has been a drawing of something approaching £500,000 from the fund.  If we add to this figure of £450,000, which is the Minister's estimate based on the conditions running over the three years of the increased benefit, it would appear that the drawing from the fund during the next year or so will be well in excess of £1 million.  I may have done my arithmetic wrong in this regard. If so, I should be glad if the Minister could put me right on these points.  My hurried arithmetic on the basis of the figures the Minister has given us this evening would indicate that it is likely, even without the increases that we have had in the past few months, that there will be drawings from the fund of the order of over £1 million.  It would need very little for these withdrawals from the fund to overake the income in the fund which is reckoned at something like £1,250,000.</P>
    <P>If this Bill had been introduced six months ago we might well have pressed heavily on the Minister, might well have accused him of conservatism in the management of the fund by proposing only the benefits which he has proposed here this evening.  It would appear on the basis of the figures which he has given us now that that accusation can no longer be made.</P>
    <P>We welcome, of course, the improvements which the Minister has proposed. Going through them, I think we can see in every case that he is meeting a real difficulty.  We could perhaps <Col N="404" /> discuss and disagree on points of emphasis between particular improvements to the scheme.</P>
    <P>By and large one cannot see any area which would appear to be a major error of judgment in regard to the clearing up of the definition of &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo;. The right of those who have reached the age of 71 and who are drawing redundancy payments to continue to draw them, the problems of dealing with the change of ownership, the problems of dealing with lay-off and short-time, in all of these the Minister has gone some distance towards making this a more humane code, in broadening it so that more people will benefit and so that there will be fewer hard cases who would be excluded by the rigidity of the original legislation.</P>
    <P>In the proposals that he has brought forward to us this evening in regard to the tribunal, again he has done the sort of thing we would have hoped him to do in introducing the idea of a presumption before the tribunal that the redundancy right existed.  It is, I think, the proper way in which to handle this problem.  Matters such as the extension of the claim period and the reduction of the qualifying period were all matters which, I am sure, the Minister's predecessor had hoped to tackle but felt he was unable financially to do when introducing the original legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made more flexible the arrangements with regard to the repayment of rebates to employers in respect of the lump sum.  Indeed, he has increased this amount generally. Also to be welcomed are some of the minor provisions, for example reciprocal agreements with other countries and resettlement.  In connection with these two matters there are some questions I should like to ask. With regard to reciprocal agreements concerning redundancy, I should like to ask the Minister firstly whether any agreements have been made; secondly, whether any agreements are being negotiated; and, thirdly, whether any agreements which either are, or would be, negotiated would be concerned only with the disposition of moneys from the Redundancy Fund or whether <Col N="405" /> there would also be an arrangement which would involve some payments from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>On the question of resettlement, I should like to ask the Minister if he could state the amounts paid out from the Central Fund under section 46 of the Principal Act.  One can detect a note of disappointment in what the Minister said about the numbers who have benefited under this provision. However, I shall return to that point later.</P>
    <P>Most of the provisions contained in the Bill are provisions that we would all welcome.  The reduction of waiting time, the removal of the limit, the additional benefits for the older worker are all matters which we would expect to be contained in an enlightened code. The question of a redundancy code is very much a part of the problem which the Minister, in his Department is facing.  In dealing with the question of redundancy and redundancy payments we are dealing with the alleviation of symptoms rather than with the cure of what is wrong in regard to our institutions and the structure of our industry. A redundancy code and redundancy payments are certainly necessary in order to deal with the problems raised by structural unemployment.  However, they can never effect a cure.</P>
    <P>It is with regard to a cure that the problems of resettlement and retraining come into their own.  If it can be said that the redundancy code was a code which worked in a relatively satisfactory way and which is now being improved, the same cannot be said in regard to resettlement and retraining.  If we speak about what is being done by the Industrial Training Authority with regard to retraining, we must come to the conclusion that, while what is being done is meritorious and deserving of our praise, it is too small when compared to the problem with which it is dealing.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be disappointed and I, certainly, am disappointed at the progress being made with regard to adult retraining.  It is true that the Industrial Training Authority have had to undertake many things in their early years but I feel that that authority, and the Minister's Department, will have <Col N="406" /> to direct their energies more and more to the question of adult retraining.</P>
    <P>While it is necessary that we should train in the widest possible way and according to the best techniques those who are now entering the labour force, we would make a very great mistake if we did so to such an extent that we were seriously neglecting those who have already entered the work force, mainly those who entered the work force in the days when all of the benefits of new training and new education were not available.</P>
    <P>Those people, as the Minister well knows, are his responsibility just as much as school leavers.  The fact that those workers have jobs now is not sufficient to discharge that responsibility, which lies on the Industrial Training Authority, on the Minister, on the Legislature and on the whole community. We have a duty to those people and, as I have already said, it is not enough that they have jobs now.  The Minister pointed out very clearly to us this evening that many of those workers may not have those jobs in the future and many of them will be seeking the protection and help of the redundancy code before very long.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, symptomatic that there has been a heavy drain on the Redundancy Fund after three years of operation. The increased strain on the fund may well be a reflection of the fact that other aspects of the problem of retaining and resettlement did not move as fast as the redundancy legislation and the operation of this code in the past few years.  During those years of relative plenty compared to now, many things might have been done. They are matters which will have to be attended to now, in leaner times.</P>
    <P>Though we welcome what is contained in this Bill, it deals only with a transition and it will not solve our fundamental problems.  The Minister has come to us with his Bill which has had the benefit of the advice of his Department.  It has had the benefit also of the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.  However, I wonder if, in amending the legislation, there are some other people who have been forgotten.  The unions have been <Col N="407" /> able to put forward the case for their members and the Federated Union of Employers have had the opportunity of putting the case of the well organised employer, but there may be many cases of small employers.  The small employer is really in serious trouble these times and he may well suffer because of a certain rigidity in this code.  It might well be that the Minister could have relaxed some of the bureaucratic rigidity of this code.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what I am talking about, I should like to mention a specific case. This is the case of a small builder who found that he would be unable to carry on.  He was working in a small way of business.  He could not really carry on this business but he had, as many of these small employers have, a great loyalty to those who worked for him.  This man, before he sent out any notices under any section of this code, went around to his colleagues in the building industry and ensured that every one of those men who were working for him would not be idle one day.  He ensured that the day after he was forced to lay off these men, due to the closure of his business, they would start the next morning in a comparable job, a job in which he was satisfied they would have the same working conditions which he was able to give them in the past.</P>
    <P>This man, by acting in this way, was doing a great social good for these men who had worked with him as a team, because that is the way these small businesses very often work.  By ensuring that there was absolute continuity of employment he had saved the Redundancy Fund from making payments to these individuals.  But because this individual did not fill out a form, did not inform the Department of Labour about this particular action, he was unable to get the benefit to which he would otherwise have been entitled.  Because of the lack of an official notification this individual was unable to get the benefit he otherwise would be entitled to under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand this particular person made an appeal in this case.  The tribunal were sympathetic to him, but section 29 of the original Act was so <Col N="408" /> rigid that it gave them no discretion, in this particular case, to overlook the fact that certain statutory requirements had not been met.</P>
