    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, in March 1965, purchased from Coast Lines Limited that company's wholly-owned subsidiary, the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited.  The purchase price of £3,600,000 was based on valuation of the assets without any allowance for goodwill.  The assets included three passenger/cargo/cattle vessels, six cargo/cattle vessels, properties at Dublin, Cork, Drogheda and Dundalk and liquid reserves amounting to £720,000.  It was a condition of the purchase that the B &amp; I should enter into an agreement appointing Coast Lines their agents in Britain for a period of 20 years at an agreed commission.  The Government also had to give Coast Lines a written undertaking that the B &amp; I would operate their business on strictly commercial lines as a self-supporting commercial entity without special measures which would place the B &amp; I in an advantageous position as compared with Coast Lines.</P>
      <P>When moving the Second Stage of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) Bill, 1965, my predecessor outlined the reasons why the Government had acquired the B &amp; I.  These were, mainly, to ensure effective Irish participation in the cross-Channel trade which was so important both from the point of view of tourism and our foreign trade. The B &amp; I profits were diminishing rapidly and it was essential to acquire the company to ensure the continuation of its services as well as to ensure that in the rapidly changing situation in the cross-Channel services the national interest would receive proper consideration. He pointed out that the shipping trade was then facing a period of rapid evolutionary change which posed great difficulties for shipping lines operating conventional services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1965 Bill provided for the operation of the company on a strictly <Col N="473" /> commercial basis.  There was no provision for Government assistance nor any provision for increasing the capital of the company.  It was hoped that necessary new investment to meet the technological changes in the industry could be financed from loan capital which would be serviced from profits.</P>
    <P>Following their appointment, the new board of the B &amp; I decided, after full investigation, that the existing management structure in the B &amp; I, which was geared to the overall management structure of Coast Lines, was not suitable to operation of the company as an independent Irish entity.  The board recruited new management personnel with knowledge and experience in the marketing and financial fields and introduced a new management structure based in Dublin and including a modern sales and marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>In order to compete effectively with the new passenger/car ferry services between Ireland and Britain introduced by their competitors and to stimulate the demand for this type of transport, which is particularly significant for the promotion and expansion of tourism, the B &amp; I decided to replace their three conventional passenger/cargo/livestock vessels with car ferries.  Two of these vessels have been brought into operation on the Dublin/Liverpool route and one on the Cork/Swansea route.  The acquisition of these car ferries and the provision of the necessary terminals at Dublin, Cork, Liverpool and Swansea involved the company in capital investment and commitments of over £9 million.  This sum was raised almost entirely by borrowing and the servicing of this borrowing has constituted a very heavy financial burden.</P>
    <P>These services, however, have been operated on a profitable basis and the record shows their spectacular success. In 1966, 378,000 passengers were carried by the company.  The serious outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain in 1967 contributed to a reduction in this figure to 306,000 in that year.  In 1968, when the first car-ferry was introduced, the number of passengers carried increased to 360,000. This figure improved further to 480,000 in 1969 and 547,000 in 1970.  The number of cars carried in 1968 was <Col N="474" /> 43,000 rising to 78,000 in 1969 and 82,000 in 1970.  Although they only commenced car-ferry operations in 1968 the company now control 37½ per cent of this market.  I should add, perhaps, that these up-to-date vessels enabled B &amp; I to pioneer the roll-on/ roll-off type of freight facility in this country.  Now they are the only Irish operator of this type of service which is increasing in popularity.  In 1968 they carried 5,157 wheeled-transport units, increasing to 14,300 units and 24,120 units in 1969 and 1970 respectively. These figures represent an estimated 30,000 tons, 90,000 tons and 140,000 tons of freight in each of the years 1968, 1969 and 1970 respectively.</P>
    <P>In earlier years livestock traffic had been one of the main and most profitable activities of the B &amp; I.  Over recent years, however, this position has altered substantially.  British Rail decided in 1968 to concentrate their declining stock of cattle wagons at Holyhead and were no longer able to guarantee an adequate supply of rail wagons at Birkenhead.  This, and the preference of shippers for onward transport by rail in Britain, resulted in a fall-off in the numbers of cattle shipped by the B &amp; I.  Where, in 1966, the company had carried 176,000 head of cattle to Birkenhead, in 1969 they carried only 49,000 and none at all in 1970. In the years 1968 and 1969 they lost £376,000 on this traffic.  A further factor was the announcement by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, which controls Birkenhead, that livestock facilities at that port would be closed down if the port were not guaranteed an annual throughout of 200,000 head of cattle and an annual income of £103,000.</P>
    <P>The likelihood that Birkenhead would no longer be available for Irish cattle obliged the B &amp; I company and British Rail to re-examine their entire position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the livestock services. There was a serious danger that the B &amp; I would be forced out of this trade entirely, leaving British Rail with a virtual monopoly of a sector of shipping of vital national interest.  After prolonged negotiation between the B &amp; I and British Rail, agreement was reached last year on a proposal, which had the approval of the livestock <Col N="475" /> trade, to operate joint livestock services through a consortium.  The agreement provided that the two companies would provide ships to a common pool and for the operation of regular scheduled services to Holyhead, for cattle requiring onward transport by rail, and to Heysham, for cattle destined for onward transport by road. The consortium is under the control of a management board, consisting of representatives of the two shipping companies and of the livestock trade. The new management board will determine rates and negotiate on any proposed increases with the Irish Livestock Exporters' and Traders' Association. Any such increases will be related strictly to new factors, such as increasing costs, and machinery will be established to relate rates to actual costs of operation.</P>
    <P>This agreement secures considerable benefits for shippers as well as for the B &amp; I.  For shippers, regular scheduled services are guaranteed for an initial period of five years with the possibility of extension for a further five-year period.  Shippers are also assured of reasonable stability in freight rates. Furthermore, for the first time, they have secured a voice in the cattle shipment business through their representatives on the management board. For the B &amp; I, the agreement means elimination of their losses on livestock carryings and a continuing guarantee of participation in the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>The agreement also recognised that the future of Birkenhead as an entry port for Irish cattle was in doubt.  This development was a cause, and not a result, of the inter-company agreement.</P>
    <P>The livestock trade recently made representations to me and to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries about the desirability of ensuring that Birkenhead should remain open to receive Irish cattle.  I arranged for officers of both Departments to discuss the matter with the trade whose views I conveyed to the consortium.  It must, however, be kept in mind that the question of the future of the livestock facilities at Birkenhead is one solely for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.  What is essential, in the interests of the trade, <Col N="476" /> is that there should be a guarantee of regular service between this country and Britain.</P>
    <P>The most difficult problem, financially and otherwise, which faced the company following the take-over was the declining profitability of their conventional cargo services and it was found essential to convert to containers and unit loads as rapidly as possible. By early 1969 all the company's cargo was being carried in specialised unit load ships.  B &amp; I are now market leaders in this field and account for 35 per cent of total freight movements in the cross-Channel trade.  To achieve the full economic benefits of containerisation, however, required the construction of automated terminals and the provision of cellular container vessels designed for automated handling of containers in conjunction with the terminals.  Because of the high level of dock labour which had been employed in the loading and unloading of the conventional vessels, the changeover to container vessels and the progressive approach to complete automation of loading and discharge involved heavy redundancy.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I have long recognised the need to deal with this problem and, in July, 1967, with British Rail and Bristol Seaway Ltd., initiated a survey of operations at the Dublin cross-Channel terminal with a view to formulating a charter for cross-Channel dock workers.  This survey culminated in the &ldquo;Murphy Report&rdquo; of May, 1968. However, even before this important report was made, the three companies had introduced an interim scheme of redundancy compensation payments, jointly operated and financed by themselves.</P>
    <P>Following completion of the survey, negotiations on the recommendations contained in the Murphy Report commenced, under the auspices of the Department of Labour, between the companies and the trade unions concerned. Arising from those negotiations, the first stage of implementation of the Murphy recommendations on redundancy was the introduction, in January, 1969, of the voluntary options scheme.  This replaced the interim scheme which had operated since <Col N="477" /> 1967.  Basically, both schemes provided for payment of a lump-sum to a docker on his retirement, together with a weekly pension in the case of those dockers with the necessary qualifying years of service.  Depending on age and service, dockers can now qualify for lump-sum payments up to a maximum of £1,500 and for pensions up to a maximum of £7 per week.  A total of 223 dockers who opted for retirement have benefited from the schemes to date.  This has resulted in a reduction in the number of dockers on the register from 446 in September, 1967, to the present-day level of 223.  Negotiations with the unions are continuing on the full implementation of the Murphy Report proposals and it is hoped that agreement will be reached in the near future. This will involve the B &amp; I Company in further heavy redundancy payments to their dockers.</P>
    <P>The company's full freight plan was estimated to cost £9 million and it had been hoped to find the necessary finance mainly by commercial borrowing and partly from internal resources including the disposal of redundant assets.  The company were also exploring, in the context of their freight plan, the possibility of reaching an understanding with British Rail, their principal competitor, on the rational long-term development of cargo services between Ireland and Britain which would exclude unnecessary duplication and, by being open to all container operators at standard rates, would avoid the dangers of monopoly.</P>
    <P>The company's development and the implementation of their plans have thus made excellent physical progress, but financial problems have arisen. Apart from the heavy losses sustained in livestock carryings, the company were involved in very heavy losses due to strikes at Liverpool in three successive years and to the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in 1967-68.  These, together with the maintenance strike in 1969 and the British dock strike in 1970, involved the company in losses estimated at nearly £700,000.  The disposal of their older vessels, particularly the passenger/cargo/cattle vessels, yielded £1 million less than the figure <Col N="478" /> at which they had been taken over. This was due to premature obsolescence of their passenger/cargo/cattle vessels because of the rapid development of specialised cargo, ferry and container vessels and also because newly adopted international fire safety regulations require costly modifications in their vessels which reduced their attractiveness to potential purchasers overseas.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1969 the B &amp; I found themselves at a crucial stage of their development.  Apart from the financial difficulties caused by unforeseen losses and the heavy drain on liquidity imposed by the servicing of substantial loan capital, the company found that British Rail had also committed themselves to a major programme of containerisation with new cellular container ships and automated terminals on the same lines as their own freight plan.  It was known that, in order to secure the volume of traffic necessary for economic operation of their new ships and terminals, British Rail aimed at securing a substantial increase in their share of the market. The developing situation threatened to bring about a freight war in the cross-Channel trade which would wipe out small independent operators and involve the two major companies in over-investment and heavy losses which would eventually fall on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I reported this situation to me at the beginning of 1970.  They pointed out that in the absence of some agreement with British Rail they would have to face a period of very substantial losses until the growth in traffic would permit both companies to secure adequate traffic for economic operation.  The B &amp; I were also concerned that in a situation of unrestricted and uneconomic competition they should be supported by CIE who had developed container operations of their own on the Irish Sea in association with one of the other British nationalised transport companies.  CIE operated containers only and not ships and with their British partner aimed to ship containers through the cheapest services available.  In this very complex and rapidly changing situation I decided to engage specialised consultants to examine and clarify the issues arising. <Col N="479" /> I invited McKinsey and Company Inc. to undertake this task because of their special knowledge and experience in this field.  They had already carried out major studies for British Rail on which, <i>inter alia,</i> were based British Rail freight plans for the Irish Sea. They were engaged in similar studies for the European Railways Consortium.</P>
    <P>British Rail were kind enough to agree that McKinseys could use the same consultancy team that worked for them and could also use the data already supplied by British Rail.  As I announced at the time, the study aimed in the first instance at analysing operational methods, routes and scales of service and identifying and contrasting possible alternative policies for the Irish State-owned operators.  In the light of this part of the study, adoption and implementation of definitive commercial policies would be considered. I made it clear that any measures recommended would have to be in accord with overall Government policy in relation to cross-Channel shipping which aims at ensuring efficient services at competitive rates for shippers, maintaining an equitable level of Irish participation in the trade, encouraging participation by private operators and excluding restrictive practices which are contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>In their first report to me McKinsey and Company found that both the B &amp; I and British Rail had each separately planned the most economic services for their own routes but that the total market for some years to come was not large enough for both the B &amp; I and British Rail to obtain the traffic levels on which their plans were based.  There would thus be considerable over-capacity throughout the early 1970s.  Two separate Dublin terminals and too much ship capacity were being provided.  British Rail were preparing to improve their market share by cutting rates which could mainly be at the expense of the B &amp; I and B &amp; I would have to match these rates to stay in business.  Both companies would lose money which would ultimately have to be met by the taxpayers in Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>McKinseys estimated that if the shipping <Col N="480" /> operations of both companies were rationalised on lines recommended by them the two companies would be able to reduce their total shipping costs by over 12 per cent and achieve higher load factors.  On the basis of the information available at the time of their report McKinseys estimated that there would also be a saving from operating to a joint terminal on a one-berth system at Dublin.  However, escalating costs have in the meantime eliminated any prospect of such saving; as separate berth operation is now cheaper, the companies intend to proceed on that basis but to set up a joint terminal operating company to control and manage the two berths as a unit.</P>
    <P>At my request, McKinsey and Co. communicated their report to British Rail also.  At subsequent meetings between British Rail and the B &amp; I, agreement in principle on rationalisation of shipping operations was reached, and settlement of the various operational and financial details leading to formal agreement is proceeding. This will lead to substantial savings in both operational costs, and capital costs in the purchase of equipment and ships as far as the two companies are concerned.</P>
    <P>These agreements should not only protect the companies against losses caused by the operation of excess capacity but ensure the provision of adequate services at the lowest real cost with consequent benefit to both exporters and importers.  On the other hand, the agreements do not constitute any kind of monopoly and will not provide unfair competition for independent operators of economic services on other routes.</P>
    <P>McKinsey and Co. subsequently reported to me on the steps which might be taken towards the integration of the marketing operations of B &amp; I and CIE.  They envisaged the possible hiving-off of marketing by both concerns to a separate jointly managed undertaking which should enter into a partnership with a similarly representative British nationalised undertaking with safeguards against monopoly operation.  These recommendations have been under examination by the B &amp; I and CIE in consultation with <Col N="481" /> the different British nationalised undertakings which would be concerned.</P>
    <P>Because of the distribution of functions among the British nationalised transport bodies concerned and their commercial relations with B &amp; I and CIE respectively, the proposal to establish a joint CIE-B &amp; I marketing organisation was not found to be practicable and its adoption could threaten the proposed agreement between B &amp; I and British Rail for rationalisation of ships and terminals and resurrect the threat of a rate war. B &amp; I and CIE have now agreed, however, on marketing policies which will safeguard the efficient and economic operation of ships and terminals and provide for standard rates of charge for all users, public and private sector alike.  These objectives provide for separation of the operation of ships and terminals from the marketing and through-forwarding of containers. B &amp; I (Freightway) will operate as a separate marketing and through-for-warding operator on both sides of the Irish Sea.  CIE will continue in partnership with the companies of the National Freight Corporation in Britain as a second marketing and through-forwarding organisation using the ships and terminals of British Rail and B &amp; I or other nationalised shipping companies as appropriate.  The ships will be open to other through-forwarding operators and marketers of containers at the same standard rates. This arrangement, which is expected to be acceptable to the British partners, will ensure the most economic utilisation of the heavy investment in ships and terminals by British Rail and B &amp; I while avoiding monopoly and keeping rates at the lowest economic levels.</P>
    <P>The proposed agreements and arrangements I have outlined should ensure the provision of satisfactory services at low cost for years to come while safeguarding the heavy public investment in the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>I took advantage of the availability of McKinseys to ask them to examine and report also on the financial structure and capital requirements of the B &amp; I.  They reported to me that the company is in need of extra capital; <Col N="482" /> that too high a proportion of its existing capital is in the form of loans, the servicing of which causes an undue burden and that additional equity capital to meet the company's immediate financial needs should be provided by the State.  McKinseys consider that if this capital was made available, and provided rationalisation was agreed with British Rail and was speedily implemented, the company would be in a more favourable position to operate successfully on a commercial and competitive basis.  They assessed the need for new equity capital at £3 million. This would be required principally to meet the B &amp; I share of the cost of the new container terminal at Dublin, the cost of containers and other equipment and the buying out of the Coast Lines agreement.  McKinseys confirmed the B &amp; I viewpoint that the existing agency agreement with Coast Lines is now an anomaly.  The agency concept had become outmoded because of the company's vigorous marketing by their own personnel in Britain of a door-to-door service and because of the changeover from conventional vessels to car ferries and unit-load ships.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I in co-operation with the Holland/America Line inaugurated a twice-weekly container service at the end of April, 1971, linking the ports of Cork and Dublin with Rotterdam and Le Havre.  This co-operation between the two companies offers a comprehensive door-to-door container service to and from the mainland of Europe.  The service should prove a valuable asset to this country's continental trade especially now that we may be on the threshold of entry to EEC.</P>
    <P>While this Bill provides for the contribution of up to £3 million by the Minister for Finance for shares in the B &amp; I it is not contemplated that this new investment should be made all at once.  In present financial circumstances it is not foreseen that more than a part of the equity required can be made available in the coming financial year.  The B &amp; I may, therefore, have to increase its borrowing for the time being and for this reason the Bill also provides that the Minister for Finance should be authorised to guarantee borrowings by the company.  I should <Col N="483" /> emphasise that the company has received no subsidies and no subsidy is provided for in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Since 1965 the whole structure of the company has been transformed.  The company now provides a fully integrated shipping and marketing service. Their passenger services have been remodelled by the introduction of three modern car-ferries signifying the company's new role in passenger transport and their full commitment to the development of tourism.  These vessels also enable the company to cater for the growing roll-on/roll-off freight traffic.  From the carriage of conventional loose-stow freight in obsolete vessels, the B &amp; I have developed to the position of offering through their marketing organisation a door-to-door unit-load service using cellular ships, automated terminals and freightliner trains.  Through their agency agreements with foreign container operators they can offer service not alone to Britain and the continent but to North America and Australia.  Mass-movement sea operations, coupled with an efficient inland network have produced improved services and operational economies for the company, the benefits of which continue to be passed on to shippers.</P>
    <P>It may be said that these achievements during the company's early development stage have not so far provided commercial profits.  However, the company's investments have now begun to pay off; the company made a profit in 1970.  It must also be realised in retrospect that the company were faced with an impossible task when they attempted to undertake so vast a programme of capital investment on borrowing alone in the face of rising costs, rapid changes in the commercial environment and a number of unforeseen difficulties which involved them in heavy losses.  I think it is enough to point out that when the company commenced operations in 1965 their fixed assets were valued at £1.2 million. At the end of 1970 they were valued at £8 million.  Moreover, as I have explained, these changes brought about great benefit to the community and to shippers.  Whereas the average sea freight realisation per ton of cargo <Col N="484" /> through the Port of Dublin to the B &amp; I in 1966 amounted to 102s 7d, in 1970 it amounted to 85s despite the inflationary increase in cost since then.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill to the House and I hope Senators will join with me in congratulating the board, management and staff of the B &amp; I on the progress they have made since the newly purchased company was entrusted to their care by the Oireachtas in 1965.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that every Member of the House would join with the Minister in congratulating the board, management and staff of the B &amp; I for the quite spectacular job which they have done since this organisation became a State-sponsored body in 1965.  They, at that stage, took over what was a relatively outmoded and out-of-date shipping line and in the five or six years which elapsed have managed to transform it into what is a relatively modern and worthwhile operating body employing modern techniques and modern equipment and methods.  They are, I think, in the light of the unsettled labour relations which obtain in so many parts of our economy, to be especially congratulated in their relative success in the changeover to containerisation and the redundancy payments which they have made to the dockers who were affected by this change.</P>
      <P>The personnel of the B &amp; I have been successful in a relatively short space of time in achieving for the company a completely new look and one which could well be passed on to many of our State-sponsored bodies if they are to gird themselves for the eventual challenge which must come with entry into the EEC.  It can be fairly said that the people employed in this organisation have been setting their sights on this target and have realised the economies of sea freight and the difficulties contained therein.  I suggest to the House that that has applied, not just at the level of senior management, but right down the line to the lowest operative in the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the arrangement with Coast Lines Ltd., in 1965, whereby the Government purchased the wholly-owned subsidiary of Coast <Col N="485" /> Lines, the British &amp; Irish Steampacket Company.  One distressing feature of that initial step seems to me to be the drastic over-estimate, in book value, of the ships which were the property of the company at that time. I do not think the Minister, in his fairly comprehensive brief, went in any detail into the fact that apparently the book value, which was the value paid for by the taxpayers, of the ships, turned out to be 100 per cent more than they realised when they were sold. This, to me, is the one really distressing feature of the history of the B &amp; I so far.  Perhaps this should not be laid at the door of the B &amp; I Steampacket Company.</P>
    <P>In that context it is fair to refer to the fact that in relation to semi-State or State-sponsored organisations or bodies, the availability of accounts and the opportunities for Members of the Oireachtas to assess their financial performance is still less than satisfactory. While we have been given a fair amount of information and financial figures in this particular case, there is still uneasiness among Members of the Oireachtas that they have not got a full and detailed account of the financial operations and standing of State-sponsored bodies generally.</P>
    <P>From the figures the Minister has given us it would appear that the financial operations of the British and Irish Steampacket Company have, despite their very heavy capital expenditure, been quite impressive.  The figure of fixed assets rose from £1.2 million in 1966 to £8 million in 1970.  This was probably the best single figure produced by the Minister in relation to this organisation, because we must take into account the fact that the £8 million of fixed assets now relates to modern equipment, plant and operations, whereas the figure of £1.2 million in 1966 referred to equipment which was antiquated and not geared to the rapidly changing operation of similar companies throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The figure of capital employed, rising from £2¼ million in 1966 to some £8¾ million in 1970, is also impressive. This, linked with the fact that the turnover of the company has almost doubled and that in 1970, for the first <Col N="486" /> time, they showed a profit, even though a small one, indicates that all goes fairly well for this State-sponsored body.  It would be less than correct, Sir, in any discussion concerning the B &amp; I and their operations if one did not refer in passing to their link with the tourist industry and the fact that it is providing an integrated essential service for this industry.  The Minister knows my views on the tourist industry and the fact that the British market is the single most lucrative market for this country and the one least tapped by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I do not see what is wrong with an organisation like the B &amp; I, working either in conjunction with, or, if necessary, independently of, Bord Fáilte, endeavouring to develop increased markets for their car ferry services in Britain.  I understand that in the past few months, this organisation have offered an attractive package deal arrangement in this connection. It is unfortunate that there is not more co-operation on the part of Bord Fáilte with the shipping company in an effort to encourage this type of trade.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will deal with the suggestion that there should be a fairly intensive direct, rather than indirect, advertising campaign aimed at the British market, explaining to the potential customers there the ready availability of the car ferry services being provided by the company and of the services being provided by Aer Lingus from some of the cities in Britain, the fact that this part of the country was one which was readily accessible from most parts of the British midlands, and that attractive rates could be offered by either the B &amp; I or Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>This is an essential part of the B &amp; I operation and one which will have to be complemented by support from Bord Fáilte.  I would suggest to the House a vigorous policy of direct advertising rather than the workshop type of arrangement which Bord Fáilte have been providing in Britain.  The type of person who comes to this country on holiday on the B &amp; I car ferry is likely to be the middle aged, middle-class type, who for the remainder of the year watches television or reads for his amusement.  If the B &amp; I, and <Col N="487" /> consequently the country and Bord Fáilte are to benefit, such people will have to know of our existence.  Again I stress to the Minister the best way to do this is by direct advertising on the television and the mass media generally in Britain rather than by the indirect approach through a travel agent.</P>
    <P>The one distressing point about the car ferry operation is that while the figures have continued to rise from a nil figure in 1967 to 24 per cent in 1969, the fall off in the increase for 1970 is a very pronounced one resulting in a final increase of only 3.2 per cent.  I do not think that the B &amp; I should be held responsible for this. There are various reasons involved, which we have all heard very often, and there is no point in repeating them now.  However, it is my firm belief that this fall-off is partly attributable to the lack of sufficient direct advertising in the British market.  The more attractive rates which can be offered on the car ferry from, say, Dover to Calais, than on the ferries to this country, must also be one of the factors which influences the British tourist in deciding to go to continental Europe rather than come here.  There is also the fact that on the ferries travelling between Britain and continental Europe there are many incentives by way of duty-free cigarettes and drink, and purchases generally, which are not available between this country and Britain.  It might be well worth while for the Minister to examine the possibility of providing duty-free facilities and concessions on the car ferry routes and on the Aer Lingus routes between Britain and Ireland.  It is just a small point but it is one of the factors that influence holiday makers in deciding which way to travel.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt in fairly great detail with the concern of the livestock trade about the continuing availability of Birkenhead as a port of entry for Irish cattle into Britain.  I understand that the recently established consortium between British Rail, the B &amp; I and the Livestock Exporters' Association has still some small difficulties to iron out before it begins to operate completely successfully.  The <Col N="488" /> two main carriers, together with the representative organisation of the exporters, have got together in one organisation, and this augurs well for the success of our export of cattle to Britain.  The Minister is correct in saying that the continued availability of Birkenhead is not something which can be decided by anybody in this country; it is the responsibility of the Mersey Dock Board.  However, there is a certain amount of pressure and representation which can be made by organisations here which have traditionally supported Birkenhead and put a lot of money into the port of Birkenhead and greatly increased its turnover.  I urge the Minister and the B &amp; I to make every effort to ensure that sufficient points of entry are made available at all times for Irish cattle into Britain.</P>
    <P>I have some degree of understanding as to why the Minister should have decided to employ the firm of McKinsey to carry out the survey into the activities of the B &amp; I.  They had previously done a survey for British Rail and I suppose they were the most obvious people.  However, I should like to take this opportunity to say how apprehensive I am to discover, of late, that foreign-based management consultancy firms seem to be the only ones considered by the Government to be suitable and competent to make reports on Irish public bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to show the line of progression between McKinseys being employed as consultants to the health boards and now being employed as consultants in the local government service, and then being employed as consultants to advise on the B &amp; I company.  I wonder if there is no equivalent company in this country, using Irish personnel and Irish expertise, employing whatever profits or fees that they were paid in helping the economy of the country, rather than at all times having to go abroad to employ a team of consultants, however admirable the consultants may be. Anybody who has read the <i>Sunday Times,</i> and various other publications in Britain in the last few months, might have serious doubts about the merits and the advice rendered by this same firm of McKinsey and Co.  They have had spectacular successes, but I would suggest to the House that their efforts in the other direction have been just as spectacular.  We all remember another American firm of management consultants who operated on a very large scale in this city for a year or two.  There are some firms in Dublin who still remember their operations to their cost.  In this particular case I can <Col N="490" /> see why the Minister felt obliged to employ McKinsey, following their having being employed by British Rail.</P>
      <P>I have to agree having looked at the figures of the B &amp; I that the B &amp; I were definitely and urgently in need of additional capital.  It was obviously an unhappy situation where two-thirds of the company's capital was being provided at that time by way of loan.  The purpose of this Bill is to correct that situation.  For that reason it is one which would be welcomed by all sides in the House.</P>
      <P>Just before I close, I should very much like to congratulate the company on their recent link-up with the Holland-America Line and again to refer to the fact that this is a vital agreement to have been concluded at this time, because it opens up to us not just short-haul routes, which the company were operating at that time, but virtually the whole of the international shipping market.  At this time, in 1971, with our EEC negotiations at such a crucial and critical point, to have this connection with the ports and routes established by the Holland-America Line is a very vital one for us.  It also helps very much in the on/off truck and transport services, which are becoming so common and popular throughout the world.  The company again are to be congratulated in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, one of the main consolations that can be taken from the Minister's speech here today and in the other House a few weeks ago is that there is an urgent need in this country for the development and a clear definition of a national transport policy, so that B &amp; I, CIE, Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte and everybody else associated either directly or indirectly with transport and transport services will know where they are going, what they have to provide, how they are supposed to provide it, the way in which the Government expect them to do it, to what level, by when and at what cost.  The time is long overdue when the relevant Minister should enunciate clearly a national transport policy.  We have the relevant Minister here today.  Perhaps it would be too much to hope that he will clearly enunciate a national <Col N="491" /> transport policy in his reply?  Let us then appeal to him to do so some time in the near future.  In the meantime the board of this company and its management and staff deserve the congratulations of this House on their very definite achievement in having revolutionised the company in the course of the last five years.  If some others of the semi-State or State-sponsored organisations could emulate that achievement the economy of the country would be in a better position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to compliment the Minister on his comprehensive speech on this Bill and on his outline of the transport situation generally in relation to cross-Channel services between Dublin, Liverpool and Birkenhead.  The proposals in the Bill are well worthy of support, as is the British and Irish Steampacket Company.  It would be true to say that the State came into this business just in time.  If one is to judge by newspaper reports of imminent agreement on the European Economic Community, rationalisation of our transport and freight services to Britain is becoming even more essential.  Leaving aside any views one might have about foreign consultants the use of the particular firm, McKinseys, in view of their co-operation with British Rail and that the firm were also employed by the European Railways Consortium, is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The co-operation and rationalisation with British Rail are very necessary since none of us would welcome anything in the nature of a price war with a national service of another country. Along with Senator Boland I should like to express appreciation of the co-operation which the B &amp; I company are giving to the tourist effort.  Anyone listening to the account given by the Minister of the startling increase in the number of cars being brought into this country will appreciate what this company have been doing over the past few years.  They are also giving considerable co-operation in the servicing of tourists in so far as the Dublin region is concerned.  They are also a <Col N="492" /> member of the Dublin regional tourist association.</P>
    <P>Some word of appreciation might also be expressed to Mr. Con Murphy and those who assisted him in drafting the Murphy Report.  It has helped to ease the situation, of which we were all aware, in relation to the Dublin dockers.</P>
    <P>I should like to support another point made by Senator Boland relating to the question of duty-free facilities. I have seen reports of resistance on the other side of the channel to this.  It is a proposal that has been put forward by the regional tourist organisation and Bord Fáilte.  Anybody looking at the situation from the point of view of competition in tourism must see that this country is at a great disadvantage, assuming that people either smoke or drink, <i>vis-à-vis</i> either France or Spain.  It may not be important to people who are not interested in these things, but people going on holiday seem to get great satisfaction from being able to buy a bottle of spirits or a couple of hundred cigarettes without having to pay tax.</P>
    <P>We have been making representations on this, as the Minister is probably aware of.  I should like the Minister to renew the pressure for change and if anybody in this House has anything to say that would help the Minister I should like to hear it said.  We have a lot of serious competition in tourism.  We have a situation where there has been considerable escalation in prices of one kind or another.  We are not competitive in our drink prices compared to cross-Channel prices due to higher rates and higher taxes.  If something can be done to introduce duty-free facilities for visitors to Ireland it would be a boost to tourism.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and compliment the British and Irish Steampacket Company on the very good work they have been doing over the past couple of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill principally for the purpose of asking the Minister some questions arising out of his speech.  I am a little bit disturbed at <Col N="493" /> some of the matters which have been referred to by the Minister.  I think we would all join with Senator Boland in the complimentary remarks which he has made regarding the work of the B &amp; I and the improvements made by the board of management.  The Minister began his speech by referring to the fact that the purchase price of £3,600,000 in 1965 was based on evaluation of the assets without making any allowance for goodwill.  Further on he referred to the fact that when the company commenced operations in 1965 their fixed assets were valued at £1.2 million.  I want some explanation of those two figures&mdash;one mentioned at the beginning of the Minister's speech and the other mentioned at the end of his speech.  I am sure there is an explanation, but it is not self evident if a purchase price of £3,600,000 was fixed without having regard to goodwill.  That would seem to indicate that the purchase price was fixed on the basis of a valuation of fixed assets or liquid assets, principally fixed assets, at that figure at the time of purchase. However, we find that the fixed assets were only £1.2 million according to the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter that disturbs me about the&mdash;I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; because it would seem to imply something sinister and I know that was not the Minister's intention nor is it mine&mdash;Minister's speech is the discovery that two bodies operating under the auspices of his Department, CIE and the B &amp; I, should find themselves with a conflict of interests.  The Minister mentioned in the course of his speech the link-up between CIE and a competitor of the B &amp; I as regards container traffic.  Both CIE and the B &amp; I are operating&mdash;I am using that word loosely&mdash;under the auspices of the Minister and his Department and it would seem to be one of the foremost points of transport policy for the Minister to ensure that that kind of situation would not arise.  If there was going to be a tie-up as regards container traffic by CIE it should be with the B &amp; I.  It seems to me from the Minister's speech that that situation is approaching but I do not know how long the other situation has continued. <Col N="494" /> Obviously, it was a situation which was disturbing to CIE.</P>
    <P>The third matter on which I should like the Minister to give some explanation, which would reassure me and possibly other Members of the House, is in connection with the agreement with and undertaking given to Coast Lines when B &amp; I were being acquired in 1965.  The Minister makes it quite clear at the outset of his speech that two things were done in a positive way when B &amp; I were being acquired by the Government.  Firstly, it was stipulated and apparently carried through that there should be an agreement whereby Coast Lines were appointed as agents in Britain for B &amp; I for a period of 20 years.  The Minister mentioned that that was one of the stipulations and no doubt it was done.  Secondly, it was necessary for the Government at that time to give a written undertaking that B &amp; I would operate their business on strictly commercial lines as a self-supporting commercial entity without special measures.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, and I have no doubt this applies generally to Members of this House and the other House, I want to see any agreement entered into by the Government, whether it be with another country or with a commercial concern, fully implemented. I do not wish to see such an agreement interfered with unilaterally by our Government if the agreement is disadvantageous to us or to the particular interest, in this instance the B &amp; I, with which the Government are concerned.  In such a case it is a matter for the Government to renegotiate the agreement and secure better and more favourable terms.  I would like to be reassured that has been done on this occasion because it does not appear, from the Minister's speech, to have been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated, quite fairly, that it was necessary for the Government to give a written undertaking that B &amp; I would operate on strictly commercial lines as a self-supporting commercial entity without special measures.  He points out that, under this Bill, B &amp; I are not receiving subsidies and have not received subsidies. I agree with that but I could not agree&mdash;and I do not think any of us <Col N="495" /> could agree&mdash;that this Bill does not constitute a special measure of assistfor the B &amp; I.  If the taxpayer, via the Government, are buying in to the extent of £3 million in equity of B &amp; I, it seems to me that that is a special measure of assistance and we should regard it as such.  I should like to be assured that that is not in breach, even by implication, of the undertaking given by the Government when they acquired B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>As regards the agreement appointing Coast Lines as agent in Britain for B &amp; I for a 20 year period, I should like to have the Minister's assurance that this will not be unilaterally disregarded by us or by B &amp; I but that the matter will be negotiated with Coast Lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may agree with me but it does not seem to be evident from his opening remarks because he reflected the view of B &amp; I that the agency agreement was now an anomaly and pointed out that that view was supported by McKinsey.  He seemed to stop short of saying that it was being renegotiated.  If it is that is all I want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to see a situation arising where we would unilaterally disregard an agreement of that kind even if it transpired that it was not to our advantage or to the advantage of B &amp; I.  I should like the Minister to deal with those points when concluding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very few observations to make because this is a sphere of activity of which, I regret to say, I know very little.  The only thing that brought this company to my notice some time ago was the fact that the cattle freight rate shot up by 25 or 26 per cent.  What I find most confusing about this Bill is that we appear to have more than one Irish semi-State ship-owning organisation.  It is quite evident from the Minister's speech that even CIE, which one might say have the monopoly of transport in certain <Col N="496" /> sections in our country, do not appear to be able to fall in with B &amp; I.  Perhaps there is more room for co-operation here.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to know how much subsidisation we can have in this country. I regret that those of us who are not very conversant with this business did not have an opportunity of ascertaining exactly what the company propose to do with this extra £3 million.  It is worthy of note that, on each occasion when Aer Lingus sought an increase in capital for their company, they afforded Members of the Oireachtas an opportunity of seeing exactly what they were doing with their money.  This was a great help to enable Members of the Oireachtas to understand the problems and see them in a different light.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company they, some years ago, did likewise.  This is a type of operation I personally like, and I am not referring now to the fringe benefits&mdash;I wear an assortment of pins of one kind or another.  It is much easier for a person like me to understand the difficulties and problems.  I have never been on a ship, so I do not know what the whole thing is about. But I do know that since B &amp; I became State-owned the cattle freight rates have shot up dramatically.  This is an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
      <P>Despite the Minister's assurance here, there are people who are not happy that there is a long term guarantee that there will be facilities available for the cross-Channel shipment of Irish cattle in the years ahead.  The Minister touched on this in his speech but nevertheless there is still room, I regret to say, for doubt.  We have, of course, on the other hand, the growing trade in the export of meat via container traffic.  Again, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries curtailed the issuing of licences for meat factories. Nevertheless, this is a line of agricultural exports which is expanding. Perhaps it may offset the problem in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister for Transport and Power should be able to insist that organisations under his Department, CIE, B &amp; I, Irish Shipping and others should have complete co-operation between one another and that the <Col N="497" /> public should get the cheapest and most economic service possible?</P>
    <P>I should also like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister, from a tourist point of view, whether boat trains should wait for the boats to come in during the tourist season. Occasionally there is a tragedy or something at sea which delays a boat. The trains do not wait and this causes grave upset for the tourists.  It is the country people, people who are destined for the western or midland regions of the tourist areas, that are suffering all the time.  It is all right for the people in the east.  Once the boat docks and they are landed they have no problem.</P>
    <P>We in the midland and western tourist regions are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  Surely a big organisation such as CIE, with their first cousins in the B &amp; I, should be able to get together and arrange some sort of service?  The Irish public certainly have an extraordinary capacity for enduring inconvenience caused by a host of different things.  I expect that one of these days there will be a breaking point.  I would look on it as being the job of the Minister for Transport and Power to see that these semi-State organisations, who, whether we like it or not, are being helped by the taxpayers, should put on a service to suit the people.  There is no point in having a train running tomorrow&mdash;one should run today as well.</P>
    <P>I find that, if I opt to travel to Dublin by CIE on a train and if I take a bus from Abbeyleix, where once there was a railway line, it can happen that the train might just have pulled out or you might have to dash the last 50 or 60 yards across the footbridge. It is a good thing to have trains running on time; but nevertheless in the tourist season, while we do not want to get back to the West Clare Railway type of operation, there should be some flexibility to facilitate passengers. We have not that many services running that you can say the next train is coming in so many minutes later.  This is something I should like to see exercising the Minister's mind at some stage.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Boland's idea of <Col N="498" /> introducing duty-free concessions on the cross-Channel routes.  I do not see any great difficulty with Aer Lingus. It would not affect me as a traveller because I neither smoke nor drink. Nevertheless, we are pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.  It might be a help to inveigle some of these wouldbe tourists if we even got them half way at the cheaper rate and let them get a hell of a shock when they dock. The State have nothing to lose on a venture such as this.  The Minister with his colleagues should seriously consider this suggestion made by Senator Boland.</P>
    <P>I regret we did not get an opportunity of seeing this operation first hand.  Nevertheless, the figures, as outlined, are quite good and we wish the company every success.  As they are now semi-State their job is to give the Irish people the very best possible service at the most efficient and cheapest rate.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one point about the McKinsey people.  I have absolutely no faith in these international consultants.  I know nothing about McKinsey but the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries employed Jones and Davies or Davies and Jones after their scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

B &amp; I have not given me an opportunity to see firsthand what they are doing and all I know about them is what the Minister has said here in his speech.  He told us that he had some firm of consultants looking at the company, consultants who also examined <Col N="500" /> their English counterparts.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries did exactly the same.</P>

      <P>The point I was making is that it has often been found that these foreign people may not always have the right idea of what way we can improve our services over here. I do not wish to persist, but in another Department the report was out-of-date in Britain when it was submitted here. Therefore, I look rather suspiciously on the Minister's present advisers.  I do not wish to pursue this matter any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the occasions where we can welcome the Bill and welcome the progress reported by the Minister in a very comprehensive Second Reading speech. I share with Senator McDonald and others a feeling of the inadequacy of the information that we have generally on such operations due to the inadequacy of our parliamentary system where we have not got adequate committees to deal with this.</P>
      <P>The case made for the B &amp; I seemed to be quite reasonable in every way. The record of progress is quite encouraging. However, the fact is that we are asked to vote an additional £3 million and we are just devoting a couple of hours in an afternoon session to it. A matter such as this should have been preceded, if at all possible, by some type of parliamentary committee that would have looked into it.  In that way we would have an opportunity of having a more detailed and closer examination of the facts and figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister glossed over very lightly in his speech the abandonment of Cork by the B &amp; I and the great volume of criticism that was stirred up two years ago when the decision by the B &amp; I at that stage to transfer most <Col N="501" /> of their operations to Dublin was announced.  It is a pity that it was not possible to stay that.  We regret that the headquarters and general staff of yet another company are making a major contribution in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you are, but you could do it a bit more.  I am not speaking directly for Cork but I am looking at the Government's policy for decentralisation and saying that we pay wonderful lip service to it at election time, but in practical application there is always a good economic reason why it cannot be done.  I think the present development of B &amp; I illustrates that.  There is also the difficulty implied here between B &amp; I and CIE and a suggestion of difficulties of overlapping arrangements and so on with regard to marketing investigations and likewise.  Again this highlights the necessity to face up to some proper parliamentary committees for the coordination of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald was inclined to suggest that this is all the responsibility of the Minister.  The Minister himself would deny that he had this real responsibility.  With nobody having responsibility we find that State-sponsored bodies, under the obligation of operating on strictly commercial terms, are very often forced to do things that are not in the general national interest. It is high time we had some type of a co-ordinating committee of the Oireachtas to ensure that at all stages the overall national advantage is borne in mind and that the State-sponsored companies have to operate within that framework.  We are not satisfied with the situation as it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House, but I have a few queries. The Minister speaks here of a written guarantee given to Coast Lines Ltd. that B &amp; I will operate their business on strictly commercial lines.  I was not aware, when the Bill was passing through the House in 1965, that there was any question of a written guarantee being given.  At that time we felt we were paying more than sufficient for Coast Lines Ltd. which at that period <Col N="502" /> were on the downgrade.  I do not think Seanad Éireann were aware there was any question of a written guarantee being given.  Indeed, on the question of the company having to operate on strictly commercial lines, we have heard this many times before in connection with semi-State enterprises.  We always find some years later that that could not be quite achieved, and there has to be some subsidy or some subvention or other given to get around it.  Therefore, I question how the Government could have given a written guarantee that was really binding at that period.</P>
    <P>On the question of the transport of cattle, I wonder whether that it is as satisfactory as the Minister's statement would lead us to believe.  I see my colleague here from the cattle trade who will, no doubt, have something to say on that.  It seems the increase in rates for the transport of cattle to England has risen out of all proportion in recent years and represents almost a levy on the cattle trade.  Why is this the case and could the Minister give any justification for these recent increases?</P>
    <P>I suppose the consortium with British Rail is necessary seeing we have to use all the facilities at the other side.  This may be a way of introducing some stability into the trade in the future. I hope the real stability that will be introduced into the transport of live cattle from this country will be that there will be proper processing, that they will no longer be transported from here, that the transport of live cattle will become an unhappy memory of our undeveloped past.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions the taking up of three million additional shares.  I should like to know what return the Minister expects on these shares and what return has the Minister got on the shares he already holds in this company, over the past few years.</P>
    <P>With those observations I can welcome the Bill.  I do not share Senator McDonald's complete distrust of all those concerns.  We have to look at their reports critically, and, if we combine their knowledge of situations elsewhere, we get a critical appraisal of what they recommend and we will be <Col N="503" /> using their services in the proper manner.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say very much at this Stage.  I was not here for the Minister's opening statement and I have not studied it. Having been abroad, I have not studied the Bill.  I do not agree with Senator Quinlan's death wish on the livestock trade.  I, as a nominee of the Irish Livestock Exporters' and Traders' Association, should not like to see the end of the export of live cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall see.  I hope it does not come true.  We have had many meetings during the past 12 or 18 months about the B &amp; I, Birkenhead and other matters.  I give the Minister credit for co-operating in every way with the cattle trade.  He appointed two nominees on the consortium and in other respects he has given his full co-operation.  The Minister is well aware of what may happen to the Irish livestock trade if Birkenhead is closed.  This is the big danger.  I agree with Senator Quinlan's comments about setting up a committee from the Oireachtas for these semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>In 1965 the then Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, introduced the first Bill and the livestock traders thought it was the best thing that ever happened to the livestock trade.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be the reverse.  However, the present Minister is endeavouring to rectify this by setting up the consortium. It is too soon to pass comment on this as they have been in operation for only six months.  I know from experience that Heysham is not working out to be a successful port.  The people who are operating into Birkenhead are obviously making a success of it.  We in the cattle trade would be satisfied if the B &amp; I opted out of Heysham and had the two alternative ports of Holyhead and Birkenhead for the consortium to operate into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the newspapers recently that it is likely the Menai Bridge will not be in operation until the end of <Col N="504" /> the year.  That has nothing to do with this Bill.  I am just mentioning it with regard to Birkenhead.  I will have more to say on the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I always welcome the Minister for Transport and Power. Since I joined the Seanad he has brought in some liberal and important legislation dealing with transport and power.  He has to tread the difficult path between asking the Oireachtas for State subsidies or capital grants for State bodies and semi-State companies and of trying to claim, at the same time, that they are now out of the red and making profits and that from now on all will be well.  It is a difficult thing to do and my basic philosophy is that State bodies such as CIE will have to get continuing capital grants and subsidies.  We must have our services and we have to pay for them.</P>
      <P>I should like to look at this Bill from another point of view.  I should like to make some criticisms of the company involved and the effect they have on some of their competitors.  I should like to make some criticisms of the Department and I hope these will be accepted, as I mean them to be, as constructive criticisms put forward in the very best spirit.  The B &amp; I are a company which have not quite the same standing as other State companies.  When they became a semi-State company in 1965 they were not in a monopoly position. There were various other Irish shipping companies&mdash;I am specifically interested in the Irish coastal shipping companies &mdash;with whom they were in competition.</P>
      <P>I should like to look at the Bill from points of view of some of the competitors of the B &amp; I and also some of the users of the B &amp; I facilities.  I have a few penalty shots for the Minister, at the same time remembering the historic occasion when he turned them all past the post in Croke Park recently. Perhaps some of these shots will go over his head and reach officials of his Department and, maybe, even get as far as the board of B &amp; I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I begin making criticisms, I should like to say that it is evident to all that the company displayed remarkable <Col N="505" /> dynamism.  A completely new look has taken over in Irish shipping activities as a result of B &amp; I's operations in cross-Channel shipping, and I wish to join with the congratulations of the other Senators to the board of B &amp; I for having made such a thorough and powerful job of the company to which they were appointed in 1965 when the Government took over.  However, the dynamism which this company possess at the moment can react adversely on competitors and a State company of this type have, first of all, to maximise their profitability. At the same time they must not knock out competing private enterprise.  One of the functions of a company of this type should be to encourage Irish firms. In other words, wherever they can, they should buy Irish.</P>
    <P>I should like to talk about the freight side of B &amp; I operations of which we have a very comprehensive review in the Minister's Second Reading speech. Last Monday I was privileged to attend the launching by the Minister's wife of the new B &amp; I cargo vessel, <i>Wicklow.</i> The fact that the launching took place in the Verolme Dockyards, Cork, by Irish labour and that the vessel was built and fitted out by Irish expertise, is a matter of real gratification.  But it is not so satisfactory to learn that at the moment the B &amp; I have four vessels being built by the Upper Clyde Shipyards. There are two reasons for this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping have four vessels being built there?  The B &amp; I have none?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in error there.  There are two points about this: first of all, that they should be built by a foreign company when there is a yard which is making tremendous progress in building some fine ships in Cork; and the second is the obvious problem with the Upper Clyde Shipyards.  We hope that this can be sorted out, but one must say that, whenever possible, these vessels should be built in Ireland.  I <Col N="506" /> know that the B &amp; I have had the <i>Leinster</i> built by Verolme.  The other passenger vessels, the <i>Munster</i> and the <i>Inisfallen,</i> were built abroad, but now that we have a yard and that it is running so well, we should encourage a State company involved in Irish shipping to have their vessels built in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I should like to say something about the competition between the B &amp; I and the coastal traders.  I have not every detail here, but there are several private enterprise firms that operate coastal or tramp shipping in this country.  There are two operating from Greenore and Waterford and these are containerised, so nobody can say that we have not got any modern coastal shipping firms. It is worth recording that the firm operating out of Waterford were the first Irish firm to provide container facilities in Ireland.  It has been extremely successful.  We should remember that sending cargo in Irish ships is, first of all, an invisible export and that sending cargo from Ireland in foreign ships is an invisible import.</P>
      <P>In 1951 it was calculated that £2½ million left the country annually in freight and marine insurance charges on trade with Britain alone.  We could double or treble that figure now and it gives us an idea of the magnitude of the business in which we are dealing. Therefore, on any occasion in which an Irish exporter or an Irish importer can use Irish shipping, he is increasing his country's prosperity.  When he exports or imports by means of foreign-owned ships, he is doing the reverse. We have everything to gain by encouraging our Irish coastal shipping firms.  There are three other firms, two in Arklow, one in Cobh.  Senator Quinlan has pointed out that the B &amp; I send their freight from Cork <i>via</i> train to Dublin and ship to Liverpool. There is now no direct freight service from Cork.  There used to be one, as mentioned by Senator Quinlan. There is a roll-on-roll-off service and there is also a passenger car-ferry service operated by the same ship, but there is no direct sea freight service from Cork to Liverpool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose that some goods are going from Cork to Liverpool.  The most economic way would be to send <Col N="507" /> them directly by boat, and they could be sent by an Irish coastal ship.  However when the coastal shippers see that freight goes to Dublin by CIE, which have a subsidy and capital grants, and then from Dublin to Liverpool by B &amp; I, which are in receipt of considerable State capital, they feel, sometimes justifiably, that they are competing as private Irish shipowners against two State firms in receipt of State subvention.  They are at a considerable disadvantage and feel that the through rates that can be quoted by B &amp; I are less because of the State subvention.</P>
    <P>This is knocking the small coastal traders, and it is something that we should get absolutely clear.  I have been talking to some of the coastal traders. I am indirectly connected with the coastal shipping business.  My family owned a firm that sent barley to Dublin and they always sent it via the Arklow coastal ships.  The Port and Docks Board put an end to the particular port facilities that the coastal ships were using in Dublin, but they proved to be extremely efficient and it was a satisfactory way of transporting Irish goods.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another point, and if I am wrong I should like the Minister to correct me.  B &amp; I have ships on charter from Shelbourne Shipping Company.  This company are Irish crewed but Danish owned and financed, which means that the operating profits from the transportation of the goods go to B &amp; I, but the capital profits on the boats, the major profits, go to Denmark.  I should like to know why, for example, the Irish group of coastal shippers were not asked to do this operation.  It would have involved purchasing container vessels, but it would have been a golden opportunity for the Arklow coastal shippers to take long-term charters.  They could have bought these container vessels, they could have modernised their fleet and then chartered them to B &amp; I.  I want to know from the Minister why a Danish owned and financed company are doing this charter work and why the money is not staying where it should be&mdash;with the Irish shippers.</P>
    <P>To give an idea of the magnitude <Col N="508" /> of the operation, take the port of that fine city, Cork, to which Senator Quinlan has referred.  Through that port 4,600 ships passed last year. Eighty per cent of those ships were less than 1,000 tons so they could be classified as tramp coastal steamers. Our attitude has been wrong because we have tended to look at the Irish Sea as an obstacle.  We are an island race.  We should not look at the Irish Sea as an obstacle but we should be developing our shipping, which B &amp; I are doing.  One of contentions is that this is at the expense of our coastal shippers.  We should be looking for a large Irish coastal shipping trade.  One of the ways of doing it is by getting the Irish State companies to use the coastal shippers for charter work, for transport of goods in every way they can.  Otherwise there is no hope of developing our tramp sea trade.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the regulations of the Department of Transport and Power which affect Irish coastal shipping and which are now out of date and a hindrance to the operations of this coastal fleet.  The regulations which govern Irish coastal shipping are based on UK regulations.  The UK coastal fleet, for one reason or another, has virtually gone out of business. It never recovered from the war. The regulations have stayed the same and our coastal shippers have a terrific handicap compared to their continental competitors who have much more flexible regulations.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister why some of the continental legislation has not been introduced and put into operation here.  Somebody facetiously remarked that it was probably because British legislation is easier to translate into Irish than either Dutch or German.  I do not think this is the case but there is no doubt that our coastal shippers are at a terrific disadvantage in having to adhere to legislation which is out-moded, which is based on British legislation which was based on a fleet which virtually no longer exists.</P>
    <P>The problem of lack of flexibility is the key to the whole problem of shipping legislation.  We are short of flexibility in our regulations.  The Department <Col N="509" /> of Transport and Power's regulations are inflexible.  I should like to give some examples of the difference between our set-up and that of the continentals. Many of the operating costs of a vessel here are calculated on gross registered tonnage.  The crucial figure is 500GRT&mdash;gross registered tons.  An amazing number of the continental vessels are registered at 499.9 tons. This is the figure they give, this is the figure that appears in the books and as far as our ports and docks are concerned it 499 tons.  However, three of these vessels were recently bought by Irish shippers and the registration changed dramatically overnight.  The Dutch registered vessels appearing at 499 tons suddenly jumped up to 506 tons, 622 tons and 547 tons as far as the Department of Transport and Power were concerned.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is not that we should attempt to be dishonest but that our regulations are out-moded and out-of-date.  Take, for example, the classification of ships, which is something of great importance to B &amp; I and to the coastal traders&mdash;the classification between home trading, or essentially short run shipping, and foreign going vessels.  Our legislation, which is based on the British legislation, is geographical.  We say: &ldquo;You are a home trader, therefore you must not operate outside a certain quite confined area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This inhibits our coastal trading a tremendous amount.  An Arklow ship in Belfast recently was offered a cargo to the Canary Islands.  It could not take it because he Canary Islands are outside the limit for the home trading vessels.  There is no such geographical limit on the continental vessels.  Danish and Dutch ships are not controlled geographically but on the size of the boats.  French ships are controlled by the power of the boats which is an equivalent sort of registration.  Our regulations are far too inflexible.</P>
    <P>There are also manning regulations which affect those ships and again we are at considerable disadvantage <i>vis-àvis</i> our continental competitors.  The home trading ships in this country must carry an extra mate and a certified cook in comparison with the continental vessels who are allowed more <Col N="510" /> flexibility.  Flexibility of manning is tremendously important if the labour costs of those vessels are to be cut down.  The labour costs of these vessels hinge on everything today.  It is not so much the capital costs&mdash;the Irish shippers can take the capital costs because they can borrow the money&mdash; but there are returns in this trade provided the labour costs are sufficiently low.</P>
    <P>A complete overhaul of our legislation and our approach to coastal shipping should be made.  We must not allow the Department of Transport and Power to permit the small people to be squeezed out because the B &amp; I are so big.  The B &amp; I people have a lot of pull.  They use it, and good luck to them, but it is our duty as members of the Oireachtas to see that this pull is not used unfairly to give the big boot to small Irish shippers who are doing a valuable job in the coaster shipping trade.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the problem, as the coastal shippers see it, of the subsidies to the State companies and I should like the Department of Transport and Power to take a long hard look at the legislation under which our coastal shipping works, and also to take a look at the fees they charge.  I have got some figures here.  Load line certificate survey fees between 300 and 500 tons in 1949 in respect of those classed as ships by Lloyds were charged £10, while the unclassed ships were charged £22 for their load line certificate.  In 1968 the classed ships were charged £34 while the unclassed ships were charged £124. In 1962 the extension fee for master's certificate was £2; in 1968 it was £16 10s. All these are burdens on our coastal shipping and I should like the Department of Transport and Power to take a more liberal view.  We are going into the Common Market shortly and we will need all the coastal shipping we can get.  Rather than discourage those people in private enterprise, who are earning this country revenue, mostly revenue from outside the country, we should be encouraging them by every means possible.  As one of the shippers said to me: &ldquo;The Department of Transport and Power regulations make <Col N="511" /> our ships so safe that we can hardly go to sea.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are ridiculous compared with continental legislation.  We ought to look at this matter.  I know the Minister has an outward way of looking at such things but the EEC makes this discussion doubly important. When we enter the EEC we will have increased trade with the continent.  We do not want the greater part of this trade to be handled by the Dutch, German and French coastal shipping fleets.  Let it be handled by B &amp; I but let it be handled by the small Irish coastal shippers as well.  They should be encouraged rather than discouraged in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should now like to suggest some matters which the Minister might undertake.  He could revise the tonnage measurement rules.  He could revise the Government regulations governing certificates for foreign-going coasters.  I referred to this as the problem of geographical limitation. There is no limitation on Dutch, German or Danish coasters but there is on our coasters.  Our coasters cannot go outside a very small, closely defined area.  It is a ridiculous regulation and is completely out of date. We have got to get wise to these matters, otherwise we will fall further and further behind in competitiveness when we enter the EEC.</P>
    <P>We should change our taxation policy.  We should do something about our fees, which have escalated from £12 in 1949 to £124 in 1968-69.  We should do something about nautical training for people involved in the shipping industry.  France has a regulation which prohibits cargoes from being carried between French ports on foreign vessels.  Cargoes must be in French-owned and French-manned vessels. We have not got many ports but we have cargoes travelling between them and we should look into the possibility of a similar regulation here.</P>
    <P>We must look into our legislation from a wider point of view.  I should like to encourage the Minister to take a broader and more generous view of the pride of people in coastal shipping. He should not allow them to be <Col N="512" /> squeezed out by giants like the B &amp; I. B &amp; I are a giant put up by the taxpayer and it is our job, as Members of the Oireachtas, to ensure that a fair deal is had by the smaller men. That is my reason for labouring this point.  No other Member in this House or in the other House has raised this point, but I want to raise it very strongly.  It is our duty to ensure that the smaller people get a fair deal.  They are doing an important job.  Let us see that they do not get squeezed out and let us see what we can do to help them.  They are Irish firms and need our help as much as B &amp; I.  B &amp; I have plenty of pull to get the money.  I admit they have a tough job to do, but so have the smaller people.  Let us ensure that they also get help.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to say something about passenger services.  I have good qualifications to make remarks about the B &amp; I passenger services because I spent five years in the UK and travelled by sea in preference to air travel.  I have travelled more than 200 times between Ireland and the UK and virtually all those journeys were by sea. I have travelled with most shipping companies except the small company which operate from Preston.  I should like to add my voice to those of Senators Boland and Brugha in advocating the provision of duty free facilities. It would be of tremendous help to our shipping companies and it would also, of course, help British Rail.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I operate three vessels on the cross-Channel run.  The <i>Leinster</i> and <i>Munster</i> operate between Dublin and Liverpool and the <i>Inisfallen</i> between Cork and Swansea.  The majority of their crossings are overnight but in summer there are daylight crossings.  The first mistake&mdash;and perhaps it was a natural mistake&mdash;that was made was the purchase of two vessels, the <i>Munster</i> and the <i>Inisfallen,</i> which, I think, were built in Germany and were originally designed for a Scandinavian company operating Baltic daylight crossings.  This is very sadly reflected in the facilities offered on those ships.  I took the trouble of checking with some travel agency people before making my personal remarks in this regard.  Those people said: &ldquo;These ships have many fine points.  The B &amp; I have got through <Col N="513" /> rates to the continent.  They have connections with the continent.  They have done a lot to sell their shipping, to sell their travel, to sell their roll-on-roll-off car ferry service, but nothing will make up for the fact that these boats are going on overnight crossings with very few berths.  Nothing will make up for this.&rdquo;  I have got some figures on this and I shall quote them in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>The Cork-Swansea crossing is the longest journey and takes more than nine hours.  The Dublin-Liverpool journey takes about eight hours.  If a person is travelling overnight for eight hours he will want a berth.  However, most people cannot get a berth.  The provision of an aircraft-type recliner seat is a joke.  I hope the Minister will convey that to the company.  Aircraft-type recliner seats with television overhead are provided by the B &amp; I if you are unlucky enough not to get a berth.</P>
    <P>On my last crossing from Liverpool I walked on board the boat and was greeted by six one-armed bandits just inside the ship&mdash;the slot-machine shipping company.  I do not like calling names but I think one-armed bandits are not the things to have in a State shipping company.  They should be thrown overboard or written off, but I suggest we should get rid of the one-armed bandits by any means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the sort of enterprise of which I approve.  I am not sure whether other Members of the House approve of this sort of thing, but I certainly do not approve.  My experience of crossings with B &amp; I have been singularly unhappy.  They have been unhappy because they have been connected with the lack of berth facilities. <Col N="514" /> If we remember that the Dublin-Liverpool crossing is used extensively throughout the winter we can see the necessity for an adequate number of berths.  It is a very good service but it is marred because you may not be able to get a bed.  There are more beds provided in the British Rail services and the crossing is less than half as long.  When you travel by British Rail you reach Holyhead by 1 o'clock after a 3¾ hour journey.  That is quite a difference when compared to the nine-hour crossing to Swansea.</P>
      <P>I shall now quote from a magazine called <i>Which</i> of January, 1970.  They did a survey of cross-Channel shipping from the consumer's point of view.  A relative of mine claims that on a crossing on the old <i>Inisfallen,</i> which I am glad has disappeared, one-third of the passengers travelled first class and had two-thirds of the space and the remaining two-thirds travelled second class on the remaining space. One had to travel second class on the old <i>Inisfallen</i> to realise how rough the going could be.  My relative claimed that he shared a cabin with a greyhound. Apparently a lot of greyhounds travelled on the old <i>Inisfallen</i>.  Whatever about travelling with a greyhound, he was lucky to have a cabin.  The fact is that there are not enough cabins on the present boats.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that this <i>Which</i> survey was written when the new boats were in service.  The B &amp; I Shipping Company, as far as passengers and crew are concerned, come off the worst.  The main reason is because of the lack of berths.  Also the magazine claims that on the Swansea-Cork ship <i>Inisfallen,</i> the maximum number of passengers was 1,200 and the maximum number of berths 256.  The report states that nearly half the passengers could not get exactly the booking they wanted and about one in five found they had booked too late to get a berth.  That gives a fair idea. The survey was by the Consumer Association people.  Many found there was not enough seating and only about one quarter of those who used them found the seats comfortable enough for a night's sleep.  That refers to the aircraft-type recliner seats which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> With regard to the Dublin/Liverpool crossing on the <i>Munster</i> and <i>Leinster,</i> the maximum number of passengers is 1,000 according to the survey.  The <i>Leinster</i> has 256 berths, the same as the <i>Inisfallen,</i> and the <i>Munster</i> has 242 berths.  There are 16 double cabins on the <i>Leinster</i>.  I should have mentioned there are 16 double cabins on the <i>Inisfallen.</i></P>
    <P>Only half of the passengers on whom the Consumer Association had checked got the type of booking they wanted. Some of them were told the cabins were fully booked and when they got there they found they were not.  A third of the passengers found the cabins were too noisy, by far too hot and there were complaints there were not enough toilets.  Over half found the seating too uncomfortable to get a proper rest.  You want pretty comfortable seating to be able to use it for nine hours, from 10 or 11 o'clock at night to 7 o'clock in the morning.  I should like to complain strongly, as a consumer and a passenger using the B &amp; I ferry.</P>
    <P>The roll-on-roll-off service is good, the car ferry service is good but the number of berths is deplorable.  I hope this message gets through and I hope that something can be done about it.  It is a very bad image if such a large number of people had to complain.  B &amp; I have got a tremendous proportion of our tourist trade, but a large proportion of the people are dissatisfied with the facilities on the boats.  I mean my criticisms to be made constructively and regarded as such.  I think it is very important that these points are made clearly and strongly.</P>
    <P>My final penalty shot at the Minister is something I feel very strongly about. It is not unfair in that I made this criticism recently to a member of the B &amp; I board and he said that the particular complaint I had to make had been raised and nothing had been done about it.  If saying it in the House here does something, at least I will have achieved something.  I hope it will put a bit of pressure on it.</P>
    <P>I cycle around Dublin quite a lot and having to come in through the side gate of Trinity College whenever I am <Col N="516" /> coming from the north side, I cycle across Butt Bridge where there is a pretty grim railway bridge which obscures the Custom House from the western side.  There was some talk that the Minister was to wave a magic wand and shift it a few hundred yards down river.  It really would be tremendously useful if that could be done.  I do not know whether it is possible, but that has obscured the view of what is probably the finest building in Dublin, Gandon's Custom House, a really magnificent building but it is impossible to see it from that point.</P>
    <P>When you turn the corner and come round Butt Bridge and go down the quays, as you have to if you are coming up, you have on the north bank the Custom House what should be a magnificent view.  You do not have the railway in the way.  Over on the north quay there are the beautiful blue and cream Guinness boats.  A bit further down the south quay you have got the Irish Lights Ship <i>Granuaile</i> and the other Irish Lights ships, beautiful ships; but completely obscuring the view, virtually the only view of the Custom House from around there, is the good ship <i>Kilkenny</i> which belongs to the B &amp; I&mdash;and through them the Minister &mdash;with its hideous funnels.  It is just a hulk.  It has got this dreadful black and yellow colouring.  It is an absolute eyesore and disgrace berthed right in the centre of Dublin where it has been berthed for more than a year.</P>
    <P>I can quite realise that the B &amp; I company may have trouble in disposing of such a dreadful boat.  Who would want to buy it?  It is terrible. I am glad Senator Brugha is here because as chairman of the regional tourist organisation this will be something near to his heart.  We have seen pictures of Deputies of all parties fishing things out of the Dodder.  Perhaps we could have a big picture of the Minister for Transport and Power tossing the <i>Kilkenny</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The company may have trouble selling this boat, but for goodness' <Col N="517" /> sake move it away from the centre of Dublin.  It is a disgrace.  It is just disgusting.  Each time I pass it, which is about three times a week, I get more worked up.  So I wanted to let off a bit of steam here because it is irresponsible to have an object like that parked right in the centre of the city. I hope the Minister can see very swift action on this point because surely it is not beyond the ability of the B &amp; I to move it off somewhere else where it will be less visible.  Whether they sell it is not my concern, but just move it away from there.</P>
      <P>These are the main points I wanted to make on this Bill.  I hope the fact that I have not spent my time praising the operations of the B &amp; I board have not made my contribution any less worthwhile.  I certainly feel that the B &amp; I board are to be commended on many of their activities and the way they go about things, but it is important for someone in the House to put the other person's point of view. I hope I have somehow or other put the point of view of the competitors, the small coastal traders and also put forward some of the complaints of the users of the B &amp; I passenger service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Seanad for a very constructive debate on this matter.  Senators Boland and Brugha both raised the point which is of very current interest concerning duty-free facilities.  Other Senators, including Senator West, mentioned this aspect also.  As I said in the Dáil, a report has recently come to hand, prepared by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with B &amp; I and Aer Lingus setting out the facts and data in support of granting these facilities.  I am having this report examined at the moment.  There are aspects concerning the Exchequer which have to be balanced before such facilities are granted.  Discussions are proceeding with the other interests in Britian concerning the matter.  I am certainly very attracted by this idea and by the arguments set out in this presentation to me by Bord Fáilte.  I think that particularly as far as the B &amp; I are concerned, where for a long period of hours there are as it were captive customers aboard, the proposition <Col N="518" /> is very attractive.  However, I will be saying more about this when the matter has been fully examined.</P>
      <P>Senator Boland also spoke about the need to enunciate a national transport policy.  This is a matter with which I propose to deal in due course either by way of publication of a White Paper or otherwise; but I do not propose to publish here any such overall policy that would commend itself for the next ten years here until certain negotiations, discussions and examinations which are being made at the present time are concluded.  We have nearly completed the final sharing arrangements that will apply between the B &amp; I and British Railways, and between the B &amp; I and CIE. These rationalisation discussions were prompted by the findings of the McKinsey team of investigators into the whole transport situation, in particular as it affected cross-Channel transportation.  Pending the final result of these discussions it would be premature to announce any such overall policy, but I expect to do so within the next six months.  It is also tied up with a very detailed investigation being carried out by McKinseys at the moment into the whole CIE position and the whole structure of CIE, in particular in regard to the rail services.</P>
      <P>Also, I should like to emphasise that, in this very complex international business, we are concerned with the arrangements that we can work out with transportation companies in other countries, particularly in Britain and also in Europe.  Indeed, complex as the situation is here at home, it is even more complex in Britain where apart from the private interests involved there are six separate State enterprises in transportation.  Once we have these matters ironed out I intend to do what Senator Boland suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins raised the point concerning CIE and B &amp; I.  I agree with the principle of the matter he raised that it is obviously wrong that two State-sponsored organisations should be in any way duplicating each other in regard to their activities.  On this aspect, B &amp; I and CIE, as I indicated in my opening remarks, have now come together on a rationalisation <Col N="519" /> of their activities involving sharing of facilities and sharing of shipping space.  Again, this is tied-up with the situation in Britain where CIE have an arrangement with one of the British State operations, the National Freight Corporation, and B &amp; I are tying-in, as I indicated, with British Rail on rationalisation of terminals and shipping space also.</P>
    <P>However, plans are now reaching fruition and the details will be announced very shortly.  Our plans are reaching fruition in regard to the complete interlocking of CIE, B &amp; I and British Rail and the sharing of their equipment, terminals and shipping space, without taking from their competitiveness. I want to emphasise that.  In any such arrangement in regard to sharing of the facilities there will be complete independence as regards marketing.  This is the principle that we are following so as to ensure that rates are cut to the lowest possible level and that customer and exporter are fully protected.  These organisations will not be in a monopoly position as regards marketing.  There will be independent marketing operations but sharing of existing facilities with consequent substantial saving both in capital and operating costs.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins raised the point about the Coast Lines agreement.  It was part of the agreement in 1965 that Coast Lines operate in an agency capacity for B &amp; I in Britain. McKinseys regard&mdash;and it confirms our own opinion and B &amp; I's strong view too&mdash;this as superfluous and unnecessary having regard to the door-to-door marketing system that B &amp; I have built up.  Now, we feel, is the time to get rid of this agency arrangement which was incorporated in the agreement in 1965.  Negotiations are practically completed as to a price for the discontinuance of this agency arrangement, and one of the purposes of this Bill is to supply the capital that will enable the necessary financial arrangements to be made with Coast Lines.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins also raised the question of the difference between the fixed assets and the assets as purchased. <Col N="520" /> The fixed assets are as the accountant wrote them in the book but the purchase price had to be negotiated, and negotiated hard; and even though the ships that were purchased in that deal had subsequently to be sold at a loss of almost £1 million that was part of the deal and in retrospect the deal was well worthwhile when you regard the tremendous escalation that has taken place since in shipping costs.  To start off with the sort of organisation, equipment and ships which this completely refurbished company now has would be a very costly business indeed.  This points up the foresight of the 1965 decision to get into this business for the protection of the Irish economy and the Irish exporter.  It was a very important, crucial and, in my view, a fundamental decision.  Even though in retrospect you may say that too much was paid for the ships at that time it has been well worth it now when one considers the sort of progress that has been made by B &amp; I, the sort of arrangements that are now being made by them which will guarantee the continuing involvement on the part of the Irish State for the benefit of the Irish exporter and the tourist industry in this important cross-Channel and indeed European and world trade which will now accrue having regard to the link-up that B &amp; I have negotiated with a major world shipping line, the Holland-America Line.</P>

      <P>There was some liquid cash as well at the time.  Then, of course, many of the terminals that were purchased at the time, taken over with the company, were also obsolete or have been rendered obsolete since. That is the explanation of that apparent discrepancy.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald also raised the point about duty-free facilities, with which I have dealt.  He was also critical of the employment of international consultants.  On this aspect I feel very strongly that we must be outward looking, not inward looking.  If we can get the advice of consultants who have already advised major national transportation corporations such as British Railways we should avail of such expertise and the type of information that is at the hands of consultants of this kind.  In this way a lot of research and spade work is saved, time is saved, and you get much quicker recommendations. That is my practical defence of the employment of international consultants of this kind who are <i>au fait</i> with this whole complex matter of transport rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>The important thing is that the ultimate decision resides with the Government and the Minister responsible.  Consultants are useful from the point of highlighting the problem but the ultimate decisions have to be made by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings to mind the point made by Senator Quinlan and touched on by Senator O'Higgins in regard to the coordination of State-sponsored bodies. <Col N="522" /> Senator Quinlan queried the fact that there does not appear to be such coordination. I would regard my function as Minister for Transport and Power, supervising a number of these State-sponsored bodies, as that of the coordinator hired by the taxpayer for that purpose.  The purpose of the Department of Transport and Power is to ensure that there is this required coordination and that there is overall supervision resting in the appropriate Minister acting on behalf of Parliament. This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Senator Prendergast raised the question of the cattle trade.  Again the best situation we could work out in the circumstances was to get together with British Railways to guarantee the future transportation of live cattle for the next five years with the possibility of a re-negotiated agreement for a further five years beyond that&mdash;to guarantee the future in regard to the export of livestock.  This consortium has been on the way for some months and the livestock trade is represented on it and is working well.</P>
    <P>Senator West raised a number of very interesting points, particularly in regard to regulations under the Merchant Shipping Act.  While not strictly relevant to this particular legislation, the points he raised are very much under consideration in my Department at this time.  We have had meetings with the Short Sea Traders' Association about these regulations&mdash; many of which are now obsolete&mdash; relating to tonnage measurements, certificates, etc.  These discussions are continuing between the Short Sea Traders' Association and my Department. As a result of these discussions, merchant shipping amending legislation is now in course of preparation in my Department and I hope to come before the Oireachtas in the near future with such legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator West rightly mentioned that private enterprise will have a continuing and expanding place in freight transportation.  The private firm he mentioned that sails out of Waterford has been a pioneer in the containerisation concept, cross-Channel and to Europe.  They and other private enterprise firms, such as the one operating <Col N="523" /> from Greenore, are very important in the overall interest of the body of the Irish economy in ensuring competitiveness in this field.  This is the paramount objective, to ensure that rates are competitive for the benefit of the exporter. It is becoming more important as we depend for our standard of living, to a growing extent, on exports, particularly in view of our imminent entry into EEC.  As far as Ireland is concerned, having regard to our geographical location, competitiveness in regard to transportation is going to be all important to our expansion in the economic sense.</P>

      <P>This is again commercial business.  Priority is always given to arrangements with Irish firms in these cases, but cost is a factor which must be taken into account. Similarly with regard to the Cork Shipyard.  I would like to emphasise that the Verolme dockyard in Cork gets priority so far as any ships being booked either by Irish Shipping or B &amp; I are concerned.  As far as Irish Shipping are concerned, the welcome fact of the matter is that the Cork shipyard is booked up until 1973 with the present construction and has orders flowing in that will guarantee its total utilisation for years ahead.  They were just not able to do the Irish Shipping boats which were required as a matter of urgency in regard to fleet replacement.</P>

The important thing is that here we have a company in which all the indications are that following a vast capital re-equipment programme, it is now showing a trading profit.  The company now has a completely new fleet, new terminals, automation, a new system of containerisation, with a new concept of door-to-door selling, with emphasis on liner-train utilisation; containerisation as far as rail and road is concerned; with roll-on-roll-off freight facilities available on the car ferry vessels.</P>

I should like to emphasise the word &ldquo;investment&rdquo;.  This is an investment which will be a remunerative investment as far as the community are concerned.  All the indications are that this will be the case.  They now carry 35 per cent of the cross-Channel traffic. By the arrangements that I have mentioned earlier&mdash;the interlocking arrangements proposed in particular with British Rail and with CIE&mdash;it is guaranteeing their continuity in this business in the future.  This is important as far as the Irish community are concerned, that by these arrangements with a huge organisation like British Rail, the B &amp; I are guaranteed for the future, and the State have a stake in this important business that is so vital to our economy.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that this additional equity investment, to a limit of £3 million, can be made by the State and that any borrowings that are required by the company to supplement that equity investment will be also guaranteed by the State.  It is with confidence that I commend the Bill to the Seanad and I wish to thank Senators for their constructive contributions on this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;by&rdquo; in line 11 to the end of the section and substitute &ldquo;deleting the definition of &lsquo;firearm&rsquo; therein and substituting the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;The word &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; means a lethal firearm or other lethal weapon of any description which is capable, or which can be rendered capable, when fired or otherwise operated of discharging any shot, bullet or other missile and, save where the context otherwise requires, includes a component part of a firearm&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are largely alternative amendments.  There is a <Col N="529" /> point in the second one which is not in the first.  It would be appropriate to discuss them together.</P>
    <P>I indicated on the Second Reading that I was not happy with the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; in the 1925 Act and that I thought it would be better to seek to improve on that definition by replacing it in its entirely rather than by adding the words which the Minister proposes to add to the definition in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that the definition under the Act of 1925 is that the word &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; means a lethal firearm or other lethal weapon of any description from which any short, bullet or other missile can be discharged. There is an extension of definition as regards airguns and some other things under the 1964 Act.  The Minister now seeks to extend it further in the Bill as it stands by adding, in section 2, &ldquo;save where the context otherwise requires&rdquo; that the word &ldquo;firearms&rdquo; shall include a component part of a firearm.</P>
    <P>Under the original definition the position was&mdash;and would still continue to be even under the Minister's proposal in section 2 of the Bill&mdash;that the test of whether or not an article is a firearm should be the capability of that article to discharge any shot, bullet or other missile.  That definition obviously gives rise to difficulties.  The Minister will agree that it has, in actual practice, given rise to difficulties in the courts in that if a part of a firearm is even temporarily removed from it so as to render it incapable of being fired then, even though the missing part can be replaced immediately, so long as it is out of the firearm it is no longer a firearm within the definition under the 1925 Act.  It seems to me that the simple way of remedying that situation and of ensuring that the extraction of a particular article from a gun will not be used as a device to get around the definition would be to do something on the lines I have suggested in my amendments, and to define a firearm as being a weapon which is either capable of being fired or can be rendered capable of being fired.</P>
    <P>In my first amendment I am <Col N="530" /> suggesting that a completely new definition of the word &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; should be inserted.  It should read:</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; means a lethal firearm or other lethal weapon of any description which is capable, or which can be rendered capable, when fired or otherwise operated of discharging any shot, bullet or other missile and&mdash;</P>
    <P>Then add that which the Minister wishes to incorporate in section 2</P>
    <P>&mdash;save where the context otherwise requires, includes a component part of a firearm.</P>
    <P>Without patting myself on the back I think that definition would be a vast improvement on the existing definition. It would provide a complete safeguard against the situation which can arise where a person charged with an offence in relation to a firearm can plead that it is not a firearm because a trigger or some other part of it was not actually in it.</P>
    <P>I raised the point on Second Reading with regard to the Minister's choice of the words &ldquo;component part&rdquo;.  The Minister may be quite right.  It may be that the choice of the word &ldquo;component&rdquo; is an appropriate choice to make and an oppropriate word to use. I have some doubts about it because it seems to me that &ldquo;component part&rdquo; may be interpreted as being a part which actually exists in the whole, and that when it is taken out of the whole it cannot be a component part and, if it is in it, it is a component part. But if it is a completely new part that has never been assembled to form part of the whole there might be doubt as to whether or not it would then properly be regarded as a component part.  It is with that in mind and in order to give the Minister an opportunity of considering it that I have also put down as an alternative the second of these amendments, which is the same as the first except that it contains the additional words in the last line: &ldquo;a component part of a firearm whether or not such part ever formed a constituent part of an assembled firearm&rdquo;. I want to make it quite clear that a component part within the meaning that the Minister wants to assign to it in this Bill will be regarded as a component <Col N="531" /> part not merely if it was in a gun and then taken out of it but even if it is a new part that has never been in a fully-assembled gun.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that, while I feel either of these amendments would cover the definition more than adequately and certainly would be a vast improvement on the existing definition, I am naturally not committed to them.  If the Minister accepts the principle of the amendment that the definition of a &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; should be altered so as to safeguard against the kind of situation which has arisen and to remove from the definition as being the test the capability of the firearm to discharge, I would be quite happy to meet the Minister.  I would urge that the Minister might try to accept one or other of these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I grasp the point that Senator O'Higgins is making.  It is a point which I endeavour to cover in section 2.  In other words, it is my amendment to the original definition, as amended.  I submit to the House that my section covers the points that Senator O'Higgins is making.  I am saying this because a component part is proposed in the Bill to be brought within the definition of a firearm.  There is no need to have a separate provision in respect of a weapon which can be rendered capable of discharging a shot.  In accordance with section 2 of the Bill as it stands possession of a part will attract all the penalties of the Act for the unauthorised possession of a complete firearm.  There is no need to provide specifically that a complete but defective firearm will also be within the definition of firearm because it will be within it in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second alternative that Senator O'Higgins proposes is identical with the first except that it goes on to propose that a component part should be within the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; whether or not it ever formed a constituent part of an assembled firearm. I am advised that the words &ldquo;a component part of a firearm&rdquo; constitute a concept &ldquo;at large&rdquo; as opposed to a spare part or an extra part and, accordingly, it is not necessary to have <Col N="532" /> the additional refinement which is in the second alternative proposed by Senator O'Higgins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow that. Is the Minister saying that an additional part would not be a component part?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am saying that the word &ldquo;component&rdquo; as opposed to the word &ldquo;spare&rdquo; or &ldquo;extra&rdquo; or some such word was deliberately used in the drafting of the Bill because the word &ldquo;component&rdquo; is the most all-embracing word and covers all the different concepts of &ldquo;part&rdquo;.  It covers a part on its own; it covers the concept at large; it covers a part that was never part of any assembled firearm and it also covers a part which is a spare part or an extra part.  It covers also the situation which Senator O'Higgins envisages of a firearm which is defective because one part is broken or missing and it cannot be fired.  It covers that case because all the unbroken parts of such a firearm are component parts of a firearm which would come under my definition in section 2.  While I quite appreciate the points that Senator O'Higgins is making I should like to assure him that all those situations or contingencies are covered by my own shorter amendment in section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue with the Minister but may I put this point of view to him?  I may be wrong but it seems to me that the acceptance of the Minister's section 2 as amending the original definition would still leave the definition open to doubt in certain circumstances.  At least it would leave it open to argument and it would be a question then for the courts to resolve the argument whereas I think that either one of my amendments would leave it open neither to doubt nor argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, for this reason: &ldquo;component part&rdquo; is all embracing. The basic situation I wanted to get at in section 2 was to overcome the problem that is created by the inability of the prosecution to prove capability of discharge.</P>

      <P>No, because a man can be charged with having in his possession a component part of a firearm.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In line 11, after &ldquo;hereby amended,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(a)&rdquo; and to add after &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; in lines 13 and 14 the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) by the addition, after the definition of &lsquo;prohibited weapon&rsquo;, of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;the expression &ldquo;prohibited substance&rdquo; means and includes any substance capable of exploding whether or not it may be detonated by the addition or admixture of some other substance and capable on explosion of being dangerous to life or property.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since I put down these amendments, on looking over what I proposed, it seemed to me that I had overlooked the very wide way in which I drafted the first of these amendments.  My view is that, if it were to be useful to the House, it would require a further amendment in such a way as to prevent my suggested amendment No. 3 from being applicable to substances like petrol which is used in cars.  I recognise that, as drafted, my amendment No. 3 would make it an offence or might make it an offence for somebody if amendment No. 6 were applied, to import car petrol or diesel oil or any combustible substance of that kind, the use of which is normally innocuous, into the north of Ireland.  I need not tell the House that that was not my intention. If I have an opportunity I will revise that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to hold up the House or the Minister and if the House will allow me to do so I shall continue on the basis that the amendments are so revised as to take usually innocuous substances out of them; otherwise I shall have to withdraw these and put down further amendments at the Report Stage.  However, if the House has no objection to discussing these amendments on the basis that I acknowledge that, as drafted, amendment <Col N="535" /> No. 3 is too wide, I shall continue.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion we were discussing this Bill the Minister commented on the speeches made from this side.  He was good enough to say that my speech was the only one which he called party political: &ldquo;the only party political speech made here today.&rdquo; I cannot see why the Minister should have chosen to say that about it.  I think I mentioned my party or his party only once and that was for the purpose of pointing out that there was no particular difference between us in regard to our anxiety to preserve peace in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>My criticism of this Bill was that its basic purpose seemed to be to forestall violence in the North and that, as drafted, it would not do very much towards that end.  Why I should be disentitled to make that criticism or why it should be said by the Minister that this is a party political point, I do not know.  What are we here for if it is not to examine, and examine critically, legislation proposed by the Government?</P>
    <P>It seemed to me at the time &mdash; and this is relevant to this subsection&mdash;that this Bill was being introduced for the purpose of impressing the people in the North of Ireland and the people in London.  I still believe that, and nothing that the Minister has said in reply to the Second Stage has persuaded me otherwise.  I do not dispute, and I made it clear on the Second Stage that I did not then dispute, the sincerity of the Government's desire to impress people outside the borders of this State with their anxiety to forestall violence in the North.  All I am saying is that it is not enough to show anxiety; you must back it up by action, and my point on the Second Stage was that this Bill was defective in several respects, in as much as it did not make it likely that its passage into law would have any serious effect on diminishing violence in the North.  I instanced in this regard the absence from the Bill of any reference to explosives other than such explosives as might be comprehended in the definition of &ldquo;ammunition&rdquo;<Col N="536" /> in section 2 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>In replying to the Second Stage the Minister said at column 387, Volume 70, of the Seanad Report of 10th June, 1971:</P>
    <P>That there is on the Order Paper of the Dáil at the moment, having received its First Reading there, the Dangerous Substances Bill, which seeks to modernise certain aspects of the law relating to explosives.... At the same time it is pretty clear and there are very extreme penalties for the unlawful possession of explosives at the moment.  They are a great deal heavier than the existing penalties or even the proposed penalties for the unlawful possession of guns or ammunition.</P>
    <P>I accept all that.  It is not easy for me to deal with the question of the Dangerous Substances Bill, because the Bill has not yet been printed and I have not been able to get sight of it. At the same time while the law relating to explosives, as the Minister rightly says, provides very heavy penalties, my concern is that the same idea lurking behind section 4 of the present Bill should be equally applied to explosives. In other words, the same idea which the Minister explained to the House last week, in regard to making it clear beyond any doubt that having firearms with the intention of endangering life meant life outside as well as inside the Twenty-six Counties, should be applied equally to explosives.</P>
    <P>That was my concern and I do not observe that that concern is shared by the Minister or his Department and that was one of the main planks on which my criticism last day was based, because we all know that the loss of life or injury to property in the Six Counties at the moment is caused not only by bullets but also by explosives. Some of the most tragic cases, and the ones which least differentiate between military and police personnel on the one hand and civilians on the other, are caused by explosives.  Before I will accept that the Government is taking its responsibilities in this regard seriously &mdash; I do not deny that its heart, <Col N="537" /> or that of the leading clique in the Government anyway, is in the right place on this issue&mdash;but, I want to see a provision which is going to make it plain beyond doubt that it is not lawful for some one in this part of the country to have explosives for use in, or to organise the importation of explosives into the North of Ireland, and I want to see explosives put on the same footing as firearms.  It is for that purpose that amendment Nos. 3 and 6 are put down.</P>
    <P>Looking at the 1883 Explosive Substances Act it would seem to me to be clear enough that the &ldquo;unlawful purpose&rdquo; mentioned there in regard to the possession of explosives is fulfilled if one's purpose is to cause an explosion even outside the boundaries of this State.  In that regard I think the Minister is perfectly right in what he said before he quoted the passage from Judge Ryan's direction to the jury in a case in Letterkenny last year. I think he is perfectly right in saying that one would naturally assume that human life and property, in the context of the matter being dealt with in section 4, would be protected by the section whether it was inside or outside our jurisdiction.  For myself, with respect to the judge, that provision would have given me no trouble.  The Minister is right to put the thing beyond all doubt by this section, but if it is being put beyond all doubt by this section, it is equally important that the matter of explosives should be put beyond all doubt by this section, too.  It is equally important that our feeling in this State in regard to explosives and in regard to people who may organise the importation of such substances into the North of Ireland or the importation of firearms there, should be translated into law.  I do not see any sign in this Bill &mdash; possibly the Dangerous Substances Bill which has not yet been made available to Members of either House will contain such a section &mdash; that the Government is meeting its responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>It would have been, I suppose, open to me to promote an amendment of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act so as to put this beyond doubt in that context, but it seemed to me that I probably would be taking this matter <Col N="538" /> too far afield if I were to import into a discussion on this year's Firearms Bill an amendment of an Act passed almost 100 years ago.  It seemed to me that the best way to do this, therefore, was to extend the definition section of the Principal Act by including a defintion of a prohibited substance which, broadly speaking, is a substance which is capable of being exploded.</P>
    <P>When I put that down I overlooked the fact that there are substances which are frequently, indeed usually, used innocuously such as petrol which, of course, can be exploded.  I would have wished to put down an amendment, and still will, if need be, on the Fourth Stage, in order to remove the innocuous substances from this proposed definition.  What I would have suggested would be that the Minister should have power by regulation to exclude from such a definition of &ldquo;prohibited substances&rdquo; substances which are commonly and legitimately used and the exclusion of which could cause no danger.  I would wish that all other explosive substances &mdash; gelignite, dynamite, plastic explosive, things used in quarrying and so forth &mdash; should be treated on exactly the same basis as firearms and ammunition, bombs, grenades, and so on, and that we should make it clear that anyone who possesses them in this part of the country with the intent of causing damage to life or limb or property in the North of Ireland or organises their importation there is equally under the displeasure of the Irish people and incurs the penalties which their Parliament provides.</P>
    <P>The second of the amendments which I have put down, amendment No. 6, was one which sought to make sure that both in regard to what I wanted to call prohibited substances and in regard to firearms and ammunition, it would be an offence for anybody in this country, putting it broadly, to organise or attempt to organise, to send or to bring dangerous or lethal things into the North of Ireland, either to bring them in across the land boundary or to organise their importation into the North by some other route.  I phrased, I am afraid, in a rather prolix way, but perhaps somebody who is a better <Col N="539" /> draftsman than I am would have been able to make it shorter.  However, this Bill is not doing its job, and I hope the Minister will take this criticism seriously and will not again describe it as a party political criticism.  This Bill is not doing its job in so far as it leaves it a matter not penalised under the firearms code for somebody in this jurisdiction to organise the importation into the North of Ireland of lethal weapons or substances.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to make a cheap point out of this, but things have happened in the Fianna Fáil Government over the last year or so which require no emphasis from me.  The people know about them and they can draw their own conclusions.  I am not going to throw in the Minister's teeth, with any particular emphasis, what was said by a Deputy of his party recently in regard to the alleged placing by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas of firearms at the disposal of people in the North of Ireland.  That may have been a piece of foolish hyperbole.  Knowing the Deputy concerned, it would not surprise me if it was.  I am not laying any particular emphasis on that, but for so long as it is possible for somebody to say that a thing like that was done, for so long as it is possible for anyone to suppose that a thing like that could lawfully be done, then our firearms code is defective.  In my view it is not enough for us to tighten up the law within our own boundaries.  If we are interested in the North of Ireland&mdash;and I believe we have not shown enough interest in it over the years&mdash; and if our view is that we must do everything which in our power lies to control violence and bloodshed up there, then we must do all we can to prevent the importation of arms into the North of Ireland and penalise attempts or conspiracies or incitements to do so.</P>
    <P>We have all got our own sympathies in this matter and quite likely the sympathies on this side of the House do not differ very much, if at all, from the sympathies on the other side of the House.  We all have our own views about recent and early history and about who was to blame for the events <Col N="540" /> of this month or that month or the other month.  I can well see that a man who, in the ordinary course of events, is law-abiding and decent, will still have a heart and a mind passionate enough to say: &ldquo;The time has come when it is no use talking about law and order any more.  The people with whom I feel myself identified by history and tradition are in danger and I must do what I can to help them.  I am going to do something even though the law would not condone it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are people like that, and I suppose that if the crunch came and if I were in that situation I might feel like that myself and I am not at all trying to take a high and mighty attitude towards people who experience that kind of feeling.  The events of the last year-and-a-half or two years in the North of Ireland must have convinced everybody in this jurisdiction, even if nothing else could convince them, that once they start putting guns into people's hands, unless they are in the hands of the Army of this State, there is no control over their use.  Although there may be a very strong emotional pull on some people to put firearms, or ammunition or weapons of one kind or another into the hands of people who they feel are threatened, innocent people whose lives they feel are in danger.  I sympathise with them and understand that feeling.  Although that feeling may be there, the events of the last couple of years have shown that you cannot give instructions that a particular gun is to be used only in self defence.  That is the reason why in every civilised State in the world lethal weapons are only entrusted, as a rule, to people who are disciplined in their use, who are used to obeying orders, and who in democratic countries take these orders only from democratically constituted authority.</P>
    <P>Making every allowance for the emotional feelings of people on this subject, this Parliament must not make any apology for saying: &ldquo;If shots are to be discharged in the name of the Irish people it will be on the authority of Dáil Éireann and on that authority only.&rdquo;  We will take the unpopular consequences necessary in order to effectuate that principle.  I should like to <Col N="541" /> see the Government doing what they can to prevent anyone within this jurisdiction from organising the importation of arms into the North of Ireland for either side, whether it be the people who are supporting the so-called provisionals, on the one side, or the people who are supposed to be crypto- &ldquo;B&rdquo; Specials, on the other side.  I do not believe in an uneven application of the law.  Until this Government show that they will do what they can to prevent people organising the bringing of arms into the North, I am not persuaded by the Bill and I do not consider that I am making a cheap party-political point by saying so.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons for amendments Nos. 3 and 6.  I recognise that amendment No. 3 goes too far, inasmuch as, if it were passed into law as it stands, it would impose an unfair restriction on something innocuous like motor car petrol and, as I say, if it comes to that, I would put down a further amendment at the Report Stage and a consequential amendment instead of amendment No. 6.  The House deserves a full and complete reply from the Minister as to what his intentions are or what the Government's intentions are in regard to explosives as distinct from firearms in connection with the question of their possible importation into the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>While Senator Kelly was talking I was reading that amendment. All I know about chemistry could be written on the back of a postage stamp, but I know this much. If that section was left as it is, any substance, capable by the addition of another substance, of causing an explosition, would render the person in possession of them amenable under this Bill.  If you stopped any woman on the street after coming out of a supermarket, she would have in her bag substances which are harmless, but which, when added to another substance, would be far from harmless. This covers a very wide range of things.  This section as it stands makes it possible to charge practically every person who makes a purchase in a shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand what Senator Kelly was <Col N="542" /> trying to explain.  It would be difficult to name all the substances which when combined with another would become dangerous and this would be necessary. To leave the section so wide open as this would prevent action being taken against anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the criticism Senator Honan makes about this.  The reason why I mentioned the mixture of other substances was that, out of my own extremely limited chemical knowledge, I know there are some explosives which are detonated by the admixture of another acid.  By themselves they are harmless, but when mixed with an acid they cause a fearful explosion.  I see Senator Honan's point.  I began by acknowledging it and what I had proposed to do was to extend the amendment by making it possible for the Minister, by regulation, to exclude from prohibited substances things which seem to him innocuous.  I trust him to get his experts to draw up a list of things which are in common use and innocuous, such as motor car petrol or weed killer.  There are some types of weed killer which, as the Minister probably knows, are fooled around with by school children and cause terrible explosions which sometimes cause death or serious injury.  It would have been much easier for me to draft this amendment, if I could have seen the text of the Dangerous Substances Bill which the Minister is having printed for the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept either of these amendments of Senator Kelly, even if he amended them further, as he suggests.  The reasons are obvious.  I need not go into some of these reasons as the Senator has already given them.  One of the more important reasons is that when this Bill was published about a month or six weeks ago, I gave an interview on the radio and I made a point at that time of making it clear that the Government were most anxious to do the same in relation to explosives, with whatever necessary amendments there might be, as they were now doing in this Bill in relation to firearms.  That is still very much our intention.  The reason that we did not do in this Bill, in relation to explosives or explosive <Col N="543" /> substances, what we are doing in relation to firearms, is that this is a Firearms Bill.  It seeks to amend and extend the Firearms Acts, 1925-1968, and it would be out of order, in my view, to seek to amend the law relating to explosives in this Bill.  It would have been my submission to you, Sir, had you not, presumably, already ruled that the amendments were in order, that they were not in order.  However, you have ruled that they are.</P>
      <P>In so far as firearms are concerned, and I think the same thing applies, or can be made in appropriate legislation to apply, to explosives, it is already an offence for a person to be in unauthorised possession of a firearm or ammunition, and it is an offence under section 16 of the 1925 Act for a person to consign for export or for removal from one place in the State to another, any firearm or ammunition, without an authorisation in writing from the superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the district, save in the case of a person who is the holder of a firearm's certificate and who is carrying with him or consigning the firearm or ammunition.  Apart from its being illegal for any other reason or under any other enactment or section, it is already an offence under section 16 of the 1925 Act, to export such goods from the State &mdash; and for the purposes of these Acts &ldquo;State&rdquo; means the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
      <P>What Senator Kelly urges at some length with regard to explosives is accepted, but this is not the place to make the case.  As I pointed out a month or six weeks ago, the place to do it is in an Explosives Bill, and we hope to publish one shortly.  The drafting of it is not yet completed. There could be similar provisions with regard to explosive substances to those in regard to firearms in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I see the Minister's point but it does not really meet what I was saying.  First of all, the Minister in his opening speech in which he recommended the Bill to the House, said that it enjoyed a good deal of support with the public.  But in his opening speech he said nothing about his intentions in regard to explosives <Col N="544" /> and dealt with them only very cursorily in his closing speech.  Furthermore, I cannot see what is out of order in incorporating sections relative to explosives in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was going to say was that the Minister was telling the House that he felt that it would not have been in order for him to import into a Firearms Bill some provisions in regard to explosives.  I cannot see where the logic of that is.  It is not a question of order; it is a question of what the Oireachtas resolves.  In its definition section the Principal Act already contains words which make it perfectly clear that an aerial bomb is a firearm.  That is perfectly clear from the Principal Act.  A bomb, grenade or, a landmine is a firearm; I should not like to have to decide it in the last instance but arguably a landmine is a firearm and certainly an aerial bomb is a firearm.  We are dealing with things of the same species.  We should not quibble about this: the Explosive Substances Act of 1875 and 1883 regulate the keeping of gelignite and things of that kind.</P>
      <P>Here we are dealing with a Bill which is a political Bill and which is supposed to be impressing people in the North of Ireland.  It is not sufficient to be told that the Bill just bears a different title from the explosives code.  We are trying to tell the people in the North of Ireland that, so far as we are concerned, we are not going to allow people within this jurisdiction to connive at bloodshed up there.  I want to tell them that on behalf of my party, and I expect the Minister will do the same for his party.  There was nothing to stop the Minister from making a consolidating Bill into which he would bring the question of explosives of the kind that are left behind in a doorway or detonated in some way like that, and nobody on this side of the House would have objected to it.  I cannot see what is out of order about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not replied to the question of somebody organising the <Col N="545" /> importation of arms.  He has said that it is an offence under the 1925 Act to export arms from one part of the State to the other.  I should like the Minister's view &mdash; I am not in any way trying to trip him up.  I have no positive answer to this myself; the matter has only just occurred to me since the Minister has raised it &mdash; would it be in order for me, under the law of this State, to telephone to Vienna and to instruct a man in Vienna to despatch arms overland to Antwerp and thence to some part in the North of Ireland? If I do that, am I within my rights, so far as the law of this State is concerned? If I am within my rights, then I ought not to be.  If this House and the other House and all parties in both Houses are serious&mdash;as I believe we are serious &mdash; about the intense violence in the North, then the organisation of bringing or sending arms into the Six Counties must be an offence here, so far as we can make it an offence for either side.  I am not taking sides about it.  The Minister has not dealt with an important question on which I should like to hear his views, that is, the position of somebody who is safely in Dublin, organising by telephone or in some other way, or inciting somebody else to organise, the importation of arms into the North of Ireland by some other route, not necessarily touching an inch of the territory of this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of Senator Kelly's remarks at the outset, we should discuss this purely from the point of view of the principle involved in these amendments.  As I understand the contributions of both Senator Honan and the Minister, the principle advocated by Senator Kelly in these amendments is acceptable to both.  If I am correct in that &mdash; and I think I am; it is implicit in what both the Minister and Senator Honan said &mdash; what we have to think of at this stage is the time factor in relation to the Dangerous Substances Bill which the Minister has forecast.  I understand that that Bill has not yet been printed.  I do not know if it is on the list of priorities which the Government propose to ask the Dáil to deal with before the Summer Recess.  Perhaps the Minister can inform the House on that. <Col N="546" /> If it is not, the position is that we are going to allow this country to go through the summer period, 12th July and the rest, in the North, without having the cover of the protection which Senator Kelly's amendments would afford the Government here, and the authorities generally.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for me to emphasise that the particular period which faces the country over the next few months, the summer period, can be an all-important one with regard to this matter and that the time factor is important. If the principle proposed here is accepted, it should not cause any strain on the Minister or his Department to accept that the intention, the principle, behind these amendments, should appear in the Firearms Bill, rather than or, if necessary, in addition to, appearing in a Dangerous Substances Bill.  The Minister made the point &mdash; and as far as the legal position is concerned, he is correct &mdash; that under section 16 of the Firearms Act, 1965, it is already an offence to export firearms or consign to export firearms from the State, or to remove them from one place to another within the State.</P>
      <P>However, I do not think that there is any answer in the 1925 Act, or in the case made by the Minister, to the point urged by Senator Kelly, namely, that at the moment there is nothing unlawful in a person in this State making arrangements to have arms consigned to the North of Ireland from some place outside the State.  It is an offence under section 16 of the 1925 Act to export firearms from here to the North of Ireland, but I do not think there is any offence at all involved in someone placing an order in London, Birmingham or Vienna, or anywhere else, to have a consignment of arms shipped from there into the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the definition of &ldquo;ammunition&rdquo; contained in the Firearms Act of 1925, it is valid to point out that grenades, bombs and other similar missiles are specifically included.  These are weapons, whatever you like to call them, that depend for their effect on an explosive substance being detonated. Having regard to the fact that they are already within the firearms <Col N="547" /> code it certainly does not seem to me to be out of place in firearms legislation to deal with the type of dangerous substance that is referred to in these amendments of Senator Kelly.  If there is agreement in principle, having regard to the dangers particularly in the months ahead, having regard to the time factor and to the Dáil programme and also to the programme of this House as regards an unprinted Bill to which the Minister refers, I would strongly urge the Minister to think again on this matter.</P>

      <P>Senator Kelly expresses dissatisfaction that I did not answer the question he posed, but in the next breath he says that he only though of it while I was speaking the last time, so I think it would have been rather difficult for me to have answered it.  The net point that he appears to be making is that we should enact by amendment No. 6 some prohibition on people here bringing guns from some other part of the world to another place outside our jurisdiction.  We might as well, in my opinion, pass a Bill saying that it shall not be lawful to transport shortguns from the North Island of New Zealand to the South Island.</P>

      <P>I want to protest in the strongest possible terms about what the Minister has just said.  I have a sense of national responsibility as well as a sense of party loyalty.  It would never cross my mind, in a deadly situation like this, to impute to the Fianna Fáil Government, rotten though I think they are, an intention in regard to the North of Ireland which I do not think they have got.  I want to make it clear that I have never alleged that, that I went out of my way two or three times in this debate to make it clear that I thought the opposite.  I believe that the Fianna Fáil Government, or those who are in control of the Government at the moment, sincerely wish for peace in the North.  I am not alleging any such thing as the Minister tried to put into my mouth.  I am not alleging that he or the Taoiseach or any other member of the Government wants to bring arms into the North of Ireland.  I accept unreservedly that they do not want to do such a thing.  All I am saying is that this Bill, which is supposed to give effect to their wish to forestall violence in the North of Ireland, will not do it.  It does not go far enough to do it.  It does not begin to go far enough to do it.</P>
      <P>I do not like to stand on my dignity and I am willing to take a poke in the eye in debate as well as anybody, but I consider that the Minister owes this side of the House an apology for that outrageous statement, that we are trying to give the Government a black eye in this deadly situation which we know that this particular Government, at any rate, does not deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's references to the North Island and the South Island of <Col N="549" /> New Zealand do not square easily either with the philosophy of his party, such as it is, or with section 4 of the Bill which is now before the House. Section 4 of this Bill, with which I am in entire agreement, is intended, according to the Minister &mdash; and I accept all this, as I think he is quite right &mdash; to put beyond doubt that the possession in the jurisdiction of arms which are likely to be dangerous to life and property includes life and property outside the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  In other words, to take the Minister's elegant example, I could be guilty of an offence under section 4 if I possessed arms in this jurisdiction intending to kill someone in New Zealand.  It is right that it should be so.  It is equally right that it should be so in regard to the importation of arms.  I still want to know from the Minister &mdash; he represents a party which wrote into the Irish Constitution a claim of an intransigent and belligerent kind to our Six Counties which is the greatest single obstacle at the moment to dialogue with the Northern majority &mdash; what reason he would like to give this House for making it a matter of irrelevance or for pretending that it is a matter of irrelevance that somebody here might conspire to import arms into the North.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that a point had only just occurred to me.  What I meant by that was that a particular image had only just come into my mind, and I do not want to trip the Minister up about this particular image, of a telephone call to Vienna ordering arms to be sent overland and by ship into the North of Ireland.  That particular image has only just come into my mind and I have not got the answer to it.  So far as I can see there is nothing in our Firearms Act or in our Explosive Substances Act &mdash; they are the English Acts which still apply here &mdash; which will make me a criminal if I do that, although by the common consent of the people in this House and in the other House of this Parliament, I am doing something that is absolutely wrong and immoral.  I want to hear from the Minister if I am at liberty or not to order by telephone, by telegram, by letter or by sending a messenger to some part of the world <Col N="550" />&mdash;New Zealand if the Minister likes&mdash; to organise the purchase and importation of lethal arms into the North of Ireland.  It is not good enough for the Minister to pretend that the North of Ireland is of no concern to us.  Has he not told us himself in as many words that this is the whole point of section 4?  The reason for having section 4 in this Bill is because arms which a defendant said were for use in County Tyrone could not be made the subject of a conviction in County Donegal. Has he not said that in his own words? Why then the talk about New Zealand?</P>
    <P>I am sorry if either the Minister or I have raised the temperature of this debate, but I am only trying to get a decent Bill.  I am interested as much as anybody on the other side of the House in preserving peace in the North of Ireland.  I accept that the people on the far side of the House are interested in it.  I am not making a party political point.  I want to make this a useful and workable Bill.  I would like to have this Bill, if I were in the Minister's boots, and be able to say to the people in Belfast &mdash; and I would not find fault with him for trying to impress them &mdash;&ldquo;We are doing our best so far as it lies within our power to make sure that no one dies within your present boundaries.&rdquo;  I want to know from the Minister if it is all right by him and the Government if somebody in this jurisdiction organises, at long distance, the importation of arms into the North of Ireland by a route other than through this Republic.</P>

      <P>I should just like to comment on the two amendments proposed by Senator Kelly.  They really relate, I think, to separable things. First, there is the question whether the prohibited substances should be included in the firearms code.  I would be inclined to agree that they ought to be, particularly for the reasons Senator O'Higgins gave.  This is something I think the Minister is not prepared to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I very strongly support Senator Kelly&rdquo;s amendment No. 6 to extend the offences under this to include anybody who tries to cause or procure or attempt to cause or procure <Col N="551" /> arms to be brought in or to be sent to a place other than within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas &mdash; and here I think we clearly mean Northern Ireland.  I do not accept what the Minister has said that this is unreal or that it could not relate to anybody because, as I read the amendment put down by Senator Kelly, it relates to offences which would be committed in this jurisdiction.  It relates to the offences of inciting somebody to bring arms from abroad into Northern Ireland. It relates to conspiring with people to bring in arms.  This conspiracy, incitement or procurement would be relevant here.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly asked a very fair question as to whether, at the moment, it would constitute a criminal offence.  If not, is it not completely unrealistic to be enacting, in the light of recent experience of alleged importation of arms into the country, a Firearms Bill which does not close this loophole?  I cannot accept what the Minister has said that it would be too remote and would be like prescribing a criminal offence for activities relating to North or South New Zealand.  The fact is, under the reading of this amendment, by having the criminal offences of conspiring and inciting persons to do things, even if we did not have jurisdictional control over the things done, it would constitute a necessary, justifiable and honest extension to the Firearms Bill and I should like to support it very strongly.</P>

      <P>It is almost impossible for me to say anything on this amendment because Professor Kelly might get into the state he was in a few minutes ago.  I can only reiterate what I have already said.  It is futile for a Parliament in this country to seek to pass laws to control matters that are happening outside its jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate between the Minister and Senator Kelly it seemed to me that the whole point of Senator Kelly's contention was that the acts were committed within this jurisdiction even though the acts were the cause of matters which happened outside the jurisdiction.  I think this is the main burden of <Col N="552" /> Senator Kelly's point.  He is not concerned with telephone calls made from North to South New Zealand but he is concerned with acts committed within this jurisdiction which have the ultimate effect of arms going to Northern Ireland.  This, I think, is the main point.</P>

I believe it is impossible to have a meaningful discussion, especially on the Committee Stage of a Bill of this kind, unless you at least express your opinion.</P>
      <P>The firearms legislation that exists at present can only extend to firearms within this jurisdiction.  I think that is self evident.  Therefore, if you move firearms from one part of the world to another, whether or not that other part be the remainder of this country which is not currently under our jurisdiction, the movement of those firearms cannot be an offence under our firearms legislation or indeed under any other legislation of this country.  I However, it would be possible as I see it, and this is subject to advice from the Attorney General or some such person would have to consider it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be possible, I think, to be guilty of conspiracy to commit some form of crime if persons within this jurisdiction were to conspire together, in a way that would be illegal, and it would not be an offence, it could never be an offence, against the Firearms Acts as such.  However, I am not saying that it would not be an offence of conspiring to do something unlawful.  It would require a better legal brain than mine and it would also need a considerably greater amount of time than I have had while standing here endeavouring to think about it.  That is the best I can do in reply to these questions.  I think it is a fair and reasonable summary of what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say nobody wants to take the Minister short.  Nobody knows better than a lawyer, whether a practising lawyer or an academic lawyer, that there is nothing open and shut in law.  We are not exchanging legal opinions here.  I feel that when the Minister refers to me as a professor he thinks that I am throwing my academic weight, such as it is into the balance.  I am not.  I am just as likely to make a mistake about this matter as the next man.  It is not true that I am taking the Minister short and I do not wish to take him short.  I raised this point in exact terms a week ago. <Col N="554" /> The Minister's officials were behind him and the Minister was listening to me, so far as I could see, with attention, and it was possible for him, having taken seriously what I was saying, to have looked it up in the meantime. I do not wish to make any particular point about that.</P>
      <P>I regard this point as important.  If this Bill goes through without some amendment to this effect it will be a sham.  I do not want to be put in a position of making it appear that I am trying to get from the Minister an opinion which no lawyer would give on his feet.  I am not trying to get such an opinion from the Minister at all.  I have not sprung this matter on the Minister.  I raised it on the Second Stage a week ago.  The Minister knows that perfectly well and he can find it in the Official Report.  I raised it in very precise and lucid terms a week ago and the Minister, or his advisers, did not think it worthwhile in the meantime to inquire whether or not our present law has any bearing on the position of somebody who, while in this State, organises the importation of arms into the North of Ireland from outside.</P>
      <P>Let us not treat this matter as just a party political point.  My views about Fianna Fáil are known to everybody in this House.  I do not think much of the present Government, not because I believe them to be dishonest in regard to their present policy on the North of Ireland.  I think the Government at the moment wish for peace in the North of Ireland and I would defend them on that issue to a foreigner, be it an Englishman or anybody else who was inclined to suspect our motives.  I would defend the Taoiseach and, perhaps, even conceal the fact that I thought his administration in every other respect was disastrous.  I have that much national spirit.  I accept the Government's good intentions about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I say that this Bill has got a serious loophole in it.  I am concerned that that loophole be closed.  If the Minister would prefer, I shall withdraw this amendment and try to improve it, if I can, and put it down for the Report Stage.  It is no part of this party's tactics &mdash; I want to say in all <Col N="555" /> sincerity &mdash; to plot or plan to obstruct the Government, in the slightest degree, with regard to the passage of this Bill. I regard this matter as important.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanations or remarks.  I do not think he has yet grasped the point I am trying to get at.  The act I am talking about which I consider should be an offence is the act of somebody within our present boundaries who arranges, conspires or procures that guns or lethal weapons be brought into the North of Ireland from wherever it may be.  I do not want to extract instant legal opinions from the Minister. As I said before, we are all likely to be wrong in giving legal opinions off the cuff.  However, I conceive that if I were to telephone somebody in Belfast and arrange for him to murder someone, or if I were to telephone someone in Paris and arrange to procure a murder over there, I would be guilty of conspiracy to murder under our law.  I may be wrong about that. That is an instant opinion which may be incorrect.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that it is a necessary component of every offence within the Irish Criminal Code that the offence should be completed within this jurisdiction. I am speaking off the cuff; the Minister asked for indulgence a moment ago because he was speaking off the cuff.  I may be wrong about that, but I do not think there is any country in the world so uncivilised and so barbaric as to treat as a matter of indifference the preparations for an offence or the preparations for something which may be dangerous or deadly to others and done within its own frontiers, the effect of which will only be felt inside somebody's else's frontiers.</P>
    <P>I, too, would like an opportunity to confound the Minister with examples if I can find them.  I feel sure that is the case.  I feel sure I am not at liberty under Irish law to procure the murder of somebody in England or in France. I think I am outside the law of Ireland if I procure or incite offences of other kinds which will be completed outside our borders.  Even if there was some doubt about that, and even if there were no such case, this is a special <Col N="556" /> case.  We are not talking about New Zealand, we are talking about six counties, over which we solemnly lay claim to legal jurisdiction in our Constitution. In my view it was a political mistake so to do in those terms, but we have done it.</P>
    <P>We are always talking about our sundered brethren.  Is it a matter of indifference to us that people within this State can do something, organise or procure something, which may result in the deaths of these sundered brethren?  Any Government who take that line are perpetrating a sham.  I have said this before about the Government in regard to their attitude on several problems, the North of Ireland included.</P>
    <P>I think the Government here genuinely intend to improve our firearms code.  This is a serious loophole.  If the Minister is not prepared to look at it seriously and get his Department to look at it seriously and come back on another occasion and talk about it, I will have to put down an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not going to venture to give a legal opinion on this matter other than this.  It seems to me to be abundently clear that if we make an amendment, such as is suggested by Senator Kelly here, then there is no need either for the Minister, for Senator Kelly or for anyone else to be left guessing as to whether or not it would be an offence. If we declare it in this Bill, by means of an amendment on these lines, to be an offence to arrange or procure the importation from anywhere or by any source or over any route guns into the North of Ireland, then that is that, and as soon as that amendment is passed into law it is an offence.  I do not think a person needs to be a lawyer, a Minister, a professor or anyone else to understand that much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>Or to send them in. We might as well get down to the <Col N="557" /> practicalities of Senator Kelly's amendments. There has been enough criticism of Government amendments in both Houses, of the standard of drafting and all the rest of it.  Senator Kelly's amendments would have the effect that everytime a motor car travelled across the Border from the Twenty-six Counties to the Six Counties a serious criminal offence was committed by the person driving it and presumably by those in it as well.</P>
      <P>A further example would be where a person with an ordinary licensed shotgun of more than 24 inches, and with everything else as it should be, decides to go to the Six Counties for his holidays to shoot pheasants, grouse or something of that kind.  He has a firearms certificate.  He is allowed to export it from this jurisdiction and has an importation certificate from the authorities in the Six Counties &mdash; I beg your pardon, not a shotgun but a shotgun of a type that would not come under the sporting weapons or a 303&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has an importation certificate from the North and a firearms certificate from here and is allowed to export it from here, he still commits an offence under this.  I am sure there are many more examples, but these two strike me straight away.</P>
      <P>I accept that Senator Kelly acknowledges there are many defects in his amendments and he wants to amend them again, but I am afraid the principle would remain the same.  Even if Senator Kelly were to get the opportunity of amending them into a form that would make the effect of them in those respects less outrageous than they are at the moment, I still could not accept them.  They seem to have a very fundamental effect and change on an involved branch of private international law or public international law for that matter, and are away beyond anything that might or should be contemplated in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the ordinary Senators sitting here listening to this have probably concluded by now that what we are discussing is a lot of codology between <Col N="558" /> lawyers and it would be much easier to go on with the thing and have less of this sort of gross technicality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a gross technicality and I am sorry that the Minister feels I am becoming unnecessarily impatient with him.  I want the Minister to deal with a net point. He knows perfectly well what this point is and he is not dealing with it. I have acknowledged that amendment No. 3 is far too wide.  Does the Minister want me to say that over and over again?  I see that it is too wide and I am prepared to remedy it, if I can. Every day we sit Ministers come in here with a list of supplementary amendments which represent second or third thoughts on the part of their Departments.  I am no better than the Minister's Department; I have fewer resources at my disposal, probably.  I am entitled to have second thoughts about it and so is anybody else on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the question of whether I am a fine draftsman or not, the Minister is just not meeting head on the points which this House wants him to meet head on &mdash; if I understand the feelings of this side of the House at least &mdash; namely whether or not this Bill or the firearms code in this State should or should not be made to apply to somebody who, while within the State, procures the bringing of arms into the North by some route, if the Minister wishes, other than over the boundaries of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that section 16 of the principal Act would make it an offence if one had got arms in here to send them out again over the Border into the North.  I am asking the Minister why he will not accept an amendment.  Let him produce his own section to that effect; no one here will crow over him. I will not anyway.  Let him produce his own section to this effect: that if anyone in this jurisdiction conspires or procures or incites the importation of arms or lethal things into the North of Ireland by whatever route, by helicopter or by plane or by direct boat to Carrickfergus or some other port in the North of Ireland, that will be an <Col N="559" /> offence so far as our criminal code is concerned.</P>
    <P>Although I have said this umpteen times I still do not seem to have got through to the Minister.  I accept that the legislation is well meant.  All I am saying is that it is not good enough; it just is not a good enough Bill as it stands.  If the Minister persists in not meeting this point head on and in not dealing with it, I propose to withdraw these two amendments and put in amendments to replace them on Report Stage.  I have absolutely no wish to hold the House up or bring the Minister back again or anything like that, but I feel I have got my duty to do and, having made this point, I just cannot let it lie.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the Minister's reluctance to consider this.  There have been recent cases in England of conspiracies there where the substantive offence would have been committed abroad and no problem arose in the particular instance.  I cannot see why the Minister fears this would raise problems of public or private international law because the substantive offences, as Senator Kelly has said, the conspiracy or the incitement, would take place in this jurisdiction.  This would not offend against the jurisdictions of the foreign country or the North of Ireland in the transfer of weapons.  They would not be concerned.  What we would be concerned with here is preventing this type of activity within our State, which at a time of great national danger we ought to be concerned with.  It is very much within our jurisdiction and I think very much our duty at this time to close this loophole.  I would ask the Minister to look into the situation again and not to close his mind on it. The Minister ought to welcome the power to do this.  I believe it would be possible to enforce and prosecute this offence if it came in.  It might be a very real safeguard in this situation.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to the plea made by Senator Robinson to have the Minister calmly look into this between now and the Report Stage.  As a non-lawyer and listening to the debate I am quite <Col N="560" /> satisfied there is a genuine case made. I am quite satisfied it is not a party political point raised in that spirit in any way by Professor Kelly.  I appeal to the Minister to have his experts look carefully into this for the next day and I hope, when it comes to Report Stage, that we will have the benefit of having a much calmer discussion and one in which the Minister will have had second thoughts.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this amendment is quite futile.  Insofar as any offence within this country or within this jurisdiction might be committed in the circumstances set out by Senator Kelly it would be an offence of conspiracy because I believe, subject to correction, that it is possible to conspire here and thereby commit an offence here.  I think the law in England, as Senator Robinson said, is much the same.  In fact, the law basically would be precisely the same.  It may be possible to commit the offence of conspiracy here by conspiring to do something which outside our jurisdiction would be unlawful.  Beyond that we cannot go because we cannot pass a firearms code to cover places which are outside our effective boundaries at the moment.  It might seem very laudable to be seen to do so but this House would simply be stultifying itself by seeking or purporting to make it an offence to comspire to do any of these things outside the jurisdiction.  There is nothing to be gained by accepting these amendments even in an amended or re-drafted form.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if it were, and I do not accept that it is, in some degree unusual for <Col N="561" /> a provision like this to find a place in An Irish Act, what has that got to do with it if we are as soverign a State as the Minister says?  If we can make our own decisions let us make these decisions. The Minister talks about the House stultifying itself.  I presume what he means by that is doing something which is not effectual or which might as well not have been done.  How much effect does the Minister think section 3 of this Bill is going to have, the reduction of penalties on the more innocuous form of keeping firearms?  Is it worth even putting that into the Bill at all?  That seemed to me, as I said the last day, to be padding and eyewash and intended merely to distract the attention from the main guts of the Bill, with which I agree.  How much effect will that have?  Was it even worth doing?</P>

I cannot accept the Minister's attitude about this.  Although I am sincerely sorry to hold the House up and to bother the Minister again&mdash; although, of course, the Standing Orders of this House do not require the Minister to be present &mdash; I have no option but to withdraw these amendments and I intend to put them down again in an amended form on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>If Senator Ó Maoláin wishes this discussion on Senator Kelly's amendments to continue, as far as I am concerned I will oblige him.  As I understand the position, Senator Kelly or any other Senator is quite free to put down Report Stage amendments.  I am open to correction on this.  He would not be in order to put down precisely these amendments on Report Stage but he is entitled to put down different amendments. If Senator Ó Maoláin hopes to defeat Senator Kelly's right to have the point which we have been discussing on these amendments discussed on Report Stage, I do not think he will succeed.  If there is any danger that the point should be overlooked, as far as I am concerned we can continue discussing it now.</P>

    <P>There is a net point involved in this and that is the right of the Houses of the Irish Parliament by their legislation to decide what will or what will not be an offence under Irish law if committed by people within our jurisdiction. That is the entire point in the case which has been made by the Minister against these amendments.  He seems to be under the impression that if these amendments were accepted in principle, even if they were drafted by his own officers in a manner entirely satisfactory to himself, it would be of <Col N="564" /> no effect.  In fact, he believed that it might be an offence in some way against international law if we should legislate in that manner.  I want to express my disagreement with the Minister on this.  What is suggested is that our legislation here should provide in the Firearms Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to hold the Minister and I am sincere in this, but I have been considering, since we discussed the first two amendments, the effect of section 2.  I allowed myself to be persuaded rather too easily by the Minister when I withdrew amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  Quite honestly I do not like the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; that will appear in the firearms code as a result of enacting section 2 here.  I should like the Minister to give it a bit more thought before we finish the discussion on the Bill.  I want to give him the reason for this suggestion.  Under the Firearms Act, 1925, the definition is stated in section 1 as follows:</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; means a lethal firearm or other lethal weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged.</P>
      <P>Under section 2 of this Bill, we are adding to that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>and, save where the context otherwise requires, includes a component part of a firearm</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> What is a component part of a firearm? Surely, having regard to the definition in the 1925 Act, this would read &ldquo;a component part of a firearm from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged&rdquo;.  In other words, it seems to me that we are in danger still of being tied to the old test as to whether or not the firearm is capable of discharging a bullet.  I may be wrong in this, but I think it would be worth the Minister's while to have a look at this section again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 2 (1) of the Firearms Act 1964 is hereby amended by the addition of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;and, save where the context otherwise requires, includes a component part of any such airgun, other weapon or prohibited weapon&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if this is necessary but I wanted to call the attention of the Minister to it and for that reason I put down this amendment.  As the Minister realises, we have just amended the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; under the 1925 Act.  The 1964 Firearms Act, in section 2, amended the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; and extended it to include an airgun, which expression includes an air rifle and an air pistol and any other weapon incorporating a barrel from which metal or other slugs can be discharged, or prohibited weapon.  The Minister's amendment in section 2 of the present Bill is for the purpose of extending the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; to the component parts of a lethal firearm or other lethal weapon.  This does not necessarily mean that the component parts of firearms caught by extended definition under the 1964 Act are captured by the alteration that is now being made.  I may be wrong in that, and if <Col N="567" /> I am, I will accept the Minister's word on it.  It may be necessary to perform a similar operation on the definition which is contained in the 1964 Act and also to include component parts of an airgun, air rifle and other weapon or prohibited weapon.  That is the kernel of my amendment here.</P>

      <P>I shall accept the Minister's assurance, but all this seems to show that my original proposition was the right one, that we should scrap this idea of having definitions in three separate Acts and now put in one composite definition that would cover the lot.  After this Bill is passed the position is that a person who wants to find out what a firearm is must first of all read the 1925 Act; then he has to look at the 1964 Act to see how the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; was amended there; then he has to look at the 1971 Act, as it will be, to see how the dtfinition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; is further amended. Perhaps by the time the Minister gets in with his Dangerous Substances Act, he may have to look at still another Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> In page 3, lines 6 and 7, paragraph (2B) (a) to delete from &ldquo;in length&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph and substitute &ldquo;in length, or an un-rifled airgun, or a rifled firearm of a calibre not exceeding .22 inches and having a barrel of not less than 24 inches in length&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since the Seanad met last week, I inquired from a military friend and I am now told that there is definitely such a thing as a pistol of .22 calibre &mdash;I had suspected this, but I was not sure.  Now I am definitely assured that there is such a pistol in existence and, at the risk of being told that I am making another party political point, I suggest to the Minister that this amendment would be innocuous.  If the section in question were adapted as I suggest, it would leave within control rifled firearms of .22 calibre but of the size of pistols.</P>
    <P>I have also been told by my military acquaintance that the modern .22 cartridge is a very different thing from the old-fashioned .22 cartridge and that, whereas the old one was non-lethal unless it caught you in a vital spot, the more modern .22 cartridges are charged with new explosives of a kind which very much increase their velocity and, presumably, the degree to which they fragment and scatter once they reach their target.  Therefore, the lethal possibilities in .22 weapons are much greater than the Minister possibly realises.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister has got extra technical advice about this and if he has, and if he will tell the House what it is, I shall not press this amendment any further.  If it is simply a case that the Department put down firearms of a calibre not exceeding .22 inches, without adverting to the possibility of a pistol of that calibre which exists, it does not seem to me that it would be much of a retreat on the Minister's part.  Certainly, it would not be interpreted as that by me or by this side if he were to adapt the section accordingly.  Even if there were not such a thing as a pistol of .22 calibre, it may be that such a pistol will hereafter be produced.</P>
    <P>In his Second Stage speech, while agreeing that this point might legitimately <Col N="569" /> be raised, the Minister said that under section 3 (2B) (b) he was to be enabled to make an order declaring a firearm of any specified kind to be especially dangerous and thus to bring it under the classification of &ldquo;military weapon&rdquo;.  It is only right that the Minister should have that discretion under that section.  However, if it is known to his Department and to the Garda, as it must be known, that pistols of this calibre do exist, and that ammunition of a very dangerous kind is now in existence for them, I cannot see why this section should not now be amended in such a way as to place them in exactly the same category, so far as the Firearms Bill is concerned, as pistols of a more traditional calibre, like .38 or .45.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a particular point of this.  I realise the Minister proposes to get power to change the situation by order, if he wishes.  However, I do not see, if this pistol is now known to exist, why it should not fall automatically into the more dangerous category and why it should not be placed there by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned here on Second Reading that I thought it was unwise to leave the figure &ldquo;not less than 24 inches&rdquo;.  I know that there are quite a number of shotguns being manufactured, and they are the most popular ones, and the barrels are invariably under 24 inches.  A number of these guns will be taken in for licence next August and this Bill will be in force by then.  Anybody who goes into a Garda barracks with a shotgun with a barrel of less than 24 inches calibre will be told by the Garda that it is outside this new Firearms Act and that it cannot be licensed.  Many of the continental guns are now down to 20 inches.  Like Senator Kelly's point about the new high velocity ammunition, there are special high velocity cartridges being used in them, and they have the same performance as the longer barrelled guns.  Anybody who possesses one of these now will find himself with what is described as a lethal weapon that cannot be licensed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Subject to what I have to say now, I am prepared to accept the principle of this amendment. Although we are well aware that there are .22 pistols, and they are the sort of things we would like to cover, they are not very frequently found in this country.  Unfortunately, there is a very large number of .22 rifles the barrels of which are not alone less than 24 inches but are fairly considerably less and I am advised &mdash; I am probably no wiser than anybody else here &mdash; that quite a high proportion of .22 rifles have barrels of around 18 inches and that a significantly high proportion have barrels of less than 24 inches.  If I accept Senator Kelly's amendment, I am creating a situation that I must transform all those weapons, without exception, into military type weapons.  On balance, although I am attracted to the amendment because it perhaps makes the thing clearer at the outset, I think more good would be done by my being allowed to rely on the powers I would get under paragraph (b) of this subsection.</P>
      <P>What I would propose to do, subject to expert advise, is to declare .22 pistols military weapons or &ldquo;specially dangerous&rdquo; which is the phrase used in this paragraph.  I am, however, loath to transform such a large number of .22 rifles into that category without examining the consequences. For that reason the safer thing would be to leave the paragraph as it is and allow the powers under it to be exercised as would be felt appropriate afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's <Col N="571" /> point.  If the Minister assures the House that he intends to place .22 pistols in the dangerous category, by order, I will certainly accept that and withdraw the amendment.  Senator Honan's point is up to him to defend. However, if the Minister is resisting my amendment on the grounds that to accept it would mean transforming a large number of at present legally held and legally used .22 rifles into lethal weapons, exactly the same argument must be effective against the section as it stands in respect of the shotguns mentioned by Senator Honan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to apologise to Senator Honan that I overlooked dealing with his point the last time I was on my feet.  The advice I have &mdash; I am entirely subject to or dependent on the technical advice I get as to these matters &mdash; is that the type of shotgun referred to by Senator Honan is a rare one in this country.  It is a continental one which has been imported here only in very small quantities.  Furthermore, it is, as a general rule, some form of automatic gun.  I am, quite frankly, not terribly keen on this type of gun. Although I can appreciate that it will cause difficulties for a small number of people, we cannot get over that. However, the difficulty will be caused only to the extent that the type of shotgun referred to by Senator Honan will be put in the military type category. Provided that they are duly licensed and looked after by the owners there would not be anything to worry about.</P>

I would assume, I hope correctly, that in the case of people who have been getting licences for particular weapons and have been using them for sporting purposes, there is no reason why a Garda superintendent should decide, merely on account of the passing of this Bill, not to give licences for these weapons any more. This section states that if the weapon falls into a particular category as regards length of barrel the penalty for not having a licence for it, if it is what the Minister refers to as the military type category, will be very much heavier.  It does not mean that one cannot get a licence that one has already been getting.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> I suggest that amendments Nos. 7 and 8 be discussed together as the same point is involved in both.  The point involved here is one to which I referred on the Second Stage.  Section 5 of the Bill authorises the sale of a replacement, spare or extra part of the firearm to a person who has a firearm certificate.  The point I made on the Second Reading debate was that technically and legally by virtue of this section it would be possible for a person to accumulate sufficient replacements, spares or extra parts, to provide himself with a second firearm.</P>
    <P>Taking a sporting shot, I think we could regard that as consisting of three component parts &mdash; the barrel, the stock and the fore-end which joins the barrel and the stock together.  I am assuming for the moment that the trigger mechanism and so on is regarded as part of the stock.  There is nothing in the section as it stands to prevent the person who has a shotgun and who has a certificate for it going into a gunsmith and ordering a second pair of barrels. In the past it was quite a common thing for a person to have long barrels and short barrels, two sets of barrels, which fitted the same stock.  It certainly would not be anything out of the ordinary for a person to order a second pair of barrels and to get them. Having got a second pair of barrels there is nothing in this section as it stands to prevent him ordering a replacement stock to fit the second pair of barrels.  Having got his replacement stock and his second pair of barrels, there is nothing in the world then to prevent him from ordering as an extra part or a spare part, a fore-end to lock the second set of barrels and the second stock together and thus to give himself a second weapon.  This is the way I see the position under this section.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that someone may say to me: &ldquo;Would that not be a great deal of trouble to go to?  Why not simply go in and buy a second shotgun and look for a second licence in the ordinary way?&rdquo; I can see the force and the validity of that argument.  This Bill is, by and large, intended to deal not with the person who is acting <i>bona fide</i> but to deal, by tightening up <Col N="574" /> the law, with the person who is acting in a <i>mala fide</i> way.  We have to have regard to that.  If a loophole exists, as I think it does exist under this section, and if we can stop that loophole now is the time to do so.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that it should be and can be stopped quite simply as far as legal sanction is concerned.  I agree that the practical operation may be a different thing, but so far as legal sanction is concerned we should make it clear in relation to this section that in passing the section we are not making lawful or authorising the kind of operation which I have described, that is the person who by dint of ordering a series of replacements or spare parts will acquire a second weapon.  We are simply not authorising that under this section.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we can deal with it in one or two ways.  We can either make it clear in the section that what we are legalising, or declaring not to be unlawful, is the sale of replacement, spare or extra parts for use solely as part of a firearm for which a certificate has been obtained.  If we do not want to deal with it in that way we can deal with it by adding a proviso at the end of the section which would declare the intention of Parliament in relation to this by saying:</P>
    <P>Provided however that nothing in this section shall make lawful or authorise the sale to anyone in a single or series of transactions of a number of such parts which when put together or assembled would constitute a complete firearm.</P>
    <P>If either of these suggestions is adopted it may not have the effect, in practice, of preventing a person from acquiring a sufficient number of additional or replacement parts to assemble a second gun but at least it will say, so far as the Legislature is concerned, that that operation is not lawful and that we never intended it should be lawful when we were passing section 5 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with amendment No. 7 first and with the point Senator O'Higgins raised.  He wants to ensure that a part could be purchased only if it could be used as a <Col N="575" /> part of a firearm for which a certificate already exists.  I do not think this is any problem.  I am advised that the two most vital parts of a shotgun&mdash; what are described as the action, which is the trigger-cum-hammer of the gun, and the barrel of the gun &mdash; cannot normally be acquired as replacements or spares or extras.  Authorisation of spare or extra parts could not relate to the vital parts and therefore there can be no question of building up a gun.</P>
      <P>To that extent the amendment is not necessary.  It is impossible today to purchase the action of a gun as a separate part.  I am advised that it is normally possible to get a second set of barrels for your gun only when you are buying the gun originally.  The main reason is that the barrels are apparently numbered and an action&mdash; trigger-cum-hammer &mdash; is never sold separately from a gun.  Both of those vital parts, the action&mdash;Senator O'Higgins may know it by some other name &mdash; are numbered also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the action. It is incorporated in the stock.  The Minister is talking now about the practice so far as gunsmiths and the manufacturers of shotguns, say in Birmingham or some other place, are concerned.  It may be that it is outmoded to give a spare set of barrels or to make up a set of barrels for an action that is sent over to Birmingham for that purpose, but I do not think it would be satisfactory legislation if we left the door open deliberately, as we will be if we no not accept at least the principle of these amendments, because &mdash;I made this point earlier and I think it is a serious point &mdash; we are not dealing here with the person who is acting, in every way, in a <i>bona fide</i> manner. We are dealing with the person who wants to get around the provisions of the law which we are making now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may very well be, and I would accept, that the Minister's advice is accurate that it is not normal practice nowadays to supply second barrels or to manufacture the stock or action to go with those barrels but it seems to me that it would not be unlawful, under this legislation, for someone to <Col N="576" /> set himself up as a manufacturer of spare parts and as a seller of them. He can, perfectly legitimately, go into the market now and advertise from O'Connell Bridge that he is prepared to make spare parts, the action and the barrels, unless we provide against it.</P>

      <P>If I could take first the point that I understood Senator O'Higgins to make on amendment No. 8.  It refers to the position where so many component parts would be acquired under authorities that, in fact, a complete and usable firearm would be formed.  In that situation, quite clearly that person would hold the second firearm unlawfully unless he got a new certificate for it.  He could not rely on his two, three or four authorities for component parts.  He would have to have a new certificate if that was the situation.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (1)  Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (7) of the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(8) Registration (including registration in pursuance of a renewal of a previous registration) of a person in the register of firearms dealers may, at the discretion of the Minister, be made subject to the condition that the person shall not deal in firearms or deal in ammunition otherwise than by the sale and purchase of ammunition for shotguns, for unrifled airguns and for rifled firearms of a calibre not exceeding .22 inches, and a person whose registration in the register of firearms dealers is made subject to the condition aforesaid and who fails to comply with it shall, notwithstanding anything contained in section 10 (1) of this Act, <Col N="578" /> be guilty on an offence under this Act.</P>
    <P>(9) In any proceedings a certificate under the seal of the Minister stating that the registration of a person in the register of firearms deals was subject, on a specified day or during a specified period, to the condition referred to in subsection (8) of this section shall be evidence of that fact unless the contrary is proved.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(2) Section 10 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(7) The references in subsections (2) and (3) of this section to a registered firearms dealer shall, in relation to a sale of any firearm or ammunition, be construed as references to a registered firearms dealer for whom it is lawful to purchase that firearm or ammunition by way of trade or business.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(3) Section 11 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (2) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(2A) If and when the Minister is satisfied that any person who is registered in the register of firearms dealers and whose registration is subject to the condition referred to in section 9 (8) of this Act has failed to comply with the condition, the Minister may remove the name of such person from the register aforesaid.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to empower the Minister for Justice to make the re-registration of a firearms dealer a condition of his confining his dealings as a firearms dealer to the sale and purchase of ammunition for shotguns, for unrifled air guns and for rifled firearms of a calibre not exceeding .22 inches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 51 of the Finance Bill provides for duty at the rate of £25 per annum to be paid by an ordinary firearms dealer and at the rate of £3 per annum by a dealer subject to this condition. The reference in the proposed <Col N="579" /> new subsection of section 9 of the Principal Act to section 10 (1) of that Act is due to the fact that section 10 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to manufacture, sell, repair, test or prove or expose for sale, or have in his possession for sale, repair, test or prove by way of trade or business, any firearm or ammunition unless such person is registered in the register of firearms dealers.</P>
    <P>This might be construed, in the absence of the proposed subsection (8), as permitting any firearms dealer, including a dealer subject to this condition, to manufacture, sell, etc., any firearms or ammunition.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to have it put beyond doubt that a dealer who is registered subject to the sporting ammunition condition cannot avail himself of the final clause of section 10 (1).  The proposed subsection (9) of section 9 of the Principal Act is intended to avoid a situation where an officer of the Department would have to appear in court to prove that a dealer was subject to the sporting ammunition condition. It may be compared with section 24 of the 1964 Act which provides that in a prosecution for an offence under the Principal Act it shall not be necessary to prove that a certificate licence, etc., under that Act does not exist.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the proposed new section relates to subsections (2) and (3) of section 10 of the Principal Act, with which subsection (2), as amended by section 16 of the 1964 Act, should be read.  The purpose of the proposed subsection (2) is to put beyond doubt that it is only where a firearms dealer is not subject to the sporting ammunition condition that it should be lawful to sell &mdash; and I use &ldquo;sell&rdquo; in its defined sense in the Acts cited together, that is either to sell, give or lend to him a firearm or any ammunition other than sporting ammunition.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed subsection (3) of this proposed section is to enable the Minister to remove from the register of firearms dealers any dealer whose registration is subject to <Col N="580" /> the sporting ammunition condition where the Minister is satisfied that he has broken the condition.  This will be appropriate where there is not enough evidence to justify a prosecution or in a case that was thought to be urgent. There is already power in section 11 (2) of the Principal Act to remove from the register any dealer who has been convicted of an offence under the Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Section 3 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition, after &lsquo;firearms certificate&rsquo; of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;; provided however that no one person shall be granted more than one firearms certificate at any one time in respect of any firearm not being a sporting firearm, unless the Minister shall certify in writing that in his opinion the granting of more than one such firearms certificate to such person will involve no danger to the public safety or the peace and that such person is capable of effective custody and supervision of any such additional firearm, and a fresh certificate from the Minister shall be produced to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána of the district on any application for a firearms certificate in respect of any such additional firearm&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 deals with a matter which I also adverted to in my speech here last week and which the Minister dealt with briefly in his closing speech.  It is the matter of collections of firearms.  It seems to me, and I said so last week, that there is a special danger in a situation in which it is possible for somebody to make a collection of modern firearms as a hobby.  I made it clear that I was not talking about antiques which are, in any case, excluded from the application of the Principal Act by one of the Act's sections.  I was speaking about relatively modern firearms of the <Col N="581" /> kind that, say, are collected as souvenirs or were brought back as souvenirs from the Second World War and which are still highly lethal.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there should be some control of an absolute kind on the possibility of a person in this State amassing a collection of this sort. When I raised this point last week the Minister met it after his own fashion by first of all saying that I had not listened to his opening speech and/or that if I had done so I would not have raised this point, nor would I have raised it had I troubled to read section 51 of the Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Section 51 of the Finance Act is relied on, as far as I can understand it, by the State to control the problem to which I adverted.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, in speaking about this section said that it was a new provision.  He said:</P>
    <P>Section 51 increases the excise duty payable by firearms dealers from £1 to £25, except that the duty payable by dealers in ammunition for &ldquo;sporting&rdquo; guns will be £3.  This is a new provision which was not announced in the Budget.  Its specific purpose is to induce as many dealers as possible to confine themselves to dealing in &ldquo;sporting&rdquo; ammunition and it effectively forms part of the measures that have been passed by the House under the Firearms Bill, 1971, to secure a tightening-up of the existing statutory controls on firearms.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that I did not know about this section when I spoke here the last day but I still thought it worthwhile putting down this amendment because in my view that section does not meet the problems that I adverted to.  The Minister's view, which I presume reflects that of his Department, is that it would be enough to make it a serious thing financially for a firearms dealer to have firearms on his premises. The Minister said, reported at column 388 of volume 70, No. 5 of the Seanad Official Report:</P>
    <P>One of the reasons that there are so many collectors of firearms at the moment and that they have so many arms in circumstances which are not <Col N="582" /> always very secure is that the fee payable on registration as a firearms dealer has never been increased since 1925, when it was fixed at a £1.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that in the case which I instanced last week of the man from whose premises a large number of usable and lethal weapons had been stolen &mdash; I was glad he had this case in mind &mdash; that this man is not really a registered firearms dealer in the accepted sense that he trades in or deals in firearms.  What he was really was a collector, but it was more economic for him as it was for many others to hold his collection as a registered firearms dealer.</P>
    <P>It may be that I misunderstood what was in the Minister's mind or that I misunderstood the effect of the Finance Bill, and I am very willing to accept contradiction or correction if that is so. As I said last week, there are people who make a hobby of collecting firearms, every possible kind of pistol or rifle they can lay their hands on, modern ones and lethal ones.  If I were setting out to put a stop to that &mdash; not because I think it wrong that a person should have such a hobby but because of the temptation that it represents to other people to make a raid on his premises, which of course will not be as securely guarded as a military store and to possess themselves by breaking through a kitchen window or something of that kind of ten or 20 firearms &mdash;this is not the way I would go about it.</P>
    <P>A man who is a firearms enthusiast is not going to be deterred from setting up as an ostensible firearms dealer by a £25 registration fee.  Perhaps I misunderstood the sense of what the Minister was saying, but I take him to imply at least that the £25 registration fee will be a deterrent to bogus firearms dealers.  If I have understood him correctly &mdash; and I do not mind his interrupting me if I misunderstood that&mdash; what it boils down to is this: that he seriously expects somebody who is a passionate collector of firearms to be deterred from obtaining for himself this status of dealer by a sum of money which is less than the cost of a good second-hand shotgun.</P>
    <P>I am far from being an expert on <Col N="583" /> firearms but I know that the cost of a good shotgun can run into three figures. Even a reasonable, second-hand one will cost more than £25.  Even a .22 rifle of the simplest kind costs I think &mdash;other Members may know more about this, but I do not think you could buy a very good one for £25.  In other words, the Minister expects that to impose a registration fee of this kind on firearms dealers is going to deter the bogus dealer who simply wants to make a collection.  I do not think it is going to deter him.  I do not think for a second that somebody who has now free legal licence to import and keep in his premises arms of the kind I have been describing is going to be put off this hobby, if hobby it is, by a charge of £25.  It is probably less than he pays on road tax on his car in the year.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour this point unnecessarily but this solution to the problem &mdash; and it is a real problem as the Minister himself acknowledged&mdash; is only, I think, tinkering with it.  It is not going to solve it and nothing will solve it unless the Garda are enabled to impose strict control weapon by weapon, man by man.  That is the reason why I have put down amendment No. 11, the point of it being that anybody who wishes to have a firearms certificate in respect of a firearm other than a sporting firearm must have a certificate from the Minister himself that more than one such firearm may be held by him in safety.</P>
    <P>I know nothing about these matters and I would be very slow to inquire into them in case I aroused suspicion about myself, but where somebody feels that he is in danger &mdash; perhaps because of a local feud or something like that, I have no idea what are the circumstances in which the Garda grant licences for the holding of a pistol, for example &mdash; there must be plenty of such licences, or some anyway&mdash;I do not know what the criteria they apply are and I do not know what the conditions in which people apply for them are, but the average person who feels himself at risk, perhaps in local trouble in the country or something of that kind, is probably adequately protected with one pistol.  I am only guessing about this and I complain <Col N="584" /> now, not for the first time, about the absence of adequate information in explanatory memoranda on points of this kind, either in the explanatory memorandum to the Finance Bill or in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill before us or, indeed, so far as the information given in the Minister's opening statement goes.</P>
    <P>If somebody wants to accumulate more than one such firearm, not being a sporting firearm, in other words let us suppose he has one pistol for self-defence and if he wants more than one pistol, more than one lethal weapon, I think he should be asked to go right up to the Minister for permission to have it.  The Minister should issue a certificate to him certifying that in the Minister's opinion the issuing of an additional firearm certificate will not constitute any danger to the public safety or peace and that such person is capable of proper custody and supervision of any such additional firearm. I think it is not too much to ask that any time that person wants another firearm he must go to the Minister for a fresh certificate.  I know this is tough on some people.  I am sure there is a small proportion of the population who make a hobby of keeping guns but it does not seem to me to be too much to impose a strict control on it at a time when guns are very much in the news.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is aware of this problem.  It seems to me that his way of handling it is not going to be effective. The new fee is far too low.  I do not think it will be a deterrent in any case to a man who is really interested in this hobby and I think it would be more sensible if a control of the kind I suggest were placed on the granting of firearm certificates in respect of more than one non-sporting firearm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the amendment in Senator Kelly's name, I should like to mention a particular type of weapon.  Senator Kelly is concerned about the fact that in the case of a person having one firearm &mdash; and I take it not of a sporting nature &mdash; the acquisition of another one should mean that he would have to get a special certificate from the Minister. There is a composite .22 rifle.  A pistol <Col N="585" /> is incorporated in the breech of this gun and the pistol can be detached from the rifle and become just an ordinary pocket .22 pistol.  I am not sure at the moment what certification is necessary for the possession of this gun. I know people who have this type of .22 weapon.  The long barrel and stock is one portion of it but a pistol is incorporated that can be detached and used effectively as a pistol.</P>
      <P>There should be extra certification necessary for this type of weapon.  A man may have what is essentially a sporting rifle, a .22 sporting rifle, but by removing the pistol from the breech he may have a lethal weapon that is far from sporting and that can be used in circumstances completely apart from sport.  This is a very dangerous type of weapon, and I would ask the Minister to ensure that some extra certification would be necessary for this particular type of weapon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Senator Kelly's point first.  I think he may be under certain misconceptions with regard to this problem.  His amendment here, amendment No. 11, relates only to military-type weapons and the number of licensed military-type weapons in this country is small. When I say small I mean that .303 rifles form the main part of the number. The number of those that are licensed are something over 400.</P>
      <P>The point that Senator Kelly is trying to deal with here in his amendment No. 11 is the case of persons who already hold a military-type weapon under a certificate but want to hold a second weapon.  I am advised that the number of people who hold more than one military-type weapon under certificate is about 12.  Senator Kelly may have fallen into the trap of being too concerned with those who are legally holding the weapons.  The real people we are worried about are those who do not bother to get certificates for obvious reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult, as things stand, to get a certificate for a .303 rifle.  It is extremely difficult to get a certificate for a second one or for some other type of military weapon.  Sometimes a <Col N="586" /> .303 licence is given for shooting deer. A certificate is sometimes given also for some type of pistol that is highly effective at short range to finish off animals for the purpose of avoiding cruelty.  For that reason Senator Kelly's amendment would really achieve very little.  In addition, the fact that the Senator would seek to make the Minister the person responsible for giving a certificate would not, in practice, be very effective, because the Minister, in deciding whether or not to give a certificate, would have to take cognisance of the local superintendent's report or recommendation.  The local superintendent is the person who gives or refuses the certificate anyway.</P>
    <P>Senator Lyons referred to a remarkable weapon.  From his description of it, it sounds very dangerous.  It is doubtful whether a local superintendent would give a certificate for it at all unless the person getting the certificate was known to him to be reliable.  A single certificate would hardly cover such a weapon and two quite separate and distinct certificates might be necessary &mdash; one for the rifle and a separate and much more difficult certificate to obtain for the pistol.  If the type of weapon to which Senator Lyons referred were to become common in this country, it could be declared by order of the Minister under section 3 (2) (B) (b) to be especially dangerous and it would be brought under the military-type category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that the number of people who would be affected by my amendment is very small.  The point which the Minister made in regard to himself and the power which I wish the House to give him is not a valid one.  There are plenty of cases in which <Col N="587" /> an authority of a higher order is given an exclusive jurisdiction in something not because the subordinate authorities were not trusted and not because their advice is not going to be sought, but simply to make it somewhat more difficult, or to attach more significance to the making of an application.  If I found myself in a situation where not the local superintendent, but a Minister, would have to give me permission for something, I would feel that a more stringent control was being placed on me.  I cannot believe that a Minister, although he will take into account the advice given by his permanent officials or in this case, by the Garda, would not exercise a discretion of his own in some cases.</P>
      <P>In view of what the Minister says I will not press this amendment.  Will the Minister tell us what other criteria which, according to his information, a superintendent of the Garda Síochána exercises in regard to weapons like pistols?  The House would like to know what kind of criteria, if the Minister can tell us off the cuff, a superintendent exercises in regard to even these dozen people we were talking about who have more than one gun.  I know the Principal Act lays down certain general standards in theory, but I should like to know if the Minister can tell us what kind of people in practice, if he does not regard it dangerous to the public order or dangerous to the people themselves, would obtain a licence for more than one lethal firearm, not being of a sporting kind.</P>

      <P>There are some aspects of this question which I cannot talk about for obvious reasons.  The granting of a licence for what we now describe in this debate as a military type weapon is rarely if ever decided by the local superintendent without referring it to the Commissioner's office, even where he is fully satisfied.  The 1925 Act, section 4, as amended, sets out factors which must be taken into account by a superintendent in deciding whether or not to grant a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the .303 rifle is concerned, one of the main reasons that a certificate <Col N="588" /> is given for it is for deer shooting. I understand it is regarded as cruel to shoot a deer with a bullet of a calibre less than .303 because it will not kill it.  Deer shot with .22 rifles have died in agony several days later.  Pistol licences are granted very often to genuine sportsmen who would want to finish off animals of different types but who do not want to use their rifle or shotgun.  It is quicker and less cruel to use this method.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This may not be of any assistance, but it seems to me that, so far as firearms certificates are concerned, section 4 of the 1925 Act does give the superintendent power to have regard to the question of public safety. Sections 4 and 5 would both entitle the superintendent to have regard to the question of public safety.  This is on the issuing of firearms certificates.  The particular case to which the Minister referred on the Second Reading discussion was the case of a collector, who rather than get individual certificates, had himself registered as a registered firearms dealer.  The Minister makes the point that under the Finance Act that operation would become more expensive.</P>
      <P>Am I incorrect in thinking that section 9 of the Firearms Act, 1925, already gives the Minister very strong powers to deal with that position once the person seeks to have himself registered as a firearms dealer?  Subsection (3) of section 9 of the 1925 Act provides that</P>
      <P>any person who applies in accordance with the provisions of this section to be registered in the Register of Firearms Dealers and pays the fee for the time being required by law and satisfies the Minister that he is immediately about to carry on business as a firearms dealer in premises suitable for that business, may be registered in such register.  But when considering any such application for registration, the Minister shall have regard to the character of the applicant and generally to the public safety and preservation of the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that under existing legislation, the Minister himself is entitled to <Col N="589" /> take into consideration questions of public safety and preservation of the peace.  He is not only entitled but is required to take those matters into consideration in connection with applications for the registration of a firearms dealer.  Under sections 4 and 5 of that Act the ordinary firearms certificate can be adjudicated upon by the Garda superintendent, having regard to the question of public safety which was mentioned in paragraph 4.  The superintendent should be satisfied that such person can be permitted to have in his possession, use and carry a firearm or ammunition without danger to the public safety or to the peace.  By and large, the existing law covers the position from the public safety point of view, both in relation to firearms certificates and in relation to registration as firearms dealers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 1,100 dealers at the moment.  We do not anticipate that the £25 duty will have an enormous effect; certainly it will have some effect.  There will be power to register subject to the condition.  The section which I have put in here is associated with section 51.  If we confine dealing to ammunition for sporting firearms only &mdash; if I might go back for a moment to the point we were dealing with earlier in our discussion on this amendment &mdash; this amendment relates only to military-type weapons and to second or subsequent military-type weapons.  The problem that gave rise in Senator Kelly's mind to this amendment, and in my mind to section 51 and to the new section here, arose principally out of the case which was referred to previously.  It was said that ten or 11 guns were taken somewhere in the midlands.  The significant thing about that case was that all those guns were sporting-type guns.  They were .22 rifles and shotguns, so they would not come under Senator Kelly's amendment. Experience shows that the vast majority of these so-called dealers, who are in fact collectors, do not collect .303s or lethal or military-type weapons: they collect .22s and shotguns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one figure that I want to correct somewhat, although I cannot <Col N="590" /> correct it to a precise figure.  It is the figure of approximately 12, which I gave to Senator Kelly.  The actual figure may be more than that.  I cannot give a precise figure other than to say that it is more than 12.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we take it that where somebody applies for a licence for a second military-type weapon, the superintendent of the Garda Síochána would have regard to the fact that he already has got one such weapon?  Such person would not be in the situation of a citizen applying for the first time for a weapon?  I presume that a stricter and closer look will be taken at the situation than was taken the first time he applied.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has just said, has he any information which may be relevant to the opposition expressed to the amendment? Has the Minister any information with reference to the number of people who already hold more than one weapon, not being a military-type weapon?  The Minister says that those holding military-type weapons are only 12 in number.  What about all the other people?  What about those who hold all these shotguns, .22s and so on?  It would be of assistance to the House if the Minister could give us an idea of this figure, and also of the total number of licensed guns in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given nearly all those figures in the Dáil about two months ago.  Unfortunately, I have not got them with me now.  The figure for the total number of licensed guns in the country is about 110.000.  I cannot be more precise.  I am advised that the number of those who would have two shotguns would be in excess of 5,000.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the public interest would be involved in the security of these weapons if a person has a collection of guns that could be described as sporting guns or as military weapons.  Perhaps it is this public interest in security that is at least partly behind Senator Kelly's amendment, which is worth considering.  A person might not have the necessary precautions to safeguard a collection of sporting weapons.  There is the potential danger that, if there were a dozen or more sporting weapons in a person's house, they might be taken for non-sporting use.</P>
