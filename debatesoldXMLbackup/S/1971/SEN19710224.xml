      <P>May I request leave to move the adjournment of the Seanad for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance under Standing Order No. 26?</P>
      <P>Firstly, there is the decision by the secondary teachers' association to take strike action from next Tuesday.  May I just say very briefly, in support of this, that this decision has been taken as a fact by the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland?  That is the first major point.  The second point is that it is only the Minister who can avert a strike by making an offer to the secondary teachers which is acceptable to them.  In the third place, it is the last possible opportunity we will have in the Seanad to discuss such a matter.  I request favourable consideration of this.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for having given me prior notice, as is the custom of the House, of his intention to request to move the adjournment of the Seanad on a definite matter of urgent public importance.  I have carefully considered the matter but must rule, in accordance with precedent, that the motion is not one contemplated by the Standing Order.  This ruling is, of course, without prejudice to the right of the Senator, or, indeed, of any Senator, to give notice of motion in the usual way in respect of this matter.</P>

      <P>The Chair's decision is based on the Standing Order which provides that matters of this kind, to be raised under this particular Standing Order, must be definite matters of public importance.  The Chair, as it has already stated, feels that this particular matter is not, at the moment, sufficiently definite to bring it within the ambit of the Standing Order.</P>

      <P>There is a line of precedents, going back 40 years, of decisions on the basis of this Standing Order.  In each case the Chair has decided, where it considered that the matter was not urgent or not of sufficient public importance or not definite, that it must rule out the proposal in question.</P>

      <P>The Chair, as already stated, appreciates the very <Col N="849" /> great importance of this matter.  However, the Chair is bound by Standing Orders in this as in all other matters. As the Chair understands the matter, a further offer has been made by the Department which may or may not be the subject of a ballot, which may or may not mean the acceptance of this particular offer.  At the moment we do not know.  The matter proposed to be raised is, therefore, uncertain and hypothetical.  It does not comply with the first requirement I have mentioned, that is, that the matter should be definite in a manner contemplated by the Standing Order.  The Senator will appreciate that the mere fact that a matter is of great public importance &mdash;as this clearly is&mdash;does not necessarily bring it within the ambit of this very narrowly defined Standing Order.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1,2 and 3.</P>
      <P>If the House agrees, I should like that the precedent established in the other House in connection with the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1971, be adhered to here.  The question of the tribunal which forms the subject of a motion here has been mentioned and No. 1&mdash;the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1971&mdash; could encompass a debate on that tribunal. I should like to suggest to the Seanad that with the agreement of the House, if this Bill were given the same expeditious despatch as it received from the other House, the Minister's Estimate will be taken in the Dáil today or tomorrow, and he has undertaken to return to the Seanad immediately that Estimate is finished and to devote the whole day to the discussion on that motion.  The debate on the Broadcasting Bill could therefore be confined to the subject with which it deals.  If the House agrees, I suggest that that will be the proper procedure to adopt.</P>

      <P>Are we sitting tomorrow to discuss a motion, this being the first week in which the scheme for the House sitting on one day of each month to discuss motions is in operation? Secondly, I should like to ask the Leader of the House, if the House agrees, whether under this arrangement if the Minister returns to the House to discuss the motion on the 7 Days Tribunal, would this count as a motion for next month, or would we take the motion relating to the EEC, as has been suggested?</P>

      <P>The Senator need have no worries about motions. If she reads the arrangement which was arrived at here by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and confirmed by the Seanad on the last occasion, she will find out how it is proposed to take motions.  This is a separate proposition altogether from the idea of another motion.  I am asking for it with the idea of expediting the business of the House and to enable this Broadcasting Bill, which is a Certified Money Bill, to be despatched in the same efficient way as was done in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This short and straightforward Bill has one purpose, namely, to provide statutory authority for the payment of grants in respect of net revenue from broadcasting licence fees to Radio Teliefís Éireann during the two years ending 31st March, 1972. By net revenue is meant the total receipts less the costs of collection and any expenses incurred by my Department in dealing with the prevention of interference in regard to the reception of broadcasting programmes.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the 1966 Amendment Act provided for the making of these payments in respect of the five consecutive years ending on 31st March, 1970, and the present Bill proposes to extend that five years to seven.  This arrangement for the payment to the Authority of the full net revenue has applied since the Authority was established in 1960.  The payments are made by way of Grant-in-Aid voted by the Dáil under a subhead of the Post Office Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> Whereas the Principal Act of 1960 and the Amendment Act of 1966 each provided for grants for a period of five years, the present Bill is for two years only.  This is because it is an interim measure.  Certain changes of an administrative kind in the Broadcasting Acts are under consideration.  More important still.  I wish to consider the question of arranging a general review of the progress made by the Authority in the ten years of its existence. There is much to be said for such a periodic examination of the affairs of any semi-State body, but it is especially necessary in the case of any organisation that wields so much influence and is so much in the public eye as the national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>When the Broadcasting Authority Bill which, with amendments, later became the Act of 1960 was introduced in this House, it was difficult to foresee how the proposed television service would fare, what would be its impact on the public and how it would affect the sound broadcasting service which the Authority was to take over. Some people doubted whether Irish television would be a viable proposition at all in view of the competition which it would have to face over a large part of the country from two established British services with vastly superior resources.</P>
    <P>In the event the television service was established on a sound financial basis in a remarkably short time and the Authority has achieved a high degree of success in its development of both the sound and television services. Indeed, Radio Telefís Éireann can fairly claim to have given general satisfaction to users.  The fact that they have encountered a healthy measure of criticism does not detract from the merits of that claim.</P>
    <P>I have not as yet had an opportunity to give full consideration to the important question whether a review should be undertaken now or postponed; if an early review be decided upon, what form it should take, and what the scope of its inquiries should be.  With the possibility of such a review in the offing and looking to developments already under way such as the provision of Gaeltacht radio stations, the advent of communal <Col N="853" /> aerials and the prospect in the more distant future of colour television, I do not feel that the Government or the Oireachtas should be asked to commit themselves at this stage to continue the existing financial arrangements for any considerable term ahead.  Hence the short period proposed to be covered in the Bill before you.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the progress and achievements of the Authority from its annual reports and accounts, all of which were duly laid before the House.  The Seanad also has had opportunities of discussing broadcasting affairs on a number of occasions since the Principal Act was passed in 1960.  With regard to the finances of Radio Telefís Éireann with which this Bill is primarily concerned, the Authority has done considerably better than was expected.  The 1960 Act authorises the making by the Exchequer of repayable advances to RTE to a total of two million pounds. The Amendment Act of 1964 raised this ceiling to three millions, and it was envisaged then, and for some years after, that even more would be required to enable the services to be developed in a manner conforming to the needs of national broadcasting.  In fact, however, the total of the capital advances to the authority have come to £1,851,000, which means that it is £149,000 short of the sum authorised in 1960 and no part of the additional £1 million for which statutory approval was given in 1964 has been drawn.</P>
    <P>During the first four years of the five-year period covered by the 1966 Act, the buoyancy of licence and advertising revenue enabled the Authority to show an overall surplus of revenue over expenditure, despite sharp increases in costs, a licence fee unchanged since 1963, and a substantial loss each year on the radio service.  Towards the end of the period, however, there was a general levelling-off in growth of licences and in the fifth year the surplus was converted to a small deficit. The actual figures were as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> The last year's deficit was caused by a loss of £676,029 on the sound broadcasting service, which was not fully offset by a surplus of £654,646 on the television service.</P>
    <P>The surpluses earned in the first four years mentioned above together with drawings from depreciation provisions were ploughed back into the development and expansion of the services, and capital assets were increased from £3,116,334 at the beginning of 1965-6 to £4,796,950 at the end of 1969-70.</P>
    <P>The Authority's capital requirements will be considerable for some time ahead.  A radio centre at Donnybrook is being completed and has to be equipped.  A new medium-wave radio transmitter is necessary for Athlone to replace the existing one and the problem of improving the reception of television in quite a few areas has to be solved.  In view of these and other continuing capital needs it would be unrealistic to expect the Authority to commence repaying its indebtedness to the State in the period to which the Bill relates.  It is, of course, paying interest on the moneys advanced from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, the licence fees were increased from July, 1970.  These increases were unavoidable; the authority faced financial difficulties which have not indeed been removed. The phasing out of cigarette advertising on television from 1st April next will mean a loss of about £300,000 a year which will be difficult to recoup from other sources.  Advertising last year accounted for more than 60 per cent of total income.  Many, including the Authority itself, consider the extent of this dependence on commercial revenue to be excessive and not in the best interests of the service.  Many would like to see it dropped altogether &mdash;and I sympathise with that view&mdash; but unfortunately a reduction in advertising could only be achieved by an increase in licence fees.  To cease advertising altogether would involve increasing the combined licence fee from its present level of £6 to about £14.</P>
    <P>Evasion of payment of licence fees is of course an ever present problem, increasing the burden of persons who <Col N="855" /> recognise their obligation to pay. Measures to reduce it, including the introduction of a Bill requiring the registration of purchases and hirings of sets, will be intensified.  I would like, at this stage, to warn unlicensed holders of sets that there will be little sympathy for them when they are detected.</P>
    <P>I referred at the outset to the fact that this is purely a financial measure. I am fully satisfied that the RTE Authority require the payments sought to be made under the Bill, and I am confident that Senators will share that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with the provision of financial support to the Broadcasting Authority and I take it, therefore, that it is in order if comment on the Bill ranges over the operations of the Authority which this financial provision is intended to support. Everybody has got his own opinions about the national broadcasting system and it is a topic which always draws wide-ranging contributions when it is on the agenda of this or the other House.  I will not treat the House to my views on the various programmes. I will limit my contribution to this debate to some general remarks about the financial position of Telefís Éireann and its financial operations, to its position of supposed monopoly, and to its specific obligations under the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>We know that Radio Telefís Éireann are short of money and word has been going round to the effect that so short are they of money that they may have to curtail some of their current affairs programmes.  I understand from acquaintances and friends within Telefís Éireann that these reports are exaggerated and that there is no proximate prospect of severe axing of current affairs programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, I think it important to state that virtually the only worthwhile service which Telefís Éireann provides are its current affairs programmes and its news broadcasts, in other words, its own programmes which it manufactures and puts out itself.  We can do without the imported <Col N="856" /> programmes: anyone who wants them can get something of the same kind on the British stations.  The only thing which justifies Telefís Éireann's existence at all&mdash;and the same goes for Radio Éireann, in my view&mdash;are the programmes which it makes and puts out itself.  These, in my own opinion, are of good quality.  I think they measure up well to what is put out by other stations.</P>
    <P>If these programmes are under threat either immediately or at some time in the foreseeable future because of shortage of money, the result seems to me to be that the way in which Telefís Éireann spends its money needs to be closely looked at.  Perhaps when the review of the first ten years of RTE's operations is inaugurated by the Minister, this will get the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>I noticed last week an item in the national newspapers which I think has a bearing on what I am talking about. It was a report of a Press conference held on the 17th February in order to apprise the Press of arrangements which were being made in connection with the Eurovision Song Contest.  The Eurovision Song Contest has been running for seven or eight years.  In the past it has been sponsored by national stations in other countries and it appears, to judge by this Press conference, to have generated a sort of etiquette of its own, not unlike the system whereby people buy rounds of drinks whether they can afford them or not.  If they sit in on the rounds to begin with they have got to fork out themselves when the time comes.</P>
    <P>The Telefís Éireann official who headed this Press conference expressed himself, according to the <i>Irish Times</i>, as follows:</P>
    <P>When we won in Amsterdam, we felt that there was no alternative to saying that we would put on the contest this year and that we would pick up the bill.</P>
    <P>The bill is to be, on Telefís Éireann's own figures, £35,000, not counting the time and salaries of about 200 members of their staff who will be engaged for a period, long or short, in getting this operation going.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> I know that what I am saying may be misinterpreted.  That is a risk one always takes.  I am not a &ldquo;little Irelander&rdquo; and I am far from saying that this country never ought to take part in any kind of international operation from which it may gain prestige.  I am not saying that at all.  But I am saying something which I hear Ministers saying very often when they are accused of being parsimonious with matters which the public would like to see more money spent on: we must cut our cloth according to our measure. When I hear rumours, even if they are not perhaps very solid rumours, to the effect that RTE are going to have to cut their current affairs programmes because of lack of money on the one hand, and when I see a report that the etiquette generated by the Eurovision Song Contest forces them to put their hand in their pocket for £35,000, on the other, I have to ask myself whether their financial affairs are conducted with the best interests of the country at heart.</P>
    <P>These words are not intended in any way as a criticism of the officials in Telefís Éireann who made this decision. Officials have to make decisions and they must be allowed occasionally to make mistakes and to go wrong.  I am not asserting that this is necessarily a wrong or a bad decision.  I would want to have much more information about the situation out there in order to be sure about it.  But I think it is worth saying that if any current affairs programme is under threat, when we find simultaneously a very large sum of money being spent not because there is a legal obligation to do so, not because there is even what I might call a very strong social obligation to do so, but simply because a convention has been generated by this Eurovision Song Contest, then I think we are in danger of paying a very high price for something, or of throwing away something much more valuable instead of it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what it would cost to put on the kind of current affairs programme which is well thought of.  I do not know, for example, what the annual budget of <i>7 Days</i> would be or of <i>Féach</i> or of the extremely good series of programmes called <i>Report</i><Col N="858" /> which were put out during the winter. I cannot make a guess at that, but I imagine that £35,000 would amply cover a season of such programmes.  If the result of the economies which face RTE is to be that we are to have to do without a programme of that kind simply in order to meet what are supposed to be obligations under the Eurovision Song Contest etiquette, then I think we have made a poor bargain.</P>
    <P>I was glad when the Irish contestant won the Eurovision Song Contest, just as I am glad if an Irish person does well in any walk of life.  However, I observe that the people who are the main beneficiaries of that song contest are the promoters and the writers of the songs and the people who subsequently make records of these songs and sell them make gigantic profits.  I do not begrudge them the profits but how can a station such as Telefís Éireann, which is operating on a shoestring, afford to subsidise this kind of operation to this degree?</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this point but I hope that I have made an impression on the Minister and on the people on the other side of the House. I believe I speak for most Irish people when I say that we would think it a bad bargain to lose a good current affairs programme merely to have the honour of conducting the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin.  We could still see it no matter where it was held, even if it was held in Reikjavik.  In other words, the ordinary viewer would not be done out of the Eurovision Song Contest even if were held somewhere else.  If the financial consequences of standing our round in the Eurovision Song Contest will result in the curtailing of current affairs programmes then we have made a bad bargain.</P>
    <P>Let me say in defence of the officials in Telefís Éireann who made this decision, something which is very much to their credit: I understand that the possibility of insuring against winning the Eurovision Song Contest was investigated a few years ago.  It was foreseen that, sooner or later, an Irish entrant might win the Eurovision Song Contest and then it would be time for Radio Telefís Éireann to stand their round and that it would be an expensive <Col N="859" /> round to stand.  Credit must be given to the officials of that organisation when they investigated the possibility of insuring themselves against that, much as the husband of an expectant mother insures himself against having twins.  Unfortunately, the insurance companies which were approached were not able to quote terms for this unprecedented and incalculable risk and so the idea came to nothing.  I want to make it absolutely clear that I do not, in any way, accuse the people of Telefís Éireann of wasting money or being extravagant or prodigal, but there is a financial calculation here which is of national importance.  I think I would have made the decision differently. I want to impress upon the Minister that if this authority is allowed to spend money on this scale in response to a mere convention or etiquette we will be paying a very high price for it if the few current affairs programmes which we have may be curtailed as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening address, spoke about advertising and about the role which advertising plays in the finances of Radio Telefís Éireann.  He mentioned, as being a point of view with which he had some sympathy, the idea that advertising might be dropped altogether.  He pointed out, quite rightly, that that would involve a very high cost in lost revenue on the authority and make their operations that much more difficult.</P>
    <P>In regard to the overall finance of a television or a broadcasting station we are down at the very bottom of the European league in regard to licence fees even though some people think the licence fee is high.  I may be laying myself open to misinterpretation&mdash; some Members of the other side of the House are too honourable to do that&mdash; but some might say: &ldquo;There is Fine Gael for you, they want to increase the television fees.&rdquo; What I am saying is my own point of view and it need not be attributed to the rest of my party.  I am not ashamed to say it and I would not be ashamed if my party held the view that the television licence fee at the moment is relatively low.  It works out at about 1½p per day.  It is right <Col N="860" /> down at the bottom of a list of comparative fees in other countries which I have here and which, if the House will be patient enough, I will read out very quickly.  The licence fees in other European countries are as follows: Sweden, £14.50: Austria, £13.60; Denmark, £12.65; Norway, £12.25; Switzerland, £11.90; Germany, £11.60; Netherlands, £8.65; Finland, £8.5; Belgium, £8; Italy, £8; France, £7.50; Great Britain, £6, which is now going up to £7 and to £12 for colour television. We are below all these countries. It would be worth our while to pay more via licence fees in order to rid ourselves of the disgusting albatross which advertising represents around the neck of a broadcasting service.  It would be well worthwhile to pay even the figure which the Minister mentioned.  I am inclined to doubt if that figure can be correct because I observe that even in Belgium, where no advertising is accepted on the national broadcasting network, the licence fee is only £8. Even if the Minister is correct, and I assume that his sources are more accurate than mine, it would not be a bad thing to have a high licence fee by increasing it two or three times in order to rid ourselves of this necessity to run advertising on our television and radio service.  The Minister has not been slow to increase postal charges by this kind of factor over the past few years.  The average small firm and the average citizen who, in the way of his business or the course of his profession, must use the postal service must spend far more than this figure every year in buying postage stamps.  I do not want to pre-empt my party's position in this regard, but for myself I would not oppose a very substantial increase in the licence fee if we could rid our service of advertising.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I recognise that that would bear hardly on some sections of the population, particularly on those who rely most on the broadcasting service in order to make their lives tolerable.  I am in no way suggesting that this should be an unqualified rise.  If a rise of this kind were made it ought to be graded in such a way that pensioners and people who, for one reason or another, are deserving cases should be exempted <Col N="861" /> from having to contribute in any way at all, just as they are to some extent at present.  It would be well worth our while, if we can get a good service free of advertising, to pay that extra money.</P>
    <P>What I object to is not so much the interruption which advertising represents, in the middle of a programme, and not so much the quality of the advertising, which is sometimes so vulgar as to make one ashamed of one's species, but what I object to is that, according to people who work in that station, the content of programmes has to be trimmed in order to suit the advertiser and programmes timed in order to suit the advertiser.  You cannot put on a programme of a certain kind at a peak viewing hour because the advertiser cannot be persuaded to associate the advertising of their product with it.  That imposes instantly a serious fetter on the freedom of the television station and it reduces to nonsense the obligation imposed on it by section 17 of the 1960 Act to have regard to the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture. There is not much money in either of these things, and the result is that they are pushed out to the far ends of the schedules, both in sight and in sound. I am against that.  If that obligation is to be taken seriously we must make it possible for Telefís Éireann to take it seriously, and we must relieve them of the burden which now lies on them and which ensures that programmes of a kind tending in this direction cannot be shown at a time when people are likely to be looking at them or listening to them.</P>
    <P>The second matter with which I want to deal is the question of the position of Telefís Éireann itself as a supposed monopoly.  I have noticed over the last year that every time a Minister in the position of the present Minister is asked in the Dáil if he will license this or that broadcasting enterprise the reply which always comes back, and which I presume is inspired by his Department, is that no broadcasting whatever can be permitted except broadcasting emanating from this authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> I have said and written this before, but I have never have had a chance to say it before in this House and I want to say it now in circumstances of the greatest solemnity that are accessible to me.  The Constitution of this country does not permit monopoly of broadcasting; it does not permit it and I do not care whether the body which lays claim to that monopoly is Radio Telefís Éireann or anybody else.  In my opinion under the Constitution of this country there can be no such thing as a monopoly of broadcasting except in so far as the monopoly may arise simply from the fact that nobody else wants to broadcast; but if Members would like to look at Article 40 of the Constitution they will find that the organs of public opinion are listed in such a way as not to differentiate between the Press and broadcasting. Who here would tolerate for an instant a monopoly of the Press?  No party in this State has ever tried to monopolise the Press, and I believe the people would not tolerate it if they did.  Nobody has ever tried to enforce a monopoly of the cinema, which is also mentioned in the same breath by the Constitution; and it would not be tolerated if such a thing were attempted.  Why, therefore, must we assume that a monopoly of broadcasting is permissible?  In my opinion, it is not permissible; it is clearly, or perhaps I should say inferentially, forbidden by the Constitution, and a Department or a Minister has no right to say: &ldquo;You may not broadcast because RTE has a monopoly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not alone am I fortified in that point of view by the Constitution,  I am also fortified in it by the European Human Rights Convention which in the relevant section, Article 10, reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.  This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.  This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.</P>
    <P>The clear inference and the clear <Col N="863" /> meaning of that Article is that while the State is entitled to impose a licensing regime on broadcasting&mdash;I do not deny that and I would not dispute it for a second and I think that the State ought to be entitled to impose licensing control&mdash;while that permission exists, the permission to license, there is no basis in the European Human Rights Convention, any more than there is in the Constitution, for the idea that the State is entitled to monopolise the air. The State has no such right or title, and while I realise that this matter is not directly in point in what we are debating today, it is in a sense in point, because the only alternative to having commercial advertising on the national network is to have another network, as they have in Britain and in other countries, in which advertising is permitted and in which the people are allowed to make money out of the advertising.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is no such second channel or second network here, either in sight or in sound, and whenever the question of having one has been raised the answer from the Minister's Department has always been the same.  It is an answer which is utterly without foundation in law, either the law of this Constitution or the law of the European Human Rights Convention to which this State has subscribed. It is a point of view which is absolutely wrong from beginning to end, and that must be said unambiguously in this House, even if it has never been said in the other House.</P>
    <P>The last occasion on which this point of view was put forward by the Minister, or his predecessor, was in connection with the question as to whether the State would permit Radio Chonamara to continue its broadcasting in Irish. That was a station set up by some young people over in Connemara who were not satisfied with the Irish broadcasting in Radio Éireann and who wanted to produce their own programmes. I am not defending and I never have defended activity which is outside the law or which goes alongside the law or tries to overlook the law or treat it as if were not there, but the answer which was given to the Deputies&mdash;Deputy Begley of our party <Col N="864" /> and Deputy Boland who was then an Independent&mdash;was that no such permission could be given because of the monopoly held by RTE; I am paraphrasing the reply.  That answer was wrong, and in my view people in the situation of the young men running Radio Chonamara are entitled to be told that the State has no right to prevent people broadcasting on principle and that if the State refuse to operate a proper licensing regime there can be no reason to refrain from taking the State to law and having that declaration made by a court.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating a free-for-all in broadcasting; I am not advocating that the present law, wrong though it is, should be broken, and I never have advocated nor would advocate it.  I want to make it clear in the Minister's hearing and the hearing of his officials that that point of view is utterly wrong, and that the sooner this State gets around to considering what would be appropriate criteria for the licensing of an independent station the better.</P>
    <P>I want to see these criteria debated in each House of the Oireachtas and I want them to be fair criteria.  I do not want to find on waking up one morning that an independent radio or television station has sprung into being with the blessing of the Minister and that it is being run by some kind of consortium.  Past experience leads me to suspect only too clearly what shape and colour that consortium would have. We must have a proper law governing the licensing of further broadcasting enterprises, even though at the moment it may not be economic to have a second broadcasting enterprise at all; but perhaps it would become economic and when that day comes a serious enterprise which wishes to use the wavelengths of this country to broadcast in this country cannot be prevented from doing so merely because it suits the Government to keep RTE in a position of monopoly.  It cannot lawfully or constitutionally be prevented from doing so and, rather than have a nasty row when the time comes, I suggest that the Minister and his Department should give some thought to a Bill&mdash; if you like an amendment to the Bill already in front of us&mdash;which will provide <Col N="865" /> criteria for the licensing of other stations and which will ensure that these other stations will not have a particular political or social or religious or any kind of sectional complexion; which will make sure, in other words, that we will not have to be looking over our shoulders at the independent station in the same way as we do at Radio Telefís Éireann&mdash;although on the question of impartiality I have no complaints to make about RTE.</P>
    <P>I believe that on the whole RTE observe their duty to be impartial as well as they can.  That does not mean that there are not programmes that I would rather not have seen, and it does not mean that I do not think undue prominence is given to trivialities such as opening of bootlace factories by Ministers, showing them grinning on the screen&mdash;it is not a news item at all. I think that a great deal of prominence is given to trivial things like that, to the ordinary parts of a Minister's daily round, things which would not be seen at all on the television screens in another country&mdash;another democracy at least&mdash;that, perhaps, is something with which one might legitimately find fault.  But, by and large, I do not mind recording my view that RTE does behave impartially on the whole; and certainly so far as parliamentary reporting is concerned it would be a very carping man indeed who would find fault with what they do.</P>
    <P>Those are my views therefore on the question of RTE's alleged or supposed monopoly and my advice is to the effect that the Government should immediately consider further legislation to make provision for the day when someone is going to want to put on a serious independent service outside RTE.  They cannot constitutionally be prevented from doing so, but they can, I think, be licensed and control can properly be exercised.  Now is the time to be giving thought to that and not when the thing may boil up into a nasty political row.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to deal with concerns the national objectives which section 17 of the 1960 Act imposes upon Radio Telefís Éireann as a constant aim.  I have already said that the duty of satisfying advertisers, of keeping <Col N="866" /> happy the people who are selling us things and trying to get us to buy more things&mdash;even things we do not want&mdash;has to a large extent, in my view, frustrated the aim behind section 17.  At the same time I must, in fairness to RTE, say that on television their services to the Irish language are respectable.  I think more could be done but I realise that a balance must be kept and that many people prefer to see a programme in the language which they understand and these people may be in the majority.  Let me say that I have been surprised at the number of people who view Irish language programmes.  Formerly, I imagined that the number of people who viewed these programmes was small but I appeared on a number of these programmes during the last year and I was amazed at the number of people who had been watching them. This is a very encouraging thing.  Even people whose knowledge of Irish is limited find these programmes interesting, find it perhaps a bit of a challenge to watch a programme like <i>Féach</i> or <i>Agallamh</i> and see what they can make of it.  The television medium is something which offers enormous potentiality in the direction of maintaining respect for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I am by no means a believer in an instant solution for the Irish language problem any more than I believe that an instant solution can be found for the Partition problem.  I do not, for one second, believe that Radio Telefís Éireann alone can restore the language. I am not even sure that it can be restored at all as the everyday spoken language of the entire people.  But I believe that a holding operation is necessary until such time as the Irish language, in some shape or form, perhaps geographically small, finally gets a firm toe-hold from which it can no longer be dislodged.  That time has not yet arrived, but it may arrive, and it is up to us to make sure that nothing is done, in the meantime, which makes that development impossible.  To that extent the potentiality of Radio Telefís Éireann as the medium of a holding operation&mdash;if I am describing it clearly enough&mdash;is extremely important.  Their function in keeping the Irish language <Col N="867" /> in people's houses and before their eyes is extremely important and extremely valuable.  On the whole, so far as television is concerned, that duty has been well carried out.  I have heard complaints that the same cannot be said of the sound broadcasting.  I would not like to judge on that aspect of it, because I am not a devoted radio listener.</P>
    <P>The importance of this aspect of the authority's operations seems to me to be extreme, and anything which stands in the authority's way, such as the necessities imposed by advertising, needs to be removed if the authority are to discharge this duty properly.</P>
    <P>That is not the only duty which section 17 places on the authority.  It is also supposed to &ldquo;preserve and develop the national culture.&rdquo;  I think the phrase &ldquo;national culture&rdquo; is an overworked, weak and useless piece of jargon.  We all have different pictures in our minds when we hear the expression &ldquo;national culture&rdquo; used.  But I know exactly what is not the national culture.  I can recognise immediately something which could not possibly come under the category of national culture, even though I might find it hard to define what is national culture. I know very well what does not fit into that description.  Many of the imported shows which Radio Telefís Éireann put on fit very easily into the description of &ldquo;un-national culture&rdquo;.  I hope I never have been, or never will be, narrow-minded in this regard and I am in no way complaining about tastelessness or anything of that kind.  I am complaining about the utter triviality and, in the general sense, the vulgarity of some of these imported television programmes.  I am not complaining that they are tasteless or have occasions of sin in them, but that they are absolutely mindless.  Those shows, which sometimes last for an hour &mdash; until some light relief comes on in the shape of the news or the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis or something of that kind &mdash; are paid for and brought in here, I presume, in order to support the advertising which interrupts and surrounds them and encloses them at each end.  So long as Radio Telefís Éireann are not provided with enough money to look after the <Col N="868" /> national culture &mdash; weak though that phrase may be &mdash; and to make their own programmes we cannot expect the authority to fulfil the duties laid down in section 17.  Radio Telefís Éireann should be enabled to make their own programmes, whatever they may be about, which is, after all, what national culture is.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not left anyone here under any misapprehension about what I mean in that regard.  If Radio Telefís Éireann decide to make a programme, say, about the progress of drainage scheme or something of that kind, it may have a limited appeal, but it deserves to be ranked, for the purpose of section 17, under the heading of national culture.  This phrase just does not mean singing, dancing, intoning ballads or playing uilleann pipes.  It means the possibility of television mirroring our whole lives for us and projecting the things which we experience and about which we feel strongly or the things which are happening to our neighbours about which we would not otherwise hear.  The authority, at present, are expected to do the impossible both in regard to the Irish language and in regard to the national culture if they have this financial millstone around their neck whereby they are dependent on advertising and obliged, in order to keep the advertising people happy, to import these revolting programmes and put them on hour after hour at peak-viewing times such as Saturday evenings.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that much of what I have said may sound doctrinaire and narrow-minded.  I do not mean it to sound like that but I would wish that this television and radio station would be able to provide, during their entire hours of operation, the same good quality viewing which they provide during the honours in which they provide their own programmes.  That would be my wish.  If they could achieve that standard they would be earning the thanks of all of us.  I urge the Minister to bring the same courage&mdash;or should I call it recklessness&mdash;to bear on the question of television licences as he and his predecessors have brought to bear on postage stamps.  If we could achieve this kind of service, even by <Col N="869" /> putting up the price of a television licence to £12 or £15 a year, we would be getting a good bargain.  I would repeat that I am speaking here for myself and not for my party, but that I would not be a bit ashamed if my party formally were to propose that solution.</P>
    <P>The final remark I want to make bears on the possibilities open to Radio Telefís Éireann in regard to the North of Ireland.  Radio Telefís Éireann existed during nine years, from 1960 to 1969, of comparative peace in the North of Ireland.  Those were years of ecumenism&mdash;years of religious ecumenism and, if you like, political ecumenism&mdash;and they were years in which an opportunity might have been taken to use this medium as a forum where people from the North could meet each other, talk to each other, argue with each other and, perhaps in a mild way, fight with each other. That opportunity might have been taken, but it was not taken.  There were occasional programmes about the North.  I admit there has been a tremendous amount of coverage of Northern affairs lately but it has not all been of the kind that would make people friendlier with each other. Perhaps that is unavoidable because events have dictated that it should be that way.</P>
    <P>That opportunity has been missed during the last nine years.  It may be boring for the average Dublin, Cork, or Galway viewer to have to listen to men with Ulster accents arguing with each other about housing allocations in Dungannon or something of that kind, but it may have a great effect up in Northern Ireland.  I believe that if Radio Telefís Éireann could establish themselves as an all-Ireland station, even what we think of, perhaps wrongly, as the other side in the North would begin to look at it.  I believe that Radio Telefís Éireann should take on the Ulster stations on their own ground, even at the cost of boring some of our viewers in this part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about a 32-county State we must begin to look at things in this way.  The television medium is a uniquely effective way of presenting <Col N="870" /> people to one another, of getting them to understand one another, of making their problems immediate.  There is no need to offer the House a eulogy of television; it has been done before and will be done again.  But that is an opportunity which Telefís Éireann missed.  I do not blame the authority for missing it, because the Government missed it as well.  The Government did not give an hour's thought to the North of Ireland during the 1960s until the trouble broke out.  Perhaps other parties were not much better in that respect; I am not making a political point of it.  We all neglected the North during these years.  Now we see how important it is to get people to understand each other and to be able to live with one another.</P>
    <P>We should all encourage Telefís Éireann to devote a period two or three times each week to a programme of some type which will get Northern people of every kind involved in discussions on current affairs.  These may be of small interest in this part of the country but will have a positive effect up there.</P>
    <P>I am not expert enough to outline what I think is called the chemistry of such a programme.  I leave that to television journalists.  They should be well able to contrive it.  They should be allowed and encouraged to do this. If I had any amendment to offer on the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, it would be to extend section 17 in order to add what has always been taken to be this general national objective&mdash;the reconciliation of all Irish people whatever their origins or whatever their class or religion&mdash;to the national objectives of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the attention of the House, and I urge the Minister to do his best to give Telefís Éireann the freedom which it needs in order to do the job which all Irish people, in their heart of hearts, expect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware that there are a number of people here who will want to say something on the general activities of Telefís Éireann, so <Col N="871" /> I will confine myself to one or two matters.  These I mentioned before, back in 1967.  It did not bear very much fruit then.</P>
      <P>I agree practically <i>in toto</i> with what Senator Kelly has said about the Eurovision Contest.  He described Telefís Éireann as working on a shoestring budget.  The figures I have here do not give that impression at all.  They are very substantial for a service of this kind.</P>
      <P>In 1967 I raised the question of our orchestras.  We have two fine orchestras &mdash;possibly the best in Europe&mdash;the Light Orchestra and the Symphony Orchestra.  Since 1967 I cannot recall seeing the Symphony Orchestra featured in a programme on Telefís Éireann.  The Light Orchestra is usually used as a backing for a few personalities. The RTE Report for 1967 gives the total cost of the RTE Symphony Orchestra as £193,000.  Receipts from concerts totalled £12,700, leaving a total net cost of £180,000.  If Parkinson's Law has operated in that sphere, as it has over the whole service, I am sure that figure is much higher now.  I cannot understand how the programme arrangers cannot use these two first-class orchestras to give a concert once a month at least to the people who pay the licence fees.  So far as I know these orchestras, particularly the Symphony Orchestra, visit Limerick and Cork occasionally and give a few concerts in Dublin.  When I see some of the trash which is imported at considerable cost, it leaves me aghast that there is not sufficient ingenuity among the programme arrangers to give the ordinary people a chance of hearing these two very fine orchestras.  In 1967, the total amount of time given on television to home-produced classical music, which, I presume, would involve the Symphony Orchestra, was .4 of 1 per cent.  Similar music, such as ballet and opera, from imported sources was .6 of 1 per cent. In 1969 the figure was ½ of 1 per cent and the figure for imported music was 1 per cent.  So we provided ½ of 1 per cent ourselves and imported 1 per cent. In 1970, we improved a little bit. Serious music, ballet and opera, was 1.4 per cent of the total programme. The imported version was 1.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> How can one talk about shoestrings, the cost of programmes, the cost of importing programmes, the difficulties in providing programmes, when we have these two excellent means of providing entertainment on our own payroll and are not using them?  Are there a number of people with influence who quarter up the total television time and allocate to themselves so much time as to monopolise the service so that no time is left available for orchestral music?  The people in rural areas are not all musical poltroons. Many of them are capable of appreciating and would regard it as a great treat to have, even once a month, a short concert provided by either one of these orchestras.</P>
    <P>The total cost of providing a television service this year runs into £3,679,000.  If out of that only .14 per cent of the total time is allotted to orchestral music, somebody should have his head examined.  I do not want to say any more about it because the wisest heads that could be put together would never bring about a collection of programmes that would suit everybody. But there should be some criterion by which priorities would be set and flippant programmes might take a back place at least once a month.  Taking into account the total cost of the two orchestras it is terrible that they are relegated practically to an umbra from which they are unlikely to emerge unless somebody does something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree very substantially with much of Senator Kelly's speech.  With some of it I disagree, and I shall make it clear why. On the question of monopolies to which he referred, like him, I do not hold that the Government hold a monopoly situation.  But it seems to me that the question of whether the Government choose to derogate from their <i>de facto</i> monopoly is a political rather than a constitutional question, and perhaps could be approached constructively on those lines.  For instance, I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about the hypothetical situation in which somebody comes to him with a proposition for a non-profit-making radio which <Col N="873" /> would eschew politics and labour disputes. That is one which would operate roughly within the terms of the Broadcasting Act, in that it would exclude political advertising and advertising relating to labour disputes.  I should be interested to see if the Minister would at least consider this kind of proposition sympathetically or if he would turn it down out of hand.  Some specialists in communications technology and the philosophy of communications will agree that sometimes, in some concrete circumstances, you can make a case for commercial radio, but not for commercial television.</P>
      <P>That is simply by the way.  I hope to speak almost exclusively about the financing operation of Telefís Éireann and to say a few words about the effects of this financing.  I should like to think that we would maintain high standards in this House in the matter of not mentioning persons who are not here to defend themselves.  In previous debates in this House, and elsewhere, on broadcasting it was a habit to mention people who were not here to defend themselves.  It has tended to creep in more in this area than in any other and it should be a challenge to us to avoid this sort of thing.  Of course, there may be some people who would be as alarmed at being praised by the Leader of the House as they would be at being criticised by Senator Kelly.  Or perhaps it is the other way round. However, it is incumbent on us all to maintain the strictest standards in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of licences, with which this Bill is primarily concerned, I should like first of all to comment on what the Minister has said in relation to the present financing arrangements for RTE.  He said that something over 60 per cent of their revenue comes from advertising and the remainder from licences.  In order to make the station completely self-sufficient it would be necessary to increase the licence fee by some very considerable amount&mdash;apparently to a total of £14.  Senator Kelly said that he would not be against this as a means of raising revenue and as a means of funding the authority.  He had some relevant statistics from other countries. <Col N="874" /> However, I would be against a total funding of the authority from the proceeds of licences.  This is not because I am in favour of advertising&mdash;far from it&mdash;but because it is self-evident that the broadcasting media, radio and television, both attract to an inordinate degree the attention of the Government in any country in which they happen to be situated.  While it is true that in their attitudes towards the broadcasting media, Governments, including this Government, very frequently have the best interests of the whole community in mind, it is equally true that there are occasions when they do not.  When Governments or members thereof seek to influence the media in a sectional, rather than in a national way, it appears to me that if the total revenue of any broadcasting station here or anywhere else were to come completely in this way&mdash;through the licence fee&mdash;it would reinforce this tendency in Government.  For this reason, I am not in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I do believe there could be an adjustment in the licence rate.  Perhaps the Minister was being purposely ingenuous when he spoke in terms of two alternatives: the present £6 and the hypothetical £12 or £14.  It is not at all difficult to see that these are not the only alternatives.  It should be possible to increase the licence fee by a certain amount, at least to bring it to the point where a greater percentage of the station's income would be coming from licence fees than from advertising.  The degree to which this could be done would presumably be a matter for a judgment on the basis of commercial as well as political criteria. This should be seriously investigated. Obviously, people who would be horrified if the licence fee were suddenly to be doubled or more than doubled might take in a slightly more kindly fashion to an increase which was intelligently and cogently presented to them, a figure considerably less than the £14 but which would have the effect of reducing the station's dependence on advertising. This would therefore reduce all the bad effects which this dependence has on the programming of the station as a whole.  I will not go into the effect this undue dependence on advertising has on programming&mdash;Senator Kelly <Col N="875" /> dealt with that very well&mdash;but there is a very strong case to be made for a greater increase to allow the major part of the revenue to come from licence fees.</P>
    <P>There is also another matter upon which I should like to hear the Minister's views: the introduction of colour television.  It stands to reason that anybody who owns or rents a colour television set should be asked to pay considerably more for his licence than somebody with a set of the old type.  I should like to believe that the Minister agrees with that.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of radio licences.  We often forget that we have a radio service as well as a television service, and since the introduction of television radio has become very much the cinderella of the service.  This is very much to be regretted.  I spent some fruitless time today trying to find out the number of radio sets which are sold annually in this country and failed.  It is very difficult to come by the statistics.  It had been my intention to contrast this figure with the figure for radio licences alone and for joint radio and television licences, which I hoped I would get from RTE.  As I did not get the first figure, there was little point in looking for the second.  But I do not believe that one needs the exact statistics to come to the conclusion that there is a very large and, if anything, increasing number of unlicensed radio sets in this country.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the most logical approach to this problem might be to have only one type of licence, a joint radio and television licence, and to institute some kind of tax on the sale of radios which would be, in effect, a once-and-for-all licence and which would go perhaps to a specific object such as subsidy of the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra about which another Senator spoke.  I think this is the only possible way of controlling the radio situation.  Modern transistor radios are very small, they are becoming cheaper and are therefore becoming increasingly popular.  If we are serious in our attempts to license these sets and to make the people who listen to these sets pay for the radio service <Col N="876" /> which we are providing, I think this idea of a tax at sale as a once-and-for-all licence, to go specifically to the radio service, would be a very useful one.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly spoke, and indeed the Minister spoke too, about the ratio of advertising to licence fee money.  There is a sort of sub-area here which I feel the Minister should also examine fairly closely.  Few people are aware of the vast cost of making, let alone broadcasting, television commercials and equally few people are aware of the extent to which these television commercials have to be made almost overwhelmingly outside the country.  Few people are aware that the cost of the commercial, plus the cost of the broadcasting time, is such as to squeeze out of television all but the very biggest advertisers&mdash;in effect the international and multi-national conglomerate companies.</P>
    <P>A practical improvement which would have a very positive effect on RTE's revenues&mdash;although it is not necessarily an ideal solution&mdash;would be if RTE were to examine the possibility of setting up some kind of unit within the station for the production of the commercials broadcast on its own channels.  This would have two benefits: it would increase employment in this country; and, secondly, because the overheads would be so much lower, it would encourage smaller advertisers &mdash;by definition almost that means Irish advertisers&mdash;to advertise on the station and thereby improve the general economic trend in the country as a whole.  In the present circumstances, it can cost £5,000 to make a television commercial for which the screening time costs only £2,000.  When we consider those figures we can see how Irish advertisers and Irish film technicians are being totally squeezed out of this market.  This is something to which the Minister could give very favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make about licences relates to the method and the agency of collection. I had to go back to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, to find out exactly what a licence was and how it was supposed to be collected.  The procedure is incredibly archaic.  There are, <Col N="877" /> I think, four sections in that Act, sections 5, 6, 7 and 8, relating almost entirely to the collection of licences which were to be issued under that Act by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  This system is archaic, and because it is archaic it is costly.  I should like the Minister in his reply to give us an indication of the amount of money that it costs him to collect the licences every year.  It seems to me that this collection charge could be considerably reduced if the collection was to be carried out by the authority itself.  The 1926 Act was drafted and passed before we had a separate radio and television authority in this country. Therefore, it was natural that the Minister should be the collecting agency.</P>
    <P>The 1960 Act set up the authority but left the collection of the licence money still a matter for ministerial concern.  I see very little difficulty in framing amendments&mdash;not necessarily to this Bill because we cannot frame amendments to a Money Bill in this House&mdash;which would allow the authority to collect the money while continuing to allow the Minister to fix the amount of the licence fee and any conditions attached to it.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent, for example, in, of all things, the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1937, section 70 of which enables the Pigs and Bacon Commission to collect levies due to it under the Act and permits the commission to sue for levies which have not been paid to it as a simple contract debt.  I believe that the authority could in this way collect these moneys much more efficiently, much more quickly and to the ultimate benefit of the entire broadcasting service than could the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the Minister wholeheartedly in his suggestion that a Bill should be introduced requiring the registration of purchases and hiring of sets.  I should like to hear when such a Bill would be introduced and I would like to offer one suggestion on it.  Few people like the idea of having their hire purchase agreements noted and the information passed to any Government or official source.  This is particularly true in the case of television.  It seems that ducking one's television licence is probably the most popular <Col N="878" /> single sport in Ireland.  People duck their television licence who would not dream of not paying their money on the bus in the morning, even though their money on the bus may come to considerably more than their television licence.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that, when the introduces this Bill, he should enable the authority to collect the money and to sue, as it is entitled to sure, for the money as a simple contract debt.  Secondly, he could suggest that purchasers and initial hirers of television apparatus should be given some concession in the matter of a licence.  In other words, the first licence a person might get would cost considerably less than subsequent licences.  This would &ldquo;sweeten the pill&rdquo;; it would lesson the shock and would perhaps make the purchaser or the hirer a little bit less antagonistic towards the Government.  There is room for simple but fairly fundamental changes in this area.  This archaic and costly system of collecting the licence money should be changed and it would take very little to change it.</P>
    <P>The next main point I should like to make concerns control of expenditure. The Government, and in this context it means specifically the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, should continually review the expenditure of semi-State bodies, in this case, the RTE Authority.  People will accuse me of wanting the Government to oversee everything, but this is not necessarily the case.  People will also say that there are some people who criticise the Government except when it suits them. I do not accept this criticism.  What I have to say on this point is being said from the point of view that I will always support the Government when I believe they are acting in the interests of the whole community, just as I will always oppose the Government when I believe they are acting in sectional and political interests.</P>
    <P>The question of expenditure is a key point in this argument.  I am not challenging the right of RTE to budget within the limits of their resources from Government funds, from licences and from advertising.  I am suggesting, however, that the Government should look very sharply at some of the considerable <Col N="879" /> overspending that is going on in RTE at the moment.  To the best of my knowledge there are several hundred thousands of pounds involved in one particular department.  I am not challenging the right of any department in RTE to budget for its outgoings but I am challenging the right of any department in RTE to spend money as if there were an inexhaustible supply of it.  Perhaps in the early days, when the station was being set up, and when the advertising money was flowing in like water, it created a feeling in certain areas in RTE that the money would always come in like this, but those days are over.</P>
    <P>It is a time for at least relative tightening of belts.  The Minister should be very firm about wastage of money in RTE and, more specifically, about departments which go over their budget to a great degree.  I will be laid open to the charge of urging the Minister to interfere in a way in which the is not legally entitled to do.  However, while I would like to defend the right of any department in RTE to make its own budget, I will not defend, and I do not think any Minister should stand over, the right of any department to go beyond its budget in what must seem to the outsider to be an irresponsible fashion.</P>
    <P>This leads us, almost directly, to the question of colour television which the Minister has mentioned in his speech.  I hope the Minister was indulgin a figure of speech when he said: &ldquo;The prospect in the more distant future of colour television...&rdquo; It is a fact that colour television has already been introduced.  The first programme in colour has already been broadcast and has already been seen by people in this country.  We are not talking about the more distant future, we are talking about now.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire if there is, in this area, an unexamined conflict between the Minister and the authority on the question of priorities in our broadcasting.  On the one hand, the Minister is placing the prospect of colour television in a &ldquo;more distant future&rdquo; and, on the other hand, there is the fact that a colour television programme <Col N="880" /> has already been broadcast and a vast amount of money has been invested, presumably, in the machinery to do this.  At the same time there is a very justifiable pressure for the production of more programmes in this country.  It seems to me that these three things are, to some extent, in conflict and I feel that the conflict should be resolved for the good of the community.</P>
    <P>If there is less money to go around and if we need and demand more home produced programmes of better quality it seems almost axiomatic that we should not be plunging into colour television with the recklessness with which we seem to be plunging into it.  I should very much like to know if this vitally important decision has been discussed, and at what level, between the administrators in RTE and the authority and what sanction, if any, the authority have given for this spendthrift approach to public broadcasting.</P>
    <P>There are two main factors about colour broadcasting.  In the first place it costs a great deal of money and, in the second place, it interests nobody producing programmes&mdash;almost without exception.  The only people it seems to have any interest for are engineers.  I repeat that this call for colour television is not coming from the people one would suppose would be most interested in it&mdash;the people who make the programmes&mdash;but from the engineering side of broadcasting.  Loath as I am to suspect vested interests, I suspect one here; I suspect the building of some kind of an empire, and I suspect that it is not in the best interests of broadcasting in this country.</P>
    <P>I will sketch out what I see as the natural sequence of events, dependent not alone on the Eurovision Song Contest but principally on the extraordinarily expensive introduction of colour in the next few years.  We are to introduce colour television and at the same time we are to have more home produced programmes.  It follows almost automatically that, because there is so little money and because colour television costs so much, the other home produced programmes will therefore be of lesser quality.  It may interest those Senators who come from outside <Col N="881" /> the metropolis of Dublin that it also follows that home produced programmes will be concentrated increasingly in studios in Dublin and that there will be correspondingly less interest by the station in anything that is happening any further than about a quarter of a mile from the door of Montrose.  This is inevitable, given the priorities.  It will mean that the teams of specialist, skilled television personnel which have been built up in the station during the years of its operations since 1960 will be at risk, and I would not be surprised if it eventually produced some kind of redundancy.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to state very clearly what his priorities are on this.  As far as I can remember, and I have not got the exact reference, he did say within the last few days that he advised people not to buy colour television sets at this stage.  If the Minister is advising people not to buy coloured television sets and if RTE are going mad trying to produce colour television, and the dealers are going mad trying to sell the sets, it seems to me that there is serious conflict here on a matter of public interest and that the Minister should ensure that the priorities he is establishing, which I believe to be in large measure the right ones, should be covered right down along the line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which, as the Minister said, is merely to extend the authority to pay grants. However, I am glad he referred to a general review of broadcasting later this year.  It will provide an opportunity to make some comment on the current state of affairs in relation to RTE.  The review is necessary in order to see how far RTE are fulfilling their obligations to the nation and in what areas it may be failing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a few comments about radio.  Whatever may be the viewpoint regarding the content of the radio programmes, I should like to welcome the continuance of all-day broadcasting since it was decided on a couple of years ago.  I must say, in fairness to the radio service, that there may be some rather trivial programmes on it but many of the programmes <Col N="882" /> are quite interesting, and I understand there has been a considerable increase in the radio audience. There is little point in providing a service if people will not listen to it, and, in fact, to my knowledge, that was the position up to four or five years ago. If one is to use a service of this kind properly it is first necessary to win the audience.  After that one can perhaps direct one's energies into the content. The essential thing is to have our people listening to their own radio service if we are to preserve and to strengthen our own identity here.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few comments on the use of the Irish language on the radio and to cover television as well.  I believe that the introduction of some Irish in a natural way into the programmes is the right policy.  Leaving aside the question of the recently announced Gaeltacht radio service, and which I welcomed when speaking on the Appropriations Bill last year, I do not really see much hope for a rapid improvement in the use of Irish as a medium of communication or an extension of the use of Irish on radio in non-Gaeltacht areas, if I may put it that way, until such time as our educational system no longer concentrates on literature and grammar and instead concentrates on the spoken language in the schools.  I understand that the Department of Education are trying to do this, but they do not yet seem to have achieved the position of having the teaching of Irish in the schools a most pleasant part of education.  The use of Irish on the radio, in so far as non-Gaeltacht areas, are concerned, will to a considerable extent be limited so long as the emphasis is on having to pass examinations in grammar, literature and so on, whereas the real emphasis should be on the ability to speak the language and to communicate in it.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister referred to the renewal of the Athlone medium wave transmitter.  My recollection is that it was intended also to increase the strength of this transmitter, and I hope that this is so.  First of all, I believe we need a more powerful transmitter. Secondly, I want to refer to a recommendation I made many years <Col N="883" /> ago privately.  I believe that this transmitter should be sited further to the south so as to improve reception in Britain.  To my knowledge reception in the south of England is either very poor or practically nil.  The House knows that there are something over a million of our own people living in that area, people who have emigrated. They need to hear about us and to hear from us.  Perhaps they hear plenty about us, but they do not hear enough from us.  Because they hear so much about us from other media, they need to hear directly from us from time to time what is going on, particularly in times of stress.  I have been in Britain on half a dozen occasions in the past two years and I can vouch for the degree of anxiety amongst many of our own people there because they were not getting accurate accounts of what was happening in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, the Minister should urge the authority, through its engineering services, to try to ensure that our people in Britain can hear the Irish radio.  There are many benefits that could come from this.  One of the reasons why I would advocate this is that, quite frequently, the otherwise impartial BBC strays from its noted impartiality when talking or reporting on happenings in our country.  It tends to give vague and inaccurate accounts when talking about Ireland.  I am not speaking now of the television programmers from the North of Ireland; I am speaking of the BBC radio programmes.  There has been so much of this reported to me from the south of England that I would almost recommend the monitoring of all BBC news items on Ireland so that corrections could be sent to them, if necessary, through the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>The erection of the new radio building on the Stillorgan Road is very welcome.  Senator Horgan mentioned radio as the poor relation of television. The decision of the authority some years ago, approved by the Minister, to erect a new station had to do with that situation.  The people in radio have been working under very great difficulties over many years.  They have been working in rented premises <Col N="884" /> scattered all over the city of Dublin. For that reason I am very glad to see that the new building is nearing completion. It will bring radio, in its technical situation and, to some extent, in its prestige position, nearer to the level of television.</P>
    <P>The only description I can give of television is that it seems to be an essential, but somewhat tormenting, contribution to life in this country. Like radio it does, in one way or another, contribute to our sense of identity.  The news service is very good, with some reservations, and so are many of the debates and discussions on radio.  However, television seems to be continuously tempted to portray the frightening and the sensational.  These things are generally considered to be newsworthy and hold attention.  This has been the case, in recent times, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.  I am touching here on some of the remarks Senator Kelly made.  Now that Radio Telefís Éireann has brought the people of the North, so to speak, nearer to us, would it not be possible to allow us to see more of the ordinary people, Protestant or Catholic, in the North of Ireland when they are happy and enjoying themselves and not when they are frightened, distressed, confused and when many of them have been persuaded into hating us?  There is the normal daily life going on in the North of Ireland.  Why cannot we see more of their normal way of life?  We could also be shown some of the wonderful scenery and holiday resorts in the North of Ireland so as to encourage people in the 26 Counties to spend their holidays there.  Many people in the Republic think they know everything about the people in the North, and yet they have never been there.  They have not the foggiest idea of the real difficulties which face the people living in that tormented part of our country.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be critical of Radio Telefís Éireann but I do not think television is availing of the wonderful opportunity they have in this regard. Here I agree with Senator Kelly.  A tremendous amount of good could be done by RTE in this regard.  It is not enough to portray violence and distress; <Col N="885" /> we have, I believe, a national obligation to show the people of the Republic the ordinary types of people of varying religions in the North of Ireland, people who in my view regard themselves as Irish.  Since I am aware of the problems regarding the screening of RTE programmes in the North, I would ask the Minister if any effort has been made to come to an agreement with the BBC in the North so that an exchange of programmes could be arranged?  It should be technically possible for the BBC to beam our entire programme throughout the Six Counties and for us to beam their entire programme throughout the 26 Counties.  This kind of inter-communication would be a major contribution towards resolving the situation that exists in Ireland at the present time.</P>
    <P>We do not see or hear enough traditional Irish music, particularly on television.  This can also be said of the traditional music and songs of the Northern Protestant people.  We should hear more of this music on our television station if we are to regard it as a national television station.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend some recent programmes which have been shown on television.  We had some excellent programmes on some of our old Gaelic poets.  They were bi-lingual programmes and were of excellent quality.  Senator Honan referred to something I myself had noticed with regard to the Symphony Orchestra and the Light Orchestra.  I am conscious of the fact that the Light Orchestra is used for back-up purposes on many programmes.  I agree with Senator Honan when he says that there is a tendency, on the part of Radio Telefís Éireann, to think that our people are not interested in good music.  Quite a lot of money is spent on maintaining two orchestras but it is some time since I have seen either the Light Orchestra or the Symphony Orchestra on television. When I was involved in this business I understood that there was some question of cost, but the position cannot be so bad to warrant our getting so little of these orchestras.  I put this point forward on a previous occasion but nothing has been done about it. Regarding the Symphony Orchestra, <Col N="886" /> the Radio Éireann deficit to which the Minister refers, includes the cost of that orchestra.  I think the cost of the Symphony Orchestra should be part of a cultural grant.</P>
    <P>Having regard to cost factors in relation to radio particularly, and to television, we should, like other countries, be maintaining our own Symphony Orchestra instead of making the television viewer pay for it.  We do not see the orchestra on television; we hear it occasionally on the radio.</P>
    <P>I commend the continuance of the phasing out, at considerable cost, of cigarette advertising.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that separate licences for car radios should be eliminated.  Our radio service should be listened to by as many people as possible.  The cost of collecting these licences, on the figures I have, could hardly justify the expenditure and the number of listeners would increase.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly said the only worthwhile programmes were current affair programmes.  Senator Kelly and I would probably agree on that, but I can assure him that that would not be the outlook of about 90 per cent of the audience.</P>

We expect to become a member of the European Community.  The song contest is not entirely like picking up the bill in a lounge bar.  There is a value in holding this contest in Dublin.  The cost which Senator Kelly mentioned does not seem very great considering that it <Col N="887" /> will attract probably the largest audience ever beamed into this country.</P>

      <P>There is considerable discussion about the licence fee being too low.  I agree with this.  We are far too dependent on advertising.  I do not altogether agree with Senator Kelly or Senator Horgan on the question of licences.  I dislike the advertising, but the need to obtain the revenue from advertising compels the station to attract an audience. It is a roundabout way of looking at the thing, but it has the advantage of holding an audience.  This enables the putting on of some programmes which have better value than the trivial material to which Senator Kelly refers. I should like to see an increase in the radio and television licence fee, although I am sure the public would not agree.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a point made by Senator Horgan in relation to the cost of licence collecting.  I know what the cost is but I do not think I am entitled to disclose it.  I recommend to the Minister and his advisers to examine the possibility of getting the ESB to collect licences.  At the present time a television set cannot be run without electricity, and it should be possible to cut collection costs by at least four-fifths.</P>

      <P>I do not altogether agree with Senator Kelly on this question of monopoly. Some of the replies given may not be as correct as they should have been.  If one is to consider the question of independent television or radio, one has to begin by considering the cost, as this excludes advertising altogether which is a matter of about £3½ million.  If we were to consider this we would need to look carefully at the sort of legislation to which Senator Kelly referred.  One would have to ensure, as Senator Kelly said, that an independent station does not play a part on one side, in a political or religious outlook, <i>et cetera.</i>  I find it very difficult to see how you could select the serious sort of enterprise to which Senator Kelly referred. The first thing that happens in any country when a <i>coup d'état</i> is contemplated is to take over the radio building. How could you handle independent radios of this kind unless they were under some national authority?  I just have not thought this one out.</P>

      <P>I should like to think about it.  I agree with Senator Kelly's comments on the service to Irish, although, knowing a wide range of people involved in the Irish movement itself, they would not agree with him.  However, I agree with him that some of the contributions in Irish and in the use of Irish bi-lingually are very good.  The station's performance in this area has shown some improvement, although I find it difficult to persuade some people that it has.  I agree with Senator Kelly that there is not an instant solution to Irish.  I also agree with him that many of the programmes are trivial and have very little to do with national culture.  I spoke in the House on this question nearly two years ago.  The problem is by no means a simple one. <Col N="889" /> I should like to refer to revenue from advertising.  I know that imported programmes cost less than home produced ones.  Unfortunately, the only imported material that can be used by RTE is produced in the United States. Other material from European countries must be translated and this is very costly.  I am not defending what is happening: I am merely explaining what is causing it.  The result is that the advertising revenue, which exceeds £3 million, is largely devoted to the production of home made material.  This is the advantage in the situation but some of these programmes are dreadfully trivial.  However, not all of them are rejected as some Members of this House would reject them: they are part of an entertainment system.  In this sense, not all of them are undesirable.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress again, as Senator Kelly did, the question of the use of our television and radio services in order to bring about a better knowledge of ourselves, North and South, and in time bring about some level of reconciliation between all the people of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that on a Bill such as this, in any discussion relating to the broadcasting and television services, there would probably be as many views as there are Senators.  To a large extent each of us is expressing his own personal views. We may have party policies dealing with general objectives or dealing with structures and that kind of thing, but when we are discussing, as we appear to be discussing here to a large extent, the actual content and presentation of programmes, the views are very largely our own personal views.</P>
      <P>Every speaker before me made a note of something I also had noted and that was the possibility of using television in a serious way for the bettering of relations between North and South.  Like Senators Kelly, Horgan and Brugha, I honestly believe that there is something here that can be done.  It is something that is well worth the closest study by the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under one of the earlier Acts&mdash; either the principal Act of 1960 or the <Col N="890" /> amending Act of 1966&mdash;the Minister has authority to appoint committees or advisers to RTE to advise them with regard to particular functions.  How many such committees or advisers, if any, have been appointed since the authority were set up and how many are still in existence?  The reason I am mentioning it now is that I should like to ask the Minister to consider very seriously, if he has not done so already, appointing a committee or an adviser to deal specifically with this question of the possibility of using the television medium with a view to bettering relations between North and South.  The mere fact of enabling us to know one another better, to bridge the gap of ignorance that is there between North and South so far as the ordinary people of both parts are concerned, the correct presentation of the South to the North and the North to the South, in itself, would better relations immediately between North and South. If the Minister used his power to set up an advisory committee in connection with the presentation of views, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was introducing this Bill he referred to the setting up of the television service here and said:</P>
    <P>In the event the television service was established on a sound financial basis in a remarkably short time and the authority has achieved a high degree of success in its development of both the sound and television services.  Indeed Radio Telefís Éireann can fairly claim to have given general satisfaction to users. The fact that they have encountered a healthy measure of criticism does not detract from the merits of that claim.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I would accept that <i>obiter dicta</i> of the Minister's as being fairly based and being a fair comment.  The authority and the television service have given satisfaction. Before the introduction of television, many of the staff of the authority had been accustomed to operate on sound broadcasting only.  They should be complimented on the fact that they fitted extremely well into the framework of television, because it is a completely different type of presentation <Col N="891" /> and has a completely different atmosphere. Any of us who, for one reason or another, have had occasion to face the cameras realise that it can be a very terrifying experience.  I think most of the staff of the authority who had previously operated on sound broadcast only, took to the television cameras like ducks to water.  I think they are extremely good.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Senator Horgan said about the desirability of not talking about people who are not here to defend themselves but I do not think any of them will object to my saying what I have said because it is entirely laudatory.  People we see very frequently we become accustomed to and seldom give a pat on the back to, but who I think deserve it, are the newscasters on the television programmes. I think I am correct in this, but I am not entirely sure, that most of them acquired training as sound broadcasters, and I feel they fitted in extremely well when television came along.  They have maintained an extremely high standard of excellence both in presentability of personal appearance and in the clarity of their diction.</P>
    <P>While we all criticise and have our own faults to find with various aspects of television presentation or sound broadcasting presentation, when we feel as I do in this instance in connection with at least part of the service, it is only fair to say that and to say it publicly.  I do not confine the remarks I have made in this connection entirely to the newscasters.  There are others about whom I feel the same.  The continuity announcers, for example, have been extremely good, extremely effective. The operators of the documentary or public affairs programmes have also come across extremely well in television. I am saying that without prejudice as to whether I agree or disagree with views or comments that were expressed.  I am talking about the performance of these people as individuals. It has been of a very high standard.</P>
    <P>As regards the programmes, as I said earlier, we all have our different points of view, but there seems to be fairly unanimous approval of certain <Col N="892" /> of the programmes such as <i>Radharc, Amuigh Faoin Spéir</i> and others of that sort.  Again, when there is that kind of consensus of opinion laudatory to a programme, I think it is only fair, when we are discussing it in this House, that we should say so.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about advertising on television.  The Minister expressed the point of view that if we could do without advertising he would like to see it done without, and the general feeling seems to be that if we could get rid of advertising we should. Personally, I do not mind whether there is advertising or not.  I am not particularly disturbed when advertisements come on the television screen.  I am speaking now as a parent trying to rear young children : from the point of view of a parent and of schoolteachers, some of the advertisements that are permitted, are quite deplorable in regard to their grammar, diction, elocution, pronunciation and so on.  I know that these are intended to be amusing. I feel sure that they are amusing to some adults, but I should like the television authority to hear my view in any event that they are not amusing from the point of view of parents of young children or from the point of view of teachers who are trying to teach young children.  If a child hears what is a deliberate mistake in grammar in the advertisement, he or she will accept it as something that came from the television and, therefore, it is all right.</P>
    <P>I do not know what standards the television authority apply with regard to advertisements.  They have authority under the Acts to reject advertisements in whole or in part and they are precluded under the Acts from accepting advertising material which is directed towards either a political or religious end.  Apart from their general discretion as to what they will or will not accept, and apart from the fact that they are precluded from accepting some types of advertisement, I do not know what standards they apply.  They must have their own set of standards and I am sure, from the point of view of a television authority, they regard the standards which they require as being high. I should like if the Minister would put to the authority the point of view that I have expressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> In talking about advertisements, may I say also that I think some of them, particularly those that have been presented by the Department of Local Government, are extremely good and effective?  I imagine they may have been quite costly to make.  Whether they were costly or not, they were well worth the expense.  I have in mind particularly various short films I have seen dealing with the topic of road safety and road regulations in the style of short films.  They were extremely good and I think that they succeeded in getting across the message which they were designed to get across.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister if he could give some information with regard to whether advisory committees or advisers have been appointed and if there are any functioning at the moment?  I do not want to be contentious in my approach to this because that has not been the style of the discussion here, but the 1960 Act&mdash;I think it is the principal Act&mdash;gives powers to the Minister to direct the authority not to broadcast matters in a particular class.</P>
    <P>Up to some time ago, when there was some controversy about the channel of communication between some Ministers and Telefís Éireann, the position was that no official directions had been given by the appropriate Minister under this section.  As a matter of general interest, I should like the Minister, when replying, to let the House know whether, since the time I am talking about, which was a couple of years ago, the Minister or his predecessor found it necessary to give any directions under this section.  I am not asking this in a contentious way and I am not asking it for the sake of asking it, either.  It seems to me that the situation which developed in the North since the time I am talking about may not have been improved by the fact that so much attention was necessarily paid to it on our television screens.  I wondered if the Government or the Minister considered that aspect of the matter in relation to the power here.</P>
    <P>I am not urging that any Minister should take it on himself to decide that such a thing may be unhelpful or even that it may possibly be inflammatory <Col N="894" /> or that he should automatically, as Minister, direct the broadcasting authorities to exclude it.  Obviously, that could not work because there still is in this country and in most countries free news media which are in no way controlled or can be controlled by the establishment.  I am not saying this in a derogatory sense in relation to the broadcasting and television authority here.  My point is that, even if a Minister wanted to gag the television authority's presentation of news, he would find it extremely difficult to do so as long as there are newspapers.  Newspapers can publish without restraint unless there were an actual war situation when censorship would arise.  I should like the Minister to tell me if any action was taken under that section.</P>
    <P>The last query I want to raise with the Minister is about an amendment which was introduced in the 1966 Act which amended the Principal Act of 1960 in different respects&mdash;the amendment of section 60 of the 1960 Act by section 5 of the 1966 Act which dealt with the functions of the authority and added three additional functions one of which was:</P>
    <P>Subject to the consent of the Minister to provide services for and on behalf of Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means; I do not know if that has ever been operated or if the Minister and his Department have ever contemplated that a power like this might require the television service to act as a kind of public relations officer for Ministers of State.  When the Minister replies I should like him to give his view as to what type of services are contemplated under that amendment which was introduced in the 1966 Act and which is still there as part of our law.  I should like to know what it covers and if services have been provided by the authority on behalf of Ministers of State, and, if so, I should like to know what those services are.</P>
    <P>I should like also to have some further information from the Minister with regard to the policy of the Department and the policy of the authority in relation to piped television.  In <Col N="895" /> the early days of the television service in this State the weight of policy in the Department was against allowing piped television.  Even where in newly-developed housing estates the appearance of the estates could have been preserved without being made ugly by all the television aerials on the chimneys, the policy of the Department was against permitting piped television. There has been a change on that now and RTE are prepared to tender, so to speak, for the work of provision of piped television services.  I am glad that the change has come about.  If piped television could be made available to urban housing estates I feel that we would all be doing a service to the whole community in so far as the appearance of these estates are concerned.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to suggest for the consideration of the Minister and the Government in relation to the broadcasting services generally is the possibility of establishing some type of Select Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to have periodic reviews, not necessarily of the type which the Minister forecast in his opening statement here, but a committee of public representatives who would be able to present to the Minister and the authority the views of those they represent from time to time.  They would be able to assist the Minister and the Department by considering the problems, particularly problems in terms of financial cost and so on, which the authority are meeting.  A committee of that sort might be valuable and would be workable.  The public should have a definite stake in the authority when a large proportion of the revenue of the authority is coming from the public by means of the licence fees.  I am not criticising the work of the authority by saying that a Select Committee of both Houses, constantly in touch with and if necessary reviewing the work of the authority, might be helpful all round.</P>

      <P>I should like to add another personal view, as Senator O'Higgins would put it.  For the diversion of Senators I am glad to say that my views differ on many points of emphasis from the views of Senator <Col N="896" /> O'Higgins.  First of all, I should like to look at advertising in a completely different way.  It seems to me that advertising on both radio and television is, in a sense, an example of the best use of both media.  The position with both radio and television is that both deals primarily with time.  The distinguishing characteristic of the effective use of time is that on sound radio is being used and pictures are used on television.  The best of radio and the best of television are got by the effective use of the particular medium in a given amount of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say the most effective use I am talking about the communication of a message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether one is conveying a message about a product, or an item of news, or a piece of drama, it is the use of the medium which is the factor at which we should look most closely.  I may say that I find the present level of advertising on radio and television just about tolerable and am prepared to bear it, if the licence fee remains much as it is, because I think it is extremely important that this service, which means so much to the community, should be as widely available in the community as possible and should be available as reasonably as possible.  In talking about the effective use of both sound and television I might give an example of what I mean from the news coverage.  I make a practice every morning of listening to the Northern Ireland BBC broadcast at five to eight and then turning over immediately at 8 o'clock to Radio Telefís Éireann.  The Northern Ireland BBC show that they have mastered the advertisers' technique much more effectively than Radio Telefís Éireann because in their five minutes you often get as much news of the 26 Counties as you do immediately afterwards from the ten minutes coming from the 26 Counties' station.  For example, on a Monday morning, in five minutes from BBC Belfast you get the GAA results for that province.  This is more than you get in the ten minutes which follow from Radio Telefís Éireann.  In the <Col N="897" /> same way, I would suggest that when you listen further after the news, at ten minutes past eight from Radio Telefís Éireann, there is usually a programme of &ldquo;What the Papers Say.&rdquo; Often to one's surprise one finds that a major news item crops up in &ldquo;What the Papers Say&rdquo; which has not appeared in the previous news programme. This again seems to me an example of something going wrong somewhere along the line in the preparation and presentation of these particular programmes.  The most effective use of the time available needs properly skilled and trained personnel and it also needs a proper appreciation of all the modern techniques available. One often feels listening to Radio Telefís Éireann that the telephone might never have been invented because, assuming Radio Telefís Éireann have got a sufficient number of lines and are treated reasonably favourably where service is concerned, they should be able to get comment at very short notice from any part of the country. They should, because of the directness of the business of broadcasting, be able to keep well ahead of the newspapers. They should never be behind the newspapers, as they so evidently are on many occasions first thing in the morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator is agreeing with me.  Senators have talked about the contribution which Radio Telefís Éireann might play in relations between North and South.  Although RTE have made some contribution in this field, it is ludicrous that, when dealing with &ldquo;What the Papers Say&rdquo; first thing in the morning&mdash;it seems to me a couple of times every month&mdash;there is an announcement that: &ldquo;I am sorry we cannot tell you anything about the Belfast papers today because there has been a hitch somewhere along the line.&rdquo;  What the hitches are I do not know, but it certainly seems to me an extremely sad reflection on our powers of communication between North and South that at ten past eight in any one morning our national broadcasting service cannot <Col N="898" /> give a summary of what is in Belfast newspapers that morning.  It is this sort of lack of attention to detail, lack of use of available simple facilities like telephones, tiny portable recorders and all the rest, that takes from the effective use of the sound medium.</P>
      <P>I do not support the remarks made by Senator O'Higgins, and that have been made elsewhere, about the use of bad grammar in television advertisements or the worry which Senators have expressed about children picking up bad grammar from the television. That is a reflection, it seems to me, on the parents and not on the television service.  The first lesson for every child who listens to the radio or watches television should be that television and radio are fallible.  Do not believe everything you hear on the radio, or everything you see on television, because recognition of the fallibility of the Press is one of the major bastions of democracy.  It lies with the parents to get across this message to their children when bad grammar is being communicated.  If you support the case made against the language used in advertisements it seems to me that you thereby fall automatically into the sort of censorship mentality which would not permit you to watch a play &mdash;&ldquo;The Riordans,&rdquo; or something like that&mdash;for fear the children might heat bad grammar.</P>
      <P>I find this a difficult attitude to understand, particularly when it is directed against an advertisement which is a fine demonstration of the use of television as a visual medium.  You have this nice effect where somebody, inside the television set, so to speak, climbs up into your living room on a ladder and sticks a notice on this &ldquo;additional window&rdquo; which a television set gives to your room.  A child watching this should have his or her visual imagination stimulated enormously. That is the important feature of the advertisement, not some slip in grammar.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the particular examples were, but argue that there is a certain amount of substance in my case.  Again I would like to differ with Senator O'Higgins where he made the suggestion, as I understood it, of a select committee which would offer advice to the Minister and would reflect a consumer point of view, so to speak.  I would be very sceptical about this because politicians are not to be trusted when they suddenly become consumer mouthpieces. They blow up some petty problem raised by their constituents into a national issue and a threat to morality. I think that is extremely dangerous. This type of matter should be handled by someone other than politicians. After all we are having the opportunity to perfom this sort of exercise now. We do not need a committee to do it. I would argue, as I have argued before, that what we do need in this area is some sort of Press Council.  I see some Members raising their eyebrows at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I am stimulating Senators.  Part of what we are concerned with in this Bill will be reflected in the quantity of advertising which appears on television.  Senator Horgan, at one stage, made some serious observations on the impact which advertising on television has on the broadcasters' freedom.  I would certainly argue that this, apart from the consumer area, is another sort of area where a Press Council would perform a useful function by being there, as a body representative of lay and editorial opinion, to pass judgment on matters of this kind submitted to them by complainants&mdash;whether these complaints were about advertising pressure, attempts at influencing the news media, or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An independent Press Council would be of much more value than the sort of committee Senator O'Higgins has suggested.  I do not want to see the initiative on this coming from the Minister. In my opinion it should be an independent body and I would hope the television authority, with newspaper <Col N="900" /> publishers and proprietors, might be in a position to take steps in this direction.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I should like to make.  I note that the Minister has indicated that he is engaged in a review of the legislation covering boardcasting.  In that connection I wish to quote from the Official Report of the Dáil, volume 251, No. 7, column 1146, where the Minister said that he hoped to introduce a Bill during the year to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>deal with some changes of an administrative nature in the Broadcasting Act.</P>
    <P>I am not clear what the Minister may have in mind when he says &ldquo;matters of an administrative nature&rdquo;, but I hope he has in mind matters solely related to the management of RTE and his relationship with the management of RTE.  I should like to go on record here as saying that, particularly under the subheadings in the 1960 Act &ldquo;General Duty with respect to National Aims&rdquo; and &ldquo;Impartiality of the Broadcasting Authority&rdquo;, the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, is a tremendous liberal piece of legislation. I find it very difficult to see how, in the face of all the pressures which we had then and are still having, we have got the great benefit of these sections 17 and 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  It is due to these two sections, and the way the authority have exercised their responsibilities under these two sections, that it has been possible for the Minister, and the whole community, to acknowledge that the broadcasting service has been largely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Most people, and particularly politicians, are very sensitive and from time to time they are critical of RTE current affairs programmes.  They should remember that next week it will be the people in the other party who will feel that they have got a raw deal.  I am absolutely sure that the best indication that RTE are doing a fine job and are exercising their duties with regard to impartiality is when they are criticised equally by virtually everyone at some time or other.  We are in advance of many other democracies in having these two sections as liberal and as wide <Col N="901" /> as they are and I hope there will not be any departure from them.  If the Minister, or anyone else, feels that there are difficulties in this regard, they are difficulties which would be much more fairly, much more satisfactorily, and much less controversially dealt with by a Press Council rather than by some limiting of the authority or introducing an element of censorship.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another point on this subject.  I think, particularly at the moment&mdash;and I hope the climate will not change if either this House or the other House discusses the 7 <i>Days</i> Tribunal&mdash;when there is no great current controversy regarding broadcasting, no sensation in the air, I would like to hear the RTE Authority giving their views on how things have worked out during the years.  Perhaps they could fill in some of the details on their interpretation of sections 17 and 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  I certainly think that the freedom of the Press and the healthy working of democracy is helped by a &ldquo;public relations&rdquo; approach by all the parties involved.  The RTE Authority have been too silent with regard to the development of broadcasting and how they see their responsibility to the community. Do the authority construe the Act as referring to the community of the whole island?  Or do they feel their responsibility is, first and foremost, to the 26 Countries?  This is the sort of thing on which the authority could usefully inform us, both for our education and to assist the general discussion of this type of matter in the community.</P>
    <P>I some sorry I have not got examples of the particular publications here with me today but the BBC, particularly, does this type of thing quite well.  Every so often they will publish a booklet of questions and answers highlighting a particular problem of controversy or some allegation of interference with programmes and so forth.  The BBC publish a pamphlet laying out clearly the responsibilities of directors, producers, and reporters, for example. This type of public education is extremely valuable and is something that RTE might consider.</P>
    <P>Some members have spoken about <Col N="902" /> radio being the cinderella of broadcasting. Could I make the point that broadcasting should be a unit?  We would obtain the best use of the media if the services were complementary, making use of the best attributes of both radio and television.  One often feels in listening and viewing that someone has gone out of their way to make it impossible for either the highbrow or the lowbrow to achieve complete satisfaction or for even the person who is interested in following a particular controversy to achieve complete satisfaction.</P>
    <P>This should not be the case.  It should be possible to arrange for highbrow and lowbrow programmes to alternate on television and radio.  If there is an important news item, say a matter concerning international affairs, and it is not possible to obtain current television films on the item&mdash;the war in Vietnam, for instance&mdash;radio could provide valuable back-up.  At the end of a television news bulletin dealing with some Vietnam battle an announcement could easily be made saying: &ldquo;Viewers interested in further discussion of the implications of this attack on the Ho Chi Minh Trail should turn over to sound radio where there is a discussion in progress&rdquo;.  On radio, the latest information will be available by the effective use of the telephone and so on, and there can be a live discussion on the topic of the moment.  This would be a sample of what I mean by the complementary use of television and radio.</P>

Even if the Senator finds the Vietnamese example a bit far-fetched, he will have got the principle of relating radio and television and exploiting the unity of broadcasting services.</P>

      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of having a look at the operations of Radio Telefís Éireann.  I am glad the Minister has announced that in the course of the next two years he will bring in some amending legislation and will look at the operations of Radio Telefís Éireann and see what is necessary to put them on a proper basis for the next decade.  That is as it should be in connection with all State-sponsored bodies. In the case of Radio Telefís Éireann it is more important still because television has such a large impact on public opinion.  In addition, it was a new venture for us, so it is timely that the review should be taking place.</P>
      <P>This debate should bring home to us the lack of Parliamentary Committees dealing with business lime this. The Minister would be greatly assisted in framing the legislation for the future if he had the assistance of a broadly-based Oireachtas Committee from both Houses.  They would bring a very wide range of opinions to bear on the performance of Radio Telefís Éireann over the past decade and also ideas and suggestions for the future.  Even though such a committee is not in existence at present, could the Minister do anything about getting some assistance in that way?  Basically, the Minister's advisers&mdash;I do not mean the slightest disrespct to them&mdash;are Dublin based and look at this whole problem from the standpoint of Dublin.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas are very much representative of opinions from all over the country and probably the part outside Dublin is even stronger in that representation.  That is why the contribution made by such a parliament Committee would have such a balancing and correcting influence and it would enable a much better approach to be made.</P>

I do not think that we should rehash it unduly; but the examination in that case, necessaily, had to be on a narrow front, much too narrow for the type of overall look that is needed at present. Many of us were greatly disturbed by some of the practices that came to light in it, hidden cameras and all the rest, and indeed the inquiry was worth what is cost if it put an end to such practices.  However, I cannot incur the displeasure of the Chair by following that further.</P>
    <P>Above all, we are concerned that Radio Telefís Éireann should be impartial. That was the theme that was stressed again and again in the passage of the Act of 1960.  I, for one, have a feeling that they are not impartial politically.  The ledt wing&mdash;it does not matter of what party&mdash;gets much more recognition and more scope on television that the ordinary centre of the party.  It would be most instructive, if a record was made available of the number of appearances by members of the various political parties; it would show who are the favourites in Montrose.  I would not need figures to say who would be No. 1 on the list.  A certain Deputy in the other House would clearly be No. 1&mdash; Dr. O'Brien.  A balance should be kept.  The Independents have been conspicuous by their absence.  Radio Telefís Éireann do not seem to realise that there are Independent Members in the Seanad.  There is still one left in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Radio Telefís Éireann should give some opportunities to Independent Members of the Seanad to give their point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not claim there is any special virtue in being independent.  In many ways it is a harder task to be a member of a party and imposes much more onerous duties.  But there are a few of us who are cast in that role, fortunately or unfortunately, apart from the university representatives who are traditionally not attached to any part.  They <Col N="905" /> surely should have some contribution to make to the discussions on and formation of public opinion by Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>Of course, it all comes back to money.  Telefís Éireann got off on a &ldquo;skite&rdquo;, one might say, between 1963 and 1965, when money was rolling in and the extravagances there had to be seen to be believed.  I remember getting an invitation to take a two-minute part in a programme.  It was a commemoration of UN Day.  First of all, they had some strange idea that I was to be the &ldquo;bogey man&rdquo; who was anti-UN. They seemed very surprised when I said I had no such views at all on this, that I wanted to see a better UN, but I was certainly not anti-UN by any means.  Nevertheless, I was wanted on this very short programme, two minutes, and I raised the objection: &ldquo;I have a very important meeting in Cork the following morning that I must attend.&rdquo;  No trouble at all to send me home by taxi from Dublin.  However, I was not going to allow the taxpayers pay for that, neither would I let myself in for that for a mere two-minute part in a programme.  That is an indication of the extravagance that was prevalent at that time.  I am glad that they are being forced to tighten their belt.  I did not altogether agree with that increase in fees which was given last July.  I hope the Minister is not contemplating any further increase in that regard.</P>
    <P>Advertising revenue which plays such a part&mdash;I think 60 per cent of the total &mdash;may look very big.  If we were to get rid of it altogether, which I am not advocating, it would mean an increase in the fee from £6 to £14.  We should look not at the £14 but at the total cost of television.  I think it would be very conservative to put the cost of a set at £25 or £30 a year.  If one buys it there is depreciation, interest on capital, <i>et cetera.</i> If one rents it, it probably costs far more plus the servicing of it.  Therefore, one might say that the present cost to each viewer is £30 for the set and £6 for the licence, that is £36.  If one had to pay the whole of the advertising revenue up to £14 it would be a matter of an increase from £36 to £44.  The cost of replacing or phasing out certain undesirable advertising is not a very great one and by <Col N="906" /> all means I would agree to have costs of that type put on as an increase in the licence fee.</P>
    <P>We should show a great deal more imagination in advertising.  I should like to see much more sponsorship.  We have, of course, big tournaments that are sponsored by Guinness and others and their purpose is mainly advertising. It gets the name &ldquo;Guinness&rdquo; on television, on papers and everywhere else. There is a great scope for sponsorship in the presentation of local events, historical events and generally we should encourage the larger firms, rather than putting their talent into creating these &ldquo;Micky Mouse&rdquo; advertising cartoons, to make a positive contribution towards paying for the presentation of a certain programme.  Periodically there could be the message flashed in underneath &ldquo;sponsored by so and so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with breaking in on the programme simply to say that this is sponsored by so and so.  The periodic use of the name should give good advertising value to whoever is sponsoring and I think it would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister how far we have progressed in selling any of our home-produced TV material.  It seems to me there are many programmes that should have a big market, especially in the United States, where there are so many television networks all over the country. That, to my mind, should be almost an industry.  As far as I can detect in the report of Radio Telefís Éireann, it has not reached any significant proportions. Programmes like <i>Amuigh Faoin Spéir</i> are real works of art and I feel there should be a market for this type of real artistic effort of which our people are very capable.  Historical programmes on our past should again command a ready market on the world and especially the American Scene.  I wonder could the Minister indicate whether he can in the future get Radio Telefís Éireann to put more effort into that.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the total cost of television and to hear all the moaning and groaning about not being able to do a service based on that. The total is £7 million in the current <Col N="907" /> year.  I have just been looking through the Book of Estimates here and the total provision for current expenditure in the universities for almost 20,000 students is £5½ million.  Therefore, so far as spending is concerned, television has got greater resources than all the university centres put together.</P>
    <P>We should have much less of this trying to keep up with the Joneses across on the BBC and more reliance on ourselves. They should set their financial standards according to what the country can bear and what is provided for comparable activities within the country.  I am not saying that the university, in all its worth, is in any way to be compared with Radio Telefís Éireann in purpose.  It is far more important, as the Minister realises.  Yet we have these comparative figures.  It is good to see that the capital advances have not been fully utilised. Of the £2 million to £3 million which we voted in 1966, the third million has not been used.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to commend the sound broadcasting.  I got an eerie feeling when reading the RTE report that, by juggling of figures, sound broadcasting is losing some £600,000 a year while television is gaining.  It all depends on the allocation made on the fees.  The allocation made is that £1 out of every £6 is supposed to go towards sound and the other £5 is for television.  This is not a realistic apportionment when one realises how much pleasure can be got from sound broadcasting, particularly in the mornings when the television station is closed. Hospitals rely to a large extent on sound broadcasting.  Taking these few factors into account it can be seen that sound broadcasting is contributing far more than one-sixth of the enjoyment to the people who listen to either sound or television.  If a poll were taken on the amount of time people who have both sound and television in their homes spend listening and viewing it would show that the members of the average household spend more time listening to sound than they do viewing television.  If this is the case, where is the justification for saying that £1 out of every £6 is all that should be allocated to developing sound?  On a cost <Col N="908" /> basis it can be seen that sound is costing more than is allocated to it by way of the licence fee.  I would suggest to the Minister that at least £2 out of every £6 should be allocated to sound broadcasting so that we will no longer have this plea that the poor relation is costing us money.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to ask for the co-operation of, and ideas from, all sides of the House in approaching the very difficult task of how to adjust television to the 1970s and how to ensure that the centre of the party gets at least as much representation as the left or the very extreme.</P>

      <P>Tuigim go bhfuil deitheanas maidir leis an mBille seo agus ar an adhbhar sin ni déarfaidh me puinn.  Ar an gcéad dul sios déanfaidh mé tagairt do oráid an Aire. Deir sé:</P>
      <P>The present Bill is for two years only.  This is because it is an interim measure.  Certain schemes of an administrative kind in the Broadcasting Acts are under consideration.  More important still I wish to consider the question of arranging a general review of the progress made by the authority in the ten years of its existence. There is much to be said for such a periodic examination of the affairs of any semi-State body but it is especially necessary in the case of any organisation that wields so much influence and is so much in the public eye as the national broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>I presume he means to include in that the television service because of all the forces capable of changing or moulding public opinion the television service is the most powerful.  All educationalists and psychologists know that of the five senses&mdash;seeing, hearing, smell, taste and touch&mdash;the most powerful is the sense of seeing.  That is why, during our school days, we not alone learned our geography but we also studied maps and sketches in order to let the knowledge acquired sink in through visual aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Television is an extremely powerful medium and is a very big responsibility for any Minister to take charge of, especially in the early stages, because <Col N="909" /> it takes some time before one can listen to or view things critically.  Thanks be to God, we are becoming a little more sophisticated as regards the programmes we view and the programmes to which we listen.  What comes to mind immediately one sees an interesting programme is the power of selection that cameramen have.  Somebody remarked to me within the last 24 hours: &ldquo;D'fhéadfaidís an dubh a chur in a gheal ort&rdquo;&mdash;they could persuade you that black was white.  However, we will not pursue that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the question of what is news and what is not. Remember the old stanza &ldquo;Dog bites man is not news, but if a man bites dog that is news&rdquo;.  Those occurrences, even including the events of the last few days, are extremely rare.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the question of the phasing out of cigarette advertising. That showed great courage on the part of the Minister and the Government because it means a loss of £300,000 in a year.  Having done that has the Minister any suggestions for phasing out or, at least reserving for late hours, advertisements in connection with intoxicating drink?  There is a definite connection between the high-powered advertising of drink and the increase in alcoholism which unfortunately has occurred during the last six years.  I do not know what loss of revenue would be incurred there, but maybe the Minister, when replying, would refer to the point I have raised.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators spoke about the programmes and the type of programmes that should be presented.  The golden rule would be: &ldquo;Produce what you can here at home and import, borrow, or hire what cannot be produced here.&rdquo;  Certainly, I must compliment RTE on the excellence of most of their home-produced programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their coverage of games, hurling, football, boxing and so on is absolutely splendid.  Such features as <i>Amuigh Faoin Spéir, 7 Days,</i> news items, <i>Agallamh,</i> and <i>Radharc</i> have a quality of truth about them and a quality of reality that one does not find in the <Col N="910" /> canned productions we have to import from abroad.  One gets the view that many of these canned programmes which are supposed to be dealing with the wild west and open air scenes are actually studio made.  One gets a feeling of unreality about them.  All compliments to RTE for the excellence of the home made programmes.  All we want is more and more of them.</P>
    <P>In connection with home made programmes I spoke here before Christmas, on the Appropriations Bill, about the question of music on RTE.  I was very sorry indeed that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was not present. I believe that RTE have a certain responsibility to our people to educate them into&mdash;if not performing good music&mdash;at least listening to and appreciating good music.  People cannot appreciate good music until they hear and get used to hearing it.  I spoke in particular at that time of, first of all, traditional music as it is called and also classical music.  Traditional Irish music is a thing of extreme beauty and is a thing we all love.  It is something that is loved by Irishmen as long as they live and wherever they go.  The Minister should do his best to see that we have regular programmes of traditional music on the television and radio.  Unfortunately, it is true that many traditional musicians are more traditional than musical.  Quite a number are more musical than traditional, but I assure the Minister that there are excellent performers and groups of performers not alone in the 26 Counties but in the Six Counties as well who combine genuine tradition with excellent musicianship.  I know that because I have played with them and I have met them.  They are not all confined to members of any particular faith.  With these sources, these excellent musicians either in the South or in the North, there should be a definite policy of presenting at regular intervals Irish traditional music in its best and most acceptable form.  Questions will arise of studio techniques and so on, but even if those players, musicians and singers had to do a short course with Radio Telefís Éireann, it would be well worth the exercise.</P>
    <P>To come to classical music, unfortunately, <Col N="911" /> for historical reasons, we have not been able to advance, as far as that type of music was concerned, as quickly and as widely, so to speak, as our European neighbours, with whom we will be shortly making close acquaintance when we enter the European Economic Community.  There is an unbroken tradition there.  Our traditions were broken here for reasons that we do not have to deal with now.  We are lacking in&mdash;I speak of the people in general now&mdash;our knowledge of and our appreciation of the music of the great masters.  We have based here in Dublin the Radio Telefís Éireann Symphony Orchestra, which is of absolute top quality.  I am not saying it is the best in Europe or anything at all like that, but it is an excellent orchestra and one of which we can be very proud.  We in Cork were very much alarmed, may I say very angry and upset, last year when it was announced that the visits of the Radio Telefís Éireann Orchestra to Cork were being curtailed and various protests were made.  Eventually we were informed that when the fees were raised it would be possible for the orchestra to go to Cork and give the usual number of concerts.  There is a principle involved here because the people in Cork, Limerick and the rest of Ireland pay rates and taxes as well as the people who live here in the capital. Since this orchestra is maintained by the taxpayer and the man who pays his licence, then I hold that the people of Cork and Limerick are entitled to a reasonable quota of concerts in the year as well as the people who are living in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There was a little hubbub&mdash;we will put it that way&mdash;after the second last concert in Cork, when it was pointed out that the attendance was very poor. Of course, the reason for the small attendance was simply that an unusual and not a terribly attractive programme for the general listener was presented. You had a new symphony by a composer who was not well known in Cork, Proinsías Ó Duinn.  His symphony No. 1 was the main item and along with that you had Mahler's Symphony No. 1, which is not everybody's cup of tea.  While the hall was <Col N="912" /> approximately half full, but, by proportion and taking into consideration the relative populations of Dublin and Cork, the hall, even though half full, had far more present than you would have present at a similar concert in Dublin.  Still, there was a complaint. At the last concert in Cork, when you had a programme suited to everybody's taste, including a Mozart piano concerto, the hall was absolutely full to capacity.  In fact, extra seating had to be procured to accommodate people there.  That shows the demand there is in Cork, and in Limerick too, for the Symphony Orchestra.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that at no time will there be any danger of Cork or Limerick being deprived of the concerts that are part of their due.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to RTE and the North of Ireland.  I remember before Christmas making the point, with regret, that maybe we had lost a great opportunity when we did not put up a booster station near the Border, so that people in the North of Ireland could have the chance of getting the truth.  On my last visit to the North of Ireland I deliberately listened to BBC radio and watched BBC Television and Ulster Television to the exclusion of everything else.  It was quite clear to me within a few days how easy it is for people to be conditioned into believing everything on it.  The people in the North, no matter what their political opinions are&mdash;goodness knows they are varied enough&mdash; and no matter what their creeds are&mdash; and they too do not lack variety either &mdash;are entitled to get the truth.</P>
    <P>I need not remind Members that the BBC will publish whatever is in the interests of the masses in England. The BBC have always been very partisan as far as British interests are concerned.  They have an extraordinary habit of twisting news so that by the time it comes to you from the BBC something you know about intimately becomes so distorted that you wonder if they are speaking about something entirely different.  This is something that should be given consideration.  A booster station should be situated near the Border.  I would like to commend to the House the suggestion that we have an interchange of artists and <Col N="913" /> broadcasting personalities from North and South.  Let us have discussion on both sides&mdash;it does not matter whether we agree or disagree&mdash;so that we can achieve something in the end.</P>
    <P>I think it was Churchill who said: &ldquo;If we had less war and more jaw we might get somewhere.&rdquo;  I should like to make one further point as regards Britain and the Continent.  Unfortunately, it is true that our exiles in England and our friends on the Continent cannot get satisfactory reception of our radio service.  Something should be done to increase the power of our radio station.  Some time ago, I heard of a chap in London who left the city and went to the highest hill he could find to listen to an All-Ireland final on his radio.  I remember one Sunday night, not very long ago, when I was in the South of France, in spite of the help of everybody concerned, I failed to get the results of some matches I particularly wanted to get.  Maybe the Minister could tell us if he intends improving the power of the radio station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with the Senators who have referred to the inability of people in the Six Counties to have the benefit of RTE programmes.  I have met very many people from the Six Counties and they are very critical of the people in the Republic and RTE by reason of the fact that they cannot get Radio Telefís Éireann programmes in the Six Counties in the same way as we can get the BBC and UTV programmes in many parts of the Republic.  I do not know the technical reasons for that.  I do not know what agreements were made with outside States in the allocation of wavelengths and therefore I am not in a position to comment on this aspect.  Many Senators have referred to the fact that, if RTE were available to the people in the Six Counties, it might lead to their getting to know the people of the Republic in a much better way.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to give us some reason why we are unable to beam our television programmes into the Six Counties.  I want to assure the Minister, on the basis of the many criticisms I have heard from people in the Six Counties, that our programmes would be very welcome there indeed.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I should like to refer to here.  In his introductory speech the Minister referred to our dependence on commercial revenue and went on:</P>
      <P>Many, including the authority itself, consider the extent of this dependence on commercial revenue to be excessive and not in the best interests of the service.  Many would like to see it dropped altogether&mdash; and I sympathise with that view&mdash; but unfortunately a reduction in advertising could only be achieved by an increase in licence fees.  To cease advertising altogether would involve increasing the combined licence fee from its present level of £6 to about £14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the assessment has been worked out correctly that, if we cease advertising on television, the licence fee would go up to £14.  One or two of the Senators seem to think this <Col N="915" /> would be good value.  Cease advertising, charge us £14 and we will all be happy!  I cannot agree with this and I am sure many of the Senators, and people outside, would not agree either. Even the present fee of £6, low though it appears to be in comparison with the fee in other countries, does not satisfy a great many licence holders that they are getting good value for this fee.</P>
    <P>People who live in certain areas have the advantage of two other channels, BBC and ITV&mdash;UTV or Welsh Television. These people, perhaps, consider they are getting value for their £6.  I sympathise with many people who are confined to RTE, especially in parts of the country where the quality of picture is very bad.  If we were to drop advertising and charge £14, these people would, indeed, get very bad value.</P>
    <P>For example, on Saturday afternoon you can switch on to BBC Grandstand or to the ITV sports programme at approximately 12.30 p.m.  You can see racing, boxing, football, motor racing, the lot.  What is the alternative on RTE? The station opens at 5.30 p.m. with <i>Wanderly Wagon.</i>  What a contrast? After half an hour of that we get the news.  Then there is a round-up of the sports events which have taken place on that day.  We could have more co-operation with the BBC in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not know the difficulties involved for co-operation between RTE and BBC officials.  I remember one Saturday not long ago when all racing and football programmes were off in England.  There was a race meeting being televised here and in less than two hours it was announced on BBC that they were showing, through the courtesy of RTE, that race programme on the BBC.  I considered that excellent.</P>
    <P>I know there are many areas where there has been co-operation such as this. We should be getting much more of this.  I should hate to think that, because certain Senators think our £6 fee is low by comparison with that of many other countries, either the Minister or the RTE authorities should get the idea that we would be pleased if the fee were increased and we had less advertising.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> Some of the people responsible for the &ldquo;commercials&rdquo; on RTE should take a good look at ITV.  They, to a certain extent, are dependent on &ldquo;commercials&rdquo;. They do not collect any licence fees.  They seem able to put over the &ldquo;commercials&rdquo; in such a way that they do not interfere with programmes. Senator John Kelly was very near the kernel of our problem here today when he mentioned that those advertisers appear to have a big influence on the type of programmes and the timing of programmes, in order that their product can be advertised at a fixed time. If that is so, I am sorry, and the Minister should do something to change that position.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this in the House some years ago on the 1966 Bill.  When we had an international boxing tournament in the Stadium there were two brilliant rounds of a contest between Ireland and Bulgaria but the programme ended there.  We were told that the result would be given in the news.  I got the impression then that there was something wrong in Telefís Éireann. Five minutes could not be spared to show the last round of that very interesting boxing contest.  I ask the Minister and RTE if it is true that we have this type of interference with programmes? We should phase out advertising and give better programmes, if we are going to pay higher fees. People who live in areas where television reception is very bad should be charged a reduced amount for licences rather than be charged the same price as those who get an excellent RTE picture or get alternative viewing from other stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with those who raised the point about sound broadcasting being treated as a cinderella.  We have sound radio all morning, but there are periods in the afternoon when sound radio on RTE does not function at all.  We must never forget that there are parts of the country where the people are not connected up with the ESB.  They cannot have television.  Their only enjoyment is from radio, because they can have battery operated sets.  A phenomenon of the present age is young people carrying transistor sets with them <Col N="917" /> everywhere they go.  If Radio Éireann do not provide entertainment for them, they try elsewhere.  In that way we lose an opportunity of getting through to a very important section of our community.</P>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Brugha's statement about the bad reception of Radio Éireann in England. Our exiles there like to be kept in touch with what is happening at home. Thousands of them would dearly like to be able to get the sports results from Radio Éireann on a Sunday night. I am speaking in particular of people in the Birmingham area, with whom I come in contact a good deal.  It is a constant source of complaint with them that for the one Sunday night they can hear the sports results there are nine or ten on which they cannot.  They get only garbled reception which is more infuriating than anything else. That applies to those who have an interest in sport, but news broadcasts are most important, too, and it is regrettable that they cannot be received there.  These are people who like to maintain their links with the homeland. They like to come home and spend their holidays here, but when they return to England they like to be able to keep in touch with the sports and interests they renewed during their visits home.</P>
      <P>At the same time we should pay tribute to Radio Éireann for the many splendid features they present.  If there is any indication of a cut back on expenditure and if that were to affect sound broadcasting, as indicated by Senator Quinlan, it would be more just to alter the ratio of expenditure between sound and television than it would be to cut back on sound alone. There should be no question whatsoever of introducing colour television until we have succeeded in having sound radio and black and white television beamed to all parts of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely necessary that we maintain contact with the people in Northern Ireland and there is no better way to do it than through radio and television.  If the introduction of colour television into this State would hinder the development of sound broadcasting and of black and white television, and <Col N="918" /> the efforts to reach all parts of the country effectively, I would oppose it. We must aim at providing the best facilities we can for everybody rather than providing the optimum facilities for the few, and second-rate productions for the bulk of the people or even for a significant section of the people.  In parts of Northern Ireland people have voiced their complaints several times because of their inability to receive a television picture from here.  There are people on the west coast who are in the same position. Constant representations are being made by different bodies in Northern Ireland and in the west of Ireland to RTE to improve both sound and television broadcasts.</P>
    <P>I also join with those who paid compliments to RTE for the quality of news features and current affairs topics, such as <i>7 Days and Féach.</i>  They deserve every tribute for the quality of the work done, and I join with Senator Kelly in expressing the hope that any cut back that might be necessary in the years ahead would not result in their efforts being curtailed or restricted.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann should be linked up more closely with our schools.  It is a costly business to provide schools throughout the country with television sets but nevertheless television could play a very important part in education. Nobody could be content with the progress that has been achieved in that direction.  It is very, very slow and we have fallen far behind what has been done in other countries.  It would add something to the cost, and I do not know if people would willingly pay a substantially increased licence fee. Nevertheless there are some things so worthwhile that a small increase might be acceptable to the majority.</P>
    <P>While I wish to compliment the people who produce features such as 7 <i>Days and Féach,</i> in view of our national aspirations and in view of the events that have happened over the last few years, it would be highly desirable if in such features we had more representation from people in the Six Counties.  If we present our own side of the story, even from different angles and from various sections of opinions in the 26 Counties, we are inclined to forget <Col N="919" /> the outlook of the people on the other side of the Border.  In every case in which it is possible, we should have a balanced or worthwhile opinion from different sections of the community in Northern Ireland on these current affairs features.  I am of the opinion that we need enlightenment on some of these points.  We are largely ill-informed about the causes for various outlooks, different persuasions and so on.  It is right that we should regard the people of Northern Ireland as belonging to the name nation and that they should get an opportunity of expressing their views.  It would be a good thing too if it were reciprocated and if we could arrive at the stage where leaders of public opinion, or those who express the feelings of a sizeable section of the community here, were afforded an equal opportunity of appearing on UTV.  We live in an age when large sections of our people have opinions formed for them by what they hear on the radio and by what they see on television.</P>
    <P>If we are to make progress in shaping or moulding public opinion I think that is the way to do it.  I would suggest that the Minister use his good offices to ensure that more of that be done in the future.  I do not wish to give the impression that I am highly critical of RTE, either in sound or in television broadcasting, because I think they are entitled to a number of tributes. As I have already said, some of the features on foreign affairs presented in this country compare with the very best presented by networks that have more funds and expertise at their disposal.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say in that connection that it is unfortunate we do not see more on RTE of people like the Abbey Players.  I should like to couple that with those who have spoken about our failure to have the Radio Éireann orchestras on sufficiently often.  Groups and people of outstanding ability, such as the Abbey Players and the orchestras, should feature more regularly.  The Abbey Players are famous the world over for their quality and it is a great pity that more use is not made of them.  It would be a substitute for some of the canned <Col N="920" /> variety programmes that we are forced to buy here to fill up time.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude on this note.  I am old-fashioned enough to believe that RTE are entitled to a tribute from the point of view that a man, his wife and family can sit at their fireside and watch RTE without running the risk of sickening embarrassment to either the younger or the older generation.  For that reason I think RTE are to be complimented. When one lives in a part of the country, as I do, where you can switch from RTE to BBC and to ITV, parents of young growing families do so with a great amount of risk.  You never know what will come next.  Something that might be rather shocking often appears. For that reason I think RTE are entitled to the compliments of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he may find his way to initiate that legislation in this House.  There has been much talk of the use to which radio and television can be put in regard to our political situation in the NorthEastern counties and the rest of the country.  I am in thorough agreement with those who suggest that we have in television a most valuable aid to cement the bonds that should exist more closely between the people here and the people there.  Unfortunately, so far as my memory goes, Telefís Éireann never send a camera crew to the North except when there is trouble, riots, burnings, something like that, happening.  I know, of course, that a good newspaperman has a nose for news, and riots make news.  I know, too, that it is good news to find other things besides riots which attract public attention and which are supported by great numbers of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a plea here some years ago after <Col N="921" /> the setting up of Telefís Éireann that we should cover the 12th July celebrations from start to finish, and I repeated that plea.  In due course, Telefís Éireann showed a BBC recording of what happened.  Then they ventured forth themselves and they produced a feature of the 12th July march in Belfast with sidelights on Newry, Derry and Enniskillen.  That, to my mind, was doing very valuable work to show the people in this part of Ireland, who had never visited the North, what exactly happens up there on this great festival day of theirs, about which they read so much in the newspapers and about which they know so little.  I felt that if the television camera crews could be got to go North, not alone to cover the 12th July celebrations, or to the Walls of Derry celebrations, but to ordinary celebrations of civic weeks, and celebrations of local festivals, and show what the ordinary people in those Six Counties are doing, not when there are riots on and not on the 12th July, but all during the year&mdash;to show that they are just like us, that they are the same as us, that they are Irish like the best of us and that we should get to know them.  I think that Telefís Éireann would then be doing a really valuable job for the country and for the purposes for which it was established.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Telefís Éireann could also do a valuable job for the same purpose by showing the people of the North what happens down here, independent of the scattered news and riots which they give from time to time.  As I have already said here, they could do a good job through the utilisation of these booster stations about which so many Senators have spoken. I do not see any technical or political difficulty in having booster stations there along this area which would enable every person in the Six Counties to get the Telefís Éireann programmes.  The only difficulty I see is that there may be trouble about the aerials but if the programmes are good from the South and if they are interesting, there is no doubt, as we have got aerials to get BBC and UTV and Wales, people in the North will get aerials that will get Telefís Éireann if it is worth viewing. <Col N="922" /> I think they would get quite a different view of what is happening down here and of the type of people who live here if Telefís Éireann would expend money, with their undoubted ability and energy, on programmes of that nature.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear about this review, of which the Minister spoke.  It will, I hope, encompass consideration of the possibilities of utilising the television end of it much more for that purpose than for the purpose merely of recording sad and unfortunate events when they occur in the North and when they occur down here.</P>
    <P>I also found myself in agreement with several Senators who spoke on the Radio Éireann sound programmes and transmissions.  I understand we are to get a new transmitter for Radio Éireann sound.  I hope, whatever the difficulties that beset the old one, which could not be heard in many parts of Ireland and which was a complete wash-out so far as large parts of England, Scotland and Wales were concerned, that something will be done to overcome those difficulties and above all to increase the power of the transmitter.</P>
    <P>We have had a 100 kw. transmitter here for many years.  It has proved useless in transmitting our programmes to the areas on the east coast of England and on the north-east coast of Scotland and even the south west of England.  Where we want to get our messages and sports results and our various news items across they cannot be heard on our transmitter as it is not powerful enough.  I understand the International Telecommunications Convention and the arrangements, the understandings and the treaties that bind us to sticking to the 100 kw wavelength. What I cannot understand is why, if we are corralled into a small area of this type of power, other European stations are not corralled into the same power area?  The answer, of course, will be that the Iron Curtain countries do not respect any conventions. Radios Prague and Budapest can be heard quite clearly here without any trouble on the medium wavelength, and they are behind the Curtain.  There is no explanation for the power and <Col N="923" /> the ease with which stations like Oslo, Stockholm and even Helsinki can be heard here on the medium wavelength, when our own transmitter cannot be heard in South West Cork.</P>

      <P>I want to come back to something which I have been plugging since 1937. I made a broadcast from 2RN in 1937 and first advocated this but it got nowhere.  I kept it up and year after year I have been hammering at it.  In the end I got somewhere.  Then we had a change of Government and I got nowhere again, then we had a change back and I still got nowhere.  Now I am pleading again for it as we have some experience now which indicates to us how important it is.  We have been in the Congo, we are in Cyprus, God knows where else the United Nations service may call our troops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want a shortwave radio transmitting station here in this country.  I hope the Minister will do something about it during his term of office because I am sick and tired of the excuses given time after time by a succession of Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs. I want some Minister to do something about this shortwave station. We are the only country in Europe that has not got a shortwave transmitter; we are the only mother country in the world which has exiles scattered around the world and which cannot communicate with them except through the courtesy of a foreign broadcasting service; we are the only country in the world which, when we have troops serving abroad, cannot get in direct touch with them and which cannot establish radio programmes direct from the homeland for their entertainment. It is time to end that situation.  Do not let anyone tell you that shortwave <Col N="924" /> radio is a washout and that nobody listens to it.  All around the world shortwave radio has become the most important network of radio communication for people in outlying districts and for people in big cities.  I do not see why, if we had a shortwave station transmitting here, we could not have these programmes relayed on many of the local stations in the various cities of the United States.  I beg the Minister to see what can be done.</P>

      <P>Will the Senator keep quiet and not be so cranky?  He is an awful irritable little devil.  Keep quiet.  The name of Ireland will be in the newspapers for one day all over the world and this time, for the first time, the greatest vision audience ever known in the history of television&mdash;500 million people&mdash;will look at that programme. It will be held in Ireland, so they are bound to talk about Ireland. If we could get as much publicity for Ireland for even one day by buying space in any half dozen papers in the United States or in England we would not have half a good column in all those papers for the £35,000 that this will cost.  As far as the Eurovision programme goes it is a good investment. I have no objection to it as it is money very well spent.</P>
      <P>As far as Radio Éireann sound programmes go, Senator Kelly questioned if they were doing as much for Irish as the television programmes.  I am a regular listener to the sound programmes and I must say that I find them most enthusiastic and most encouraging in so far as the use of Irish goes.  I find that there is a lot more and better Irish used in sound broadcasting than there is on television. There is a much greater variety of good programmes in Irish on the radio than there is on television.  A tribute is due to those who are running sound radio, which is supposed to be the cinderella of the broadcasting service, and which I believe is now attracting a greater audience than the television programmes which we have.  Sound radio is also, in my opinion, much more satisfactory from the point of view of news coverage.  The news bulletins on sound, particularly the news coverage of world events and the 1.30 p.m. news which is run every day by Mike Burns, give a very interesting synopsis of important events that occur here and abroad but which we do not get on television. Great credit is due to the people who are running the sound broadcasting service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> I have one more point in connection with this whole question.  As far as schools broadcasting is concerned an awful lot will have to be done to improve our position and techniques before contemplating putting sets into the schools.  Anyone who listens to the BBC schools broadcasts or who listens to the UTV junior programmes will realise the amount of work, money and research that has gone into them.  I was listening, on the BBC, to a potted history of Ireland which was being given in a series of six lessons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which were given for schoolchildren and I think they were the best and fairest I have heard anywhere.  It would be very useful for RTE to get hold of those and rebroadcast them here.</P>
      <P>There is one other point that I wish to make before I sit down.  Ulster Television, a unit of the Independent Television Network, is a very Irish station. There are Irish programmes on it of which anyone could be proud.  The news bulletins, their news coverage, their special features on Irish events and affairs and their coverage of events which happen south of the Border are to be envied and I recommend strongly to Telefís Éireann&mdash;if there is a technical difficulty they should try to get over it&mdash; to participate in a greater exchange of programmes and a greater reutilisation of UTV programmes than we have had up to the present.  I notice we use quite an amount of BBC material but very rarely do I see UTV matter being used. Again, I welcome the Minister to the House and hope he will not forget the short-wave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to speak after Senator Ó Maoláin.  I liked lots of what he said and I certainly could not outdo his feat of broadcasting on 2RN in 1937 for the simple reason that I was not born then.  However, I have one claim to fame over sound radio which, if it does not equal that, it comes somewhere near it.  I expect that I am the only Member of the Seanad to have broadcast on shortwave <Col N="927" /> radio a ecumenical religious programme to Irish priests and nuns in Africa over Vatican Radio from Rome, with a Cardinal looking over my shoulder just to make sure that I, as a Church of Ireland representative, did not do anything wrong.</P>
      <P>That was in 1968, a few years after Senator Ó Maoláin's first appeal for shortwave, but I must back him up. I received some indirect communications after that programme.  The power of shortwave radio really is amazing. To be sitting in the Vatican and broadcasting to Irish clerics in Africa was really quite a sensation.</P>
      <P>To be slightly more serious, I have been particularly edified by this debate. I think it is a very important one because it is right that the Seanad should have a full-ranging discussion, giving all our personal points of view rather than particular political ones and contributing to the problem of running our national television and radio stations.  It is important that this should be done as well as we can possibly do it not only from our own particular point of view but from the point of view of the image which this country has abroad, and I am very pleased that so many Senators have made the point, and I am sure the Minister has taken it a dozen times by now, that our television network should be run and should be linked so that we achieve maximum co-operation with the North&mdash;that we get maximum coverage of everyday events in the North and <i>vice versa.</i>  I feel this can contribute in a very powerful way to understanding between the two parts of the country and I am delighted that so many people, especially Senator Ó Maoláin in his recent speech, have emphasised this so strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that if we welcomed the Minister, he has earned it.  If he were to come back on his next visit with any necessary legislation for co-operation between RTE and broadcasting services abroad, with the BBC, if legislation were necessary or if any other legal arrangements had to be made by the Department, then I for one would welcome this very much because it is one of the things <Col N="928" /> we must get on with.  We have been far too slow, we have gone through a period of relatively good relations between the two parts of our country and we now realise that things were only as they appeared on the surface and we have got to get down to the problem of deepening the understanding, of bridging the gap, and the communications media are vital in this project.</P>
    <P>We have had very interesting views from the professionals and this is one of the reasons why the Seanad is so important.  Senator Keery and Senator Horgan are professionals&mdash;Senator Keery is an ex-professional newsman&mdash; and they have given very instructive criticism and comment on the current use we are making of our radio and television networks.  I particularly want to take up Senator Keery on his use of his discussion of the efficiency of the advertisements in television and radio.</P>
    <P>I would agree with what he said but I would say that that is not the only criterion&mdash;the efficient use of time &mdash;by which we must judge the usefulness or otherwise of advertising. All the problems in running a television or radio station of the type we have in this country can be reduced to problems of balance.  If we do not have the finance from the advertising revenue how do we run our station? Do we have to increase our licence fee?</P>
    <P>I should like to see a State subsidy to help to cover the gap that might occur if we reduced advertising.  It is a question of balance and we certainly do not want to penalise those who are in the lower income groups, to whom radio and television licences mean so much, and we certainly want to ensure that all the people get the benefit of the work that is done by producers, directors, technicians and other personnel in our television studios.  Advertising has got to be judged in a more philosophic way.</P>
    <P>I am rather concerned with one point.  I dislike advertising on TV and radio.  It is different from advertising in the newspaper.  I can read the newspapers and I never see the advertisements: as far as my conscious mind goes they do not make any impression <Col N="929" /> on me, that is, unless I am specifically looking for some particular point in the advertising columns.  This is not the case in regard to television and radio. You cannot get up every quarter of an hour and turn down your TV set or turn off the sound: you have got to see them; as McLuhan has said, the medium is the message.  This is a half-truth which indicates that the way that programmes are put over is almost as important as what the programmes say.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about the position that we are going through a period of greatly changing values in this country and that everybody, and especially our younger people, is affected by the advertisements he sees.  I think that the very advertisements have become a part of the medium and they are propagating not the sense of values that we should like to see our young people having but a sense of values which is motivated by self-interest.  Advertising works on the theory that the people being shown in the advertisement are satisfying themselves and our younger people could get the impression that self-satisfaction is one of the prime aims in life.  This is the danger in advertising. We could become motivated by self-interest.  This problem has got to be fully realised and I think the advertisements have a much more subtle effect on our philosophy of life than people are generally aware, and there is a great danger that we will become a nation ever more motivated by self-interest.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am against advertising on television and radio but I realise that there is a problem of balance.  We cannot just produce the extra hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the air with which to run our television stations, and so it is a matter of balance.  A problem that this House should consider and watch very carefully is the standards by which the advertisements are controlled and the effect that those advertisements are having.  These things are hard to measure but we should attempt to measure them.  This House should act as a watchdog in this regard.</P>
    <P>In a debate of this nature we should voice our fears to the Minister because our sense of values is very important. <Col N="930" /> This is especially true where our younger people are concerned.  I myself have not got the problem of raising a family but if I had a young family I would be inclined to keep television out of the house for this reason.  As Senator Andy O'Brien has pointed out, RTE cannot be accused of producing salacious or suggestive programmes and this is greatly to their credit.  However, I think that advertisements in the long run, subtly, subliminally and psychologically, can have a bad effect on children.  That is my conservative point of view and I wanted to make it clear.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers here have said that the quality of the home-based, home-made products is good.  If possible we should have more of them and fewer of the canned importations from abroad.  The home-based products do not have to cover only one section of the market; let them cover all sections of the market.  I know there are questions of expense here.  Finance has to be balanced here against quality of programmes.  I am not sure if this is correct but I have been told that the canned programmes are actually cheaper to show on television than equivalent programmes produced at home.  I think we should pay more and have more home-based programmes.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have spoken about the rather jaundiced view which the BBC appear to have of this part of the country.  I agree with this.  I think the BBC have a jaundiced point of view on this part of the country, of the country as a whole.  I would say that every colony or ex-colony which was under British rule feels the same. Anyone I have spoken to says this is true of the BBC but, before we become too glib in our criticism of the BBC, let us think back to sound radio of ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Let us think back on the views of the UK and England that were propagated by our sound radio.  I remember hearing those views, they were outlined strongly in my background, and they were horrifying.  They would raise the hair on anyone's head if he heard them nowadays.  I am glad to say that that attitude has gone.  I think that criticism of the BBC is justified but before criticising them let us make sure that our coverage of events in <Col N="931" /> the North is a true reflection of life up there.  I know that people of all persuasions in the North feel that this is not so.</P>
    <P>Again, I back up Senator Ó Maoláin very strongly when he says that we should attempt to cover all aspects of life in the North of Ireland and not just the sensational and the spectacular.  We should endeavour to cover all newsworthy parts of Northern life.  I know as a person who has spent some time in Northern Ireland that there are parts of Northern life which are very fine and interesting, which are quite unknown to people in the South&mdash;those parts of life would make good material for broadcasting. It would contribute greatly to the common good if more emphasis was placed on the less sensational happenings in both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I was in Portadown this weekend and I noticed the only time that the BBC national news on television covers Ireland, either North or South, is when some unedifying scene occurs, such as the No. 1 headline which appeared on BBC television last Saturday night. This criticism of the BBC is certainly justified but we should make a special plea to our broadcasters, newsmen and other professionals in that business, to achieve a sense of balance, to hold on to the best set of values and not just to pander to sensationalism but to cover other items worthy of news which occur in the everyday life of the country and which do not involve killing, fighting or any other unpleasant features of Irish life, which come to the surface every now and then.</P>
    <P>I should like to cover a few other points briefly.  I am pleased that Senators Brugha, Cranitch, Honan and O'Brien raised the point of music on RTE.  I feel very strongly about this too.  We are not making enough use of our Symphony Orchestra or our Light Orchestra and our smaller chamber music groups.  I refer to the classical field: I am not as expert as Senator Cranitch on traditional music but I like it very much and the more I hear of it on radio, and see it well performed on television, the more I get to like it.  One point that I have noticed, and it is particularly dear to Senator <Col N="932" /> Cranitch's heart and it strikes me very strongly, having worked in the UK for a couple of years where I saw BBC television: there is no finer sight or sensation on television than a symphony orchestra in full flight.  I should like to see more full-scale programmes devoted to our RTE Symphony Orchestra. A programme consisting of the orchestra playing a major work is a marvellous sensation, a marvellous sight and a marvellous sound.  I hope the RTE Authority, or the people in charge, will give us more of the orchestra.  We have a fine orchestra and we are denying our viewers something of the highest value.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha made an interesting point in this regard.  He asked should we not attempt to subsidise the orchestra outside of the RTE Authority budget&mdash;that it is more than just an RTE symphony orchestra.  It is something that belongs to our culture and the financing of it should come from a general cultural fund.  I think this would be worth considering and I hope it will be considered by the Minister and other people who would be involved.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to make two small points.  One is about the coverage of sport on our sound and television networks.  I delight in seeing hurling and football on television, but I should like to see some handball on television.  I do not think I have ever seen handball on television.  Hurling and football are magnificent spectacles on television but I would make a plea for fairer treatment of the other games &mdash;I do not want to use the unpleasant epithet which has been associated with the other games for so long.  Now that the ban is about to disintegrate or disappear I think we should have more coverage of other games.  After all, as Senator Jack Fitzgerald has said, on other networks you can get continuous Saturday afternoon sports. In a programme of continuous Saturday afternoon sports you could fit in the whole spectrum of Irish sports. I should like to see a greater effort being made to widen our approach to sport on television.  I think some of our camera teams could well take lessons from the BBC, which is the <Col N="933" /> station I see, for their really expert coverage of association football.  I am sure the same rules would apply to all sports covered by the BBC but the actual technique and the close-ups and the replays are absolutely marvellous. I think our television people could benefit more from studying the BBC approach to sport in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister&mdash; this is of special interest to me as a university representative&mdash;if he has made any contact with the BBC about the University of the Air?  This involves the Minister for Education as well as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. As everybody knows, the universities are under terrific pressure, especially where night courses are concerned. The older people, who have not had the opportunity earlier on in life, want to study.  It is tremendously important that these people should not be denied an opportunity to receive university qualifications.</P>
    <P>I would envisage a two-way arrangement. Not just buying all BBC programmes. We have lots of good programmes, historical and cultural, that we could give to the BBC in part exchange.  I should like to see some approaches being made on this.  I should like to know if the Minister has had any informal contacts.  Some of the university programmes will be seen on BBC transmitters in parts of the country and an agreement between the BBC and RTE&mdash;a two-way agreement&mdash;would be beneficial to both stations and could help the people who are studying at night, or trying to take degrees later in life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My opening <Col N="934" /> sentence was about to be, in fact, that my known capacity for holding up the progress of public business was such that I thought I should say immediately that I know nothing about broadcasting.</P>
      <P>I have been stimulated by the debate and there are a few points I should like to make.  Arising out of what Senator Cranitch has said and Senator West, I think there is a question of doubt about the degree of influence of television on opinion and conduct.  The last serious discussion on this matter which I read was in the publication on a study two to three years ago.  The conclusion of that analyst was that it only confirmed people in their prejudices.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the desirability of the Minister getting in and my ending quickly and, dangerous though I think it is to try the patience of my friends on the right, I must tell them that I did not enjoy last weekend as much as most other Members of the Fine Gael Party.  I was away for the weekend and away from television.  I came back on Sunday evening, and I say this to illustrate the point, which I think is a serious one.  I was greeted by one of my children&mdash;the most politically conscious one&mdash;who said &ldquo;I am beginning to love Boland&rdquo;.  That point is made so I will go on to the next one.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Cranitch in his remark about alcoholism and the advertisements for intoxicating drink. God knows, there is nobody in this House who enjoys a drink more than I do, of any kind, with certain exceptions that I find are disagreeable to my constitution.  But in fact television advertising is bad and does stimulate the fellow who is trying to keep off drink.  On looking at the figures it seems to me that the loss would not be very great.  If I construe the figures, taking 1969 as the last year published, the figure seems to be taking in both sound and television and about 7 per cent of the total revenue would appear to come from advertisement for alcohol. This surprises me.  I thought it would turn out a much larger figure. It is less than £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support all Senators who praised <Col N="935" /> what someone described as the cinderella of broadcasting, that is the sound broadcasting.  Personally, I think it has improved enormously over the years. I find myself listening to it more and more and finding it satisfactory in its way of treating topics.  It was unfortunate that Senator Quinlan used the word &ldquo;juggling&rdquo; with regard to figures in relation to sound broadcasting when he gave a figure of about £1 to £6 as being the proportion of the money spent or given to performances on the radio and television.</P>
    <P>We have a person with an impeccable reputation auditing the accounts of this body&mdash;the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;and his attention should be drawn to the fact that someone in this House has seen fit to say that there is juggling involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest, nonetheless, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought to be made aware that this point has been made here, so that a note with regard to this would appear on the accounts.  He would know the basis on which the figures had been prepared and presented to those who had to study them.</P>
      <P>I was extremely interested in what Senator Mullins had to say about shortwave radio.  I found myself in great sympathy with his point of view and would think it a bit much to ask the Minister to deal with this now.  At some stage he might present to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas some analyses of the economics of this, as presumably it is for financial reasons we have not got it.  It would be useful for us to know the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental thing we are doing here today is going through a Stage of a Bill providing for, in effect, further assistance to Radio Telefís Éireann by the publc.  In this situation we should be thought of as persons whose minds ought to be directed to the financing of RTE and we should have some sort of a cash flow.  The Minister has told us of the various projects and that we are having only a two year <Col N="936" /> extension of the right to provide the grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>I should like to have seen what the project is for the next period which can be projected having regard to the things that are intended to be done. There can be many different bases for depreciation of assets and I should like the Minister to have been able to tell us what the basis of depreciation of assets is.  No doubt this can be found in some statute, but I would have liked to have known what interest does the State charge on this grant-in-aid.  That does not come out of the accounts I have before me.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if there is much loss of revenue from unlicensed television sets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's anxiety to get in, I will not speak at all on the Bill.  I should just like to ask the Minister one or two questions. In relation to the proposed new medium-wave radio transmitter in Athlone, it has been rumoured that this is to be erected elsewhere.  I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that this transmitter will be erected on the same site as the present one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will probably be the Minister's white-haired boy when he hears my speech from the Opposition. Generally speaking, the function of the Opposition is to oppose a Minister.</P>
      <P>When Senator Kelly, in his constructive speech, suggested that advertisements should be taken off radio and television, he gave an alternative to provide the money.  The Minister must be aware that Senator Kelly was at least constructive in that he was producing an alternative method of getting revenue.  Perhaps Senator Kelly did not realise that reception throughout the country is not the same as it is in Dublin.  Many people have spoken about that in various places.  People are not getting the same value for their money in some areas because reception is not good.  That I must accept as being true because the people throughout the country know more about it than I do.  I receive it in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the advertisements, there are certain aspects on which I would <Col N="937" /> agree fully with Senator Kelly.  I hate advertisements on television and radio and the Minister also says if he could do away with them he would do so.  If it were financially possible he would do it.  I often see an arrow&mdash;and this is an advertisement seen not only on our television but also on English television &mdash;a little arrow drawn with a sword that advertises Disprin.  This advertisement for Disprin always reminds me of Dettol, which gives me the odour of a maternity hospital every time I look at the arrow.  This is a very bad advertisement. I often wonder why the Medical Association do not take this up.  That is an advertisement advertising drugs like Disprin and is not correct at all.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of people here have suggested improvements.  Nobody is disputing what Senator Ó Maoláin said about the shortwave, or what anybody else has said.  But if we are to have everything that has been suggested today we would need more money than the Minister is providing.  Let us face up to this situation.  I am a realist as regards this problem.  I am not decrying all the suggestions; but if we must beam into the North, if we must have the shortwave, if we must have schools programmes or television university, let us face up to the fact that we must pay for them.  The amount that has been referred to by the Minister would not cover a tenth of what has been suggested here tonight.  To a certain extent, under this Bill, we are trying to find money to finance our broadcasting system.  I agree with all the suggestions made but the Minister is not even halfway on the road towards providing the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>There is another point I wish to make.  The Minister told us that payments are made by way of grant-in-aid voted by the Dáil under a subhead of the Post Office Vote.  I do not know if all the Members of this House know the definition of a grant-in-aid which has come from another room in this House.  According to that definition, if my memory serves me right&mdash;and I am open to correction on this&mdash;a grant-in-aid is only superfluous money nobody inquires about it.  Even the Comptroller and Auditor-General may <Col N="938" /> not inquire about it.</P>
    <P>This is all I propose to say.  I know the Minister wants to get in.  I could speak at length but I do not want to delay him.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that in the statement I have just made I am probably his greatest supporter.  I cannot see how our economy can provide the money for all the suggestions that have been made here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to convey my thanks and appreciation to the Senators for the way in which they have received this Bill.  The contributions offered have been very constructive and, indeed, very fair and certainly contain much food for thought and consideration.  I should like to assure the Senators at this stage that all the suggestions made will be considered carefully by me and by my Department. Of course, many of the remarks made will also have to be conveyed to the RTE Authority.</P>
      <P>As far as I can, I shall try to comment on some of the suggestions made by the various speakers throughout the course of the debate.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald, Senator Tomás Ó Maoláin and, I think, Senator West, were very keen on the shortwave radio.  I believe that in 1946 a high-powered shortwave transmitter was purchased but this was disposed of in the early 1950s, no broadcast having been made.  The decision not to proceed with the setting up of the shortwave service was taken after very careful consideration at the time.  Apart from the difficulty of getting a suitable wavelength, the position is that in general, throughout the world, shortwave listening is negligible, because of poor listening conditions, the general absence of shortwave bands on receiving sets and the strength of television.  However, to satisfy myself that this is not the same case as that which existed in the early 1950s, I shall have the matter re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West also mentioned the University of the Air.  I understand that this term has now been changed to the Open University.  Any question on this would be one primarily for the Minister for Education, and probably <Col N="939" /> also for the Government.  As far as I am concerned, it will be a matter for the RTE Authority as well.  RTE have been given the maximum freedom in programme matters and are, in fact, devoting some hours on Sunday afternoons at present to instructional TV programmes with an adult appeal.  My functions lie generally in approving any extra time necessary for such broadcasts which might fall outside the approved hours of transmission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It will probably come up under the HEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Very likely.  Senator West also dealt, to a large extent, with advertising.  My function as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in regard to advertising on Radio Telefís Éireann is spelled out under section 20, subsection (3) of the Act of 1960. This lays down that the total daily time fixed by the authority for broadcasting advertisements and the distribution determined by the authority of that time throughout the programme is subject to the approval of the Minister.  Since the beginning, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has always insisted that his function in relation to the RTE advertising is limited, even when it was argued that things being advertised were injurious to health, such as cigarettes and hard liquor.  At a later stage I shall deal with cigarettes and hard liquor.  I think Senator Cranitch raised this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various Senators made reference to Northern Ireland and to the possibility of getting our sound and television across to the Six Counties.  It is not any secret that replacement of the present Athlone transmitter by a more efficient and higher power transmitter is under way at the moment.  We are quite satisfied that this will give a very good radio reception throughout all of Ireland, especially during daylight hours which was part of the weakness up to now.  It is hoped, too, that this new transmitter will be near enough to Athlone or the present site of the transmitter that is operating at the moment.  This should satisfy Senator Keegan.  It is also hoped that this new transmitter will enable us to get our <Col N="940" /> radio signal well and truly into England.  I cannot say too much on this at the moment, but we certainly hope this will be the case.</P>
    <P>Improved television coverage of the Northern Ireland area would be, to my mind and indeed to the mind of the Government, very welcome and indeed very desirable.  But in view of the obligations under international agreements to which Ireland is a party, it is a problem that will not be solved very easily.  I can assure Senators that this matter is receiving every consideration at the moment and I am hopeful that we will be able to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Jack Fitzgerald who mentioned something in connection with aerials, as to why people in the Six Counties are not getting our signal.  As Senator Ó Maoláin said, they would if they put up the appropriate aerials, but they are not inclined to do this.  We do know that at the moment RTE television transmission to the Six Counties may be satisfactorily received in various places west of the line joining Bushmills, Coleraine and Enniskillen, the south-eastern part of County Fermanagh, south Tyrone and the western region of County Armagh, part of County Down east of the line joining Bangor and Newcastle.  The population within these areas, which I have just mentioned, is about 14 per cent of the population of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>In other parts of the Six Counties on high ground reception similar to that received in Dublin from the BBC and ITV can be obtained if what is known as a high fringe aerial is used. Because both BBC and ITV transmitters are situated close to Belfast viewers there get satisfactory reception with ordinary simple aerials.  We all know that Belfast is surrounded entirely by hills and the signals emitted from any of our existing transmitters are too weak for satisfactory reception with simple aerials.  If people living on high ground wish to get RTE signals they should consider putting up an aerial and I think they would.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch and Senator Alexis FitzGerald dwelt on the advertising of <Col N="941" /> cigarettes and alcoholic drinks.  It has already been announced that cigarette advertising is being phased out and will cease as and from the 1st April. This decision will not affect the advertising of tobacco or cigars.  As a result of this the authority will reduce its advertising revenue by about 10 per cent unless it can find other sources to make good the loss.  In 1969-70 the cigarette advertising on television brought in almost £¼ million.  This follows the trend of many countries in Europe who have ceased advertising cigarettes on television while some others are in process of phasing out this source of revenue.  I understand that cigarette advertising is no longer allowed on British television as a result of the decision by the British Government some time in 1965.  The British Government's decision has been very strongly criticised by the Independent Television Authority and by the representatives of the tobacco manufacturers on the grounds that it introduces an unfair and potentially dangerous principle of discrimination.</P>
    <P>In connection with alcoholic drinks, the House should be aware that there is no advertising of hard liquor on RTE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been so for some time and it is something of which we all approve.  The advertising of alcoholic drinks accounted for about 7 per cent of the revenue of Telefís Éireann from advertisements in 1969-70.  On sound radio the revenue was about £7,000 to £8,000, or between 1.7 and 2 per cent in the same period. There has been criticism of the advertising of drink on television and its effects on young people, particularly on the unformed or immature minds. Advertising trends are kept under review by the authority from time to time and changes are being effected in the presentation of drink advertisements on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, we do not advertise hard liquors.  We also insist that advertisements must conform to a code of standards before <Col N="942" /> they are accepted for transmission. Again, my only function in regard to advertising is under section 20, subsection (3), as I have already mentioned to Senator West.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion from Senator Quinlan that RTE should make greater efforts to sell some of their taped material.  I have been informed by RTE that the sales are of very small value because there is a small market in English-speaking countries for monochrome film.  I understand that the sales in 1969-70 realised about £7,500.</P>
    <P>We have had the Eurovision Song Contest kicked around quite a lot.  I should like to state that RTE's obligation to stage the contest this year derives by tradition from the victory of the Irish entrant last year.  As the House will remember, the contest was held last year in Amsterdam.  Once they are obliged to stage it they must do the job well because our national prestige is involved and the contest has become one of the most popular events in the world of light entertainment. The television audience is estimated to be in the region of 400,000,000 viewers.  I understand that some 18 broadcasting organisations are expected to take part.  These organisations will send hundreds of representatives to Dublin for the event.  I am quite satisfied that the holding of the contest in Ireland cannot fail to promote interest in Ireland and be of benefit to the tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but my point was not that the holding of the contest here would not confer some benefit. Clearly it would, and I agree with the Minister that if people come tourism will benefit.  My point was, and is, that an organisation like Telefís Éireann, which is short of money, is being asked to subsidise this event and may have to do so at the expense of its current affairs programmes and the programmes of an entertainment kind which are made here.  The tourism organisation should subsidise it or should pay £35,000 to Telefís Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Senator Kelly that, if the financing of <Col N="943" /> the Eurovision Song Contest was going to have a detrimental effect on current affairs programmes, this would be very serious altogether.  I would be satisfied that the RTE Authority would not allow this to happen.  There have been rumours about lack of finances and curtailment of certain programmes. This is normal at this time of the year because the Programme Controller is probably getting his programmes ready for next autumn and this is the time of year when the contracts of people who are working with the RTE organisation are renewed or looked at and examined.  I certainly agree with Senator Kelly that, if the Eurovision Song Contest, no matter how much we might like to have it, affected the current affairs programmes, it would be a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to a remark I made in my opening address in connection with changes of an administrative kind in the Broadcasting Authority Acts which are under consideration at the moment.  Possible provision will be made for wider powers of borrowing and investment.  We will have to look into the disposal of copyrights, licences and privileges and widening the scope of the authority's superannuation scheme.  These are some of the many things that will have to be looked at.</P>
      <P>Comment has also been made by more than one Senator that we should have a committee composed of Oireachtas Members to advise on these things.  I do not know what the RTE Authority, who have responsibility under the Act for television in this country, would think of that.  Some Senator, on this side of the House, referred to the fact that it would be good if we had more rural people on this committee to safeguard the interests of the rural community.  This is not necessary because there are people from rural Ireland on the RTE Authority at the moment.  I am very satisfied that these members from rural Ireland who are on the authority will certainly see to it that every section of our community will be represented at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Michael O'Higgins raised a <Col N="944" /> query on the setting up of advisory committees.  To date, one advisory committee has been set up since the Act was passed.  This was an educational advisory committee of five persons and the sanction of the Minister was conveyed on 4th December, 1964, for the making of recommendations on radio and television educational matters to the authority.  One reason why there are not more advisory committees functioning probably lies in the fact that the authority has not sought to have them formed or has not approached me or my predecessors to have committees or advisers appointed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins queried the services for Ministers.  On my reckoning <i>Telefís Scoile</i> is the only paid service formerly provided for a Minister under that section.  Various features such as <i>Garda Patrol</i> and films on road safety are broadcast without charge to the Department backing them and without any great formality of arrangements. Everyone would agree with me that these things are very desirable.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan raised the question of issuing licences and collecting licence fees.  He suggested that this should be transferred to RTE.  This matter is under consideration at the moment.  I cannot say what the result of the consideration will be but it is certainly being examined.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly brought up something which was very important when he referred to RTE's position as the sole national broadcaster and said they should not have a monopoly.  He suggested that it was possibly unconstitutional. RTE's position as the sole national broadcaster derives from the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, as amended by the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  Not being an expert on constitutional law, as the Senator is, I cannot dispute its constitutionality with him.  It was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and has been in operation for some time.  If somebody wishes to contest this, it is a decision which he himself will have to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he would <Col N="945" /> Senator Kelly again spoke about the establishment of independent local radio stations.  We must appreciate that the Irish broadcasting service has been a public service since it was set up and the establishment of independent local broadcasting stations would therefore involve a radical change in policy.  Legislation would be necessary if this was required and, to my mind, there is no evidence of any public demand for such a change.  It is quite obvious to anybody who is interested in this that local stations would need to earn a substantial amount of money, which they would do from advertising. This would be possible only by diversion of advertising receipts from RTE which is operating the sound broadcasting service at a substantial loss.  As well as that, it is probable that these local stations would take advertising from the local provincial newspapers. The independent stations would, no doubt, provide opportunities for remunerative investment if permitted to operate in the most profitable areas and without the kind of national obligations which are undertaken by RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be open to the Oireachtas, if the Oireachtas provided a licensing system for independent stations, to impose upon these independent stations whatever standards they chose.  If they chose to say to the station: &ldquo;You will have to safeguard the aims that we have laid down for Telefís Éireann and you will have to observe impartiality&rdquo; there is no reason why it should not do so.  Let me add also that I did not make any plea for local broadcasting stations that might take advertising away from local papers.  I merely made the point that there is nothing in the Constitution which rules out such a thing and nothing which entitles Radio Telefís Éireann to claim a monopoly or the Minister to assert it.</P>

However, there is no reason why there should not be an independent national station.</P>

      <P>I suppose we could toss that backward and forward all night long.  I do not know if Senator Kelly meant to be sarcastic or not when he told me, in his opening remarks, that I was not a bit slow to increase the postal charges.  I do not mind one way or the other, but the House should also know that I increased the television licence fees in July, 1970.  The case has been made by some Senators here, in the course of the debate, that they personally would not mind if the fees were increased to £14, thus doing away with the income from advertising which is necessary for RTE to survive. I know full well the comments and the publicity which my action last July in raising the fee to £6 received and I certainly would not like to be in a position where I would have to announce that the licence fee was going up to £14.</P>

      <P>Senator Michael O'Higgins asked about the number of people who do not pay their television licences.  At the moment we estimate this number to be about 40,000 which would mean about £240,000 annually <Col N="947" /> to RTE.  We are making every effort to trace these people, to catch up with them and, as I mentioned, we hope to have legislation before long before the House.  Every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas would welcome this because £240,000 per year is quite a sizeable sum.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by Senator Horgan that I should exercise more control in connection with the budgeting of departments.  This I cannot do because this is purely an internal matter for RTE.  Senator Horgan went on from there and raised something which is fairly topical at the moment, colour television.  I want to state that RTE has no firm plans for the regular studio production of colour programmes and I understand that this will be the position for several years.  Even after a number of years I would imagine that the production of regular studio programmes will depend on the availability of money at that particular time. I should think that colour television cannot be contemplated for several years ahead owing to the financial commitments involved and other commitments having higher priority.  I am thinking of things like Gaeltacht radio, the radio service, the VHF radio and improved reception generally throughout the country.  I am extremely doubtful that there is any widespread public demand for colour having regard to the cost of the sets.  The important thing is the quality of programmes, not their colour.  I am not anxious to stimulate demand for colour programmes or indeed colour television sets.  It might be interesting for the Members to know that in the United States of America, where they have had ten full years of colour programming, less than one-third of the sets are colour sets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparations for colour have been going ahead for some time.  This, to my mind, is not premature because in buying new equipment one must consider whether it would be adequate for the broadcasting needs ten years from now.  I understand that much of the equipment now available is adaptable for colour.  Consequently, RTE have, of necessity, been involved in colour earlier than might otherwise have <Col N="948" /> been the case.  Because they have what is known as colour capable equipment available and because staff must be trained for the inevitable advent of colour, RTE has been transmitting Eurovision colour material and imported or canned material in colour for some time.</P>
    <P>I understand that after April next it will be possible to broadcast Irish events in colour.  I am thinking now of GAA finals or other sports, maybe the Sweeps Derby.  They will be handled by the Outside Broadcast Unit, which has been re-equipped for the Eurovision Song Contest.  I understand also that, if we are to have any chance of getting other stations or other networks in other countries to take these programmes from us, they will have to be in colour.  At the moment experimental colour transmissions of Eurovision material or the canned material will continue, amounting to about one hour per day.  But regular or studio transmissions of colour television are still several years off.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Senator Horgan that the authority are not rushing madly into this.  I think it is the wish of every Member here that this should be the case, that we should hasten very slowly here.  This would also be the wish of Members of the other House.  I understand about £25,000 has been spent specifically in preparation for colour.  The number of colour sets in the country is very small. I believe about two months ago it was estimated that there were 2,000 colour television sets installed.  They have been coming into the country at the rate of approximately 300 per month, but they are not being installed at the rate of 300 per month.  They are being kept in warehouses and places like that.  To spell out our attitude to colour, it is very simple: there are no firm plans for the studio production of colour programmes and there will not be for some time.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael O'Higgins asked for the number of written directives to RTE under section 31 and the answer is that no written directive has been given under section 31.  I am not going to comment on the part of Senator Quinlan's contribution where he said <Col N="949" /> that the left-wing get too much coverage because I would be expressing a personal view here and we could be discussing that one for a long time and not agree on it.  I think I have covered most, if not all, the queries that have been put to me.</P>

      <P>Before we decide this I want to mention a point I brought up before in this House: that is the tendency of rushing through Stages of a Bill.  The Committee Stage is the Stage at which Members are enabled to put down amendments to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I never oppose or threaten the authority of Senator Ó Maoláin in these matters.  But this question of rushing Stages of a Bill through the House is not a precedent <Col N="950" /> we shall accept.  I am quite sure many Members of the House will recall that I made this protest before.</P>

      <P>May I point out, with Senator Belton's permission, that this is a Certified Money Bill which must be made law within a deadline. There are only two sections in it.  I took it for granted that Senators would be anxious to facilitate the Minister in getting this Bill through tonight.  We had a very extensive debate and nobody suggested any amendments. Therefore, I took it for granted that there would be no difficulty in concluding it tonight.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the House completely misunderstands me. I mentioned this matter before when this occurred previously.  I am sure the Leader of the House remembers that quite clearly.  I am prepared to accede to the Leader of the House on this occasion, provided it will not be taken as a precedent.</P>
