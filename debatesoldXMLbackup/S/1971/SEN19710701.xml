      <P>I should, I think, inform the Seanad of the procedure in this matter.  In accordanc with Standing Order No 75 a Bill which has been initiated in the Seanad, and amended by the Dáil, is after its receipt back from the Dáil deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On Report Stage the Minister on the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo; explains the meaning of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  Seanad amendments, on Report Stage, are in order provided that they arise out of the amendments made by the Dáil.  The only matters that may be discussed are the Dáil amendments or any Seanad amendments rising out of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order and so that this matter can be clarified, in the present case it is not our intention to propose any amendments to the amendments made in the Dáil.  Were it the position that we wished to do so, I should be glad to know what the procedure would be. I would suggest that it might be proper that, if we did give notice of intention of the presentation of amendments, rather than proceed to business we should fix the date and time at which the matter would be discussed.</P>

      <P>That is a matter the Chair has considered.  It is really a matter for the House.  If the House wished to adopt a procedure of that kind it could do so.  The Standing Order does not provide for any compulsory period of notice, so it is essentially a matter for the House.</P>

      <P>My only concern here is that in taking this Bill on Report from the Dáil today, without notice, which I am quite prepared to do, it would not be held as creating a precedent which would oblige us to take Bills from the Dáil, to take Dáil amendments on Report, without notice in the future.</P>

      <P>There are precedents in the past.  Bills of this nature have been taken without notice on previous occasions, but no binding precedent can be established.  It is a matter for the House, on each occasion, to decide.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>These are three amendments which were agreed to in the Dáil subsequent to the passage of this Bill in the other House.  Amendment No. 1 is part of section 9, subsection (2), and is merely a drafting amendment as the Seanad will appreciate.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 was inserted by me at Committee Stage in the Dáil to ensure that the eyesight standards, which the trade unions concerned were anxious to apply in the case of tests on locomotive drivers, will be the standards that at present apply.  The trade unions representing the locomotive drivers, in their representations to me, asked that the regulations would incorporate the current standards of vision on which they have agreed with CIE.  This I propose to do under this amendment which states that:</P>
      <P>the standards of eyesight referred to in paragraph (a) may be set out in the regulations under subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is the most important of the three and was the only matter that caused some contention in the course of the passage of this legislation. As the Seanad will remember, it concerns section 29, subsection (4). The original intention of the Bill was that periodic medical tests would be compulsory as far as all engine drivers were concerned.  It was represented to me, both by the trade unions concerned and by Members of the Dáil, that there was an inequity in the section as it stood as far as present locomotive drivers were concerned.  In the Dáil I conceded the case made in respect of locomotive drivers who were employed by CIE before 4th October, 1968.  On 4th October, 1968, by agreement between the trade unions and CIE, it was made a condition of employment <Col N="812" /> in CIE for new entrants as locomotive drivers.  Part of the conditions of employment stated that these periodic medical tests would be carried out and that has been in operation since that date.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what we are doing in this section is putting into statutory form what has, in fact, been practice since October, 1968, so far as new entrants to locomotive driving are concerned. We are removing, altogether, the original meaning of the section which would make the periodic tests applicable to locomotive drivers appointed before October, 1968.  In other words, the present locomotive drivers will not be subject to the statutory compulsion of periodic medical tests.  All drivers who have come in since 1968, and entrants from now on, will have this statutory compulsion to have these periodic medical tests in the interests of safety.  It would have been inequitable, on balance, to have this apply to men who were appointed before the condition became part of the conditions of employment of locomotive drivers.  For that reason I brought in the third amendment, in the Dáil, in response to many and varied representations from trade unions or members of the public and from Deputies in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House will be grateful to the Minister for the explanation he has given of these relatively minor amendments to this Bill.  Before speaking on the question as to whether the Seanad should assent to these amendments I should like to comment a little further on the question of the manner in which these come to the Seanad.  It is, of course, a matter of some gratification to us that Bills are now being introduced into the Seanad, receiving their first discussion here, and then going to the Dáil.  But it would be wrong if I did not point out the difficulties under which we labour when the amendments come back to us in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that this return of the Bill from the Dáil to the Seanad appears on our Order Paper today for the first time.  We had virtually no notice of the matter that was being discussed.  We received only this morning <Col N="813" /> a copy of the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt for a moment.  The Chair is a bit worried about this turn the discussion is taking.  The Chair has just stated that on the Report Stage this Bill is returned from the Dáil.  The only matters which may be discussed are the Dáil amendments or any Seanad amendments arising out of them.  It occurs to the Chair that this question of notice and so on would better have been raised on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if my introduction to what I had to say was overlong, but my point is: which Dáil amendment are we discussing?  We do not have with our Order Paper this morning a list of the Dáil amendments. We have a copy of the Bill as passed in Dáil Éireann.  In order to discover the amendments which are before us now we would have to compare the text of the Bill as it left us with the text now received from Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>In order to find out what amendments were before us&mdash;and as you properly say they are the only things we can discuss&mdash;it was necessary for me to examine the sheet of Dáil amendments, go through them and find out which of them were in the text of the Bill which has now been circulated to us.  All I should like to suggest is that it would be helpful to the House if in cases like this the list of the amendments actually made in the Dáil were circulated on a separate sheet.  This would enable us to discuss these matters more usefully.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the nature of these amendments quite clear when introducing them and there is no difficulty about them.  But on more complicated legislation, perhaps more controversial legislation, it might well be that we could be in serious difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to pass to the amendments which the Minister has suggested to us.  He mentioned that the first amendment which was made in section 9 is a drafting amendment.  It is a drafting amendment which includes, within the scope of section 9, as I understand it, the question of certain actions or proceedings which are <Col N="814" /> being enforced by the board of the old joint committee.  I should like to ask the Minister: is this merely a matter of safety in case there are certain actions which have not yet come to light or is it the position that there are, indeed, actions of which he already knows?  When the Minister is concluding this debate I should be glad if he would indicate whether there are any actions of the type which needs to be covered by the amendment or whether it is merely an added safety in case these arise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second amendment, and the third which is concerned with the same matter, the Minister has told us that what he is doing is amending the Bill to bring it closer to the position which has already been agreed on between the unions and the management of CIE.  It would be helpful if the Minister would reassure the House&mdash; and through the House reassure the public&mdash;that the fact that he is limiting this statutory requirement to drivers who have been recruited since 1968 does not mean that there is no surveillance in regard to the health and eyesight of existing drivers.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing this Bill originally I recall that the Minister indicated that the situation was not one in which nothing had been done before and now everything was to be done on a statutory basis.  But the fact that we, in this amendment, say that the Bill which is now before us will only apply to those recruited after 1968 might give rise to the anxiety that there were no controls or provisions whatsoever in regard to those who had been recruited before that date.  Subject to these queries and comments these amendments are acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The third amendment really only consolidates the 1968 agreement.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct. The first amendment is just a normal cautionary tightening up.  There is no such action pending that we are aware of as mentioned by Senator Dooge.  It is really a caution to ensure that the section is tightened up.  In case there is any such action&mdash;it is very unlikely to arise&mdash;just as Senator Dooge used the <Col N="815" /> phrase, it is an added safety to tighten the section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is just ensuring that the vision test will be as it now is and will not be changed.  While amendment No. 3 ensures that the section will make statutory and therefore mandatory the periodical medical test for locomotive drivers of the future who have been recruited since 1968, I want to assure the House that there is no question of any departure from safety as far as existing drivers are concerned, that regular physical and eyesight tests are carried out in regard to engine drivers.  From their own point of view it is in their own interest as well as everything else.</P>
      <P>After 50 years of age, for instance, a locomotive driver must have an eyesight check every five years.  These examinations take place at the moment but it was my feeling, from the humanitarian point of view, that we should not make this mandatory for the older men who were there before 1968 and they might be in some way prejudiced by making it a mandatory matter in their regard.  For that reason I decided to eliminate it.  Time will take care of the problem.  There is no point in using the sledgehammer to deal with a nail situation.</P>
      <P>The problem will be a diminishing one.  It was placing an unnecessary psychological burden, more than anything else, on existing engine drivers, so I decided not to go the whole way and to amend the section for that reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that these amendments are being brought in at this fairly late stage not least because of the tardiness in some respects of one of the unions involved in examining the Bill and its implications for their members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a question. In view of this I am wondering whether the Minister would assure us that in legislation of this kind in future this kind of problem might be alleviated, if not removed completely, by prior consultation with unions involved in this sort of situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the fullest consultation with the trade unions at all stages in this matter.  They were aware of it and eventually we met them half way.  This, in my view, was parliamentary democracy at its best.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Higher Education Authority Bill is intended to give statutory status to an <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority that was set up in August, 1968.  The history of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee is that it was conceived in the spring of 1967.  I think some courtship had been going on by certain individuals before that but the birth of this <i>ad hoc</i> committee did not occur until August, 1968, which is a long period of gestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general we, on this side of the House, welcome this Bill.  We have certain reservations as to the details in some of the sections, but these I will deal with at a later stage.  We have heard a number of speakers on this Bill already.  I would agree with the people who pointed out that the emphasis has been laid on the academic side of this Bill, that is the university side of this Bill.  Probably the first institutions to be dealt with, to be recognised by this Higher Education Authority when it comes into being, as I am sure it will come into being, will be the universities.  However, we must not overlook other aspects of education. Technological aspects of the <Col N="817" /> present age require consideration, and some of this technological work may be dealt with by institutions other than universities.  Of course, it will be up to the Higher Education Authority, when it is established, to decide whether they come within the ambit of their jurisdiction or not.  Technological advances were mentioned here when we were discussing the Nuclear Energy Bill. Before the Governing Body of University College, Dublin, last Tuesday was the question of the setting up of a faculty of computer science.  This is under consideration at the moment. These are extremely important aspects of our age.</P>
    <P>There must also come within the ambit of this Higher Education Authority the many research bodies that have been established in recent years. Consideration must be given to these research bodies because there must be co-ordination at this level of education. My understanding of the <i>raison d'étre</i> of this Bill and of the setting up this Authority is to co-ordinate all levels of higher education, be it university, technological, research and maybe the College of Art or places like that.  These points of course are brought out in the Bill itself, I think in section 5.  I will come to that later. This will be the province of the newly-appointed Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>It is as well for me to mention the fact that has been mentioned by somebody I think from the Government benches that higher education can never be dealt with in isolation.  All sections of education impinge upon each other to some degree.  Secondary and primary education are subjects that must be discussed here as well as higher education.  I will give you the reasons.</P>
    <P>Take secondary education first.  In my view it would be necessary for the Higher Education Authority to consult with the principals of post-primary educational schools and discuss with them, not tell them in an imperious manner what they should do, the curriculum for the last two years in secondary schools.  It would aid the principals of these schools in the formation <Col N="818" /> of the minds of the pupils in regard to their future careers.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and I have put down an amendment to section 11 concerning the dissemination of information.  I have sought to add a new subsection which would compel the Higher Education Authority to give such information as would be deemed necessary and to include <i>inter alia</i> the size of the faculties in the various universities and the numbers that are rejected each year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of that is to ensure that the principals of secondary or post-primary schools, whatever designation one wants to give them, would have before them the information that a faculty&mdash;be it arts, be it medicine, be it any faculty you like&mdash;in that particular year was overcrowded.  Some other faculty may not be so overcrowded and there may be vacancies there.  On the basis of that information from the Higher Education Authority they could guide their pupils.  I do not suggest all information should be given, but the relevant information that would be applicable to the guidance of students as to their future careers.  This guidance should commence at least in the penultimate year of secondary school.  This guidance, of course, need not be accepted but I think it would be a great help to the principals of the secondary schools if they had before them which faculties were overcrowded and which were not overcrowded. They could advise the pupils themselves and the parents of the pupils as to what they should do when they leave the secondary school, what subject they should take up or what faculty they should enter.</P>
    <P>With regard to primary schools, I will leave this over until I am dealing with night classes in universities.  There is also the question of whether all primary teachers should have degrees and the facilities to be given to them if they have degrees.  Night classes are the subject of much controversy with students, especially in UCD.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the position in Galway and Cork, but it is not my intention to overlook these universities.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by Senator <Col N="819" /> Honan, a teacher may have the highest degrees possible and yet may not be an expert in imparting his knowledge to the student.  From my own experience when in college I had one lecturer who was an FRS but was not a particularly good teacher.</P>
    <P>I agree with the idea of giving the child of any parents an opportunity to have higher education such as that received in a university, but I wonder if the cart has been put before the horse in this regard.  We are reaching a situation where faculties are overcrowded, where provision had not been made for this aspect of education.  The buildings are not adequate, with the exception of the new building being erected in Belfield. I do not know the age of the buildings in Cork and Galway.  The existing accommodation does not encourage the assimilation of knowledge and because of lack of heating, lighting, etc. these buildings are outdated. These things should have been looked into before the inflow of students.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the recruiting of competent staff to the various universities. It is not easy to reject a student when, if the numbers were not so great, he or she would be deemed competent to enter the university.  The situation is arising now where students are being rejected due to the lack of accommodation and lack of staff.  Probably every university in the country has bent over backwards to accept as many students as possible and it has gone beyond the ideal staff-student ratio.  An imbalanced staff-student ratio impairs the assimilation of knowledge of those people who would be taken in under a correct staff-student ratio.  Therefore, the standards go down.  The ideal staff-student ratio would vary from faculty to faculty.  It may be that in arts, the ratio would be one staff member to 20 students, although that is high.  In medicine, or in faculties where practical work has to be undertaken, such as engineering and architecture, the ratio should be much lower&mdash;perhaps one staff member to ten or 12 students.  I have not got the solution to this.  It will be a serious problem for the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> I should like to comment on the financing of universities.  This Bill states that after consultation with the various higher educational institutions, the institutions that have come within the ambit of higher education will submit their requirements to the Higher Education Authority.  I presume they will be processed and be brought to the Minister.  The Minister for Education must go to the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance for the money.</P>
    <P>If the Higher Education Authority, in consultation with the higher education institutions, obtain the money they require, there is no problem.  But this will not always happen.  The economic circumstances of the country may be such that the pruning of the grants to some Departments may occur.  I am not suggesting that this is the fault of a particular Government.  Economic circumstances may dictate this.  The grant for higher education needed by the Higher Education Authority may be reduced by, say, £500,000&mdash;I am taking that figure at random.  The Higher Education Authority will have to distribute that money to the higher education institutions who have submitted their budgets.  It may be said that this should be distributed equitably. I wish to avoid the word &ldquo;equitably&rdquo; because to some minds equitably means in proportion to what they have asked.  To others, it may not mean exactly that.</P>
    <P>I am speaking here about capital funds, not current funds.  The current funds may arise on an odd occasion.  I cannot envisage how current moneys or higher education can come into this generally, but they may.  It may be conceived by some people that if buildings have already commenced, or if tenders have been issued and have been accepted, or if plans are being prepared, it would be better to complete that building or buildings, even though it would take away from the grants to other institutions.  An institution that has this afoot already should be given money to complete what has already been undertaken and is partially complete. It would be better business. Maybe what I am saying is self-evident to many people, and probably would <Col N="821" /> be self-evident to the members of the proposed Higher Education Authority. However, it is no harm to mention these facts and to have them on the records of this House.  I presume that the members of the Higher Education Authority will read the Dáil and Seanad Debates on this subject.</P>
    <P>It would be more businesslike, and cheaper in the long run, for the Government to finish what has been commenced. Where commencement begins would be a matter for discussion.  If plans are prepared, is that a commencement? If tenders have been issued, is that a commencement?  Certainly, it is a commencement if the buildings have been started and the grants should be given to complete them.  I shall give an example.  On the campus at Belfield at present the Department of Finance have allocated money for two-thirds of the cost of the library.  The money for the other third has not yet been allocated. This may be dealt with before the establishment of the Higher Education Authority but I am using it as an illustration.  It would be better to complete one building before starting some other structure in another place.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of finishing all the buildings in Belfield.  I think there are three faculties which are not yet catered for&mdash;architecture and medicine being two of them.  There may be reasons for the delay in the medical faculty.  I do not know if the delay in these has anything to do with the merger, which I shall refer to later.  I am not quite sure why this cannot go ahead at present.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to students' fees.  This has been mentioned in newspapers recently. Unfortunately, it was leaked before the governing body of UCD had time to deal with it, but it is now public knowledge that it has since been dealt with.  The newspapers published a statement to the effect that students' fees were going up by 25 per cent.  One must face up to this.  The universities appear to be the butt of all criticism in this regard.  They get their money from two sources: by way of grant from the Government and by way of fees from students.  If they cannot get sufficient money to operate by way of grant, the only other way to get money is to increase the fees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Where does the fault lie?  Is it right that the university should take the whole blame?  I do not think so.  The running costs of a university, like any other institution, are going up.  The salaries of teaching staffs and wages of others are increasing.  The running costs, such as heating, lighting, cleaning, are all going up.  The universities, in common with other businesses and institutions, need more money each year.  Not alone do they need money for the normal increases, but new faculties are being introduced at present. There will, therefore, be new recruitment of staff.  I have already mentioned one of the new faculties, that of computer science, which is in the pipeline at the moment.  There may be others.  There is a lectureship in Swedish pending.  That may be paid for by the Swedish Institute and may not be relevant.</P>
    <P>The running expenses of the universities today are rising very rapidly, and money must be procured.  If the Government do not provide the money, there is only one other source from which they can get the money, that is from the students&mdash;a source from which I do not like to take it.  I am not blaming the Minister.  When I refer to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; I mean any Minister for Education, and if I wish to refer to this particular Minister I shall do so.  I do not want to point any of my statements now towards the present Minister for Education.  I know that the Government may be in financial difficulties; I know that they may have to cut their cloth; I know that they may not be able to increase the budget to universities to cover increased current expenditure, year by year.  However, what I do not agree with is that the universities should take all the blame, and that they should be the butt of the criticism from the general public and students for the increase in fees.  I do not accept this.  I should like to ask the present Minister, Deputy Faulkner, if he would issue some statement regarding the increase in fees in the universities.  It is no fault of the universities; they must increase their fees.  That must be evident to everybody. Costs are going up everywhere.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to the question of night students.  This has been a <Col N="823" /> thorny problem in UCD.  There were demonstrations there, not because they abolished the night classes, but because they introduced a new system of a three-yearly admission.  For the benefit of people who are not clear as to what a three-yearly admission is, it means that from a certain date a number of students will be accepted and they will go through the whole three years, with professors and lecturers.  But no others will be taken in until those three years are over.  Then another three year cycle will begin.</P>
    <P>There has been an outcry amongst the night students about this.  Not so long ago Trinity College abolished night classes altogether.  This is a subject that should be seriously considered by the Higher Education Authority. If we want primary school teachers to have degrees they may only be able to take their degrees at night, unless they are willing to spend three years studying for their BA and then go to a training college such as St. Patrick's in Drumcondra which is one of the best training colleges in Europe at the primary level.  I ought to know because I attended St. Patrick's National School in Drumcondra and we were used as guinea pigs for the student teachers.  St. Patrick's Training College have produced some of the finest teachers in primary education.  These student teachers are handicapped because they have not got the time to study for degrees if they wish.  These teachers might avail of night classes to get their degrees.  This is one aspect of it.</P>
    <P>Night classes should not be abolished altogether.  The Higher Education Authority, in consultation with Trinity College and University College, Dublin, might evolve a system of night classes that would be acceptable to those who wish to partake of them. There might be a method of transferring professors or lecturers to whatever institution would be used for these degrees.  This is a problem for the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>One may ask why the night classes in Trinity College were suspended and why in UCD the three year cycle was introduced.  It is due to the lack of <Col N="824" /> qualified staff.  It was felt in UCD that a degree of a lower standard might be issued than a degree taken during the day classes.  These are the reasons given by UCD.  I should like to ask the Minister for Education to indicate if it is the wish of Members of the Oireachtas to again study the question of night classes.</P>
    <P>I will refer to a statement which the <i>ad hoc</i> committee made and the Minister refuted on the question of the cost of capital works.  The <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority estimated the cost of capital works at £24 million.  The Department of Education stated that this was wrong.  They said it would need only £15 million.  Something must be very wrong if there is such a great discrepancy there.  More information on this subject should be made available. It is almost certain that the <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Committee had expert advice from architects and quantity surveyors when they arrived at the figure of £24 million.  Surely the Department should have had expert advice when they arrived at the figure of £15 million.  I fail to see how this discrepancy can have occurred.  This has already been mentioned in the other House.  I should like to know how this discrepancy occurred.  I should like to know how the <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority fixed £24 million and the Department fixed £15 million as the cost.  The difference of £9 million is a sum that could be used to great advantage in other aspects of education.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's winding up speech in the Dáil&mdash;Volume 251, column 1133 of the Dáil Official Report&mdash;he stated that when the Higher Education Authority was set up it was his opinion that it required legislation to establish a higher education institution not already there.  I want to ask the Minister if an institution is already in existence, but has not been deemed a higher educational institution, would it need legislation to promote that to an institution of higher education?  There is no provision in this Bill for demoting an institution of higher education which does not fulfil what the Higher Education Authority would deem to be its duties.  I doubt if the point would ever <Col N="825" /> come up, but I think it should be covered.  Much has been said in the other House about which institutions should come within the ambit of the Higher Education Authority.  There was no discussion of what should be left out.  Neither was there any mention of the criteria by which an institution of higher education should be judged. I presume the Higher Education Authority will set up their own criteria. If an institution does not live up to what the Higher Education Authority requires, there is no provision in this Bill to take any type of penalising procedures against it.  There is no provision, for instance, to demote it or to put it outside the ambit of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>We now turn to the question of student participation in the Higher Education Authority.  The Minister said that he has made provision for 18 places&mdash;I am not sure whether that figure includes, or excludes, the present chairman&mdash;but he will only fill 14 of those places.  I am not at all against his suggestion on this but I wonder what is the purpose behind this proposal. He said he may bring in students on the HEA.  Is it reserved for clerics?  Is it reserved for any particular purpose at all?  I am not against this proposal because, after establishing the Higher Education Authority, over a period of years it may come to the Authority's notice that they would like to have on the Authority certain people who have proved themselves in education and they could then bring the membership up to 18 members.  This is reasonable and fair enough and I will not dwell any longer on that subject.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the <i>ad hoc</i> educational authority I should&mdash;like other Members of the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;like to pay a compliment to Dr. Ó Raifeartaigh on the work he has done for education here throughout the years. He is well deserving of our gratitude. I should like the Minister to convey&mdash; I am quite sure the Seanad is with me on this&mdash;our appreciation to him of the work he has done for education.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to a subject which was, in fact, a very hot subject formerly, but it is not such a hot subject <Col N="826" /> at the moment.  I refer to the merger between Trinity College, Dublin and University College, Dublin.  I am on the governing body of UCD.  If somebody asked me what stage the proposal for the merger has reached now I would find it very difficult, indeed, to give a correct and complete answer.  I admit that very frankly.  I do not really know what stage it is at. Some people say it is going very well and the <i>ad hoc</i> committee did a great job of work but I feel it is at a standstill. There is a stand-off at the present moment on the question and it remains there.</P>
    <P>In this regard we should come to some definite conclusion.  Things just cannot go on the way they are at present and the question cannot be left in mid-air.  If it is the intention of the present Minister, Deputy Faulkner, to proceed along the lines of, or to vary, the late Deputy O'Malley's suggestions, I think this intention should be communicated in proper detail.  The Minister should get after the two universities, if this is his intention, or he should tell them to scrap the idea, or he should tell them there might be another method of co-ordinating certain facilities.  At the present moment, it would be very difficult for anybody, even a person reasonably well acquainted with the negotiations that went on over the past few years, to state what is the position of the negotiations. As we are dealing with higher education a statement from the Minister in this regard would be very valuable indeed.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer the Minister to a matter that is conflicting in many ways.  Section 14 (1) of the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
    <P>Might I refer the Minister to his winding-up speech in the Dáil which can be found in the Official Report, Volume 251, columns 1132, 1133, in which he states:</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that the approval of the Minister is required especially in relation to staff <Col N="827" /> appointments made by the Higher Education Authority.  I want to clarify the position.  The situation is that the approval of a Minister arises only in relation to the creation of the post.  After that the Authority can appoint whomsoever it wishes.</P>
    <P>That is quite clear.  I shall now read again section 14 (1) of the Bill:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
    <P>Now, these two statements&mdash;section 14 (1) of the Bill and the Minister's statement&mdash;are in direct conflict.  I think this should be explained.  At present they are in complete conflict. It may be that the Minister meant something else instead of &ldquo;such&rdquo;, for the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; connotes, at least to me, particular persons.  Maybe the Minister intended it to mean a grade of persons, or he may want to suggest the qualifications of the persons to be the officers and servants of An tÚdarás.  I am not sure what his intentions were in this regard.  The word &ldquo;such&rdquo; in that section is not a happy word.  Again, I reiterate that the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; in section 14 (1) conflicts with the Minister's statement in his winding-up speech in the Dáil. The Minister, when he is replying, might like to advert to that.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the chairman has been dealt with by other speakers, especially by Senator Kelly.  The Higher Education Authority was not, in fact, meant to be in the same position as a semi-State body where the Minister nominates the chairman.  I understood it to be a different type of body and, therefore, I feel that the 14 members the Minister intends to appoint might first be appointed and from those members they themselves should elect a chairman.  I feel that this is the proper or most democratic way of doing it.</P>
    <P>If I may, I should like to advert, in a general way, to some sections of the Bill.  I am glad to see that Deputy Faulkner, the present Minister, has added a new subsection (3) as one of <Col N="828" /> his proposed amendments in Dáil Éireann and has also made an addition to section 6 (2).</P>
    <P>The Minister also undertook to bring to the notice of the Higher Education Authority that the College of Surgeons should be included as an institution. I believe the Minister did not intend to leave the College of Surgeons out initially, it was just an error.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very fair in accepting these amendments.  I hope he will be as fair in accepting amendments that we propose to put down here in this House.  I have two amendments down already but none of these is controversial in any way.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to section 16 which reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  An tÚdarás may appoint a committee or person to advise it on matters relating to its functions.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person appointed under this section to a committee or to advise may be either a member of An tÚdarás or not a member and An tÚdarás may, subject to the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay him fees and allowances for expenses.</P>
    <P>I am not going to get hot under the collar about whether this stays in or out, but I am a little dubious about the value of all this.  We have a proliferation of commissions and various other things that take up the time of the Civil Service and various other bodies.  I think we are going too far here.  My own view&mdash;and this is a personal view, not a party view&mdash;is that I could do without this section completely.</P>
    <P>Senator John Kelly brought out a very valuable point.  Relating sections 22 and 23 of the Schedule to section 12 (2)&mdash;section 22 of the Schedule states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall appoint one of its officers to be Secretary of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Schedule reads:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may perform such of its functions as it may deem proper through or by any of its officers or <Col N="829" /> servants duly authorised in that behalf.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The payment of any amount or any part thereof to the institution for which it was provided shall be made in such manner and subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit.</P>
    <P>The net result of section 12 (2) and the last two sections of the Schedule means that one man, the secretary for instance, can distribute the funds given to An tÚdarás.  This, to me, is not right but this is what the Schedule and section 12 (2) amounts to.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Minister wants this Bill through before the Recess and he probably will get it through before the Recess because there is agreement on the general principles of the Bill on every side of the House.  I have pointed out some defects that I might like to remedy, but the general principle of the Bill is correct.  May I ask the Minister when he intends to set up this Higher Education Authority if the Bill becomes an Act before the Recess? When would it commence to function? That is all I wish to say at the moment.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom, ar an gcéad dul síos, fáilte a chur roimh Bhille an Údaráis um Ard-Oideachas.  Sílim gur Bille é atá riachtanach chun ord agus eagar a chur ar phleanáil in ard-oideachas ionnas go bhfaigheadh muintir na hÉireann luach a gcuid airgid sa chéad áit agus go mbainfeadh gach saoránach a bhfuil fonn air dul ar aghaidh i gcúrsaí oideachais an tairbhe is mó is féidir as oideachas.</P>

Tá prionsabal daonlathach i gceist anseo&mdash;an prionsabal go mba chóir cothram na Féinne a thúirt do gach saoránach, go háirithe dóibh siúd atá ag íoc cánach chun díol as cúrsaí oideachais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an gcoimisiún.  Chaitheadar cuid mhaith dá gcuid ama i <Col N="830" /> rith na blianta ag cíoradh na ceiste agus as a gcuid moltaí d'eascair An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla mion-phointí a phlé chomh maith le cúrsaí geinearálta a bhaineann le hoideachas. Mholfainn don Údarás áird a thúirt ar chupla meamram a bhaineann leis an réim ina bhfuil a gcuid gnótha.  Ceann amháin acu san is sea meamram d'fhoilsigh Comhairle na Gaeilge le déanaí.</P>
    <P>Gan trácht ar an bPáipéar Bán, tá an oiread sin scríofa, an oiread sin meamram foilsithe, ar chúrsaí na teanga go bhfuil an baol ann i gcónaí nach dtabharfar mórán áird ar aon rud nua a fhoilsítear.  Ach sílim gur fiú áird a thúirt ar an meamram seo mar gur doiciméad sáthach ciallmhar é. Ní amháin gur scríbhinn dhátheangach í, rud atá suimiúil ann féin, ach chomh maith leis sin tá cuid de na moltaí réasúnta.  Cuir i gcás an méid so ar leathanach 6, alt d (2):</P>
    <P>Molaimid go gcloifí feasta leis an nós a bhíodh ann nach gceapfaí ar fhoireann teagaisc ná ar fhoireann riaracháin na gcoláistí oiliúna ach daoine le dhéanamh an gnó sa Ghaeilge acu.  Sa chás go bhfuil daoine gan dhéanamh an gnó sa Ghaeilge acu ar fhoireann choláiste i láthair na huaire, molaimid go dtabharfaí deis réasúnta dóibh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Sa cás nach bhfuil iarrthóir le fáil a bhfuil caighdeán oiriúnach Gaeilge aige, molaimíd go n-ofráilfí an post dó ar bhonn sealadach ar an gcoinníoll go bhfoghlamódh sé Gaeilge laistigh de thréimhse réasúnta.</P>
    <P>Luaitear an pointe sin agus is pointe tábhachtach é i gcúrsaí Gaeilge nó i gcúrsaí teangachais glacadh leis an bprionsabal nach ndéanfaí leatrom ar dhuine toisc nach bhfuil a dhóithin taithí aige ar Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tuairim amháin ar chúrsaí Gaeilge a nochtadh.  Tar éis dom roint mhaith bliain a chaitheamh ag scrúdú na cúrsaí seo agus ag déanamh taighde ar na fadhbanna atá i gcúrsaí teangachais in Éirinn, táim sásta nach bhfuil mórán seans againn an Ghaeilge a shábháil mura dtugtar go hiomlán faoin teanga a chur <Col N="831" /> in úsáid go simplí mar gnáth-mheán cumarsáide ar an leibhéal céanna leis an mBéarla.  Creidim gur ceart an Ghaeilge mar ábhar scoile nó ábhar léinn agus an Ghaeilge mar theanga labhartha a dheighilt óna chéile.  Má tá éigeantacht le bheith ann is ar labhairt na Gaeilge mar gnáth-ghléas cumarsáide is cóir í chur i bhfeidhm agus ba cheart dúinn deireadh a chur le h-éigeantacht sna páipéir litríochta ar feadh tamaill fada ar aon nós.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil tairbhe ar bith ag baint le coinníoll éigeantachta i bpáipéir litríochta a bhrú ar dhuine ar bith cun go bhfaghadh sé post ar bith ach amháin mara bhfuil gá sa phost sin le caighdeán litríochta. Cruthaíodh domsa nach musclaíonn an sórt teiste sin grá don tír nó don teanga i bhfurmhór díobh sin go gcuirtear an coinníoll orthu.  Ní ceart go n-iarrfaí ar dhuine ar bith bheith in ann níos mó a dhéanamh sa chás ach a bheith in ann a chuid gnó a dhéanamh i gceachtar teanga, Béarla nó Gaeilge, faoi mar is gá.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud é foilsiúcháin Ghaeilge a bheith ar fáil agus is maith le cuid mhaith daoine iad.  Ach, mar sin féin, is beatha teanga í a labhairt. Ar shlí, is amhlaidh atá an cairt á chur roimh an gcapall againn.  Táim i bhfábhar an Ghaeilge mar ghléas labhartha amháin.  Ba chóir dóchas a bheith againn tabhairt faoin athrú seo go h-iomlán agus iontaoibh a bheith againn as ár muintir féin.  Ní féidir snámh mara léimtear san uisce.  Ní féidir aon dul ar aghaidh a dhéanamh in aon slí muna bhfuiltear sásta seans a thógaint.  Faoi mar adúirt mé, níl ach an t-aon polasaí ciallmhar amháin i stáit daonlathach&mdash;polasaí an dátheangachais&mdash;agus is cóir dúinn túirt faoi.  Sé sin, dhátheangachas diaidh ar ndiaidh i gcás na Gaeilge agus moladh in áit ceartúcháin a thúirt dóibh siúd a dheineann iarracht ar an méid Gaeilge atá acu d'úsáid.</P>
    <P>This is a very necessary and welcome Bill.  As has been said it is necessary to provide proper, planned development in higher education so as to avoid overlapping and to provide as adequate a level of continuation education as our resources will permit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> Education has to do with the needs of the individual, but in case those who regard themselves as academics might stray from a sense of realities it is necessary for An tÚdarás to keep in mind that, as the individual has to be able to sustain himself, so must the community by its own efforts, in the creation of wealth, be in a position to sustain as high a level of education as is possible.</P>
    <P>As one of our Senators said here yesterday, we are living in a world subject to what he described as market pressures.  I believe it will be necessary for An tÚdarás to have regard for job opportunity here as well as abroad and to engage in the necessary research to ascertain what our requirements are if we are to sustain life on this island. Whatever may be the criticism of those who talk about realists, I think we have got to realise that service to the community and to the needs of a developing Ireland is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  We are a country which is having to progress through her own efforts in a world that does not feel it owes us anything. For this reason, one of the studies I would recommend to An tÚdarás is the interim report entitled <i>National Adult Education Survey</i>.  I have the feeling that there are some people, involved not only in education but in other areas of life, who feel that the community owes them something, whether it be education or a comfortable job with a comfortable salary and that they owe nothing to the community in return.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said too often that we have got to make a success of this country because nobody will do it for us.  It is to that area I would urge An tÚdarás to direct their attention.  I am not suggesting that we should become a dictatorship and introduce a system of forced labour direction of those who receive the great gift of higher education, but it is necessary to point out that in countries like Russia one of the conditions is that a graduate will have to repay the State by undertaking to serve two or three years in what one might describe as the less pleasant areas of that country.  This is compelling people to repay their obligation to society.  This is what is done <Col N="833" /> in dictatorships.  In democracies one expects people voluntarily to repay their own obligations in life to their community.  We should be able to acquire some of the realistic philosophy of life or obligation to life which is so evident in the past 20 years in countries such as Japan, particularly in their attitude to education.</P>
    <P>Earlier in this debate one Senator expressed anxiety that too much emphasis might be placed on technology. I do not think we need worry, judging by the traditional social attitude to education I have observed in Ireland. I do not think the time for anxiety in that respect has yet come.  I would draw the attention of An tÚdarás to the ratio of academics to technologists elsewhere. In Britain the ratio of technologists to academics is 2.4 technologists to one academic.  In Europe there are .31 technologists to one academic.  It is hardly necessary to refer to our own statistic which is entirely reversed.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary to say that, whether we become a member of the European Community or not, we shall be obliged to sustain ourselves on this island in competition with other countries.  I would also direct the attention of An tÚdarás to the natural genius of our people.  It is one of the responsibilities of an authority such as this to encourage that natural genius of our people towards making a success not only of themselves but also of life in their own country.  Yesterday afternoon comment was made on section 4 of the Bill which reads:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions, An tÚdarás shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>I do not know of a better way of putting the question of our national philosophy. This is how it has been described in the 1960 Broadcasting Act already mentioned.  It is not an adequate description, but it is not easy to find a better one.  If I were asked to alter it I would simply put the word &ldquo;identity&rdquo; in place of the word &ldquo;Irish language&rdquo; because identity is the one thing we have in common throughout <Col N="834" /> Ireland, whatever other differences there may be and if we strengthen our identity our language will survive.  I have no doubt that identity is what we shall want to preserve because it must be of crucial value to us.  In connection with the ideal that motivates section 4, from my experience it is impossible to put down on paper what is meant by a true sense of values in the national sphere.  Nor do I see how we can assess this virtue in a person who seeks an appointment, at least until after one has seen how he performs. Whether it is in the universities or the training colleges or elsewhere, it is frequently the quality of the individuals that make up the personnel of such institutions that makes them worth supporting.</P>
    <P>Those who succeed to higher positions in life, whether it be in education or otherwise, must give a leadership and example that will raise the level of values, that will give an appreciation of the quality of life, and that will inspire a community to rise above its own selfish norms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been the subject of a very full and critical debate both in the other House and so far in this House.  I am sure it has been a useful debate in so far as it has resulted in the acceptance by the Minister of some very desirable amendments to the original Bill.</P>
      <P>One aspect of this debate which is noteworthy is that in the Dáil Chamber&mdash;it is a different matter here where more people are directly involved in education&mdash;the debate was left almost exclusively to six Deputies. All of these were people directly engaged in education.  This would be understandable on a technical matter but on something so fundamental and so all-embracing as education, it is surprising.  It pinpoints, for myself anyway, the isolation in which this particular level of education has stood from the aspirations of the majority of the Irish people as represented in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applied, too, to the other two levels of education up to four, five or six years ago.  Only a few people participated in the debates.  With regard to this level, it is a subject of <Col N="835" /> general interest at the moment.  Until very recently university education has been the particular preserve of the financially privileged.  As we try to rid ourselves of some of those older systems, one wonders how such an unfair system could have survived for so long.  If one's parents could afford the fees and maintenance of the student during his university years, the less privileged members of society paid the balance, which was often two or three times what the parents paid initially towards his fees.  The balance provided university education for a more privileged society to which their own children could never ultimately aspire. We are making some effort to get rid of this.  We have come a long way and any progress we could make is very welcome.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is a bit too soon to see the progress that has been made reflected in real public interest.  One of the general functions of this authority will be the promotion of an appreciation of the value of higher education and research.  That suggests an appreciation among the community at large. The success of that aim will depend very largely on the extent to which another function will succeed, that is, the promotion of the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education. That amendment was tabled by two Labour Deputies in the other House and was very wisely accepted by the Minister.  When the last aim becomes a reality and there is general involvement in education, we should have a fuller debate on this level of education in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There will always be some limit to the number of people who will partake of this type of education, but the limit should not be contingent on financial standards.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party welcome this Bill.  The Labour Party have recognised for a long time the need for such an independent co-ordinating authority as An tÚdarás Um Árd Oideachas will be.  It is written into a policy document and it arose from our understanding and that of many other people concerned with education and with the social system in regard to higher education.  Higher education has developed <Col N="836" /> into a complex system consisting of universities, research and teaching institutes and various colleges, and has been built up in a haphazard manner, with a total lack of planning. Because of that, the present generation find themselves in this dilemma today.  We had evidence of each institution operating in its own exclusive compartment and each fighting desperately for the State resources that are at the command of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Education for 1960-67 report finding ample evidence not alone of the lack of understanding among the various institutions as to each other's needs, but a certain amount of antagonism towards each other.  This is no criticism of the institutions but one of the system which has been built up without any recourse to planning.  As a result of the strides we have made in providing the quality of opportunity at second level, growing numbers are competing for university entrance.  That is a very welcome development.  However, the present problem is that this system has developed without any reference to career guidance.  There are now emerging from the second level system large numbers of people who will qualify for a very limited number of faculties.</P>
    <P>Yesterday reference was made in this House to a redundancy of BAs in the foreseeable future.  That is a real fear; not alone has our secondary school system been completely university-orientated down through the years, but there has also been an emphasis on the more academic subjects.  I know that a great number of boys and girls, by virtue of their past achievements, will qualify for university entrance.  We are gravely concerned about the limited number of faculties for which they will qualify.  They have dropped scientific subjects at some stage of their second level education and now find themselves with only two faculties for which to qualify: perhaps law and arts. People who would find themselves divorced from the legal professions generally and whose parents and whose background would prohibit them from pursuing law as a career tend to rush into arts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Some allusions have been made to accommodation for arts students in Dublin: I know that the situation in Cork is critical, due to overcrowding. The picture now is increasing numbers, gross overcrowding, inadequate accommodation, insufficient staffs and, to crown it all, so many square pegs in round holes.  This presents quite a problem and the Authority will have a formidable task when they start to grapple with the situation.</P>
    <P>For the last four or five years there has been some uncertainty with regard to the structure of education.  We have had the case for the merger, the case for five independent universities, and the case for many additional institutions, and so on.  Now we have probably reached a situation where positions have been taken up and opinions have been formed.  I am making this point to pinpoint what, in my opinion, is the big task that will face the Authority when set up.  Because it is such a big task it must have a certain strength and a certain amount of goodwill.</P>
    <P>The subject of strength and authorrity has been debated pretty exhaustively in the other House and it will probably be the subject of many amendments.  To a certain extent, the Minister has cleared the matter up in his opening speech in the Seanad. With regard to section 12, subsections (1) and (2), which are crucial points, the Minister could, with a certain amount of usefulness, look upon the suggested amendments of the Federation of University Teachers.  This is not an aspect of the debate which one would want to develop to any great extent at this stage.  However, this may meet the point that you would have, on the one hand, more strength on the part of An tÚdarás to perform their own functions, and, on the other hand, with regard to section 12, subsection (2) perhaps less fear of interference at the day-to-day level in the functioning of the individual institutions of education.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister knows very well the need for goodwill in this field and for understanding the functions and problems of the Authority. This Minister and every other Minister for Education over the last few years <Col N="838" /> have had experience of resistance.  Resistance can be very time-consuming and wasteful.  If a little more attention was paid to the viewpoints of the people and institutions concerned resistance to the establishment of the Authority could be avoided.  Everybody wants autonomy and independence. I am very mindful that the Minister, in the final analysis, is the person who, on behalf of the community, must foot the bill, and on his desk the ultimate responsibility must lie.  He is the man who, on behalf of the taxpayers who foot the bill, must make the final decisions.  If we can achieve a balance between this and the autonomy needed by the other institutions and the Authority to fulfil their roles properly we will have achieved something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Comment has been made by several Senators on the question of the appointment of a chairman, on the question of removing the chairman and ordinary members of An tÚdarás.  I concur with those who believe that the chairman should be appointed by the members of the Authority which must be seen as an independent body.  While I know that the Minister has the right to appoint the Authority, the impression can be given that because he appoints the members they are only an extension of the Department.  If the Minister would allow the members, when appointed, to appoint their own chairman and if there would be some safeguard regarding the dismissal of members it would be very useful in creating the atmosphere which is needed with regard to this Authority. The idea of the Minister first appointing a chairman and then going into conclave with that chairman to appoint the members can give the wrong impression. The members should be appointed first and then the chairman appointed by the members.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Brugha and several other Senators to section 4 of the Bill which deals with the Irish language.  I would be the first to support the need for a section like that in the Bill.  If we are committed to the revival of the language, as I am sure all of us are, the revival movement must have status and to have status it must be seen to be the concern <Col N="839" /> of the universities.  Rightly or wrongly, the impression has been created among the general public that Irish is something that is pursued with great vigour at first level and then as one progresses through the educational system it becomes less important. This may not be so, but it must be seen to be the function of the universities.  I know that there are problems surrounding the drafting of a section such as this.  The word &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo; I hope does not suggest defeatism.  The Minister is committed to the revival of the language and if there were any way in which he could strengthen it he should do so. If he could, he would have my support for it.</P>
    <P>Another point which relates to section 14 (5) concerns officers and servants. Once again we have the old term &ldquo;servant&rdquo; to which we in these benches have always objected: &ldquo;officer or servant in the employment of An tÚdarás.&rdquo;  Paragraph (c) reads:</P>
    <P>he shall not be entitled to reckon the whole or any part of that period...</P>
    <P>in which he is a member of either of these Houses:</P>
    <P>...for any benefit payable under any scheme under section 15 of this Act.</P>
    <P>We have had this paragraph appearing in legislation on other matters during the last year or two.  The various Ministers have agreed to delete that provision and it should also be deleted in this case.  Entitlement should be allowed under the Acts for such time as an officer or servant is a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>We all feel strongly on the question of student involvement.  There is a great deal of emphasis on the involvement of everybody engaged in the system. There is a great deal of lip service paid to the idea of education being more student-centred than it used to be.  There is also a great deal of general comment about generation gaps and the failure of the student to understand the management point of view.  All of these matters could be ironed out to some extent by the appointment of <Col N="840" /> some students to this body.  We might bridge the generation gap and have a better understanding between the various people involved in the system.</P>
    <P>One other important point is that emphasis should be laid on adult education.  This has also been mentioned by other Senators.  There is provision under the Bill, as it stands, for the Authority to concern themselves with this aspect of education.  Half of the people over 20 years of age left school at the age of 14 and the majority of the other half left school ill-fitted to fulfil themselves and to play a useful role in society.  There is a great interest in higher education for the furthering of careers and for the pursuit of knowledge.  We owe it to the people who have been deprived of a proper education to help them to get it now.  There is a great need for a people's university or university of the air or some sort of system that would meet the desires and wishes of these people.</P>
    <P>There are several small points that one would wish to refer to, but I know that there are other speakers anxious to contribute to this debate, people who have very useful contributions to make.  Because of that I shall not detain the House any further.</P>
    <P>I am concluding by hoping that the Authority will fulfil the function for which they are being created.  I hope that the charge will never be levelled at this body, as it has been levelled at so many bodies and commissions in the past, that it is being used as a dumping ground for embarrassing or unwelcome proposals or ideas.  I sincerely hope the HEA will prove to be a positive, dynamic force in the field of Irish education.  With some thought and consideration for the points of view of all concerned and bearing in mind the need to build up goodwill and give the Authority the necessary strength to do the job it is being established to do, it should have the effect that everybody concerned desires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the setting up of the new Authority.  I think it is a very timely gesture.  Very many views and much criticism of the proposed new <Col N="841" /> Authority have been heard, but that is to be expected.  Members of the Oireachtas can only express their doubts and fears, wishes and hopes, and endeavour to represent every shade of opinion fairly.  For that reason alone the introduction of this Bill is timely. The Minister is getting the maximum response from the public and thereby will have a fair idea of the present-day needs of higher education.</P>
      <P>One of the fears expressed about the setting up of the new Authority is that they will be completely dominated and influenced as a result of the chairman being appointed by the Minister.  Any Minister undertaking a responsible job has got to appoint the chairman so as to establish that the appointment was not made as a result of pressure from any particular section of the community. This is one situation in which a Department, a Minister or the Government could be pressurised by, say, a professor in education&mdash;I say that with no malice&mdash;or by people who have a deep-rooted vested interest.  It is for that reason alone that I have stood up here to make my contribution.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister will give us, with this new Authority, the safeguards which are needed to cover all sections of the community.  I express the hope that strong provisions will be made for the bread-and-butter subjects.  We ought not to lose sight of technical training and technical education because we have a tendency nowadays to educate people to a point where they can no longer stand on their own two feet.  For every man who wishes to work today there is another ready to sit on his shoulders and allow him to pay for his education, hospitalisation and social welfare.  I sincerely hope the Minister, so far as he possibly can, will ensure that this is a body representative of all sections of the community.  He should ensure that the choice of members of the Authority is not based on or controlled from a few universities and that there will be a balanced influence on it.  It should be neither controlled, directed nor influenced by our cities alone but should take into account all sections of the population.  This is of vital importance at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reached a stage in this country where we are no longer willing <Col N="842" /> to pay for the education of professional people to the point where they impose a burden on some sections of the population.  Every man is entitled to a basic education but if you want to become a specialist in any field you have got to contribute to that education. Education is not appreciated unless there is an effort and sacrifice on the part of those who intend to join the professions.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the views expressed by Senator Belton.  One of his worries was that one man would have the responsibility for the payment of all accounts.  He expressed the fear that the Authority would have too many subcommittees and would become so dispersed that they would no longer have any real authority. That is the expression of two extremes. The new Authority will have to have a balanced approach and I hope provision will be made for technical training.  At present there is a serious shortage of engineers, doctors and dentists but more acute is the shortage of people who are the backbone of the development of our industries. There is a desperate shortage of agricultural officers and technicians of every kind.  We have almost reached the stage, in the building industry, where people have to train themselves. They take on a job as a labourer on a building site and find themselves doing plumbing and building without having any, or sufficient, technical training.  This is a provision that should be included.  The need for it and the importance of it should be solidly established and kept very prominently before members of the new authority.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister, when this board are set up, will make sure that they are widely representative of all sections of the community who are interested in the future training of our people in the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, I should like to welcome this Bill and to say in advance I would like to divide what comment I have to make between the Bill and the first report of the <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority which we are also considering with it. This gives us a fairly broad background <Col N="843" /> against which to discuss the situation.  Perhaps there are two factors that have to be taken into consideration at the very beginning when we are discussing a subject of this importance.</P>
      <P>The first factor relates to universities themselves.  It is perhaps not said often enough about the universities that they have, since their institution, been doing a great deal of very good work. It is not often realised, for example, that our universities have managed, over the past 50 years, or longer in other cases, to maintain standards of education and comparability of degree on very much more limited resources than have been available to universities in directly competing spheres.  I am referring, in particular, to universities in Britain.</P>
      <P>It is an actuarial fact, as far as I am aware, that our universities have been existing and educating the people on sums of money which mean that they have only about one-third as much to spend per student as the universities in Britain have had.  Their success in maintaining standards and the acceptability of Irish degrees abroad has not been without its pitfalls; there certainly have been grounds for criticism here and there, but in broad terms we have maintained standards. We have maintained this international comparability on a budget that is tiny by international standards.</P>
      <P>I often feel that the Minister and other members of the Government party might evoke a slightly warmer and more co-operative response from the universities.  If they paid tribute more often than they do to this undoubted achievement a lot of the present suspicion between the Department of Education and the universities themselves would not exist.  It springs from a feeling on the part of the universities that the work they have done over the last half century has been ignored and is now to be written off as something which is really unimportant in itself, the first broad comment against which we should examine the whole subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second overall factor which is relevant here is the changing role of <Col N="844" /> the Department of Education.  It was once said of a man in an Irish Government that when he was asked what Cabinet post he would like he said that he rather felt he had done his bit for the country and perhaps he could have Education.  That was some time ago and since the story is probably apocryphal I will not link it with any name or any political party.  The fact that it is the kind of story which can be heard abroad shows the kind of low esteem the Department of Education were held in some years ago.</P>
    <P>I have had my own personal experience of that.  About seven or eight years ago, when I first started to write about education for a national newspaper, the astonishment outside my immediate sphere of employment was only equalled by the hilarity inside that there would be enough in education for anybody to write about.  That was in 1964 or 1965.  Events over the last decade have shown that the role of education in our society is appreciated more than it ever has been before.  It follows naturally from this that a much greater strain is being put on the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In the past the Department of Education's activities were perhaps largely regulatory.  They were to do with the establishing of various standards, with the maintenance of a large and far flung inspectorate system and with the payments of grants to schools and other educational institutions once they were satisfied that the various conditions had been complied with.</P>
    <P>It is fairly true to say that at least up to the date of Deputy Dr. Hillery's accession to that Department, Ministers, broadly speaking, followed suit in this.  Since 1963 at least, however, the role of the Department of Education changed rapidly.  From being a regulatory body it has become, in many important ways, the source of educational policy.  The strain on their human resources, I believe, has been considerable.</P>
    <P>It would be too much to expect the Department, as they were originally conceived, staffed and manned, to undertake the fantastic overhaul of our entire educational system which certainly was called for over many years <Col N="845" /> and which has now begun.  When we are criticising the Department, as many of us occasionally do, we should realise the very real limitations in terms of human resources under which they laboured.  I am not by any means suggesting that this is a reason for criticisng any of the present staff of the Department of Education, far from it; I would go to the opposite extreme and say that some of them must be working above and beyond the call of duty almost continuously.</P>
    <P>We should also point to the need for more and more skilled manpower within the Department as decisions of greater complexity and greater consequence for the country as a whole are being taken.  I will certainly support the Minister for Education in any representations he is likely to make to the Minister for Finance in this field because this is where the real responsibility lies.</P>
    <P>University education in general is an ironically situated subject.  It is one of the subjects which have a large degree of political importance in society.  I often think it strange, and in some respects sad, that the more important, educationally, the topic seems to be the less importance it seems to have politically.  Very often governments are inclined to spend more time and energy on things which are less educationally important because they are more politically advantageous.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House have been to universities.  I have been to one myself.  Many people who have been to universities are often in a state of blissful ignorance about the esteem, or lack of esteem, in whch universities are held outside this charmed circle.  The phrase &ldquo;university intellectual&rdquo; is, generally speaking, not a complimentary one and I look forward to hearing other Members of the House, notably Senator Ó Maoláin, on this in due course.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise how responsible the universities themselves have been for giving this phrase such a majorative ring.  When we look at the present concept of the university and compare it to what the university was when it was originally set up, we have reason to be startled.  The university was originally a professional <Col N="846" /> school.  It was a school for teaching people how to do things that were useful in society.  In the middle ages it was a professional school which taught the priests, the lawyers, the doctors and others.  Yet something peculiar happened in this country, in Britain and, indeed, elsewhere during the 19th century which somehow separated the idea of knowledge itself from the uses to which knowledge could be put.</P>
    <P>This development has made universities over the past century or so places which are in many respects very much too removed from reality, and has had the consequent effect that the universities have tended to produce people who are in many respects removed from reality.  More recent research and trends have shown that university graduates are not only people who tend to be a little removed from reality&mdash;that in itself is not a great crime&mdash;but they are also people who are removed even from the possibility of getting a job. I do not know how further removed from reality one could be than that.</P>
    <P>The appointments officer of University College, Dublin, Dr. Derek Schofield, said in a recent article that the university graduate now, in arts for instance, unless he is particularly well endowed academically and with personal qualities, may run the risk of finding himself part of new class of unemployed.  When things have come to this stage we can realise that something is wrong with the university system as we have known it for the past 100 years and that it needs to be, if not necessarily taken by the scruff of its neck and shaken, at least gently nudged into a different direction. If it is true, as I suggested, that the phrase &ldquo;university intellectual&rdquo; has a majorative ring, it is equally true to suggest that just as second level education is increasingly recognised as a right for all people in our society it will not be long before third level education acquires something of the same overtones.  This will not happen, naturally enough, without great difficulty and without the expenditure of a great deal of money, but it will happen because we are coming to accept in philosophical terms the right of people to education to the limit of their ability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> It is almost impossible to say with any certainty that this will be carried out within the institutions of third level education as we know them.  It is far more likely that in the end we will give much more than lip service to the concept of permanent education, to the idea that no human being in any civilised and democratic society can be permanently excluded at any age from the educational processes of that society.  Scandinavian countries have recently adopted a system which may well have its teething troubles but which we should well be looking at, a sort of educational data bank.  This ensures that students who are qualified will have educational credits, have an educational bank account from which they can draw at any time during their lives and at any of the institutions which they choose to attend.</P>
    <P>In the future we will have a pattern of third level education which will, I believe, be a great deal more flexible than it is today.  In the meantime, we are faced with the problem of coping with the institutions that we have and doing something with them, not sweeping them out of the way, but certainly making them more responsive to the needs of our society.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the first report of the Higher Education Authority under a number of headings.  The first heading I should like to deal with is that of finance.  When the first report of the authority was published with its figure of £24 million needed for capital expenditure on higher education, considerable comment was occasioned by the Department of Education's announcement that they thought that the figure of £15 million was sufficent and that it would cover capital expenditure for the provision of places not only in the universities but in other third level institutions.  Like Senator Belton I think we are entitled to a little more information from the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it seems to be increasingly accepted nowadays, certainly in view of the news of the past few days and of the past week, that the greatest single headache for the universities at the moment is not so much <Col N="848" /> capital but current expenditure.  There is even reason to doubt that the grants proposed by the Department for the current year for current expenditure in the universities do not even add up to keeping the situation at a standstill.  In other words, it is alleged, and I should like to hear from the Minister on this, that what the Government propose to give the universities in the coming year will not only not enable them to keep things as they are at the moment but will ensure inevitably that things get even worse.</P>
    <P>In order to document this I have been looking at the Book of Estimates and trying to calculate on last year's figures what this year's increases ought to be in order to keep current expenditure at least in line with current prices and with inflation.  I have taken two very conservative figures.  I have taken the figure of 8 per cent for inflation generally and the figure of 12 per cent for salary increases.  We all know that salary increases last year, and I believe in the university sector as well, amounted in many cases to 17 per cent. I have chosen 12 per cent simply because it adds up to a more manageable figure of 20 per cent when it is taken with the inflation figure but also because, of course, university current expenditure is not entirely, although it is very largely, accounted for by staff salaries.  If we take these figures and look at the Votes that are proposed we get quite a shock.  If we agree with my contention that in order to at least keep pace with inflation and increased salaries, university current expenditure should have been increased by something of the order of 20 per cent over last year, we get startling figures in relation to the different colleges.</P>
    <P>On the basis of my figures the general grant for University College, Dublin should have been increased by £444,400 and on page 87 of the Book of Estimates we get the actual figure which is £355,000.  Again, on the basis of my figures, Cork should have got an extra £209,600.  They got £144,000.  In respect of the Cork figure one must point out an almost equally horrific fact which is that the increase in the general grant proposed for Cork this year is actually less than the increase <Col N="849" /> they got last year. This is a worsening of conditions that not trade unionist would accept.  For the other institutions, the figures are the same according to my calculations.  On the basis of a 20 per cent increase in current costs Galway should be getting £171,800.  In fact they are getting only £132,000. Trinity should be getting £298,800, they are only getting £224,000.  Maynooth should be getting £18,000, they are getting £5,000.  I and many university people would like to have the Minister's comments on these figures and find out how he has arrived at these general grant figures and if there are any special circumstances which, in the Minister's view, account for such a very small increase, given the enormous increases in current expenditure that the universities are facing at present. The second main heading I should like to discuss in connection with the report of the Authority is that of the structure of higher education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second main aspect of the Higher Education Authority's first report which I want to discuss is that related to the structure of higher education in Ireland, generally.  Here we are faced with two needs which are complementary and which, to a certain extent, are opposing needs.  The first need is to provide for the creation in higher education generally of a number of different kinds of institution to fulfil basically quite different educational needs.  The second need is that we have, at the same time, to ensure against the creation of a sort of educational apartheid of the kind that exists at the moment in which the differences between different institutions in the field of further education are rigid, the barriers are uncrossable and in which there are very real social stigmas attached to what are considered to be the less favoured institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need different kinds of institututions in higher education.  The experience of the colleges of advanced technology in Britain has shown us how great the temptation is for non-university <Col N="850" /> institutions to attempt to achieve university status.  In so doing they betray the very purposes for which they were instituted.  For example, in Britain the CATS, as they are known, were originally instituted to make higher education available to a far greater spectrum of the population than would have access to a University in the normal way.  However, because of the peculiar structure of higher education in Britain, and because of the ambitions on behalf of those colleges, and of the superior social status that is attached to the universities, the CATS found themselves shedding, one after another, the socially most desirable aspects which they had when they were first set up, the aspects designed to help people through part-time, adult and worker education.</P>
    <P>It will be a long term job meeting this difficulty.  It will not be possible to persuade the Irish electorate overnight that another kind of third level institution can be just as valuable as a university.  I should like to think that eventually the people will come to believe that a university, though valuable in itself, is not necessarily the pinnacle of perfection where further education is concerned and that different types of institutions are totally necessary for people with different kinds of attitudes and inclinations.</P>
    <P>If we are going to set up a diversified higher education system, how are we to avoid the pitfalls of creating this apartheid situation?  There are three main ways in which the apartheid situation can best be avoided. The first is that there should be as much unity as possible among the various institutions of higher education. When the Higher Education Authority are constituted I should like to see them providing the basis of that unity.  There is the problem about the conference of Irish universities.  In the first report of the Higher Education Authority, the members noted that they had supplied the Department of Education with the heads of Bills to establish not only the authority, but also the conference of Irish universities. The Bill before us now makes no reference to the conference of Irish <Col N="851" /> universities and I should be glad to hear the Minister's comments on the reason for this omission.  On reflection, I am not at all convinced that this is not bad.  The creation of a conference of Irish universities at this stage might be a divisive factor in higher education and might contribute very powerfully to the kind of apartheid against which we are struggling at the moment and against which Britain is still struggling.</P>
    <P>Within this unified framework of higher education it is important that there should be as much similarity as possible at certain levels between the different kinds of institutions.  For example, the methods of financing these different institutions should, as far as is humanly possible, be brought into line with each other.  In Britain part of the trouble they are having with the binary educational system is that the methods of financing the technological colleges and the polytechnics differ so radically from the method of financing the universities, and a schism is created almost from the beginning.</P>
    <P>We have, in the Higher Education Authority Bill, the germ of an alternative to this kind of situation and the germ of an answer to the kind of problem that it presents.  There should be the greatest possible similarity between the method of financing these different institutions within the sphere of education generally.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there should be the greatest possible interdependence between the various institutions.  By this I mean that a student who finds himself at the proposed Limerick college should not be precluded from eventual or ultimate transfer to another institution of higher education.  Likewise, I think this could be a two-way process. I do not see any reason why people who have established credits in the universities should not be permitted to change to other third level institutions if they find that it suits them.</P>
    <P>The third way in which we could guard against the possibility of this apartheid situation developing is that there should be large representations between the institutions.  At the moment, in Britain, representation <Col N="852" /> tends to be only one way.  Universities tend to have representation on the boards of the lesser institutions.  There is no converse representation by the institutions on the boards and governing bodies of universities.  This principle of representation would go a great way towards establishing, in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of educationalists, the general impression of equivalence of purpose which has to exist between all third level education institutions no matter what they may teach or to whom.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to draw particular attention to the question of Limerick.  The First Report of the Higher Education Authority has made specific proposals for it.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said that what he was giving the people of Limerick might be even better than a university.  I do not know if he believed that himself at the time. I doubt very much if the people of Limerick believed it then or even now. I would make a very strong case for the accuracy of what the Minister said on that occasion.  We are so caught up on the old fashioned 19th century idea of the university and its value in this country that we cannot see the possibilities inherent in the kind of institution that is proposed for Limerick. If we look at the United States we will see that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is to the United States what we hope the Limerick institution will be to Ireland.  This institution is one of the greatest single prestige educational institutions in the United States.  I see no reason why the Limerick institution could not be in exactly a similar position in this country.  I am perturbed at the slowness with which progress on the Limerick project has gone ahead.  I am perturbed not only because it is denying a particular kind of education not only to the people of Limerick but to all the people of Ireland who might be in a position to benefit from it, but also because delay in this area will reinforce the still very prevalent public opinion that university education is something better than what is proposed for Limerick.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced of the value of <Col N="853" /> the Limerick institution as proposed, perhaps with some detailed amendments. In order for this institution to achieve their full value socially as well as educationally we must avoid this apartheid situation in higher education. For that reason I think it behoves the Minister to appoint a very strong Higher Education Authority and to make it clear that there will be no nonsense in higher education about the relative importance of different kinds of institutions.  All institutions are educating the children of this country at third level&mdash;they have an equivalence of purpose.  This cannot be denied to them by any form of out of date snobbery.</P>
    <P>The third point is to do with access to higher education.  I was disappointed in this aspect of the Authority's report for the reason that it seemed to pay little or no attention to it.  This seems to imply that the problem of access to higher education was not one which greatly exercised the minds of the members of the Authority and they were not really very worried about it.  We can be sure that a great number of people in Ireland are worried about the question of access to higher education, not just to the universities, but to all institutions of higher education at third level.  They are very anxious to ensure that the situation can be improved in some way.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown us that money is not the only problem here. Motivation is very important as well. I have often wondered if the Minister would consider extending the grant system in two ways.  Would he consider extending it to include students with reputable qualifications who will be going to other third level institutions? Secondly, would he consider the possibility of financial grants to the parents of pupils who, because they need their children's financial support, cannot afford to send their otherwise qualified children to any institution of further education.</P>
    <P>This sort of scheme is, I imagine, a civil servant's nightmare.  It is the sort of scheme that is difficult to administer. Let us consider the case of a widow with five children whose eldest son has just reached the age of 18 and <Col N="854" /> has four, five or six honours in his Leaving Certificate, who is anxious to go to either a university, a teacher training college or to the Limerick institution. This woman has no choice but to keep her son away from further education and send him to work in order to support the family.  The possibility of a system which would allot money grants or support grants to people in this position might be examined.  The practical difficulties might be insuperable but I should like to hear that at least they would be considered.  A comparatively small amount of money might go a long distance in this area.</P>
    <P>On the question of access to higher education reference has already been made, by Senator Cranitch, to the question of the open university.  So far I agree with the Department of Education's policy on the open university idea which is, if I understand it correctly, that an open university is a relatively low priority in terms of where we spend our educational resources.  A university of the air as it was first called in Britain sounds like a great idea and the perfect answer to the problem of providing higher education to the masses, yet the experience, in other countries, and specifically in Britain, has shown that the overwhelming majority of people who have applied for places on the open university courses have been people who were already extremely well educated by any standards in the society in which they lived.  The majority of those people have been teachers and the open university in Britain at present is facing a very serious dilemma.  It was set up to provide education for the masses and now finds itself being forced into the position in which its main role seems to be to supply degrees to teachers.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that most of the pressure for the open university in this country has come from teachers and specifically from national teachers. We should listen to them but I agree with the Minister that there are other far more important things to be undertaken first.  The experience of the open university in Britain has been, in the <Col N="855" /> words of the cliché, that you can lead the horse to the water but you cannot make him drink or, to put it another way, you can lead horses to water but the only ones who will drink are the ones who are thirsty.  The problem of inducing a thirst in the animals is much greater than the problem of getting them to the sources of education.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to a point which was made by Senator Dr. Belton. He said it was time the Government accepted responsibility for the admissions crisis in Irish universities at present. I agree with him largely on this matter.  The question of how many students you admit to any university or to any particular faculty in a university is ultimately a political problem. The Government will have to accept increasing responsibility for the taking of decisions which may be electorally unpopular in the short term but which can only be educationally valuable. There is, of course, another side to the story.  There has been a tendency, on the part of the universities, to accept anybody who walked through their doors and to then present the Government with the bill.  If the Government are to accept responsibility for policies which limit university entries the university itself, I suggest, has a certain responsibility in this matter as well.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make about the Higher Education Authority's activities to date is in connection with teacher training.  In many respects the educational authorities' approach to the question of teacher training is rather inadequate.  We saw last year, in the teachers' dispute, how important this subject is.  The teachers' dispute should have left us with one great lesson that you cannot create parity where none exists between different teachers.  You cannot say that parity exists and assume, therefore, that it does.  In the salary dispute last year it seemed to me that the Minister was starting at the wrong end by trying to squeeze teachers into a certain mould. He would have made much more sense, if much less spectacularly, by starting at the other end with teacher training. All teachers, up to and including university teachers, are involved in an <Col N="856" /> activity which is similar.  If you reorganise teacher training properly you will find that many of the crises and bitternesses which have marred our educational scene over the past couple of years will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>The universities have an enormous role to play in the training of teachers. It is surprising that at present they play such a small role.  It is surprising that institutions which pride themselves on their educational qualities and on their roles as the preservers of all that is best in education, have so little to do with education and, specifically, with the training of the people who will teach the children of this country.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of what is being done in Coleraine.  At an educational conference in this city yesterday a speaker stood up to complain that we, in this country, have a very clear idea, but a very limited one, of what was happening in Northern Ireland.  He said that in many important areas in Northern Ireland, and particularly in education, we did not know the first thing that was going on whereas we knew everything about developments in England, France, Sweden, America and elsewhere. The Coleraine experiment is one which I would recommend to the Higher Education Authority for study. I am unclear as to the reasons for this attitude.  In many respects what is going on in the North is considerably in advance of anything that is going on in Britain.  Perhaps it is rather like the national school system which was set up here over a century ago.  At that time all Ireland was a colony of Britain and Britain could try out various educational experiments which they were not quite prepared to try out at home.  This is why we got our national school system in advance of the British primary school system.  I suspect the same sort of thing is happening in Northern Ireland which is still, in a sense, a colony of Britain.  It is a place where Britain can try out various educational experiments, and the more the merrier so far as I am concerned because some of them seem to be very worthy of our attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> In Coleraine the whole approach to teacher training is eminently sensible. First of all, there is a four-year course. This nettle is not grasped by the Higher Education Authority here.  The course, in Coleraine, is divided to cater for a wide variety of people.  There are five subject schools in the university, of which education is one.  The degree is a four-year course and there is also a three-year course leading to the certificate of education which entitles people to teach up to O level.  The first two years of this course are shared between candidates who are going for the certificate of education and candidates who are going for the degree. After two years they can change from one course to the other if they wish to and many of them do.  The important thing is that when they get this degree in the school of education at Coleraine it is a BA of the university. It is not a B Ed., it is not a dead end.</P>
    <P>When we talk about teacher training in this country we have to try and escape from creating the situation in which we will train our teachers between the ages of 18 and 22 and assume that they are fit for nothing else but teaching when they graduate.</P>
    <P>The Coleraine experiment specifically avoided that danger and it is something we should examine very closely down here.  I see every reason for linking teacher education much more closely with the universities.  I fail to see why the Higher Education Authority did not grasp the nettle unless it was that they were unwilling to offend existing interests.  Obviously, it would cause great problems.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties would be that universities would suddenly find themselves with a new and massive department which might be the biggest department in the university.  A second danger would be that the universities would attempt to impose their somewhat Procrustean discipline on the schools of education.  I am convinced the overall effect would be to the benefit of the future teachers of this country, as well as to the universities themselves.  The Higher Education Authority have not yet confronted this problem adequately.  I believe that if <Col N="858" /> they fail to confront this problem we are in for continuing trouble and dissension between our teachers.</P>
    <P>There are two very brief general points I should like to make before moving on to the Bill itself.  The first relates to the proposed merger between the two Dublin colleges.  I have always found it very difficult to understand why the Government, on the one hand, insisted that the development and co-ordination of higher education in this country was a national problem and, on the other hand, insisted on treating Dublin as somehow distinct from the national problem&mdash;treating it in a different way.</P>
    <P>In adopting the attitude Deputy Donogh O'Malley, the former Minister for Education, adopted to the existence of the two colleges in Dublin he was motivated at least as much by psychological as by educational and economic reasons.  The history of the proposal since then has shown that a substantial measure of co-operation and goodwill can be achieved between the universities involved.  The responsibility of the Government should be to insert this degree of agreement, or something as closely resembling it as possible, into an overall national problem.  There is not very much to be gained educationally, socially, politically or any other way by attempting to do more than has already been done.</P>
    <P>The second general point concerns student participation.  One of the points on which I found myself most deeply in disagreement with the agreed statement published by NUI and Trinity on the merger proposals was the proposals for the governments of the two colleges concerned.  I would appeal to the Minister, when he is examining the whole question of university government, as he must, to think twice before adopting any of the models that so far have been proposed for our investigation, starting with that proposed by the Commission on Higher Education and the most recent one which found its expansion in this document.</P>
    <P>At this stage there is not much point in going into detail regarding the percentage of students that can, and should, be represented on university governing bodies.  I should like to offer one brief suggestion for consideration. <Col N="859" /> In some parts of Europe, I am specifically thinking of France, they have written student participation into the law of the land with a qualification which is of interest.  This qualification is designed to prevent a small clique of students from gaining control of student representation on any governing body in such a way as to make those students unrepresentative of the body as a whole.</P>
    <P>The laws, as enacted, lay down that the student representatives on the governing bodies of universities and other institutions must be elected in an election in which at least a certain given percentage of the student body votes. I am unhappy about introducing into student elections provisions which we do not introduce into elections higher up along the line about the proportion of the electorate which should vote because it specifically looks like a form of discrimination against students, and in a sense I suppose it is.  At least, it might help to reassure people whose only view of students is that they are a wild and ravening mob, determined on upsetting all established order.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly in his speech on Second Reading expressed some worry about the kind of institutions with which the Higher Education Authority might find themselves dealing. On the one hand, he expressed a concern that the College of Surgeons, as I remember, should be included in the Bill.  On the other hand, he expressed the concern that certain less worthy institutions should be included. I will not repeat what I have already said on the subject except to say that, as far as I am concerned, the more institutions of higher education that can come under the broad wing of the Higher Education Authority the better.</P>
    <P>We are a small country.  We are not a rich country.  The possibility of wasting our resources in a diversified situation like this is immense.  We should be very slow, and the Minister should be very slow, to limit to universities the kind of institution which is envisaged in this Bill.  We would like some specific indications from the Minister of the kind of institutions he has in mind, up to and including the <Col N="860" /> Limerick institution, the proposed Ballymun institution, and other institutions which may be a mixture of second and third level education.</P>
    <P>I have some queries about the order of various sections in the Bill; one of them is related to the position of section 9.  It seems to me that the most important section in the whole Bill is section 9.  It surprises me that this section, which is related to the planning of our entire higher education system, should arrive so far down in the Bill.  I am not altogether sure of the <i>rationale</i> behind the drafting of Bills, but I would presume that there is some hierarchy involved and that each section in the Bill is presumed to devolve in some way, or at least have relation to those that go before and after it.  This is why I am surprised at the relatively lowly position accorded to section 9.</P>
    <P>I am most surprised at section 4 in many ways&mdash;at its nature and its position. I am surprised at its nature because there seems to be implicit in it the understanding that An tÚdarás for some reason or other might not bear in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language.</P>
    <P>To some extent we all pay lip-service to the Irish language but the rather stereotyped language of this section seems to me to be more lip-service than usual.  It also perpetuates a confusion which has dedevilled the Irish language since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>As somebody once said, the Minister for Education has always carried the second and invisible portfolio of Minister for Irish.  For some Ministers this has been a joy and a pleasant responsibility. For others it has been more like a cross.  Because of this we have identified in our national consciousness the restoration of the Irish language so completely with our educational system that we have failed to identify it with anything else.  In other words, we have made a complete identification: Irish equals the educational system.  I think the political, as well as the educational effects, have not always been very desirable.</P>
    <P>Given that we must have a section like this, I am surprised at its position. <Col N="861" /> I am surprised that it comes after Section 3.  I am surprised at the fact that it does not form part of Section 3. I fail to see the importance of a general duty which does not form part of general functions.  I am perturbed at the way in which the whole Irish language question is &ldquo;ghettoised&rdquo;, if you like, in a certain section by itself. I have not quite made up my mind what I should like to see there instead, or what order I should like to see the sections in, but the Minister can be sure that I will try and do something about it when the time comes.</P>
    <P>Section 6 seems to be worthy of amendment if only to remove the superfluous and over-elaborate wording of the second subsection but I do not plan to say much about that.  The main problem still seems to lie to some extent with section 12.  The Minister has already drafted an amendment to this section.  In broad terms nobody is in disagreement with his goodwill on this matter but I think it could still probably do with clarification.</P>
    <P>In his introductory speech to this House the Minister referred to the fact that the appendix to the Estimate which indicated how An tÚdarás would propose to allocate different grants would be&mdash;I am quoting from column 694, Volume 70 of the Seanad Official Report dated 24th June, 1971:</P>
    <P>a statement of information for the Dáil and for all persons interested but being an appendix to the Estimate it will not rigidly commit An tÚdarás to make the grants exactly an indicated.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would parse and analyse the words &ldquo;rigidly commit&rdquo;.  If it will not rigidly commit the authority will it in fact commit them in some way?  If it does not commit them at all, is there any point in having it the way it is, and is there not an argument for further amendment?</P>
    <P>Moving on to the Schedule, I should like to express some concern at the provisions relating to the membership of the authority.  We all take the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> for granted and we do not question his motives in wanting to keep four seats on the authority <Col N="862" /> vacant at any given time to allow the representation of, say, particular interests or people with particular skills but I believe that having four vacant seats on an authority of this size is too great a temptation for the Oireachtas to leave with the Minister. There is always the danger of some Minister in some situation, faced with some particular case, quietly packing an authority to ensure a decision in favour of his point of view.  I am discussing this completely in the abstract but I think that the independence of the authority would be much better guaranteed if there were to be no places on the authority left unfilled for more than a certain length of time. The argument that this would prevent the representation of particular interests can be defeated by reference to section 16, which allows the Authority to appoint a committee or person to advise them on matters relating to their functions.  This section is broad enough to allow at least the utilisation of the skills of people who, although they may not be <i>de jure</i> members of the Authority as such, would be enabled by this section to contribute to the work of the Authority almost exactly as if they had been members of it.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill has been criticised on the grounds that it represents too long and too straggling a chain of command.  In the past it is true universities tended to make their representations directly to the Department of Finance and there was a fairly direct structure from the universities to the Department of Finance, and through the Department of Finance to the Government. The present arrangement, it is alleged, by institutionalising a chain of command which includes two further units&mdash;the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education&mdash;is something that weakens the power of the universities and, indeed, of other third level institutions and makes it more difficult for them to make representations when they are looking for more money.</P>
    <P>I do not really go along with this criticism.  The chain of command is certainly long.  I do not think it need be as clumsy as some of its detractors <Col N="863" /> have made it out to be.  It may well have two very important beneficial consequences.  The first is that it would strengthen the Department of Education, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Department of Finance and <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Government. Ultimately it will be in the best interests of all educational institutions that this should happen, that more and more the Department of Education should be strengthened and should be seen to be basically representing their case to the Department of Finance and to the Government rather than have it the other way round.</P>
    <P>The other beneficial effect which I think will flow from this is that it will show in an institutional way the fact that education in this country, as in every country, is basically a unity and cannot be considered as anything else. In the past we have been bedevilled far too often by dissension between different sectors of the educational world. People whose interests and whose abilities are all pointing in the same direction have all too often been at each other's throats.  I would like to see the basic idea behind this Bill as an idea which is aimed at the elimination of this dissension and at the creation of a kind of unity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that indirectly this Bill owes its origin to a decision made by the former Minister for Education of a merger between the two universities in Dublin.  He reached a decision which to the ordinary people seemed practical and sensible.  It is the ordinary people who pay for university education even though only a very small proportion of them or of their families can ever hope to have a third level education. The cry then among the academics was that they had not been consulted. Immediately afterwards they were consulted and they have been consulting with one another and against one another during all the years in the interim and nothing has come of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators in the course of this discussion referred to the fact that a man may educate himself in a university with the purpose of earning a practical living.  From the discussions which then took place it seemed to <Col N="864" /> me that you had only to leave it to university professors and university lecturers to argue themselves out of ever coming to a decision.  I say that without any offence and with the greatest respect for those Members of this House who are university professors.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been criticised because he did not introduce this legislation sooner.  If he had introduced it sooner, it would probably have met with such a welter of criticism of the same type that it would have got nowhere. Therefore, he did the only thing possible, as did his predecessor and the only thing any Minister can do when dealing with a university. First, he established a body which was somewhat similar to this body and he gave it a trial run.  It did not meet with the objections and the criticisms that legislation would meet with.  It proved a success and then he introduced the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are few things in Ireland which can evoke a more emotive spirit than education and, in particular, higher education.  For generations past most young people who had hoped to advance themselves could do so only by education, and the sacrifices made by many parents for that purpose were untold.  Therefore, for any Minister to win a fight with university professors for university interests is well-nigh impossible.  They have only to call on this emotive spirit.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this Bill would seem to be once and for all to ensure that universities in their claim for autonomy, in their claim for independence, must realise that there is something, some group, some authority, to which they must be subject. The success of this Bill and the success of university and third level education in Ireland is going to depend very largely on the composition of this body.  It is going to depend very largely on the dedication and the enthusiasm of this body.  Therefore, this body, in the first instance, must be given authority in a very general way but, on the other hand, they must be seen to exercise their authority in a very individual and practical way.</P>
    <P>Comments have been made on most sections and subsections of this Bill <Col N="865" /> and criticisms about them have been expressed, even in regard to the definition of &ldquo;academic members&rdquo;.  In my view the fact that a man, in addition to being a professor, being a lecturer, devotes a certain amount of his time to some other avocation&mdash;the subject in which he is professor or lecturer&mdash;does not detract from his being an academic member.  It does not detract from his capability to give a sane, practical decision on something relating to the administration of university education.  It would be most ill-advised if the academic members of An tÚdarás should be under any cloud or should be declared unqualified simply because they are only part-time members.  In regard to institutes of higher education, we have to leave autonomy to them.  They are defined as &ldquo;a university&rdquo; and &ldquo;an institution&rdquo; which &ldquo;the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister can designate, even after consultation with An tÚdarás, that that section is not wise and is leaving too much power in the Minister's hands.  If we argue that way we are completely overlooking section 5 of the Bill.  Section 5 says:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall advise the Minister on the need or otherwise for the establishment of new institutions of higher education, on the nature and form of those institutions and on the legislative measures required in relation to their establishment...</P>
    <P>Therefore, even before you can have a new institution, you must have legislative measures for that purpose.  Also, before you can declare it to be an institution of higher education you must have an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is not something the Minister can decide at his whim, even if he has the desire to do so.</P>
    <P>The general functions of An tÚdarás are defined in section 3.  Some of them are quite easy to understand.  Some, for me, in any event, create difficulty.  The first is quite simple&mdash;it is furthering the development of higher education. It is development in all lines, even new <Col N="866" /> fields of study and new research that had not yet been thought of.  Secondly, assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment. This, to a great extent, is the nub of the whole thing.  We have in our universities and under our present system, not only duplication, triplication, but even quadruplication of expense, where money is not used to the best advantage.  Many of our university professors would admit this.  There must be areas of excellence in some of our universities where certain things could be centralised and developed to a peak of excellence that would be difficult to emulate elsewhere.  There must be other areas in which they are not so well suited.  Surely it is not beyond the wit of our universities or of An tÚdarás to insist that our universities will co-operate in this regard. Subsection (c) states:</P>
    <P>promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education...</P>
    <P>That is capable of two constructions. There is not really much need to promote in the average boy or girl, or in the average parents, a realisation of the necessity and the importance of higher education.  However, there is a need to promote such a realisation among those who will be employing or who are likely to employ the output of our institutions of higher education.</P>
    <P>During the last few days I have heard remarks which seem to indicate that a person goes to a university for the purpose of finding a way of living. This indicates to me that once he gets a university degree he is entitled, as a right, to a living.  That is a wrong construction. One goes to a university for a way of life, rather than a way of living.  If a person attains a profession he should be capable of bringing to that profession a richness, an enthusiasm, a dedication which otherwise he would not have.  This is how a university can be distinguished from a college of technology.</P>
    <P>We are told that many people get a BA and that then they can do nothing. If a person goes to a university and does a BA degree, if he has had the least benefit from his education what <Col N="867" /> he has learned is how to think.  He has learned sensitivity of mind, of words, of thought; he has learned to train his mind analytically; he has learned a certain discipline of mentality.  Now when he has a baccalaureate degree he can learn to study and prepare to make himself useful to society, and a man with such an education is useful in any walk of life.  He need not confine himself to teaching.  That should not be the only way of life open to him.  There is room for much progress in educating the prospective employer as to the benefit of university education.</P>
    <P>Promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education is covered in the next clause.  In Ireland we cannot afford to educate people for export.  Only a certain percentage of our national product can be devoted to education.  At the moment some of our university faculties are grossly overcrowded. The universities, of their own desire and will, must limit them and they are doing an injustice to the students whom they do not so warn, unless those students have already made up their minds that they do not propose to live in Ireland.  If they have made up their minds to that effect they should not be a burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a body such as An tÚdarás is needed to define and decide from informed sources.  People are needed to make forecasts of manpower requirements, to decide the numbers that are needed in particular sections, where one university is overcrowded and where another has not enough students.  That is something which An tÚdarás can do and which will help the universities.</P>
    <P>However, I am completely stumped as to the meaning of clause 3 (e):</P>
    <P>Promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.</P>
    <P>There are very few words that are more prostituted than the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;. One hears it used when people want to justify having broken the law and defied normal order.  One hears it used when people want to maintain order. It is a word to which everybody attaches his own meaning to justify his own deeds, and sometimes his own misdeeds. I do not know what it means in <Col N="868" /> this context.  I hate shibboleths and catchcries and words which can be so used.  I hope that it means the avoidance of patronage in our universities.</P>
    <P>Until some years ago we heard that in certain university colleges those on top could decide who would come in as lecturers.  I hope that that was untrue. I hope that such statements were foul slanders, but if there was such patronage, and if patronage of that nature is to be avoided, that is fine. However, I should rather use some word other than &ldquo;democratisation&rdquo;. If it means that in some of our universities the president and the governing body are dictatorial entities, who will brook no suggestion, or improvement, that is all right, but again I should prefer a different word.</P>
    <P>We shall all agree with section 4 of the Bill.  I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Irish language and, in case I may be misunderstood, I should like to mention that during my five years in university Irish was not on my course when I was doing political science and economics, or later when I was doing law.  However, I went to the Irish lectures every day; in addition I went to Coláiste Laighean on two days a week, which was an Irish college then in Parnell Square&mdash;I do not know if it is still there&mdash;so nobody can say that I am opposed to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>We shall have to be charitable in one thing.  One may make an excellent professor, one may help a person to become an excellent Irish speaker, but the subject must come first.  I should like to see Irish promoted in our universities on the campus, in the bar, on the dance floor, in the halls, on the playing-fields.  For instance, it would be ill-advised to teach jurisprudence badly through Irish, or to teach psychology badly through Irish. I should much prefer to see the student get his subject thoroughly in a language which was clearly understood and comprehended not only by himself, but by the person who was lecturing to him. Otherwise, there is going to be a shortage of the most skilled people. Many of our best lecturers are not going to deal with Irish at all, they may not even be of Irish origin.</P>
    <P>A lecturer must bring to his subject <Col N="869" /> an enthusiasm and he must instil enthusiasm in his students.  He must have a fine shading of words in order to do that, and that would not be easy in a language in which he and the students are not speaking every day. There are many subjects in which it is possible and in those cases it should be encouraged.  However, if and when it is apt to interfere with what is the primary purpose of the students attending a lecture, to become conversant with the subject of that lecture, then one would have to be careful.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with Section 5. It relates to new institutions of higher education.  The other sections give An tÚdarás their teeth.  Whether a man be an academic or anything else there is one thing to which he ultimately must have regard&mdash;his ability to pay his way.  If our professors are talking too much, too long, and too theoretically, there is nothing that will bring them to their senses more quickly than when they have got to account.  They have got to co-operate.  It will make them involved with An tÚdarás.  They have got to prepare their plans and programmes and see where they fit in with the general community.  The whole purpose of education for each individual is to see where he fits into the community.  Each university college and each institute of higher education will, under these sections, have to see where they fit in, and how they will do their part in the best way.</P>
    <P>I find a slight fault with Section 13:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may institute and conduct studies on such problems of higher education and research as it considers appropriate and may publish reports of such studies.</P>
    <P>If I had my way I would change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because the whole purpose and success of this will depend on how An tÚdarás do their work and how they are seen to do it. How can An tÚdarás perform their functions if they do not institute and conduct studies and problems on higher education?  I do not mind whether the chairman is permanent or part-time. If he is permanent he is the only person permanent on it apart, possibly, from the officials.  There is no use having a <Col N="870" /> part-time body who may turn up for a meeting now and again and on whom there is no definite obligation to do a job.  Not only must there be a definite obligation to do their job but they must be seen to do their job.  I would also make the publication of their reports obligatory.</P>
    <P>Some quarrel has been found with section 14.  In my view section 14 as it stands is very appropriate.  It states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
    <P>The effect of that section is merely to give the Minister a veto.  If they want to appoint, on the principles of Parkinson's Law, 30 people where 20 would do, the Minister can say that 20 ar adequate.  If they want to appoint X who is a crackpot, the Minister may say such a person is not suitable.  They may appoint him if the Minister does not express his disapproval.  The Minister has gone out of his way in this Bill to keep the subject of higher education away from the narrow field of party politics and put it where it should be&mdash;on the national plane.  I pay the Minister the highest tribute for this.</P>
    <P>There is nothing slovenly about the Bill.  It is carefully thought out.  It is broad where it should be broad and it gives teeth where teeth should be given. Some quarrel has been found by some of the Members of this House with the composition of An tÚdarás&mdash;there must be at least seven academics, at least seven who are non-academics and then there are three or four left over.  If An tÚdarás are to be worth anything to the people they will have to be objective in their approach.  They will have to have men with expertise of administrative ability and common sense, as well as men who understand and appreciate third level education and what it means to this country and to the students who receive it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I cannot agree with what Senator Kelly said as I have a very high regard for his intelligence and capacity.  The Senator suggested that if the intellectuals or academics in this group decided such-and-such, even though they were defeated by a <Col N="871" /> majority, what they decided still should hold.  The Senator offered no reason in support of this.  I can see no reason in support of it.  I can see many reasons to the contrary.</P>
    <P>The Minister, quite obviously, should have the power to appoint the chairman of An tÚdarás.  If that man is in any way to reflect public policy at all, his appointment must be in the hands of the Minister.  There is no use saying: &ldquo;Look, Minister, you appoint 10, 12 or 14 people and let them elect their own chairman&rdquo; because there may not be among that number one person who will have the capacity to be the type of chairman that is required for this body.  If the chairman is to be permanent&mdash;I hope he will be&mdash;it is most important that his appointment should be in the hands of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Having consulted with the chairman, the Minister appoints the others, and also having consulted with the chairman the Minister may remove any members.  I think this is right, despite all the criticism that is made about it.  Can a situation be visualised in regard to a committee of 12 or 14 people, even though one fellow is a complete dope, where a majority of that committee will bother meeting and saying: &ldquo;We had better eject him and remove him from the committee because he is no use to us whatsoever. On the few occasions he comes here, he is a hindrance rather than a help&rdquo;?  If we do not live in a vacuum we must be satisfied that such a course is impractical.  It would never arise. It should be in the hands of the Minister, if he is to have any respect for the advice given him, to be able to remove a person whose advice he cannot possibly see his way to accepting, either because it is not objective, or because it is constantly unreasonable, or because the man himself is unbalanced.</P>
    <P>One further improvement which, I think, could be made in this Bill is in section 21.  I notice that it is obligatory on An tÚdarás to make a report only every five years, or as often as the Minister decides.  This is a body which will be empowered to expend many millions of pounds annually.  I agree that the accounts are laid before <Col N="872" /> the Houses of the Oireachtas each year.  I agree that the Minister can look for a report more often than every five years, but I feel that the Oireachtas should be entitled to a report from An tÚdarás more often than every five years.  I appreciate that, if there has to be a new development or a new building, you have got to erect your new building or you have got to get your professors and so on, but they are not going to be putting up new institutions every day of the week and the report of An tÚdarás will mean more than that.  Therefore, I would like to see that period of five years shortened to two years.</P>
    <P>With these few minor amendments, which I would recommend to the Minister for his consideration.  I consider this Bill to be one of the most useful pieces of legislation we have had relating to education for a long time.  I hope that it will keep our academics and our intellectuals from the unedifying type of exhibition which we saw some years ago when the merger was first suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go a little further than Senator Nash in saying that this is one of the most useful measures dealing with education that has come before us.  It is also one of the most important measures to come before us for a very long time and certainly since I became a Member of this House more than 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, it has been realised for a very long time that something should be done along these lines and this was underlined in the report of the Commission on Higher Education. For too long those of us who have worked in universities, and the larger number in the community who have children attending universities, have been living with a system which is most frustrating.  In this country where our resources of all kinds&mdash;such as personnel, accommodation and equipment&mdash;are scarce we have had duplication and, as Senator Nash has said, even quadruplication sometimes of a very wasteful nature, in these circumstances it is practically impossible to make any progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any field of science, including medical science, we find the staffs of <Col N="873" /> our departments going to meetings and conferences in these islands or elsewhere where papers are presented dealing with research made possible by extensive equipment and by especially well qualified staff.  These papers are produced in numbers and quality which we cannot match.  I do not wish to suggest that, given the facilities, we are not capable of matching them because when we do produce papers at such meetings there is very little doubt that we can show that our possibilities are just as good, or perhaps better, than those elsewhere. However, we just have not got the facilities, the staff or the equipment at present and we cannot acquire these until some method is devised of coordinating expenditure on these in our institutions of higher education.</P>
    <P>On another level, and from a rather different point of view, we find great difficulty in recruiting staff and keeping those we have succeeded in recruiting. This difficulty arises not so much because of salary differences between ourselves and elsewhere but because of the very deficient facilities we have for the support of research. This body, which we are being asked to establish, can do a great deal to remedy this situation.  Presumably, it will have consultations with the universities and this will help to generate some sort of rational pattern of development.  Then grants can be awarded on the basis of such a prepared plan.  The making of grants, on a plan like that, will make it difficult for anybody to sabotage that plan.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I have a strong personal feeling that the operation of this body, by itself, will be less than fully effective.  In developing its plan it can and will try to obtain the co-operation of the universities but it will have no right to enforce it.  Indeed, if it makes any attempt to do so it will raise the whole matter of university autonomy and academic freedom.  It can use its grant allocations to induce conformity, giving grants for agreed developments and withholding funds for those which are running counter to its intentions, but this is a kind of negative role.  The only body that can effectively plan development in a university is the university governing body itself.  This, <Col N="874" /> of course, will have particular relevance to the situation in Dublin where the most difficult problems in this area are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination between the two Dublin colleges, their complimentary development, the rational sharing of their facilities, all should come, naturally, from a single governing body. They can be difficult to impose from without, as the reaction to the proposals put forward by the Minister's predecessor shows very clearly.  It is common knowledge that in the professional schools the greatest difficulty arises particularly in this.  We have all heard, I think of two-headed monsters, a creature with one body and two heads. The so-called agreement between the universities has produced a different kind of monster, a monster with two pre-clinical bodies and one clinical head.  When I refer to the so-called agreement I have in mind&mdash;although it has not been mentioned very often&mdash;the fact is that the medical faculty of Trinity College was almost unanimously opposed to this agreement.  The faculty of medicine, veterinary medicine and dental science, just over a year ago, passed a resolution in which it took the view that the proposals put forward by the representatives of the NUI and TCD were unsatisfactory from an educational point of view.  It adhered to its previous decisions in relation to the rationalisation of subjects in the Dublin universities, that there should be a single medical school, a single veterinary school and a single dental school in Dublin, referring to the university medical school in this case. I do not think that that resolution has got very much publicity but it has been forwarded to the various authorities.  I have reason to believe&mdash;in fact I know &mdash;that a considerable number of the staff of the medical faculty of University College, Dublin, agree with the point of view expressed in that resolution.  At the same time it has been represented that there is the unanimous agreement about the pattern of professional education in future in Dublin!</P>
    <P>I should like to mention an example of the kind of benefits that can accrue from co-operation when it is administered by a governing body that has <Col N="875" /> authority.  I refer to the group of hospitals which are associated with the Trinity College medical school.  For over 150 years these seven hospitals have been vieing with each other for funds for their medical and teaching work.  The result, of course, was complete stagnation, a situation that would have led to the disappearance of at least some of them if it had been allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>About 15 years ago negotiations were started and after a prolonged period of some five years an Act was passed in 1961 giving effect to the agreement by which the hospitals would be governed by a single Central Council representative of the hospitals. During the last ten years this group has been working under this single Central Council.  It took quite a bit of time to get over the initial birth pangs and growing pains, but for some years now co-operation has been very effective indeed.  Expensive equipment is being purchased; expert staff are being recruited, and these benefits are being shared by all the seven institutions. There are, of course, enormous advantages in the care of patients and in the promotion of teaching and research.</P>
    <P>This is encouraging, but of more significance is the fact that over the previous 30 years the Department of Health and the Hospitals' Commission had done their level best to try to bring about the same kind of co-operation between these hospitals, and they failed.  They recognised their failure themselves.  Each hospital went its own way.  They could not be stopped from doing so because they were each independent of the other.</P>
    <P>The only body that ever succeeded in bringing about co-operation was the body set up by the Hospital Amalgamation and Federation Act, 1961, recognised as having the authority to do this by the hospitals themselves. This would be almost directly analagous to the governing body of a joint university in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This House has recently had before it the statutory order made by the Minister for Health bringing into being a further association between this <Col N="876" /> group of hospitals and St. Kevin's Hospital, previously controlled by the Dublin Health Authority and more recently by the Eastern Health Board. As from today, 1st July, this hospital has become St. James's Hospital and is controlled by a joint board composed equally of representatives of the group of hospitals to which I have just referred and representatives of the Eastern Health Board.  It is intended, in time, that the small hospitals which formed this group will cease to exist, one by one.  Their activities will be transferred to and concentrated in St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>At some time in the future&mdash;not in the very near future&mdash;we will have a large hospital capable of providing the best possible level of medical care and teaching.  This is a very satisfactory development for the Trinity College medical school.  But how much more exciting would it be if this new development could embrace the other two great Dublin teaching hospitals with university associations in a single medical school here in Dublin?</P>
    <P>Maybe I have said enough about the background of this Bill and perhaps I should say something about the Bill itself.  It would be very difficult, at this stage, to say anything new.  This Bill has been fully discussed, particularly on the Committee Stage in the Dáil, and many Members here have spoken about it but there are a few points I should like to make and a few on which I would like some clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (c) defines an institution of higher education as</P>
    <P>(c)  an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education...</P>
    <P>The scope of this designation is of the greatest interest to everybody.  There is a very wide range of institutions which can claim to provide higher education in some form or other.  Where is the line drawn?  How many of these will be included?  Perhaps there will be some difficulty in deciding at the lower edge of this group which are higher and which are not quite so high.  There is another difficulty at what I would regard as the upper edge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> Yesterday Senator West mentioned the Royal Irish Academy as an institution that could properly be included within the interests of An tÚdarás.  I would agree with him wholeheartedly and particularly with his argument that the fact that the activities of the Academy extend over the whole of Ireland is relevant at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should like to look at the position of other institutions of a similar nature in this regard also.  I have in mind in particular the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, especially in relation to post-graduate training activities of the latter College. These are professional bodies with responsibility for vocational education and post-graduate training, for the promotion of research and for the standard of practice in their branches of medicine.  There is also the Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>
    <P>I understand that a fourth level of education is now being mentioned. This might include these bodies and others like them with special functions for post-graduate training and research.  I am particularly interested that research should not be lost sight of in this regard.  It is mentioned in this Bill and it is certainly true that research needs to be co-ordinated, almost as badly as higher education.</P>
    <P>We have, for instance, the National Science Council.  We have the Medical Research Council, the Medical Social Research Board, the Agricultural Institute, the Economic and Social Research Institute and others.  I do not know of any scheme or arrangement for co-ordination between these and yet there are areas in which there is a good deal of overlapping.  I am quite certain that there are also areas which are being neglected.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the functions of An tÚdarás.  Like Senator Nash, I am not a bit clear about the meaning of the last of these functions.  I should like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to explain what &ldquo;democratisation&rdquo; means in this context.  If it were possible to find an easier, a less contrived, a more euphonious sort of word or phrase I would very much welcome it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Section 6 refers to the thorny question of student numbers.  This is becoming increasingly difficult.  Formerly in Ireland we often referred to ourselves as having a land hunger.  I think this has now been replaced by an education hunger.  The number of students coming up for third level education is getting so great that it is a tremendously difficult problem.  The plain fact is that this country produces more children than it can find jobs for here as adults.  Many must find employment elsewhere, though some of these do return with better training.  The only question is whether we can or should accept responsibility for preparing those who must leave us for making a career elsewhere.  I have always felt that we must.  Too many of our children have had to emigrate with only a primary education and fit only for relatively lowly posts abroad.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what Senator Nash refers to as a burden on the Irish taxpayers, this should not be allowed to continue.  We must be prepared to provide further educational opportunities for our children even if they have to go abroad after having had this education.  This does not, of course, mean that they must all go to universities because in that way we would be depressing the quality of work in these institutions.  But the Higher Education Authority should see that a full range of opportunities is provided.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton referred to the night classes and discontinuance of these in Trinity College.  I was not closely involved in that but I can say to the House that the discontinuance of these classes was not because of any objection the staff had to doing that kind of work.  A large proportion of these classes was devoted to training for the Bachelor of Commerce degree which we had in those days.  The students came for evening classes in public administration. They got a Diploma in Public Administration after, I think, one year and then if they attended lectures for two more years they were qualified to sit the tests for the BComm degree.  We discontinued that because at the establishment of the Irish Management Institute it appeared that this effort of ours was going to become redundant.  I am not quite <Col N="879" /> satisfied that it would have become redundant myself, but we took that decision in good faith because we did not want to be in competition with an institution that was being set up on a completely different basis.</P>
    <P>As far as the other evening classes were concerned, I think it is quite true to say that they came to an end for want of students not for any lack of enthusiasm on the part of the staff. At that time, of course, there were special conditions required of a great majority of people in the population before they could attend any kind of classes at Trinity College if corresponding classes were available in University College, Dublin.  When University College, Dublin, started evening classes our students faded away.  These were the circumstances as far as I know in which our evening classes came to an end at the time they were running.  We have not been able to start them since.</P>
    <P>Section 7, subsection (12), deals with the machinery of providing grants for higher education institutions but neither in the previous section nor in these sections nor in the following section which deals with research on problems of higher education, is there any reference to consultation with the institution of higher education.  In fact, I have not been able to find such a reference in the Bill.  I may have missed it but it certainly is not stressed in any of these sections.  I have no doubt, of course, that such consultations will take place.  Indeed, they should be inevitable.  But I do feel strongly that this point should at least be mentioned somewhere in the Bill.  It is as important surely as the stipulation that requests for grants must be made in a certain manner.</P>
    <P>The Schedule deals with the number of members in the Authority and the manner of their appointment.  Here we have a conflict between the natural desire of the institutions to have a say, as much of a say as possible in fact, in the appointment of members and the responsibility of the Minister to appoint the kind of people whom he feels can do the job best.  I sympathise with my colleagues, of course, in their <Col N="880" /> wish to have a voice in these appointments but I can only take the example that we have before us of the existing <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority whose members were appointed directly by the Minister.  While there were some reservations expressed at the time about their manner of appointment and the actual known views of some of them in certain directions, I think that they have done a very good piece of work.  They have worked extremely hard and patiently as other Senators have said.  I have particularly in mind, of course, the chairman of the Authority and the splendid work he has done not only in recent years in the Authority but also previously in the Department of Education.  If I have reservations at all about this <i>ad hoc</i> body which has been meeting over the last three years, it is that they have not been radical enough.  I do not find their report on teacher training satisfactory. I agree with Senator Horgan about this and I support what he said.  Hippocrates, the father of medicine, had a large number of aphorisms which we are in the habit of reciting to our students.  One of these was: &ldquo;Serious diseases need drastic remedies.&rdquo;  Higher education here is, in the professional regions anyway, in a serious condition and half measures will not be an adequate remedy.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Higher Education Authority should be given the necessary &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; to make it effective and that it should not be afraid, after full consultation of course, to advise the Minister firmly and, if necessary, radically.  I would hope the Minister would encourage them in this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the composition of An tÚdarás, I would agree with those who suggest that it should include students.  We have found these very helpful even at the highest level of the board of Trinity College.  My most direct experience of them is in the executive committee of our faculty.  I find the ones that I come in contact with&mdash;and this has been going on for four years for we were the first faculty to take this step&mdash;extremely helpful and my colleagues are all in agreement with this.  I think that if it were decided to have students on a Higher Education Authority considerable care would <Col N="881" /> have to be taken in the manner in which they would be selected, because, of course, there are students and students.  Some of the ones who are most likely to get votes from their fellow students are politically minded, they are not necessarily the best students in the academic sense.  Many of the students who do well at examinations and are going to come out with good degrees are not interested in the organisation or political side of the thing at all.  It would be a difficult matter for the authority to select, but I believe that if there were students on this body it would help in the deliberations.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell suggested that it would be better if the Higher Education Authority had a majority of lay or non-academic members.  The Bill provides for seven of each with four vacant places so it is possible if the Minister were to accept Senator Russell's view that we would end up with seven academic and 11 lay or non-academic members.</P>
    <P>I am always amazed with the consistency with which businessmen seem to assume that neither academics nor doctors can be given more than an advisory voice in running the concerns of which they are an integral and vital part.  I wonder what would be the reaction if I were to suggest that a body should be set up to co-ordinate business activities and that it should have a majority of academics; or that the Irish Management Institute be run by clerics; or the Church by higher executives.</P>
    <P>We had a similar reaction when the Minister for Health wished to have doctors and their ancillary colleagues in a majority on the Health Boards. There are, of course, academics who could not run anything but there are others who are not deficient in organising ability.  In the college to which I belong all the important decisions are taken by academics and we have managed to survive.  I would like to support Senator Kelly's suggestion, notwithstanding what Senator Nash said just now, that, even if the academics are in a minority, if they are solidly opposed to some action proposed to be taken by the Higher Education <Col N="882" /> Authority, the authority should not take such action.  I do not think the authority would like to go firmly against a unanimous opinion expressed by the academics on an academic matter.  They would be unwise to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch referred to the fallibility of examinations as the sole basis for admitting students to a university and he would like to have every student interviewed.  Over the last few decades, since the last war, many universities in this island have tried out every possible way to screen students for admission to the university and they have come to the conclusion that there is no single way and indeed no combination of ways that is infallible. They have checked the results of their admission procedures over the years against the record of those admitted to the university.</P>
    <P>You may make mistakes at interviews just as easily as at examinations. You get a bright extrovert student who is making a good impression at an interview, you admit him and find that he really is not nearly so good as he appeared to be at the interview.  In our admissions at the medical school we take into account the examination record, not just the single examination with which the student leaves school but his record, so far as we can ascertain it, and the headmaster's or headmistress's report. If the leaving certificate results are available, we ask for the intermediate certificate results as well.  If two candidates have each got the required performance of the leaving certificate, the one who has done best at the intermediate certificate will probably get preference.  We like to have the reports from the school at the same time, in fact, we insist on them.  We think this is better than an interview.  We think that the headmaster or headmistress who has known the student over a period of years is in a better position to assess the student and advise us than we are by seeing that student for perhaps five or ten minutes.</P>
    <P>You have to take some trouble about this because you have to get to know the headmasters and headmistresses. We have during the last five <Col N="883" /> years operated an arrangement for bringing the headmasters and headmistresses to a conference in the college once a year in January.  We spend the whole of a Saturday with them. They discuss our admission procedures and the kind of opportunities we have available.  We have a chance then of telling them which schools are overfull, which schools could still take students and what the requirements of these schools are.  They get a lot of information from us but we get a lot of information from them.  We can make up our minds which of them is reliable in an assessment of a student. There are some we know, whose geese are all swans.  Others tend never to give a good report.  If such a headmaster says that this boy is middling, you may assume that the boy may be quite good.  I feel that this is something the Higher Education Authority would be well advised to encourage.  It takes time, patience and a little money, but it is time well spent and money well spent too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill too.  It simply gives legislative effect to the Government decision to set up a Higher Education Authority.  This decision was made in 1968.  I consider the Bill a further advance in the education development which we have seen over the last decade.  No matter what one thinks of the political aspects of education, it must be admitted by all that there has been a dramatice escalation in the expenditure on education over the last decade and considerable and significant advances have been made in the educational progress. For example, in the development of chomprehensive education, in the matter of giving post-primary grants to students, university grants, a spectacular development in special education for the physically and mentally handicapped children.  As one who has been very close to education and as a person who has been very critical of the Department of Education over the years, I would like to pay that tribute to the heads of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officials of the Department of Education have been very severely <Col N="884" /> criticised, particularly over the last few years.  But we must give credit where credit is due.  Senator Horgan stated that some of the officials of the Department of Education were working under tremendous pressure over the past number of years.  In an endeavour to develop education, they came up against vested interests of various kinds and deep-seated prejudices. Some of the officials of the Department of Education have been damaged in their health as a result of the tremendous pressure under which they have gone over the last few years. I say this candidly and openly as a person who was involved in several disputes, major disputes, with the Department of Education, involving a strike which lasted for six and a half months, and in several minor disputes involving strike or industrial action. But, as I have said, I must give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>I see in this piece of legislation, then, a further advance in educational development.  The <i>ad hoc</i> body which was set up as the forerunner or precursor of the Higher Education Authority has introduced a very vital report on teacher education.  I admit, like Senator Jessop and Senator Horgan, that it has not gone far enough in the matter of teacher education. Certainly, it has set out the guidelines which must be taken into account in teacher supply.</P>
    <P>With regard to the nature of the teacher's qualification and the nature of the course leading to that qualification, education is a basic service and is absolutely fundamental to the development of the total individual personality to its full potential.  Education is also vital to the cultural, social and economic improvement of a nation. There is a vital link between educational standards and the calibre of the teachers who man the educational service. No system of education can rise above the levels and standards of the teachers who man the educational service. No nation can afford to neglect the recruitment of the best brains into the educational service, and if a nation runs the risk of recruiting to the teaching profession those who are mediocre in calibre, then that nation can never <Col N="885" /> rise above mediocrity.  While education needs a basic service, the teacher himself is fundamental to the whole process. If you have a bad system of education, you cannot expect high standards in the various services which are dependent on education.  It is just as simple as that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when producing the Report on Teacher Education, the <i>ad hoc</i> body, which was the forerunner of the Higher Education Authority, had to deal with a very complex area, because there have been traditional prejudices and jealousies in the matter of teacher education.  Different institutions were engaged in the production of teachers.  Certain bodies had autonomy in the matter of teacher education, particularly in the post-primary sector.</P>
    <P>People who are in autonomous situations are very reluctant to accept advice, and they will resist any kind of directive towards them in their practices in the matter of teacher supply. At the moment we have many haphazard systems of training teachers. Therefore, the Higher Education Authority had to cut across various prejudices, and perhaps that is the reason why they have not been as drastic as Senator Jessop would like to have them.  When one is trying to achieve something, it is often better to get around it rather than face up to a total confrontation, and that is the way in which the Higher Education Authority has dealt with this question of teacher supply.  However, we would have welcomed a more drastic approach towards the question of the nature of the course and the nature of the qualification.</P>
    <P>The report indicates a certain type of contradiction.  In one paragraph it states that they would consider that the course should be of a certain type and that the qualification should be conferred by a council for national awards.  In chapter 17 they say they consider that a link with a university is absolutely essential.  It is instructive to examine the word in paragraph 12, with particular reference to the words &ldquo;consider&rdquo; and &ldquo;should&rdquo;, and compare them with the extract from paragraph 17, which uses the <Col N="886" /> words &ldquo;believe&rdquo; and &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;. In other words, they say in paragraph 12, that the nature of the course should be considered in such a way and that the degree should be conferred.  Yet, in paragraph 17, they say that they &ldquo;believe&rdquo;.  When one says one believes, it is a sort of <i>credo</i>&mdash;you simply believe it&mdash;and it is much stronger than &ldquo;consider&rdquo;.  When one uses the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;, it has a far greater significance than the word &ldquo;should&rdquo;.  Therefore, I find the Higher Education Authority somewhat contradictory in the matter of the nature of the qualification which will be given to teachers.</P>
    <P>However, most of the report has been very constructive and has marked a considerable advance in the existing situation.  For example, in recommending the establishment of An Foras Oideachais, they laid down entry standards and disciplinary measures which might be used in controlling the teaching profession.  In other countries they have established councils for the control of entry, for the control of standards and for the control of qualification. In suggesting the setting up of An Foras Oideachais it implies a review of the standards of education, the training, the fitness to teach of persons entering the teaching profession and, as it may deem appropriate, to advise thereon the Minister for Education and the institutions conducting teacher training courses.</P>
    <P>This is very important.  An Foras would have the function of considering how best to educate teachers, to supervise their training, to foster, encourage and promote the educational and professional interests of teachers, and to advise the Minister for Education and the other competent authorities on all these matters.  This is a considerable advance as far as the teaching profession is concerned.</P>
    <P>Further very useful recommendations have been made by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee, acting on behalf of the Higher Education Authority.  It advises that the teacher training course should be extended to three years, that a grants system should be established so that there would be parity of treatment <Col N="887" /> between teacher trainees and students in the universities; that mature students should be admitted to training; that the teacher training colleges, as we now know them, should be upgraded to the status of colleges of education, and that these colleges of education would be conducted on the principle of co-education, which is a feature of training colleges abroad and, of course, is a feature of universities here.  These mark considerable advances.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Teachers' Organisation, which caters mainly for teachers in the national or primary schools, has traditionally sought a liaison between teacher-training colleges and the universities.  Teacher training was originally the main function of a university.  In mediaeval and renaissance times the function of the university was to train people in the seven liberal arts: the <i>trivium</i>&mdash;the three&mdash;and the <i>quadrivium</i>.  In this way a person got his master's degree to teach.  The main function of a university was to produce teachers.  It was only at a later stage that the schools of medicine and law were introduced into universities.  Therefore, the original function of the university was to produce teachers, and these teachers set up schools in various places.  We have the example of the monks trained in the Irish monasteries going to the continent of Europe and setting up their own schools, and there they taught.  Other additions then were made to the university at a later stage. However, I am trying to emphasise that the university was originally a training college for teachers.  When the industrial revolution took place and when there was such a demand for popular education teachers had to be produced in great quantities.  <i>Ad hoc</i> establishments were set up&mdash;these establishments are now called training colleges&mdash;in order to produce thousands of teachers.  The time has come when a nation which has any regard for its educational system must examine to what extent these <i>ad hoc</i> establishments are sufficient to meet the demands of modern society.  The INTO feel that the time has come to establish a closer liaison between <Col N="888" /> teacher education and the universities. As far back as 1902, Dr. Walter Starkey, Resident Commissioner for National Education, said:</P>
    <P>The need for co-ordination in Ireland is undeniable and is not of recent date.  The teachers from the earliest times are cribbed, cabined and confined within the narrow curriculum of a primary school and of a training college.  The primary school is the bedrock upon which the whole structure is based and if there is such a thing as continuity in mental development, it should be leavened with the broad and liberal ideas which have their sources in the university.</P>
    <P>Thinking people throughout the world are now of opinion that the school and the teacher of the future must continue to play an even more important role than they did in the past.  Education in the past was mainly an affair of the family and standards were patterned on the moral order of the community.  But due to the disturbing and inimical influences surrounding children at the present time, interfering with their orderly upbringing, it is felt that there must be more realiance upon the school and education than in the past.  There has been a weakening of family discipline and there has been a relaxation of the character building aspect of the home.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I looked at the <i>Time</i> magazine which was on the table of the Library and in it I saw a report of the escalation of crime in the city of Washington.  It is a very beautiful city and one where one would expect very high standards.  It is now freely admitted that even in the city of Washington violence of all kinds takes place even in broad daylight in the main streets.  It is no longer a question of violence in the dark around the corners.  That is how society is developing at the present time due to these inimical influences to which I have referred.  Day after day and night after night children all over the world are being bombarded with this portrayal of violence of all kinds.  If the homes and family backgrounds fail society, we must find a substitute.</P>
    <P>Thinkers in the United States are <Col N="889" /> gravely concerned about the development of crime and how it might be counteracted.  We think that more reliance must be placed in the future on the role of the teacher and the role of education.  That is why I have emphasised that teacher education is fundamental and no stone should be left unturned in order to produce teachers of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan referred to the Coleraine experiment.  He said that persons can qualify with a university degree after a four-year course but others can qualify with a certificate or a diploma after a three-year course.  We are a 32-county organisation and we have several thousands of our members in Northern Ireland.  They are not at all satisfied with this type of approach towards teacher education.  One thing that should be aimed at, and which is emphasised in the Higher Education Authority report, is unity in the teaching profession.  What would this recommendation which has been made lead to?  It would lead not alone to graduates in the post-primary sector but to graduates and non-graduates in the primary sector, and rather than unity being created, a further fragmentation would be created.</P>
    <P>We have studied the whole question of teacher education for many years. We are of the opinion that those who man education should have a common basic qualification in the art of teaching because there is only one art of teaching.  If people want higher degrees opportunities should be given to them. As far as the primary sector is concerned the creation of an opportunity to take a degree by staying on an extra year is not adequate because it would lead to a further division in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>Instead of having trained teachers in the primary sector there would be graduate teachers and non-graduate teachers.  This would be a further cause for disunity.  I should like to say that we would not at all be enamoured of Senator Horgan's recommendation of the Coleraine experiment.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to research as being one of the functions of the Higher Education Authority.  I agree that there is a great need for research in all areas <Col N="890" /> in Ireland&mdash;in industry, medicine, science and, indeed, in education.  On one occasion I was listening to the chief inspector of schools in the London County Council area.  He was speaking to a group in Rathmines Town Hall.  He deplored the fact that only .005 of their budget was devoted to research.  I was asked to speak to his paper and I complimented him on the happy situation in which they found themselves having .005 of 1 per cent of their budget devoted to research because, in Ireland, as far as education was concerned, it was .00000 recurring.</P>
    <P>In other words, we had spent no money whatsoever on educational research. In Scotland, since 1929, there has been a council for research in education and they produce an annual report.  Here, we introduced new schemes of education but we never have any form of research into how these new schemes operate&mdash;for example, Buntús, which was introduced in Irish a short time ago.  There was a lot of criticism of it but criticism is not enough.  There should be some research into how this scheme is working as compared with the old scheme for the development particularly of oral Irish, Similarly, other schemes which have been introduced into the education field should be subjected to some research.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch referred to the open university.  He suggested that this might be something which could be examined by the Higher Education Authority.  The idea of the open university is a very good one.  It is an exciting opportunity for adults to study for degree qualifications through the media of integrated television, radio and specially designed correspondence courses.  The open university received its royal charter in May, 1969.  It is an autonomous, independent body empowered to award its own degrees. It provides undergraduate courses and higher degree courses for advanced study and research and updating courses to keep people abreast of the changes in modern technological society.  It is a very long-term objective, however, as far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>I happened to be one of the group who asked Mr. Normay, the organiser <Col N="891" /> for the North of England and Northern Ireland, to come to Dublin with the assistant secretary of the open university to give a talk.  The Minister for Education was present on that occasion.  The two speakers freely admitted that the cost of running an open university was astronomical.  A total of 25,000 people have signed for the courses already and it is of interest that 40 per cent of those people are between the ages of 25 and 34 and 7 per cent were over the age of 50.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cranitch that this is a wonderful idea because it presents a new, exciting opportunity to people to better themselves and to develop their potential to their personal satisfaction.  At the same time, one has to take into account the order of priorities. There are more pressing matters at the present time.  I have already referred to the escalation in education expenditure over the last decade and if we were to consider this idea of an open university we would have to jettison some of the very pressing and urgent educational needs of the present time.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome this Bill. It is a considerable step forward towards the development of the educational schemes which have been a feature of the last decade.  I am certain it will help to produce the kind of society we would all like to see in our country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody has already said that our institutions of higher education have never been famous for promoting and encouraging our Irish language and <Col N="893" /> culture.  Comhairle na Gaeilge have issued a list of submissions to the Higher Education Authority.  Not only does it outline what would be best for the promotion of the Irish language in our institutions of higher education but it also deals with &ldquo;bun oideachas&rdquo; and &ldquo;meán oideachas&rdquo;.  I have just looked at the Report of the Commission on Higher Education, 1960-67, Presentation and Summary.  On reading chapter 28 I felt that the Higher Education Authority had its heart in the right place.  It is quite aware of the special obligation it has to strengthen and expand Irish studies in our universities.  The report goes on to refer to our textbooks and the proper recruitment of competent Irish teachers. In general, there is no section of the promotion of our Irish culture and language, and the difficulties that surround them, that has not been adverted to in chapter 28.  Instead of reading out the chapter, I would advise people who have any doubts about the sincerity of the Higher Education Authority to study chapter 4.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the &ldquo;bean na dtrí mbó&rdquo; attitude amongst the teaching profession.  We have a certain type of snobbery between the different branches of education. Teachers in our secondary schools regard primary teachers, and those who teach in technical schools, as being in a lower category.  This is the first big problem that needs to be ironed out by the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>I regret also that in this report there has been no mention of the faculty of home economics.  I have said previously in this House that the science of home economics has for too long been the Cinderella of higher education.  It is a strange thing that those who advise our farmers on cattle and crops have to go through a university, whilst the women who advise on home making have no such status.  In view of the fact that life is becoming far more complicated with the affluent society and a greater amount of leisure time, it is all the more reason why we should give special attention to the faculty of home economics.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan referred to integrated training of teachers.  This is the first step in ending this rivalry that we <Col N="894" /> know exists between the teaching professions.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about more and more education.  We have got free post-primary education and more opportunities for our children to get into universities.  From that point of view the quantity of education has greatly increased over the last ten years.  One thing that has not increased is the quality of our education.  Instead of addressing the quantity of our education we should now be concerned with the quality of our education.  The qualities of responsibility and judgment and the quality of having a civic spirit and practical patriotism are all very lacking in our society.  This, first of all, goes back to the home, but the continuation of the home is at school and then there is the university.  A great reflection on the quality of our education is that this great sense of responsibility and sense of practical patriotism seems to be lacking.</P>
    <P>Someone said that those who get higher education owe a debt to the community.  This is something which those people very often forget.  I inquired and found it takes about £462 per pupil from the Exchequer to keep a person at university.  Those who go through our national training colleges have to guarantee that they spend five years giving some return to the community.  The day has come when something like that will have to be done in the other fields of higher education. I should like to comment on section 3 (c) which states:</P>
    <P>promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research.</P>
    <P>The appreciation of higher education must start in the home.  That is one reason why I agree with Senator Desmond when she said there should be far more opportunities for adult education because many of the 30-40 age group have not had the opportunities which those of the present generation have now.  There should be more stress&mdash;this has been referred to by many people&mdash;on education for education's sake, as a power which enriches each one of us and helps us to develop a proper attitude towards life and <Col N="895" /> society.  This comes into the quality of education and it will, we hope, give a sense of responsibility towards the community.</P>
    <P>I see that of the number to be appointed to the Higher Education Authority only two will be women.  We all know that it is the women who are most interested in the education of the family.  It is the women who steer their children into the various streams of education and who try to assess their different talents.  From that point of view I hope the Minister will see fit to appoint more women to the authority.</P>
    <P>By and large those who are fearful of the Higher Education Authority should read page 47 of the report which contains a very wonderful conclusion. It is a summary of the whole attitude of the authority towards education in general.  It is well worth quoting:</P>
    <P>It has been well said that the connections between education, technology, economic growth and social development are the centre of the problem of modern society.  We see, accordingly, our higher education institutions playing a vital part in meeting the challenge of the seventies adequately accommodated, staffed and equipped as visualised in this report, that they may confidently be expected to maintain their high standards of teaching and research and the international acceptability of their degrees and other awards.</P>
    <P>That is a very important point, because I understand that there are some degrees that are in some way in doubt. But here it is to be repeated that in return for adequate support the State is entitled to have its money spent to the best advantage.  That is one of the main points of the Bill, that the State is entitled to have its money spent to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The nation will, we believe, look firmly to its higher education institutions for understanding and practical co-operation in the coordination of effort and rationalisation of resources which will be necessary if this aim is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>From that very short paragraph there is nothing to fear and a good job has <Col N="896" /> been done in setting up the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>Táim cinnte go dtiocfaidh tairbhe mór as an mBille seo, má bhíonn an dea-thoil agus an có-oibriú idir na brainsí go léir go bhfuil baint acu de hoideachas.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators who have spoken I welcome this Higher Education Authority Bill because it gives statutory basis to the existing Higher Education Authority and because it is a first step in the rationalisation of higher education in this country.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that we have had a rather extensive debate on this in the Seanad.  I have been present for a good deal of the debate.  Some of it has ranged very widely over higher education but this is important.  I note that on Second Stage in the Dáil only five people spoke.  Apparently very few were present during the Second Stage, and this is regrettable.  This is the first opportunity we have had for some time to debate the issues relating to higher education and I am glad the Seanad have taken, perhaps rather liberally the Leader of the House may think, the opportunity to debate higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of this authority for reasons which have been given and which I will summarise here, and particularly for the reason that higher education has become increasingly dependent on public moneys.  All of the institutions of higher education are now very largely dependent on money from the Government, and therefore the taxpayers' money, for survival.  This means that the universities have to negotiate with the Government for increased funds.  A very graphic example of this is University College, Galway, which is in a critical situation at the moment looking for further funds from the Government.  It is not a good thing for each university to have to negotiate directly with the Government.  This is not good for <Col N="897" /> university autonomy and is not a fair position.</P>
    <P>It is a much more equitable and rational position that there would be an authority such as the Higher Education Authority to negotiate on behalf of all institutes of higher education.  We must face the fact that the national cake for universities&mdash;although we all want it to be as large as possible&mdash;is a small cake because in our small country we must parcel it out very fairly, equitably and with great concern and we cannot always have the same sophistication in our methods and approach as other countries who have more cake to distribute.</P>
    <P>If each institution, as it does at the moment, negotiates separately then we will not have as equitable a solution as if we have this Higher Education Authority doing the programming of our higher education and the negotiating on behalf of all.  This is a very good principle and I am glad to see it embodied in statutory form in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In speaking about the creation of the Higher Education Authority I would also like to echo what Senator Horgan said here earlier this afternoon, that the development of higher education must come very much through the development of third level institutions and that these third level institutions must be given a degree of autonomy from the Department and must be allowed to play a much greater, a much more recognised and a much more prestigious role in higher education in this country.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the European Movement in Brussels about a fortnight ago which I attended with Senator Dooge and Senator Keery the subject under discussion was the universities and technology.  In relation to the universities it was clear that on the European level there is what was called a crisis in the university, that the university in every country is having to justify itself and justify itself particularly in relation to other third level institutions.  In a very good paper read by the <i>rapporteur</i> in this discussion it was stated that the main differential between the university and other third level institutions is that the university has always performed and will continue to perform <Col N="898" /> the valuabe role of basic research, of pure research, the necessity to have people who have both the interest in researching, the facility for research, the time and the independence to conduct this research.  It is this above all which distinguishes the university from a third level institution but we must move away from the idea that in so far as it provides instruction on the level of higher education to people it is necessarily any better than another third level institution that is providing a similar type of instruction.  For that reason it cannot be justified that the university would get priority in facilities if it is providing the same course as in a third level institution.  I am thinking of something like architecture being provided at Bolton Street and being provided in one of the university colleges.  There ought not be discrimination in favour of a university purely because it is a university.  There ought to be an equitable attitude and an equitable distribution of the resources. I welcome then the institution of what has been called a buffer between the the Department and the institution and also a negotiating body which can negotiate on behalf of all the bodies.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned both in the Dáil and in this House that the designation of institutions of higher education may be something which could be abused by a particular Minister for Education, which might not be sufficiently controlled under the wording of the Bill.  I am referring to the fact that under section 1, paragraph (c)</P>
    <P>an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designated by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Act</P>
    <P>shall come in under the Higher Education Authority.  I would agree with Senator Nash that surely this must be read with section 5 and that the Minister would only designate an institution of this sort after the groundwork had been done by An tÚdrás and after advice had come forth for the setting up of a new institution, or for the designation of an institution, and for legislation relating to that institution.  This might very well be legislation relating <Col N="899" /> to an existing third level institution to give it a greater degree of autonomy and again I would agree with Senator Horgan that the more of these third level institutions that can be brought under the umbrella of the Higher Education Authority the more there will be rationalisation, the more there will be a fair distribution of what cake there is and the more this will comply with the real needs of the community.</P>
    <P>I feel at this point that it is impossible to speak on the Second Reading of a Bill relating to higher education without at least a short reference to the original impetus to this rationalisation, that is the merger proposal, and particularly the merger proposal of the late Deputy O'Malley, the then Minister for Education.  I should like to go on the record of this House as being in opposition to this type of approach.  I think he had a problem in that academics are slow to come to a decision, are as slow to grasp reality as any other group and have a vested interest, in certain cases, in the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>At the same time, I think it was wrong for two reasons to propose a merger for the two Dublin universities. The first reason is that he was going to take them out of the context of the other university colleges in the country and, therefore, going to warp the university structure not on a rational basis but on a basis which no longer exists, the fact that there was a religious apartheid in Dublin.  Secondly, it was trying to introduce a global solution to a problem which could vary from faculty to faculty and from department to department.</P>
    <P>The great value of the merger idea, although the idea itself was very wrongly approached, is that it did create a climate of rationalisation, faculty by faculty and department by department.  This is the only way that you can have proper use of resources, that you can have a proper scheme to give the best of the institutions, the best of the manpower, the best of the facilities to the students and have the best working relationship between staff and students.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister was able to take a global decision of this <Col N="900" /> sort without consultation.  Here I must, as I did when Senator Kelly was speaking, affirm what he said in relation to the only department I can speak for, the law department in Trinity College.  Just as there was no consultation with the law faculty in UCD so there was no consultation with the law faculty in Trinity College.  I think one can generalise from this that there was not any prior consultation with the university departments.  I would ask the question whether the Minister would contemplate the merger of trade unions in this country or the merger of farming groups or some other radical change in a community without prior consultation with those who will have to implement it, carry it out and live with it.</P>
    <P>Although I am very strongly in favour of rationalisation, of self-criticism and of action within the university institutions to change some of their out-dated structure and to use their resources to the best of their ability, I do not think the global decision of the merger was a good idea.  I think it has meant that there has been a great deal of difficulty in arriving at a more acceptable solution and I do not think it has yet been reached in the TCD/UCD proposals.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill setting up the Higher Education Authority on the basis that I consider it to be purely a first step in rationalisation of the universities. I have no doubt that within a short period we must have before us more comprehensive legislation.  We must have legislation relating to the composition of the universities of the future.  I would hope we would have legislation embodying the institution of the conference of Irish universities which was recommended by the Commission on Higher Education and was also referred to in the TCD/NUI proposals.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in the light of the discussion which we have had here in the Seanad, and in the light of the views put forward, for a statement as to whether it is intended when legislation relating to the universities comes forward to combine this with the setting up of a conference of Irish universities.  I think this is a <Col N="901" /> matter of great interest and I think it is a matter on which he may be prepared to comment.</P>
    <P>This Bill, although it is welcome, is very limited.  It does not set up the conference of Irish universities and, therefore, allow for the academic coordinating system through this body. It also fails to create the substantial rationalisation of universities which is necessary, and it fails to clarify the left-over position of the merger.  The position, as I understand it at the moment, is that the ball is with the Higher Education Authority.  It is up to them to report to the Government on the TCD/NUI proposals.  I suspect that that report may be more than ready to come but is waiting for this Bill to go through before it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Moving on to the consideration of the Bill itself, I have already referred to the fact, and I hope again that the Minister might comment on this, that, as I see it, section 1, paragraph (c) and section 5 if they could be read together would remove a great deal of the controversy about this: that the Minister would only designate institutions of higher education once the section 5 machinery had been put in operation and once this recommendation came from the Higher Education Authority itself.  If this was seen to be part of the same scheme it would remove a good deal of the controversy about this.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general functions of the Higher Education Authority, Senator Kelly spoke about the possibility of adding a function relating to the absorption of graduates.  Whether or not it is actually spelled out in the Bill, I would support his idea that we must make some effort to face this problem of the expense of graduating for export, of educating for export, of sending our doctors and our engineers abroad, so that they are cheap professional people for other developed countries, particularly America.  We must think along these lines.</P>
    <P>I would say that if you are putting in a separate provision relating to the absorption of graduates you must combine with that career guidance for the schools.  The channelling must come at <Col N="902" /> both ends.  It makes sense if you have a sophisticated career guidance for the student going to a university or a third-level institution and then the study of the absorption of graduates at the other end.</P>
    <P>In relation to the financing, which has already been the matter of considerable debate in the Dáil, I would draw the attention of the Minister and the House to the memorandum sent to Senators by the Irish Federation of University Teachers with a proposal for an amendment.  If the amendment is not put forward by other Senators, I propose to put forward this amendment relating to section 12.  If I might quote very briefly from the memorandum:</P>
    <P>We recognise that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to decide on the total amount each year for higher education.  But if there are to be any reducations in the figure proposed initially by An tÚdarás, it must be the function of An tÚdarás itself to determine where and how the cutbacks will operate.  The Federation therefore recommends that section 12 (1) be amended by removing the phrase &ldquo;such amounts for institutions of higher education&rdquo; because of the inference that the Book of Estimates would include appropriations to each institution of higher education.</P>
    <P>Council feels that it is neither necessary nor desirable that details concerning the total sum made available should be included in the Book of Estimates.  These would be subject to scrutiny and debate in the annual report of the Authority which would have to be presented to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Irish Federation of University Teachers therefore recommends that section 12 (1) should be modified to read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be paid to An tÚdarás, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such an amount for higher education and research as may be approved of by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> If this proposition was acceptable to the Minister it would alleviate a lot of perhaps completely unjustified fears in the academic world and it would not take away the physical decision as to the financing from public funds of higher education which is very much the province and responsibility of the Minister.  It would allow for the decision as to the cutbacks to come from the body which had first recommended the payments from An tÚdarás, from the body which was expert in these matters.  I would also like to draw to the attention of the Minister the second recommendation in relation to section 12 regarding the distinction between capital expenditure and current expenditure. Again they recommend the distinction and recommend that section 12 (2) be amended to - read as follows:</P>
    <P>Any payment to an institution which An tÚdarás makes out of the amount it receives under the foregoing section shall, with respect to capital grants, be made in such manner and subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit.  Any payment for current expenditure shall be made in the form of block grants.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give a flexibility in relation to current expenditure. the amount to be determined and how it would be spent would be a matter for the autonomy of the university.  This distinction between capital and current expenditure is very good.</P>
    <P>Another point which I wish to make in relation to the composition of the Higher Education Authority, and on which I will be proposing an amendment, is in relation to something which was mentioned in the Dáil and which has been mentioned here.  It is a very retrograde and foolish step now to set up a Higher Education Authority, one of whose functions will be the democratisation of institutes of higher education, and not allow statutory student representation on this authority.  I propose to introduce an amendment that two students of institutes of higher education in this country be included in the Higher Education Authority.  I <Col N="904" /> have before me Volume 251, No. 7 of the Dáil Official Report, in which the Minister, in reply to the suggestion on Second Reading that students be included, said:</P>
    <P>I do not believe in appointing students simply because they are students.  I will do it only if it is clear to me that they have a contribution to offer.  The nature of the tasks allotted to An tÚdarás as well as its non-representative nature precludes the appointment of representative of the student body as such.  However, students are not ineligible for consideration. I have a feeling that the demand for such representation is based on a misconception.  An tÚdarás is not part of the university or the higher education structure.  It is a separate organisation set up for the specific purpose of giving independent advice to the Minister.  It is not an elected body. The members are appointed entirely on the basis of their expertise, their experience and their qualifications for the particular assignment.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests in that, that at some future time with the four places he would have open to him he might consider appointing a student.</P>
    <P>I put this point to the Minister very seriously, with a knowledge of the situation and the students' attitude towards the Higher Education Authority and the setting up of this institution, that the academic members on the Higher Education Authority are not representative of the academic world as such.  While the students would not be representative of the student world as such they would be persons who would have a knowledge of how these institutions were working, have the particular viewpoint which they would share with their fellow students or with their fellow academics.  They must be seen very much on the same basis as the academics.  They are the consumers of the university.  They are vitally concerned with it and if one could look to the existing institutions in Ireland, student representation has been a success in the faculties and in the departments of the university.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville Keery referred, from practical experience, to a committee in <Col N="905" /> Trinity College on which students are in the majority and he spoke greatly in favour of this participation and of the responsible way in which it was carried out.  The students would have a contribution to make on the structuring of institutions of higher education.  On the democratisation of the university they would have a valuable contribution to make and although a large part of the work of the Higher Education Authority will be financing for the future in which students might not have a particular expertise, nevertheless, in many of the functions of the Higher Education Authority they would.  Furthering the development of higher education, promoting an appreciation of the value of the higher education and research are all areas in which the viewpoint of the student is of interest, is of great validity and ought be included in the actual composition and the statutory structure of the authority.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not sufficient in 1971 for the Minister to give a vague assurance that at some future time he might co-opt a student on to the Higher Education Authority.  This is a foolish approach in light of the fact that the authority will have to gain stature in the community.  It is a tribute to the <i>ad hoc</i> body that they have gained a stature in the academic world.  They have gained a reputation for independence and autonomy from the Department of Education and this is both a tribute to the Higher Education Authority and to the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the authority are to have the functions we are giving them in this Bill and are to have the role in the university world and in the world of higher education which we are giving them they must be representative in the statutory sense.  They must have academic, non-academic and also student members. I shall be bringing in an amendment to include two student members. One student member is inhibited from putting forward a view, is lost around a table of senior and probably more knowledgeable people and two is a fairer number.  I would urge the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>I feel that one of the major problems which will face the Higher Education Authority, and on which they will have <Col N="906" /> to do serious work, is the allocation of places in higher education.  Each of the universities is having a problem; each is either limiting the number of places available in various faculties, is about to limit, or is thinking of limiting them in some of the larger departments. In relation to this, I should like to refer to section 13 of the Bill, which gives An tÚdarás the power to institute and conduct studies on such problems of higher education and research as they consider appropriate.  In connection with this, I should like to speak with the cap of a professor of law, to urge that the Higher Education Authority should bear high on their list the study of legal education.</P>
    <P>For a long time it has been impossible to get any rationalisation of legal education, which is a very important part of education.  It has been impossible to have a body which has the authority and the impartiality to satisfy the competing interests of the university law schools, and of the professional bodies, the Incorporated Law Society and the Benchers of Kings Inns.  This is a possible important function that the Higher Education Authority could have, to conduct an independent study of this, make recommendations which would be implemented, and have the authority to override, at times, the rather selfish interests of one group or another, and to rationalise and to make more equitable legal education in this country.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to agree with Senator Nash on section 13.  If he does not bring in an amendment to this effect, I shall do so, that in relation to the studies it conducts, An tÚdarás should be under a duty, and not merely have discretion, to publish the reports of such studies. There are too many bodies which can set up expensive research projects, expensive studies, and are under no duty to disclose.  Reports ought be published &mdash;the publication can even be rather limited&mdash;but there must be a duty to publish reports of such studies.  This ensures the completion of the studies and that there is a certain public scrutiny of the work that has been done.</P>
    <P>Any other remarks that I may have <Col N="907" /> on the details of the Bill will be better made on Committee Stage.  I favour the idea behind the Bill, for the reasons I have given, and I shall be bringing in amendments on the points that I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  Ó thús aimsire bhí dúil ag muintir na hÉireann sa léann mar thuig siad gurbh fhearrde é an duine an léann fiú amháin nuair nár chabhair ar bith é i ndul chun cinn sa saol.

      <P>Anois sa lá atá inniu ann, is féidir a rá go bhfuil oideachas saor in aisce ag na daltaí sna bunscoileanna agus sna scoileanna iar-bhunoideachais.  Nuair a thagaimíd go dtí oideachas ar an dtriú leibhéal ní féidir a rá go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh cé go bhfuil airgid an phobail á chaitheamh air.</P>
      <P>Many aspects of this Bill have been dealt with together with many aspects of higher education.  However, I should like to mention one particular point which has been dealt with mainly by Senator Brosnahan, the relationship between the first and second levels of education and the third level institutions. It is in relation to the third level colleges that I wish to make my contribution to this debate.  Due to the number of academics in the Seanad, the debate has tended to deal mostly with the universities but it is in third level colleges that teachers in primary-and post-primary education are trained and educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the report on teachers' education, published by An tÚdarás in September, 1970.  At the beginning of this there is a table which gives the figures for the number of students under training in various institutions and the output in 1970.  For primary teachers it was 574, for university courses it was 1,300; and for the other institutions it was 145.  It can be seen at once that there is a big imbalance <Col N="908" /> there.  There are 1,300 finishing with a higher diploma in education and 145 people qualified otherwise for posts for teaching in post-primary schools.  This is a big headache for everybody concerned.  As far as I can see, there is a surplus of people with a higher diploma, and a great dearth of teachers for other subjects.  This is something to which the Higher Education Authority will have to turn their minds in future.  We cannot go on churning out a surplus of people in one field, while there is a shortage in other sections.</P>
    <P>With regard to primary teachers' training, the report recommended a three-year course leading to a degree. In the training for primary teachers, the educational course and the teacher training is carried out simultaneously. I consider-this to be a better system than the system of the higher diploma in education where a person does a basic degree and then the higher diploma.</P>
    <P>The higher diploma in education has been much maligned.  On page 20 of the report, it states:</P>
    <P>We have been further told that, as a result of the various pressures of the course, good honours graduates in science and in arts are coming increasingly to choose immediate employment outside teaching, rather than face the present rigours of the additional year's training.</P>
    <P>It is a debatable point whether a year's training of that sort is the best type of preparation for teaching.  One of the big faults that was found with the higher diploma in the past was its lack of teacher training in the sense of lack of training on the job, that is lack of actual practice.  The idea put forward that a person attending university full time will have a better higher diploma in education than the person who is teaching during the day and attending lectures during the evening is a very debatable point.  There is a lot to be said for the other side.</P>
    <P>I do not think that people should be required to have a higher diploma in education as a qualification for secondary teaching, go to university for a <Col N="909" /> year's post-graduate studies and then be paid a pittance for this.  If the higher diploma is to be worthwhile, then the teachers who have it should be paid for it.  One of the things referred to in the report on page 16 is a very important point: the desirability of inter-changeability of teachers between the primary and post-primary sectors.  On this the report states:</P>
    <P>Our primary and post-primary system is highly compartmentalised. It takes no cognisance of the possibility that the university graduate might prefer to teach at primary level or that a training college graduate might show a preference for post-primary teaching.  We think that it would be highly desirable, from an educational point of view, to have the rigidity of the present system relaxed.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with that.  With all the talk we have had about parity it has been very difficult.  People have talked here on other matters, about putting the cart before the horse, but if we had uniformity or similarity in training courses it would be much easier to have parity of salary.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that at the moment relationships between the various branches of the teaching profession, both primary and post-primary, are very good indeed.  I hope that this will continue to be so.  Nothing would help it better than that there should be similarity of training courses.  I would make the plea that the people in the training colleges be given a degree at the end of their course.  The best natural asset that we have in this country is the brains of our people.  If we want these developed to their fullest capacity we must pay the people who do it.  We must pay our teachers and we must give them a first class education.  Nothing but the best is good enough for any section of our teachers.</P>
    <P>The fact that grants are paid to those attending universities and not to those who are called to training colleges has already been mentioned. There should be some harmonisation of these matters.  It could be done in two ways.  The grant scheme could be extended to cover those who go to <Col N="910" /> training colleges.  Other schemes could be extended as well.  Loans could be extended to those attending university. After all, the people in the universities are privileged people.  They have been referred to here as the consumer.  I do not know what they consume.  I know plenty of university students who consume various beverages but I do not think this is what is being referred to. A person who gets as far as university costs the State many hundreds of pounds irrespective of whether that student has a grant or not.  If he has a grant it is costing the State so much extra.  The national teacher pays back the money.  Senator Ahearn mentioned that he or she guarantees to teach for so many years and during that time repays the money.  On the other hand, the person who costs the State hundreds of pounds can leave the country.</P>
    <P>I was one of those people who, about 20 years ago, spent some time working in England and while there I saw Irish boys doing menial jobs, working on the buildings, in factories and shops during the summer holidays to earn enough money to go to college.  They did not feel that they were consumers.  They did not feel that anybody owed them a gift of university education.  We felt when we did this that we were still privileged that our brothers and sisters who were working as wage earners and paying tax were making a gift of university education to us.  I get annoyed at times when the notion is put forward that university students are privileged people.  They are privileged in the sense that when they are finished in the university they will be of the upper crust.  I get annoyed when I hear of the necessity for these people to be represented on everything.</P>
    <P>There is a further relationship between second and third level education. This concerns the content and standard of the courses, particularly the leaving certificate courses in our post-primary schools.  The leaving certificate, at the moment, has a two-fold nature.  It is a qualifying certificate for entry into the university; it is also a terminal certificate for the person who is finishing his formal education.  There is a conflict between these two.  This conflict requires to be resolved.  In the <Col N="911" /> past the universities have had too great an influence on the content of the courses for the leaving certificate, for example, the subject of Irish.</P>
    <P>We have been trying to turn out Irish scholars rather than Irish speakers because the universities require Irish scholars.  This has put a certain influence on the courses in the secondary school and even as far back as the national school.  Two-thirds of the people in the secondary schools will not go any further.  Surely, if the emphasis is to be on speaking Irish, particularly with regard to those who are doing the pass leaving certificate course, I would advocate giving the pass leaving certificate to the person who could prove he was proficient at speaking Irish.  Is this not what we want?</P>

      <Col N="912" /> Caithfidh mé filleadh ar an bhfocal seo &ldquo;dea-thoil&rdquo;.  Luaigh an Seanadóir Cranitch aréir an drochthoil i leith na Gaeilge atá le fáil in áiteanna áirithe i gcuid dár n-institiúidí ard-oideachais. Ba mhaith liom aontú leis sin.  Fiú amháin nuair nach mbíonn drochthoil i gceist, is minic gur cuma leis na h-iolscoileanna an Ghaeilge bheith ann nó as.  Mar adúirt an tAire sa Dáil, nuair a bhí sé ag caint ar an ábhar seo:</P>
    <P>If, in fact, we have failed in our efforts to revive the language&mdash;of course, I do not admit this&mdash;then the universities must bear a considerable share of the blame.  In my view the big mistake made in the efforts to revive the language was that we tended to ask the little children travelling the country roads to school to revive it while the universities, which might be expected to give the example in relation to the revival of the language which is the most important part of our national culture, did relatively little.</P>
    <P>Aontaíom leis an rud adúirt an tAire ansin.</P>
    <P>Má cheapann aon duine go bhfuil mise ag iarraidh gnó polaitíochta a dhéanamh de seo, ba maith liom a chur i gcuimhne do chuid de na daoine sa Fhreasúracht gur sa bhliain 1928 a chuireadh tús leis na hiarrachtaí i gColáiste na hOllscoile, Gaillimh agus gur deineadh togha oibre ansin.  Tagann daoine áirithe chun mo chuimhne ins na rudaí seo&mdash;an tOllamh Liam Ó Buachalla, a bhí ina Chathaoirleach anseo, daoine mar an tOllamh Liam Ó Briain agus mar sin, a rinne deaobair ar fad.</P>
    <P>Ní fheicim cén chaoi gur féidir le hÉireannach saor ar bith a rá go bhfuil oideachas ar bith aige mura mbíonn a theanga féin aige.  Tá dóchas agam nach ndéanfaidh an tÚdarás dearmad ar an ndualgas seo atá leagtha ortha i leith na Gaeilge.  Tá súil agam freisin nach mbeidh aon scéimeanna a bheidh ina leitscéal a chur ar siúl.  Is dóigh liom gurb é an rud a tharla i gcás na Gaillimhe gur thóg sé ualach mór ó choinsíos na ndaoine ins na hollscoileanna eile.  Dúradar leo féin &ldquo;Tá obair ar súil i nGaillimh. Dá bhrí sin, ní gádo Choláiste na <Col N="913" /> hOllscoile i mBaile Átha Cliath ná i gCorcaigh mórán a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge.&rdquo;  Tá súil agam nach dtarlóidh sé sin.</P>
    <P>Those people who spoke here have in the main been practitioners in the art of education, and most of their contributions have been constructive. One matter which was stressed here was communication.  All of us in the various branches of education have at one time or another criticised the Department of Education on this matter of communication and lack of communication, but there is a new element coming into this.  I do not know if I am quoting George Bernard Shaw correctly, but I think it was he who said &ldquo;Those who can, do, and those who cannot do, teach&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a new fellow who has come along and he is the fellow who cannot teach but who writes in the papers and calls himself an educational expert. This is the fellow who tells other people how to teach.  You would imagine that these people would be concerned with communication, but my experience of them is the very opposite.  I attended a meeting recently which was of vital concern to the communication of ideas by the Department with the all-important people, the teachers and the parents.  This meeting was held in my home town of Carrick-on-Shannon and I was present in a triple capacity, as a parent, as a teacher and as a public representative. The accounts of that meeting that appeared in the next day's papers bore no resemblance to reality at all.  If anybody doubts me, he can go down to the Library and get a copy of the <i>Irish Times</i> of the Saturday following the meeting, and a copy of the <i>Leitrim Observer,</i> the local paper, where every single word that was said was quoted, and let him make up his mind for himself.</P>
    <P>When I see people whose educational qualifications are to me rather suspect writing open letters in which they state that at five meetings not one person spoke in favour of the Minister's proposals, I wish that they kept their pens and their minds to themselves and not try to create heat and smoke where they should be creating light.  If we want to get anywhere in <Col N="914" /> education in these complex matters we should approach them in a spirit of goodwill, as I mentioned before.  We should approach them in a spirit of trying to resolve difficulties rather than trying to create them.  There are sufficient difficulties in education without people trying to come in and create more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that seeks to establish the means of attaining certain community objectives in regard to higher education.  In winding up for my party on this measure I want to discuss this under a number of headings.  Firstly, I should like to consider the need for An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas.  Secondly, I should like to discuss the status of An tÚdarás, thirdly, its functions, and, fourthly, more briefly, some matters in regard to its procedure so far as that is circumscribed by the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here, as has been said by many speakers in this debate, with a most important measure.  We are enacting legislation which brings on the Statute Book a new departure in regard to the organisation of third level education, a further important step in the carrying out of the duty that is laid on the State and the Oireachtas by the Constitution.  The Constitution tells us that &ldquo;the State shall provide free primary education... and, when the public good requires it, provide other educational facilities or institutions&rdquo;.  It is against that background that we must judge the provision of third level education.  When the public good requires it, when the State, the Government and the Oireachtas are so convinced then there is a constitutional duty to provide it.  The State, through the agency of the Government, and with the consent of the Oireachtas, have in recent years sought to extend widely the provision of education at different levels.  That initiative of the Government and consent of the Oireachtas has been a reflection of a shared opinion that the public good now requires the various measures which have been brought into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to some of these measures, for example the abolition of fees in post-primary education, it was easy <Col N="915" /> to get agreement and consent from all that the time had come, and in the opinion of many of us had long passed, when this particular step should be taken.  When we move into the sphere of higher education which, as has been said in the course of this debate, is first, for the relatively few and, secondly, involves far higher costs than education at primary or post-primary level, then indeed the whole situation becomes more complex.  The decision as to whether to move in one particular direction or another necessarily involves so great an expenditure of public funds, that it is, I think, compellingly necessary that this should be done not by the ordinary method&mdash;discussion within the Minister's Department and debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash;but that there should be special provisions for the tendering of objective advice to the Minister and ensuring that there are adequate consultations before such advice is tendered.  Therefore, we get the proposition which is before us today.  It has been said by a number of Senators, Senator Nash and Senator Mrs. Robinson, that this Bill to establish a Higher Education Authority arises primarily from the suggested merger of UCD and TCD. To make such a suggestion is unfair to the Commission for Higher Education which recommend certainly not an identical body but a similar one.  It is unfair to the Department to suggest that they would not have proposed the setting up of such a body were it not for the particular problem posed by the university situation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Senator McElgunn, who has just spoken, has commented on the fact that a great deal of the debate has been concerned not with third level education in general but more particularly in regard to third level education as represented by university education.  He attributes this to the fact that there are many Members of this House who are concerned with university education, but I think there are other reasons.  It is because there are more difficulties in regard to university education, some of them arising from the fact that there are a number of existing institutions in this field, but also others due to the fact that, of their nature, such bodies <Col N="916" /> do give rise to peculiar problems of their own.</P>
    <P>The central problem inevitably was touched on again and again in the debate.  I am sorry that I find it necessary, as an a academic, to return to this problem of university autonomy.  It has been mentioned repeatedly throughout the debate but still I do not think that it has been adequately discussed.  The discussion in this debate in regard to university autonomy has at times been very simplistic in manner.  There has been too little realisation that one cannot deal with this idea of university autonomy as a single item.  There are many aspects of it and the varying aspects have to be taken into account. It is inevitable that such a discussion should arise in a debate of this type because the proposal which the Minister has put before us is one aimed at the solution of the crucial problem of the harmonisation of university autonomy and of university accountability. It is common cause that university autonomy is something that should be respected and continued if at all possible. It is also common cause that under our present conditions of high State support for university activity some university accountability is an absolute essential.</P>
    <P>To follow the order which I indicated, I should like to talk first on the question of the need for An tÚdarás. There can be no doubt that there is a need for some new departure, some new structure.  We would all agree that the present system in regard to the financial review of university expenditure is unsatisfactory.  There are some very obvious defects: the historical and long-continued division of university financing between separate Government Departments, the fact that faculties, which are integral parts of University College, Cork and Dublin, are still financed separately through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, whereas the remaining faculties are dealt with through the Department of Education.  May I say they are financed rather more generously so that, for example, when I was in University College, Cork, if a book was not available in the Engineering Library, because we could not afford it, we <Col N="917" /> were quite liable to find this expensive special book in the Library of the Faculty of Agriculture.  However, these are defects which could be easily remedied without a wholesale reorganisation.</P>
    <P>The real problem lies deeper.  The problem is, I think, essentially the separation&mdash;the divorce&mdash;between financial control and the planning function in regard to higher education. Unless this is cured, and unless we can overcome the consequences of this divorce, we will continue to have serious anomalies and severe frustration in the operation of our system of higher education.  I feel that the only possible solution&mdash;of course it is the solution which the Minister has proposed to us here this evening-is to unite many of the functions of financial control and of long-term overall planning in one body.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider now this might be done there are only relatively few alternatives.  The State now exercises financial control; it could be given the complete planning control at the cost of the loss of a good deal of their individual freedom by the universities. Alternatively&mdash;I am not suggesting that it is a serious possibility&mdash;the universities could be made completely independent financially.  The third course open, and the one that the Minister suggests, the course that is agreed to by all the House, is that a great deal of the more important decisions with regard to these two functions which should be united, should be given to a body which would be a buffer between the Government and the university.  Perhaps that is a bad image, a bad metaphor to use.  It seems to indicate, perhaps, that the universities and the Department are a pair of warring dogs that have to be separated in some way.  This, indeed, is not the truth.</P>
    <P>Rather is it the position that if such an intermediate body is proposed it will be a body which is wholly devoted towards this particular problem.  It will not have the further preoccupation of the Department regarding the remainder of its work, nor the further preoccupation of universities and other bodies of higher education in regard to the actual execution of their work.  I <Col N="918" /> say that to give financial control to the universities, in addition to the control of planning they have at the moment, is an alternative which I mention only to be dismissed.  This is something which I do not think has ever been claimed for the universities. It has been suggested occasionally that some academics would wish to have this solution, would seek what, in effect, would be a right of taxation on behalf of the universities.  Let us be clear that no responsible person is advocating this solution.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the solution of passing the problem of the academic planning of the universities to the State. All we can say about this method is that in those countries where is has been tried&mdash;and examples can be given&mdash;it has had the most disastrous results.  I think we can take the situation of France as being the typical example.  Coming down from the Napoleonic reforms of education we have the great example of a centralised educational system.  It has been said by French academics with a wry smile that so closely were the regulations laid down that, in fact, there is almost a regulation on the number of jokes per lecture appropriate to the various courses.</P>
    <P>What has this led to in this particular system?  First, it has led to an elitism of a kind which I think would not be acceptable to the people of this country.  It has led to a fierceness of competition for entry to the Grande École and to the universities of higher reputation.  It has led in the remaining universities and in the regional universities to a degree of specialisation which goes very far beyond the desire of anyone in this country for co-ordination and promotion of centers of excellence.  Even if one can say that that is the elitism which gives rise to the polytechnician and the other products of the French schools, where one must study for two or three years after matriculation in order to gain entry, even if we accept that there are merits in this, we can see the danger in this approach when we remember that it was this system of higher education that finally erupted in the explosion that toppled the apparently untoppleable General de Gaulle.  If we followed <Col N="919" /> this particular route we would be doing something which is against our national characteristics.</P>
    <P>If we look at the Report of the Commission on Higher Education we see a description of our existing position. It is worthwhile looking back at that if only briefly.  In one sense things have moved rapidly, in another sense they have moved hardly at all in the sphere of higher education since the publication of that report.  In chapter 3 of that report we can read an account and also a criticism of the situation which existed at the time when the commission reported and which still exists.  I do not propose to quote from it further than to read the headings of the different paragraphs.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 3.8 we have the heading &ldquo;State not Planning Authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In paragraphs 3.9 and 3.10 the headings &ldquo;State and Institutions of Higher Education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 3.11 &ldquo;Existing Consultation Insufficient&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 3.12 &ldquo;Under-development of Higher Education outside the University&rdquo;, and so on.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 3.13 &ldquo;Demands on the University&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the situation which we face.</P>
    <P>In chapter 18 of this same report we have the views of the Commission on Higher Education on how this might be remedied.  Here we get a clear rejection of the solution of State planning. If I could quote briefly here from paragraph 21 of chapter 18, we have here in the report of the commission what might well be the basis for what has to be done under this particular Bill.  It says:</P>
    <P>In chapter 3 which contains our assessment of the present position we have suggested the State cannot be regarded as a planning authority in higher education nor does the State so regard itself.  The financial consultations which take place between the institutions and the State cannot be regarded as a planning process. The State must obviously be the ultimate authority for deciding the amount of public resources to be <Col N="920" /> devoted to higher education.  In our view, however, the State can, only to a limited extent, determine how these resources should be utilised.</P>
    <P>At this stage of the debate I do not want to delay unduly on these particular points.  By introducing this Bill, the Minister has acknowledged that the proper solution is one which will give us a body which will stand between the two parties involved&mdash;a two-headed Janus that will look both towards the Department and towards the institutions of higher education.</P>
    <P>This solution, of course, is one which has cropped up again and again in discussion over the years.  When it does so, we always look to the headline of the University Grants Committee. This was set up in Britain in order to co-ordinate university finance. When founded, the University Grants Committee was a fine old British compromise. It is interesting, when we are now discussing this particular Bill, to realise that that particular fine old British compromise has crumbled somewhat in the last few years.</P>
    <P>The University Grants Committee in Britain operated with the Treasury under a sort of gentleman's agreement. We know that in respect of such gentlemen's agreements and even economics agreements like the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, that when they are in trouble gentlemen do not always keep their agreements.  Since its inception, this compromise, the formation of a University Grants Committee, became a headline throughout the world, but has itself now fallen on somewhat evil days in the country of its origin.</P>
    <P>On one occasion, I think it is some six years ago now, the British Government made a unilateral decision over the heads of the University Grants Committee that the fees of all foreign students in Britain should be raised by a considerable amount.  There was there a crisis of confidence and the beginning of the decline of the University Grants Committee.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that only four universities in Britain refused to accept that dictate from the Treasury.  They were Oxford and Cambridge.  who have long <Col N="921" /> had the habit of saying they would rather have their freedom than the money.  The third was the relatively new University of Bradford.  It is perhaps significant for us that the fourth was the Queen's University of Belfast.</P>
    <P>These institutions actually suffered financially because they considered it inappropriate to accept this particular dictate from a Government Department. This is interesting when we consider that the Commission on Higher Education recommended specifically in its report that what we wanted in this country was something more than a University Grants Committee.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has brought in here&mdash;and he is to be commended for doing this&mdash;is something decidedly more than a University Grants Committee. He has given here, as was recommended by the Commission on Higher Education, an authority which, first, is statutory and, secondly, to a great extent, is executive as well as advisory in its functions.  I should like to say that in doing so the Minister has done the right thing.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the day will come when the Minister or his successors will regret that this was done.  In the short term the crisis will come, as it came in the British Treasury, when the Minister or his successors will have to stand up in public and say: &ldquo;Even though there is this published recommendation of An tÚdarás um Ard Oideachais, I cannot meet the bill.&rdquo; I should like to say to the Minister that even though he may have created for himself, or for his successors, embarrassments in the short run, in making this body more substantial than the University Grants Committee, he has done something which will have real benefit in the long run, which year in and year out will give benefits which will more than compensate for the temporary and short-lived embarrassment.</P>
    <P>This leads me on to the second point which I wanted to discuss, the question of the status of the authority which is now proposed to be set up.  Here we come right into the question of autonomy and academic freedom which many Members, quite rightly, feel seems to be a favourable topic of conversation <Col N="922" /> or of lecturing by academics of various sorts.</P>
    <P>In the beginning I mentioned that this was a complex subject.  There are a few points I should like to make in regard to it here because the status of An tÚdarás, as provided for in this Bill, is very relevant to this problem.</P>
    <P>When we come to talk about academic freedom or autonomy I think we should straight away distinguish between two types of academic freedom. We will not get far in debate or have any great agreement in regard to it unless we recognise this distinction: first, individual academic freedom and, secondly, institutional academic freedom.  Both of these have been discussed in the course of the present debate.</P>
    <P>Individual academic freedom is something which is not as important as institutional autonomy in regard to what we are concerned with here in the setting up of this body but, nevertheless, it is well, just in passing, to mention what it entails.  In this respect the academic looks firstly for certain rights that every citizen looks for: absence of discrimination in regard to his appointment, his retention in employment and the carrying out of his duties.  There are some other freedoms which he claims as being essential to the proper carrying out of his duties: the right to teach according to his individual concept of what is true and what is relevant rather than an obligation to teach according to a formula or an ideology which is imposed upon him.  He claims the right to publish the results of his study and research.  He claims the right, subject to the other requirements of his employment, to pursue his personal studies and his research in the directions of his choice.  Now the true academic does not include, in his claim to individual academic freedom, any claim to opt out of common burdens, whether those are the burdens of the community at large or the burdens of his academic community.  Academic freedom does, however, include the right to some participation in the policy formation of his academic community.</P>
    <P>If we turn to institutional academic <Col N="923" /> freedom, the matter becomes more complex and more subject to misunderstanding. In this regard I would like to distinguish between two groups of issues in regard to institutional academic freedom.  First, a group in regard to which academics will strive to the end to maintain their own control and, secondly, a group which academics feel should be under their control but which they would be happy to exercise in co-operation with others.  In regard to institutional autonomy, academic institutions claim the right to control of appointments to their own institutions. They claim control over curricula and standards.  Academics will struggle to the end to maintain control on these two issues.  Many of us in academic life would leave it, or leave the country were this battle lost, rather than continue to operate under conditions which we would hold to be incompatible with our calling.</P>
    <P>However, when we go beyond these two we come into areas where the academic community as a whole is not so rigid.  It may be easy to point to individual academics who will take a rigid line on almost any subject, but taken by and large there are a number of issues on which the academic community feels it just would not be for their benefit but for the public benefit if control were largely within their hands.  As I have mentioned before, these are issues over which most academics realise that it is not possible in this day and age for an individual academic institutions to have complete and untrammelled control.</P>
    <P>I list four of these other issues here: first, the admission of students; secondly, the balance between teaching and research; thirdly, the freedom of development in regard to the size of the institution and in regard to its specialities.  The fourth is in regard to questions of salaries and staffing.  While there have been times in the past in which institutions have claimed that these matters are necessarily a matter of institutional autonomy which must not be tampered with, I think we would find today that most academics would not look on these matters as issues on which there can be no accommodation. In particular I feel that the <Col N="924" /> various institutions which have autonomy in the country at the moment would be prepared to replace the autonomy of the individual institution in regard to these matters by a group autonomy which might be exercised through a body such as the conference of Irish Universities, whether this be on a statutory or an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>While I say that these are issues which the academic would not consider crucial in the sense that he would consider if they were lost or shared that there would be and end to academic life as we know it, nevertheless they are important.  What is the case for autonomy for bodies of higher education? The case is not that this is an inherited privilege which should not be removed, that it is a natural right which should not be interfered with. The case for individual academic fredom, the case for institutional autonomy, made by academics at this time in this country, is that autonomy in these matters is a prerequisite for the good performance of their function.  It is not that they themselves as individuals would be better off or are better off because of these conditions but rather that their institutions are better institutions for these freedoms, that their contribution to the general good is a more valuable good because of such autonomy.</P>
    <P>Autonomy of university institutions has varied from age to age and from place to place.  If we look back we can see tremendous variations in this regard.  When we come to discuss the whole future of third level education we may think that we are talking about something new but if we really look at the history of these institutions we will find there is little new indeed. We have talked in this debate and we will talk again on Committee Stage about student participation and democratisation. Yet in the University of Bologna in the 13th and 14th centuries the university was run by the students and not by the masters as were Oxford, Cambridge and Paris.  The running of a university committee by a student majority, which Senator Keery talked about, is not a matter that belongs only to the 20th Century.</P>
    <P>Also we may look at the question mentioned in section 3 of this Bill in <Col N="925" /> regard to equality of opportunity.  We can look back in history and see times and countries where there was a greater equality of opportunity in regard to university education than we have today.  The Americans who adopted the idea of working your way through college in an effort to promote equality of opportunity, were following the path of those who worked their way through college in Elizabethan England.  To return to this question of the case for autonomy, the case is that, given these particular conditions, a better job will be done.</P>
    <P>Apart from a few short periods I have held only three jobs in my life for any considerable length of time. I worked for three years in the Civil Service.  I worked for 12 years in a semi-State body and I have worked for 12 years in the university.  The degree of autonomy was somewhat different in all three cases.  I can say that I worked far harder when employed by a semi-State body than when I was employed in the Civil Service. I now work immeasurably harder as an academic than I did in the other two cases.  The conditions of academic employment are such that if I wished it, or if any academic wished it, he could make this job one of the softest on earth.  The fact of the matter is that they do not.</P>
    <P>Academics, given this particular freedom, tend to work considerably harder than they would in the absence of such freedom.  Senator Kelly said at an early stage in this debate that it is quite easy to point to individuals who take advantage of the system.  I do not think it is quite so easy.  I do not know of any in my own department and I do not know any in the School of Engineering in University College, Dublin.  I am quite sure there may be, well hidden somewhere, individuals who take advantage of this situation.</P>
    <P>If an academic has been chosen for his knowledge, ability and, above all, his enthusiasm for his particular subject, then the conditions of employment are such that he will devote all his time to his subject which is his job. When Senator Kelly was speaking in this debate about the quality of life <Col N="926" /> Senator Ó Maoláin interjected to ask who worked in this country more than 60 hours per week.  I think Senator Jessop will agree with me that many heads of university departments do. There is no question about this.  The conditions are such that the job could be one of the softest but, because of the nature of the individuals who seek this particular life, who are appointed to it by their peers, the level of work is far higher than in comparable employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in a number of countries the contrast between the amount of work put in by those who work on research within the university and those who work on research in research institutes. The difference is sometimes startling.  The fact that some may take advantage of the conditions in the universities is more than outweighed by those who respond to the particular system in the way I have described.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have spoken too long on this topic but I feel that there has been certain misunderstandings in the course of the debate.  I will turn to the other side of the problem.  I said that what we were concerned with here was harmonisation of university autonomy with university accountability.  Let us be quite clear that the allocation of substantial funds from State sources to the universities involved the question of accountability and this is not challenged.  We can read this in our own Commission on Higher Education or in the Robbins Report which I think express it rather well.  I quote from paragraph 725:</P>
    <P>It is recognised that subvention involves allocation and that allocation may involve co-ordination and certain controls.  It is not felt that such measures need be an improper encroachment on legitimate academic freedoms.</P>
    <P>Because I share the views expressed in the Robbins Report I am perfectly happy to support this Bill.  It is the need for co-ordination which gives rise to this particular need and the body such as the Minister suggests here is an appropriate one.  There is need for co-ordination on these areas which I mentioned which have traditionally <Col N="927" /> been part of the institutional autonomy of the universities but which, in the conditions of our country and our time, need co-ordination.  There is a need for co-ordination on admissions.  There is a need for co-ordination on areas of research.  There is need for co-ordination on areas of development.  There is need for co-ordination on staffing.  To a large extent this co-ordination could be done by the institutions themselves coming together either on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis or coming together in some form such as a conference of Irish universities. While this would go a great way towards solving the problem it would not go far enough.  What we need is somebody who can complete this co-ordination, can examine the proposals of the institutions themselves, and present to the Minister the results of this co-ordination.</P>
    <P>We come to the question of who should best do this?  There is no doubt whatsoever that if the universities are asked who is the best judge of what should be done in regard to admissions, staffing and research in development areas, they will say: &ldquo;Ourselves, of course.&rdquo;  If the Minister's Department are asked who are the best judges of this, they too will answer: &ldquo;Ourselves, of course.&rdquo;  What we are setting up here is a body to whom we will entrust this task and of such a nature that it will have the confidence both of the universities and of those responsible for the ultimate provision of the moneys.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in regard to this problem is the nature of education itself.  Education is not a commodity. Senator McElgunn earlier made a comment on the fact that someone had mentioned that those undergoing higher education were consuming something. He took exception to this, and I think rightly so.  Education is not a commodity. One of the difficulties about it is, in fact, that we cannot judge it like a commodity.  I should like to quote here from a school-master&mdash;a schoolmaster who wrote some 100 years ago. I should like to quote from Dr. Arnold who said:</P>
    <P>The mass of mankind know good butter from bad and tainted meat <Col N="928" /> from fresh&mdash;and the principle of supply and demand may perhaps be relied on to give us sound meat and butter, but the mass of mankind do not so well know what distinguishes good teaching and training from bad. They do not here know what they ought to demand and, therefore, the demand cannot be relied upon to give the right supply.</P>
    <P>I think we have been guilty in the past of relying on the market forces in education to give us the right equilibrium. I think most of what has been said in the course of this debate about the excesses and deficiencies in different areas of training arises from an undue reliance on the uncontrolled operation of supply and demand.  It is necessary that there should be real planning.  It is necessary that there must be somebody somewhere in the system which is given by the Department the power to plan to the extent necessary&mdash;but no more than what is required&mdash;in this respect.  For such a body to be accepted by the institutions of higher education, who have previously done their own planning on a small scale, it is necessary that this body be of a particular type.</P>
    <P>If An tÚdarás um Ard Oideachas were an academic body and a truly autonomous body, individual institutions would be very much less fearful of the effect on their autonomy of the institution of the authority.  If, at the same time, there were established either statutorily or non-statutorily a conference or a council of Irish universities, I think many of the fears and the criticisms that have been heard might not have been so many or so loud, because even with the institution of An tÚdarás there still is some need for the co-ordination of the universities themselves. Such co-ordination as now exists&mdash;and it has been mentioned during the debate that there has been increased co-ordination&mdash;is on the basis of personal relationships and <i>ad hoc</i> meetings.  I think that if in the future there was a co-ordination along the lines which the Commission on Higher Education recommended, in which there would be regular meetings but not necessarily of the same persons, which would be in each case not <i>ad</i><Col N="929" /><i>hoc</i> but <i>ad rem</i>, this would be a sound development.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear from some remarks the Minister made in the Dáil that he is less than enchanted with the idea of a conference of Irish universities, particularly on a statutory basis.  I must say one must sympathise with his attitude in this regard.  Nevertheless, I would hope that there is nothing in this Bill which would prevent the universities acting in a co-ordinated manner.  I should like to ask the Minister if he could give that assurance.  The Bill is written in terms of An tÚdarás dealing all the time with individual institutions. I would ask the Minister if he could give us a guarantee that the drafting of the Bill is not such that it would preclude the dealings between An tÚdarás and a non-statutory body which would speak for some or all of our institutes of higher education.</P>
    <P>I should now like to pass to the third topic which I mentioned, namely the functions of the Higher Education Authority.  While we will be dealing with these in detail on the Committee Stage of the Bill, nevertheless there are some points that I should like to bring forward at this stage.  Looking at section 3 it is interesting to note how inter-related the various general functions of An tÚdarás are.  If we look at section 3 we find that the first general function is the furthering of the development of higher education.  As we know, you will go no distance in the furthering of higher education under our present conditions without a substantial investment of moneys and a substantial increase in the current expenditure of the various institutions concerned.  We are led immediately to the question of the amount of this investment and its co-ordination, which is the second general function which we have here in section 3.</P>
    <P>As is already evident from the report of the Higher Education Authority, which we are discussing this evening, the amounts are going to be considerable. There is going to be a necessity for higher taxation in order to support this further development of higher education.  If this is to be acceptable to the community in general there must be a promotion of the appreciation of <Col N="930" /> the value of higher education and research from the point of view of the community.</P>
    <P>As Senator Nash indicated, this particular general function has also the meaning of promoting the attainment and the appreciation of the value of higher education from the point of view of the individual.</P>
    <P>Senator Desmond in the course of her contribution said that she thought that it would not be possible to promote an appreciation of the value of higher education until such time as there had been an attainment of a further degree of equality of opportunity and equality of participation.  I am inclined to reverse these two.  I am inclined to say that we will never get a participation from certain sectors of our community in higher education until there has been a furtherance of an appreciation of the value of higher education to the individual.  There is no doubt whatsoever and all investigations have upheld the hypothesis that the major factor in determining career choice, in determining decisions about further education, comes not from school, not from television, not from career guidance but from the family itself.  Even in the countries where career guidance is highly developed the family attitudes are the prime determinant in regard to choice of courses in school and choice of vocation. Until such appreciation becomes widespread we will not get equalisation of participation in higher education. It is quite obvious that in regard to this there is a long haul ahead of us.</P>
    <P>The final general function in regard to democratisation has been the subject of comment and undoubtedly will be the subject of debate during the Committee Stage.  I join with Senator Nash in thinking that the word is, perhaps, an unfortunate choice, particularly if we intend to interpret this as bringing into the university at every level some sort of idea such as &ldquo;one man, one vote&rdquo;.  What we are looking for in all of our educational system and in particular in many areas of higher education is a question of participation rather than any sense of voting rights or voting powers.  It is this idea of participation that we require. <Col N="931" /> In fairness to our institutions of higher education, they have started at the right level in dealing with this problem. Participation at departmental level and faculty level is far more important for the student body and staff than participation at governing body level or at Higher Education Authority level.</P>
    <P>We have in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill the powers of this particular body to advise the Minister.  It has been pointed out here repeatedly during the debate that there are disharmonies between the demand and supply of students.  It is most appropriate that in section 6 An tÚdarás should be obliged to maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education, because, as has been pointed out, these are not always the same thing under the conditions of higher education in this country at this time now.  We have demands which come from individuals, demands arising from their wish for self-fulfilment. On the other hand we have certain need of the community and what we need above all here is some guidance which will attempt to bring the demand for education on the part of the individual and the need of the community more closely into harmony.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of the functions of An tÚdarás, I would like to advert to a point which was raised by Senator Jessop, and that was the position in regard to research.  We have throughout this Bill a reference to higher education.  We have in section 3 (a) the general function of An tÚdarás to further the development of higher education.  Under 3 (c) it is to be concerned with the promoting of appreciation of the value of higher education and research.  I should like to ask the Minister specifically for an assurance in this regard.  Reading these two together, parts of the same section 3 of the Bill, one might be forgiven for saying that An tÚdarás should be concerned with promoting an appreciation of two things&mdash;higher education and research&mdash;but should be concerned only with the provision of one, higher education.</P>
    <P>Whereas there are certain areas of <Col N="932" /> research which are best done outside institutions of higher education, there are many types of research which are, firstly, most efficiently done within institutions of higher education and, secondly, whose presence within these institutions is necessary for the maintenance of an efficient level of teaching. It would be quite easy to justify the inclusion of pedagogical or didactic research such as occurs in the training of people in their immediate post-primary degree years.  A person studying for a master's degree in arts and science is an apprentice in research and this should be counted part of education.</P>
    <P>What about the further research? What about post-doctorate research and staff research?  I would ask the Minister for an assurance that the unhappy wording of these paragraphs in section 3 could not be used in the future in order to remove from the universities such research as is there.  I acknowledge that in regard to oriented research and applied research, there may be a need for co-ordination between the work of the universities and the work in other institutes.  In regard to didactic research, basic research and non-oriented research these are the concern of the university.</P>
    <P>We, in this country, have a bad record in this regard.  It is this which gives rise to anxiety.  We had in the past the removal from our universities of certain areas of research.  I was sorry to hear Senator Jessop talk in this debate of fourth level education, because I am afraid that the fourth level education and the fourth level research might be removed from our third level institutions as it was in the case of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies many years ago.  In regard to research in agriculture we also had a tendency to starve the universities of research opportunities and facilities in favour of An Foras Talúntais.  I have a very definite anxiety in this particular regard.</P>
    <P>Returning to higher education as such, it has many objectives: the advancement of learning itself; the formation of general skills; the formation of special skills and the final one of providing an intellectual witness in the <Col N="933" /> community.  We are in trouble here because the demand to be trained in special skills is, in some instances, greater than our special needs.  If I may revert for a moment to my own particular concern in university education, I should like to rebut the suggestion made in the course of this debate that most engineers in this country are educated for export.  In civil engineering the position has been, for many years past, that any graduate in civil engineering who wishes to obtain a job in Ireland has no difficulty in finding one.  Nevertheless, many of them do seek their first jobs abroad. Of those who do virtually all of them return again and are able, having been abroad, with their greater experience to make a better contribution to their own country.</P>
    <P>While speaking of this I should like to refer to the point which was mentioned by Senator Honan, and mentioned also by Senator Brugha, that the ratio, as they described it, of academic to vocational training as given in OECD statistics would indicate that we are out of line with other European countries.  In this regard I might say that, while the ratio is out of line, let us be clear in regard to comparison of the figures themselves.  The ratio is not out of line because we are producing too many professional engineers in this country, but rather is completely due to the fact that we are producing too few technicians.  The number of professional engineers that we are producing in this country is in line with the number in relation to population which is produced in the other countries of Europe.  Where we are completely and absolutely deficient is in regard to the provision of technicians at all levels.</P>
    <P>Because Senator Honan spoke of professions that are able to look after themselves on graduation, I might say that the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, which is the professional body catering for the engineers, has cooperated with the Department of Education to the best of its ability in regard to technician training.  The prime problem in regard to technicians in this country is not only the question of training them but it is a question of <Col N="934" /> social status.  Until the whole community in this country recognises that the technician has a very real and special contribution to make to the development of the country we will not be able to afford such people the social status that is their due and we will not be able to attract young people into this type of work.</P>
    <P>I might say that the Institution of Engineers of Ireland has for the past ten years been endeavouring to correct this, making its views known where appropriate.  It has done more than that: the Institution of Engineers has admitted to membership of the institution those who are fully trained as technicians according to modern standards. The position is that those who now graduate from the new technician courses in Bolton Street and Kevin Street, which are approved of by the Department and monitored by extern examiners appointed by the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, receive their diplomas from the president of that Institution.  The profession here is conscious of what is required and there is certainly no attempt on the part of the professional engineers to promote their own interests as against those of technicians.</P>
    <P>The lack of harmony between supply and demand was mentioned by a large number of Senators.  Senator Kelly mentioned that the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary had, a few weeks ago, talked of the large numbers of those who came out with the higher diploma last year.  It was mentioned in the debate that of course these were people who had come into the university several years before.  Deputy Michael O'Kennedy as Parliamentary Secretary worried about this particular point, but Senator Michael O'Kennedy, speaking in the Seanad in January, 1968, when these people of whom he is now talking were already in the university, had this to say, and I quote from column 634 of Volume 64 of the Seanad Debates:</P>
    <P>The increase which we note in the numbers who are attending universities, and which it is anticipated will continue, is very encouraging.</P>
    <P>Here we have the dilemma that we all &mdash;and I do not wish to pick on the <Col N="935" /> Parliamentary Secretary in this instance &mdash;were glad to see the increasing numbers coming into the universities.  We failed to anticipate the extent of the problem to which this would give rise.</P>
    <P>This is a peculiarly difficult problem. We are going to graduate large numbers this June.  Many of them are going to find it difficult to get jobs.  What are many of them going to do?  They are going to do what the Americans did during the depression.  The first great rise in post-graduate education in America occurred during the depression because people could not get jobs. We are going to find more people coming back to do post-graduate courses in the universities because of the difficulty of getting employment.  Next year we are going to have people still more highly trained, and let us hope that they manage to get more employment of some type then.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash did not seem to be worried about this particular problem and he said that the people who went to the university were going there, I think his words were &ldquo;for a way of life rather than a living&rdquo;.  I do not think this is true, and I do not think it has ever been true.  I should like in rebuttal of this to quote from a person who certainly can be described as intellectual, but he was an intellectual who lived so long ago that I think there is no harm in quoting him.  His aphorisms have come down and been quoted through the centuries as examples of wisdom.  So I quote from the Analects of Confucius that he doubted if any man had ever studied for three years without the hope of financial reward.  That was apparently true in the days of Confucius and I think it is still true today.  I do not believe our students go to university for love of learning.  We hope that some of it may rub off on them during that period, but the position is that our students go to the university in order to make a better career for themselves. The vast majority of students have done this down through the centuries and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>There are many points in regard to the functions of the Authority in regard to its procedures, but at this stage <Col N="936" /> of the debate these are better left for a later discussion.  I should like, before concluding, to refer to a few of them because they are ones which I think will come up for substantial debate during the Committee Stage.  Firstly, there is this question of equality of opportunity.  I should like to say in regard to this that here again we have a word that can mean so many different things.  In one sense we have always had equality of opportunity and in another we will never have equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>Let me explain what I mean by this. In the old system, under which many of us went to the university, there was equality of opportunity in the sense that many of us went to the university on open scholarships.  But we had here open competition and this was equality of opportunity in a sense.  This indeed managed to bring many people to university who would not otherwise have gone there.  This is true of other institutions of higher education like our colleges of technology.</P>
    <P>We now have a new meaning of equality of opportunity where anybody who gets two or three honours, depending on the institution, is admitted to the institution and anybody who gets four honours is supported by the Department.  This is a move towards greater equality of opportunity.  But already we have people talking in other countries that equality of opportunity is not met by this. If you start talking, as some people have talked in this debate, about the right of the individual to the realisation of his potential, then you get to the position of saying that equality of opportunity is only fully met when every individual in the community has been developed in some particular institution of higher level education to the absolute limit of his ability.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it that we are not at the stage when we can afford or nearly afford equality of opportunity of this particular type.  But there is one particular matter in regard to equality of opportunity and this is a distortion of the distribution of students in regard to family origin.  We have all read accounts of this whereby the middle class in particular are over-represented <Col N="937" /> in the university compared with the community itself.  We tend to feel that this is something we should be ashamed of in this country.</P>
    <P>It is a world wide phenomenon.  In Britain, which now has had 25 years since the Butler Education Act, the position is still the same.  The position is that partly because of economic factors, but more largely because of parental attitude, education at the university is not as valued among certain families as others.  This will continue to be a factor down through the years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Authority itself, there are just a few points that I would like to raise at this stage and ask the Minister if he could perhaps answer a few questions.  There has been some discussion about the position of the chairman but I would like to ask the Minister whether it is the intention that the chairman of An tÚdaras should be full-time or should be part-time or whether this is being left completely open.  I would like to ask him if in the event of the chairman being on a full-time or substantially full-time basis, whether it might not be more appropriate that he should have a salary rather than allowances.  Thirdly, I would like to ask him if, in the event of at any time the chairman of An tÚdarás being full-time, any provision can be made under this Act for transfer of pension rights and the granting of pension rights or whether this would have to be the subject of special personal legislation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the members, there are a number of points that will certainly arise.  Senator Nash, in the course of this debate, was rather critical of those Senators who were unhappy about the question of the removal of a member.  He seems to feel that it is perfectly proper that the Minister should remove a member who has shown himself continually to be non-objective, continually unreasonable or who showed himself to be unbalanced.  If the Minister is foolish enough to appoint to the Authority a person who, within five years, becomes so non-objective, so unreasonable, and so unbalanced as to be a hindrance to the operation of the Authority, indeed it is the power of <Col N="938" /> the Minister's appointment rather than the power of removal which should be called into question.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the definition of academic member, Senator Nash seemed to think that this was a niggling thought but I am not sure that there is not a point here which is worthy of debate.  As drafted, it would appear that so long as a person spends any part of his time in an academic position this is sufficient to qualify him as an academic member. Now there are many person who hold part-time positions in the universities. I would like to suggest that there are some of these people&mdash;I stress some and not all&mdash;who are quite unsuited to represent, even indirectly, the academic community in this Authority.  There is a grave misunderstanding about the function of academics and it is reflected here.  A person who walks into the university and gives a certain number of lectures and walks out again does not know what goes on inside a university in the same way as a full-time staff member.</P>
    <P>The duty of those of us who hold full-time positions in the university is not merely to lecture and to examine at the end of the year.  Our job is also to consult with students, to advise students, and much of the misunderstanding in regard to the amount of work which is done by academics is due to neglect of the fact that the informal relation with students is equally as important as the throwing of words at them in a lecture theatre.  So I think that in a very real sense the person who holds a part-time appointment, who walks into an institution and gives his lectures and goes away again to pursue his main avocation is not a suitable person.  He certainly is not a person whose understanding of the work of an institution of higher education is comparable to that of a full-time academic.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I would like to raise because it may not be relevant on the Bill itself although it is relevant now when we are discussing the motion on the report of the authority.  This is the question of the estimation of the finance required. We have been quoted, in the course of <Col N="939" /> this debate, a figure of £24 million as a five year requirement by the HEA. The Minister said in the Dáil that the same job could be done for £15 million. I hope I do not misquote the Minister or misrepresent him in that regard.  But if this is what the Minister said I would suggest this cannot be sustained because, while it might be true to say that a sufficient job could be done for £15 million, it is not true to say that the same job can be done.  It might be possible to reduce amounts but this must always be done at the cost in some respect.</P>
    <P>For example, universities have particular problems which arise from the nature of the work in them.  If you are designing a block to be an office block in which people will be moving through continuously you need a certain amount of circulation space, but if you are designing a university teaching block where everybody moves around for ten minutes of the hour and remains fairly stationary for the other 50 minutes of the hour the amount of circulation space required is quite different.  There is danger here that we could economise too far in regard to allowances for matters such as this.</P>
    <P>Another factor on which there can be very false economies&mdash;one has seen it in many buildings&mdash;is economy in regard to the matter of lifts.  A certain amount of money can be saved at the time of the installation of the building at a cost of a greatly increased outage in regard to the working of the lifts.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that he and his Department should be careful in the future in regard to this.  It is due to the Authority and the public that the Minister should be clear on his point as to exactly what economies were possible that could reduce a figure of £24 million to £15 million.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this Bill is an attempt to harmonise university accountability and the accountability of other institutions of higher education with the idea of the autonomy of such bodies.  As such, the solution that the Minister has proposed is a worthy one.  If this solution is adopted, <Col N="940" /> we will have a system of third level education which will manage to carry on the job that is being carried on under difficult conditions.  Our universities, in particular, but to a large extent other higher education institutions also, labour under the difficulty that they are playing in an international league.  If they once drop below international standards they are finished.</P>
    <P>We, in our institutions of higher education in this country, have been hanging on by our finger nails in the past few years.  Unless relief comes quickly there is the real danger that one or other of the sections of these institutions will have to let go and fall to the bottom of the ravine.  If this scheme goes through and if the universities and Department trust An tÚdarás we can have a great improvement.</P>
    <P>I should like before concluding to quote and comment briefly on a remark made in another place by a British Prime Minister.  I think it is safe to quote him since he is 90 years dead. Benjamin Disraeli, in a debate in the House of Commons in 1863, said:</P>
    <P>A university should be a place of light, of liberty and of learning.</P>
    <P>In the past our universities have done their best in this regard.  In regard to light, to liberty and to learning they have done their best.  But all we have done is in each respect to shine in some places and be somewhat dim in others.  It may well be that, under the new Authority, we may decide that there are only certain places in which we can shine.  But we can, at least, look forward under An tÚdarás to higher education institutions which truly will be places of light for the student, of learning for the staff and, I hope, of liberty for all.</P>
    <P>My final remark is that the aphorism is frequently made that there must be greater control of what is done in these institutions because he who pays the piper calls the tune.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say this to those who are fond of this aphorism.  They should remember the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, <Col N="941" /> because there the piper was asked to play the tune that got rid of the rats, but when the rats were gone the good Burgomaster of Hamelin was unwilling to pay the price.  I would suggest that if this community wants to get rid of the particular plague which we have of the underdevelopment of our country and of many of our people it should be prepared to ask the piper to do the job and pay him the price that was agreed.  Otherwise, like Hamelin, they will be left only with the lame little boy who hobbles along after the rest. By all means ask the piper to do the job.  But remember that in the case of the Piped Piper of Hamelin it was the piper and not the Burgomaster who knew what tune to play.  If that is remembered, we may be able to have a bright future in regard to our institutes of higher education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> I recently attended a Conference of European Ministers of Education in Brussels at which a number of matters in relation to higher education were discussed.  One of the consolations I took away with me from this particular conference was that I discovered that other countries' problems in the higher education sphere were largely similar to our own and just as difficut of solution, and that we were wellup in the vanguard in our educational development and thinking.</P>
    <P>One would perhaps sometimes be inclined to feel after listening to and reading the various criticisms of my Department that our problems were unique and if properly tackled could be easily solved.  But having both publicly and privately discussed the various problems in relation to higher education with other Ministers and officials intimately involved, I come away fortified in the knowledge that we were on the right track, that our ultimate goals were properly set and our pace on the road to progress was just as good as the pace in other countries. This is particularly true when you take into account that we are a small country not overblessed with resources.</P>
    <P>We have had a very useful and very worthwhile debate on the Second Reading of the Higher Education Bill. Perhaps it is hard to avoid the conclusion that certain speakers and some of the points raised were, perhaps, somewhat overcritical.  I am sure I am not misinterpreting the feeling of the House in accepting that the general consensus is very much in favour of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In proposing the Second Reading of the Bill I gave what I described as a brief summary of the circumstances that led to the Government's acceptance of the idea of the establishment of the Higher Education Authority.  Senator Kelly appeared to fault that summary because it did not include a reference to a policy statement made in April, 1967, by the late Mr. Donogh O'Malley, the then Minister for Education, with regard to the rationalisation of the provision for university education in Dublin city and in the country generally. That statement had, of course, a <Col N="943" /> very important bearing on higher education but it had nothing directly to do with the Government's acceptance of the idea of establishing An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas.  Senator Dooge agreed with me here.  Were I, in my brief summary, to have mentioned that statement as being among the circumstances which caused the Government to accept the idea I should have been misleading the House.  This is a comparatively minor matter but, perhaps, it is as well to put the record straight.</P>
    <P>The aims of this Bill are both idealistic and practical.  It contains, I feel, nothing that could justifiably be regarded with any kind of misgiving. That is not to say that it should not be fully and frankly examined and discussed by the Oireachtas&mdash;it has been very fully and frankly discussed on the Second Reading in this House&mdash;on the contrary, I should be very disappointed if the measure of the importance of this Bill were treated otherwise.  As I mentioned in my introductory statement, the existing Údarás um Ard-Oideachas, the <i>ad hoc</i> body, were set up following the recommendation of the Commission on Higher Education that a permanent authority be established to deal with the financial and organisational problems of higher education.</P>
    <P>The task of that authority, as the commission saw it, was spelt out in the following terms:</P>
    <P>It is necessary to consider the development of a future system as a whole.  Our recommendations envisage not only a considerable extension in the diversification of the means through which higher education will be provided but also the development of a system that, as a whole, will provide for the community's needs in higher education. It is not sufficient to contemplate an authority concerned only with part of that system even though a most important part.  Neither is it sufficient to think in terms of a committee which, by definition, will be concerned only with the provision of grants.  There must be a more positive approach to the development of higher education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> I think Senator Dooge agrees with us in this respect also.</P>
    <P>The commission, which made this recommendation so described what they considered should be the work of An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas, having given long and careful consideration to all aspects of higher education. The commission were composed of people who had no axe to grind and who had given unselfishly of their time and abilities as members of the Commission on Higher Education. While to people, who over the years had given thought to the requirements of higher education in Ireland, the recommendation to establish such a body having such duties might be an obvious one I feel that it is nonetheless a valuable recommendation coming as it did after a long, deep and comprehensive study of the whole field of higher education by the commission.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made, in the course of the debate, of the existing Údarás and their work.  This gives me an opportunity to pay a tribute in this House to that body.  They have been assiduous and painstaking in their examination of a number of problems relating to higher education.  Reference has also been made to their first report. In that report of 1968-69 they have produced most useful recommendations. They recommend, for example, the establishment of a council for national education awards, legislation for which is presently in course of preparation.  They have furnished the comprehensive report on teacher training which has been mentioned during the course of the debate.  Having drawn up general recommendations for the provision of third level education in the Limerick Institute of Higher Education they set up a working party to assist the planning board of that institution in the preparation of a programme through which the institute might commence its educational work.  During that time, too, they had been working on problems for the future provision for higher education in the country in general and in Dublin in particular.  If one were to have any doubts as to the wisdom or the necessity of setting up the body for which this Bill provides, the amount and the value of the work which the interim <Col N="945" /> Údarás um Ard-Oideachas have achieved must surely dispel these doubts.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of this first report of the Higher Education Authority is the stress it lays, at several points, on the responsibility of the institution of higher education towards promoting the common good and ensuring that the State gets a fair return for its investment.  In relation to the report as a whole, while it is naturally condensed, it can be said that it highlights a large number of problems in relation to higher education generally and to university education in particular.  It forces us to dwell on and to analyse these problems in a way in which we might not otherwise do and, in that process, we are compelled to ask ourselves a number of questions which at this point of time are, perhaps, fundamental.</P>
    <P>The first question we must ask ourselves is how do we compare with the rest of western Europe in the matter of participation in higher education. The report noted that the proportion of the relevant age group in higher education here is still somewhat lower than in west European countries generally.  However, when we come to examine this matter in detail we find that we have now over 22,000 pupils in institutes of higher education; 19,000 approximately in our universities and 3,000 in training colleges and other third level institutions.  In each of the appropriate age groups there are about 45,000 people and if we take the average time spent by students at institutions of higher education as being four years, we find that we have about 12 per cent of the relevant age group in these institutions.  This compares very favourably with the present western European average.</P>
    <P>In turn, this forces us into asking whether&mdash;these are matters which were discussed during the course of this debate&mdash;in the normal course of working out our priorities we can afford to go on providing higher education on an open-ended basis; or, alternatively, whether we should go on providing more and more of such education on present lines, having regard to our social and economic requirements. It is in this light that we have got to view the Authority's projected <Col N="946" /> additional 5,000 art students by 1975.  This figure stems from a projection that there will be 7,000 additional students seeking higher education by that year, and that only 2,000 of them will find their way into other faculties.  Therefore, 5,000 of them must be consigned to arts.  Having so consigned them, the Authority assumed that their bent would lie in arts, rather than in the specialised technological, or other higher technical fields.</P>
    <P>I accept that due regard must be had to education for its own sake. At the same time, the overall needs of the nation cannot be lost sight of. On the one hand, it could hardly be argued on any basis that this nation would require an additional 5,000 arts graduates.  On the other hand, it is quite obvious that we do require very many higher grade technicians and technologists.  Rather than think in terms of providing for 5,000 additional arts students, perhaps we should direct our attention towards the regional technical colleges and the technological institutes, and have a look at the major role which they must play in meeting our needs, not only catering for additional students, but also in providing persons with qualifications for which there will be a very great demand, and which will supply an urgent national need.</P>
    <P>There is another item which has been raised on a number of occasions by a number of Senators in relation to the authority's report, and it calls for comment. A sum of £24 million has been mentioned as the capital requirement over the next six years.  Certain university commentators have said that this projection is too low.  The authority had accommodation for about 13,000 students in mind in relation to this particular figure, both by way of replacing existing unsuitable accommodation and also providing additional accommodation.  This would represent a cost of somewhere around £1,846 per student place.  While providing facilities for, say, medical students, is very costly, all our experience in relation to building would put the cost per student place at very much less than £1,846.  I shall give a few instances to illustrate this.  The cost per student <Col N="947" /> place in the regional technical colleges, in which a large proportion of the accommodation is devoted to science and to workshops, is £600.  The cost per student place in Belfield is about £650, and in the proposed arts block in Trinity College, the cost per student place is also estimated at £650.</P>
    <P>This underlines the fact that, while there is a difference between us, we are estimating our costings on practical examples that we have got ourselves and which are known to us.  I suppose if the Higher Education Authority had consulted me and had asked me what the particular amount should be for the work proposed I might have told them at that stage that it was what I believed it should be.  However, they did not consult me and I am very glad of that, because it proves that they are an autonomous body, and that they have the right to publish whatever their beliefs and opinions are in relation to higher education.  It does not necessarily follow that I have to agree with all the suggestions they make.  Nevertheless this did underline the fact that the Higher Education Authority are an autonomous body and that they are not controlled, as some people might suggest, by the Minister or by the Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to the staff-student ratio, the report sets a target of one to 12. With the tremendous advances in all kinds of audio-visual aids and the development of closed-circuit television, perhaps the report might have laid greater stress on increasing the application of technology to university teaching, rather than relying solely on increasing the manpower engaged in it.</P>
    <P>I should like to state that I am not making these comments in any spirit of criticism, but as a contribution to the great debate, which must go on as a necessary part of our future planning in higher education.  Part of that great debate has taken place here today.</P>
    <P>I should like to address myself to some of the points which came under discussion.  I am going to refer to a few of them only, in general terms, in the hope that I might be able to remove <Col N="948" /> any misunderstandings or misgivings which some Senators may have, and I shall explain some matters which may be regarded as requiring clarification. Of course, I appreciate that this is Second Stage, and not Committee Stage, and therefore I do not propose to go deeply into the separate sections of the Bill.  I shall do so only to the extent that the clarification to which I have referred is required.</P>
    <P>I shall begin with points that were raised by a number of Senators in relation to the definition of an academic member.  Senator Kelly criticised the definition on the grounds that some future Minister might contrive to have some flimsy academic post established in an institution of higher education.  I think he said that it might be an academic post that might be purely nominal, in order that the occupant could be appointed as a member of An tÚdarás. In my view this is too far-fetched.  If he were to so act it would not be long before an ill-intentioned Minister would find himself without any Údarás um Ard-Oideachas.</P>
    <P>Several Senators have asked what was intended by section 3, paragraph (e).  This is in relation to promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.  Perhaps the Senators overlooked the fact that this paragraph deals only with the structure of higher education.  This, to my mind, gives An tÚdarás the function of promoting where necessary and to the extent necessary the democratisation of the governing bodies and boards of management of institutions and of subsidiary bodies and committees which might be said to form part of the structure of the institution.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies in the Dáil spoke very convincingly on this particular matter, so convincingly in fact that I agreed to accept its inclusion as an amendment of the general functions of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly spoke also about adding a further function to the functions already allocated to An tÚdarás&mdash;that of planning the absorption of graduates. An tÚdarás, of course, must play their part in regulating entry not only to individual institutions but also to individual faculties within institutions. <Col N="949" /> Once students have entered the institution career guidance must, I feel, be the duty of the institution.  In no way, in my view, could An tÚdarás involve themselves in being some sort of an employment agency for graduates as would be the case if the onus for the absorption of the end-products of higher education were placed on them.</P>
    <P>Section 4 came in for some comment by Senators on all sides of the House. In my view there could be no misgiving on the part of any Irish person about the duty being placed on a body such as An tÚdarás in relation to the restoration of the Irish language and the preservation of our national culture. Some speakers appeared to think that the terms of section 4 give powers too wide to An tÚdarás in this respect and fear that here, as they fear in regard to other sections of the Bill, there may be some latent threat to academic freedom.  Others apparently would wish to see this duty set out in a more positive form.  I do not see the necessity for describing this duty of An tÚdarás otherwise than in the form in which it is at the present time in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said on many occasions before, and I now repeat, it is in no way an unjust criticism of our universities to say that they have failed, and failed pretty seriously, to play their part in promoting the restoration of the Irish language and the development of our national culture.  If they had given the leadership which it is right to expect from them we should be very much further on the road to achieving these national aims than we are.  I do not think it is sufficient to say that there were and are great difficulties in doing this because if we were simply to concern ourselves with difficulties in many respects of life as well as in this one we would never get anywhere. Worthwhile ideals are seldom attained without difficulty and institutions of their very character have the duty as well as the privilege of leadership.</P>

      <P>They have got the privilege of leadership in our community and because of this they must also have a duty to help attain what <Col N="950" /> we all regard as a very important national aim.  This duty is placed on An tÚdarás in general terms so that they, as a responsible body, may themselves determine how they can most suitably and effectively fulfil it in the performance of their general functions as set out in section 3.</P>
      <P>Somebody raised the question as to why it was not added to the functions in section 3.  It was put in as section 4 basically because I wanted to emphasise very particularly our concern with the restoration of the language because, as I have said on many occasions, I believe it is the most important aspect of our cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress again what I have stressed in the Dáil that I do not believe that the Irish language is the property of any party.  It belongs to all of us.  It belongs to all political parties.  It belongs to all of our people. It is, therefore, very important that we should all co-operate in our efforts to ensure that this matter, which I feel is basic to our identity as a nation, should be preserved.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that I have had meetings with IFUT recently in relation to what might be done in regard to the promotion of the Irish language in the universities.  We had an exchange of ideas which I think will be helpful.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá i nGaeilge mar gheall ar an gceist seo. Go dtí gur ceapadh mar Aire Oideachais mé ní raibh a fhios agam go raibh an oiread éifeachta ar na hábhair a bhíonn á dteagasc sna bunscoileannaí agus sna meánscoileannaí ag an ollscoil agus atá.  Tá sé soiléir go mór mhór sna meánscoileannaí agus go mór mhór sna meánscoileanna beaga go nglacann siad sin le pé ábhair atá á dteagasc sna hollscoileanna mar tá sé sin le chéill agus tá sé le tuiscint.  Ach mar a dúirt me níor smaoitigh mé air seo go dtí go raibh mé im Aire Oideachais agus to dtí gur chuamar chuig lucht na n-ollscoil ar iarraidh orthu Ealaíon a ghlacadh mar ábhar sna hollscoileanna don scrúdú máithreánach. D'aontaigh siad seo a dhéanamh agus tá sé seo le feiceáil anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an tsuim atá san Ealaíon sna scoileanna éagsúla le feiceáil anois ar <Col N="951" /> fud na tíre.  San curriculum nua atá curtha ar fáil againn do na bunscoileanna tá Ealaíon ansin níamháin i ranganna na naíonán faoi mar a bhíodh sé ach sna ranganna uilig sna bunscoileanna.  Tá sé ar fháil ar curriculum na meánscoileanna agus na gceárdscoileanna chomh maith.  Luaigh mé seo go díreach chun a theaspáint cén dóigh a théann na rudaí a tharlaíonn san ollscoil i gcion ar mhuintir na tíre go ginearálta.  Sa dóigh chéanna dá gcuirfeadh na h-ollscoileanna an oiread suime sa Ghaeilge agus ba cheart dóibh tá mé den bharúil go mbeadh sé seo le feiceáil i measc muintir na tíre uilig.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt Seanadóir éigin fá dtaobh de, deineann na daoine óga aithris ar na daoine fásta; ach ní dheineann na daoine fásta aithris ar na daoine óga. Ní gá dom a rá arís an méid adúirt mé cheana féin go sílim go fóill gur thosaigh muid ar an dtaobh contráilte nuair a bhíomar ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a athbheochan nuair a thosaigh muid leis na bunscoileanna. Tá a fhios agam gurab gá san am é sin a dhéanamh; ach tá sé soiléir anois, nó ba cheart go mbeadh sé soiléir anois nach dtiocfaidh leis na bunscoileanna iontu féin an Ghaeilge a shábháil.  Ach tá mé iontach buíoch do na h-ollúna iolscoile a tháinig ar an dtoscaireacht chugam ar na mallaibh as an dóigh inar phléigh siad an cheist liom agus gídh gur thuigeamar uilig go raibh deacrachtaí éagsúla agus deacrachtaí móra ann, ag an am céanna táimíd uilig sásta go dtig linn níos mó a dhéanamh ná mar a rinneadh cheana féin agus sílim gur comhartha maith é go bhfuil na h-ollúna ag cur níos mó suime sa cheist seo anois ná mar a chuir siad riamh inti.</P>
    <P>There was a considerable amount of discussion on section 12.  In my introductory statement on the Second Reading of this Bill I gave what I considered, and what I still consider, a fairly clear explanation of what that section entails.  There is little I need add to that explanation except, perhaps, to say why in subsection (1) there is mention of amounts to be paid to an tÚdarás out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas rather than an <Col N="952" /> amount.  This is merely, as I have explained on many occasions, to distinguish between the total amounts voted by the Dáil each year for current grants and capital grants, respectively. The general system in relation to the preparation of the Estimates for the Public Services requires that the amounts for capital services and for other services&mdash;in this instance the current grants&mdash;be shown separately in the Estimates.  The amounts referred to in this subsection, therefore, relate to two global sums to be provided by way of grants-in-aid to An tÚdarás to be allocated by An tÚdarás in the form of capital grants and current grants to the different institutions.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will not be asked to vote specific amounts for each separate institution but, as I have already said, there will be an appendix to the Estimates indicating how it is proposed to distribute the global amounts as between the various institutes.  If, for good and sufficient reasons, An tÚdarás find it necessary to vary this allocation they will be free to do so. Information as to how the final allocation of the global sums were made will appear in due course in the Appropriation Accounts for the financial year in question.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I can clear up some doubts in people's minds by explaining the method by which An tÚdarás will determine the amounts they propose to allocate for the various institutions. The procedure will be that, in the light of all information available to them from the different institutions and having regard to the general functions allotted to them under this Bill and particularly to their function of co-ordinating State investment in higher education and in furthering the development of higher education, An tÚdarás will prepare their proposals for the Minister and state their requirements as to the current and capital grants.  They will then have discussions with the Minister and, having learned from him the overall amounts which will be available for capital and current grants, they will go back to the institutions and discuss with them whatever adjustments it might be <Col N="953" /> found necessary to make in the earlier proposals.  They will then inform the Minister how they propose to make their allocations and it is this information that will appear in the appendix to the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I want to underline the fact that the Minister would not interfere in the final allocation.  This would be a matter for An tÚdarás and they would simply inform the Minister as to their final decision in relation to the money allocated to the various institutions. They would supply this information so that it could be made available for inclusion in the appendix to the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Section 13 also came up for some discussion.  It states that:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may institute and conduct studies on such problems of higher education and research as it considers appropriate and may publish reports of such studies.</P>
    <P>An amendment to that section was suggested by some Senators.  That amendment would change &ldquo;may publish reports of such studies&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall publish reports of such studies&rdquo;.  I feel that an amendment on these lines could be interpreted very narrowly.  It could mean that An tÚdarás would be required to publish a report on every minor investigation they had carried out which might be construed as a study.  I feel that An tÚdarás could be relied upon to publish the results of any study of a major nature.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to section 14 and this was combined with references to sections 22 and 23 of the Schedule.  Section 14 (1) states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
    <P>It was suggested here that the Minister would control these appointments and that the appointees, in fact, would be civil servants.  By relating it to section 23 in the Schedule which states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may perform such of its functions as it may deem proper through or by any of its officers or <Col N="954" /> servants duly authorised in that behalf.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that An tÚdarás could pass over their function or functions to a civil servant.  I assume what was meant by that was that the Department would continue to control the whole situation.  In actual fact, the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; in section 14 (1) refers to types and titles of posts.  This particular word appears in many other enactments in this context and it never has been held to refer to individuals.</P>

      <P>May I intervene to ask why it is necessary.  Would it not serve the same purpose if you had &ldquo;may appoint&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the manner in which it is found in many other enactments and I am guided here by the legal people in relation to it.  I would like to emphasise that there will be no question of An tÚdarás being required to submit the names of persons proposed for appointment to the Minister for his approval.  An tÚdarás will make their own appointments.  At present, of course, it is true that civil servants staff the Higher Education Authority, but it could not be otherwise so long as An tÚdarás are an <i>ad hoc</i> body. Once An tÚdarás are statutorily constituted they will make their own appointments without any reference to the Civil Service or to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The provision in section 23 of the Schedule is a normal one.  It is simply to enable An tÚdarás to delegate dayto-day tasks to their officers.  In fact, they would find it very difficult to carry out their functions at all without having this power.  However, there can be no question of this delegation extending to the major functions of An tÚdarás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan was, I think, premature in taking for granted what the future overall provision for higher education may be.  The present position is, as I have stated on many occasions, that recommendations are awaited from An tÚdarás.  It will be for the Government, after having studied these and all other recommendations, to come to a decision as to the nature of the omnibus legislation which will be introduced to deal with this matter. <Col N="955" /> Senator Quinlan also spoke about channelling some of our young people into the Civil Service and the teaching profession.  We are, of course, doing this but we must remember in this connection that we have a greater problem to deal with now than we had some years ago.  I have looked up the figures and I find that in 1925-26 we had 26,000 pupils in post-primary education whereas today we have 200,000 pupils.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell referred to the Limerick Institute of Higher Education. This was understandable since, as a Limerick man, it would have been strange if he had not done so, particularly in view of the remarks that Senator Quinlan made about the institute.  Senator Quinlan said that the institute must learn to creep before it tries to walk and, if I understood him correctly, he suggested a period of about 20 years of creeping before the institute could stand sturdily on its feet and enter into its full life of higher education.  That is not the kind of progress I envisage for the Limerick Institute of Higher Education.  I am anxious that the institute will come into being as soon as possible as a foundation for third level education in conformity with the objective the Government see for it; that objective is that the institute should provide higher education of a type which is primarily technological in character but that it should also cater, to a significant extent, for education in the humanities.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil, I was as anxious as any other person that the institute should start this year, if that were possible, but I recognise, as I think many of the Senators speaking on this debate recognised, that the establishment of this institute is something new in Irish education.  It is vitally important, therefore, that it should get off to a good start.  If it were to totter in its early stages it could have a very detrimental effect on its future and its future is something which not only concerns Limerick but concerns the whole nation and, therefore, it is vitally important that it should get off to a good start.  The reason why I could not give approval <Col N="956" /> for the opening of the Limerick Institute in September of this year was because the planning board, despite the fact that they worked conscientiously and hard, and I must give them every credit for that, did not succeed in devising a course of instruction on the basis of work commencing this year, which could be regarded as adequate as to scope or having the elements of technological studies which would be in keeping with the objectives for which this institute is being founded.  In endeavouring to work out a suitable programme, the planning board had the guidance and advice of a working party from the existing <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority.  I had the benefit of advice from the Authority as to the suitability of the proposed course.  Taking all things into account, I had no option but to decide that the proposed course would be an unsuitable basis on which to commence the educational work of the institute.  Since it would not be possible to provide the workshops and laboratory facilities needed to cater for a course with suitable technological content by September, 1971, the opening of the institute has been deferred for one year.  I have already stated that I envisaged degree courses being undertaken in the institute from the outset provided the courses proposed are in keeping with the basis purposes for which the institute was approved.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton spoke of the strides that had been made in the educational field in recent times and suggested that we had, perhaps, put the cart before the horse by not providing all the necessary facilities for free education. Nobody knows better than I do the problems and difficulties which have arisen in relation to the introduction of free education, but I also know that, were we to wait until everything was ready, we would never see the introduction of free education. Whatever the difficulties may be in providing the facilities necessary, and there are difficulties, the proper thing was done when free education was introduced.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan, in his address, brought forward certain sums based on last year's provision for universities <Col N="957" /> as compared with this year's provision. He apparently lost sight of the fact that last year's total included Supplementary Estimates which contained sums relating to arrears for the 12th round salary award.  I welcome the Senator's call for diversity in institutions through which third level education is provided.  We live in a world of constant change where, if we are to avoid obsolesence, we must be constantly altering existing structures and erecting new ones.  This is no less true of third level education than it is in any other sphere.  We appreciate, of course, that some people do not take kindly to change and that we will have a difficult task in altering certain fixed attitudes.  However, this great debate in relation to education is proceeding in this House just as it is proceeding elsewhere and none of us has a monopoly of ideas when it comes to solving the particular problems that lie ahead of us.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Desmond was gracious in her acknowledgement of the great strides that have been made in recent years in the provision of post-primary education.  I share her concern that third level education should be as representative as possible of the various sections of our people.  It was this concern that impelled the Government to introduce the higher education grants scheme.  Under this scheme approximately 1,500 students now get grants annually as compared with 270 students who previously got university scholarships.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Schedule was also mentioned by a number of Senators, particularly by Senator Kelly.  Section 16 provides:</P>
    <P>Every question at a meeting of An tÚdarás on which there is disagreement among the members present shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present and voting on the question and, in the case of an equal division of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall have a second or casting vote.</P>
    <P>In my view, every member of An tÚdarás must have equal standing. Non-academic members will not be unreceptive of reasoned arguments by <Col N="958" /> the academic members and, of course, the reverse will also hold.  Anything from which it might be inferred that there will be two separate blocs within the membership of An tÚdarás would be highly undesirable.  Furthermore, the Senator's suggestion that all the academic members voting together should constitute a majority could lead to a situation in which, if the academic members decided to act in accord, they could render the other members of An tÚdarás powerless.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggested conference of Irish universities, referred to by a number of Senators, including Senator Mrs. Robinson, I know that it was originally intended that some legislation would be introduced jointly with this particular Bill in relation to this.  It would, of course, be entirely wrong even to contemplate setting up a conference of Irish universities before we know what the future structure of higher education will be.  Since the notion of such a conference was first mooted, there have been changes and there will be further changes; it will be in the light of all those that the constitution of a co-ordinating body to deal with purely academic matters will then be considered.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to student representation. I spoke at some length on this in the Dáil.  I should like to point out that a fundamental characteristic of An tÚdarás is that they will not be a representative body, inasmuch as each member will be selected on the basis of his experience, his knowledge and his ability, and he will not act as a representative of any particular institution, or any body, or any interest. I have given evidence of my acceptance of the principle of student representation by nominating students on the governing bodies of the colleges of the National University of Ireland. The provision for such representation on the board of an institution is proposed in the National College of Art and Design Bill at present before the Dáil.  I am always ready and willing to consider the question of student representation where I consider such representation appropriate.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate, as I have said on many occasions in regard to the functions assigned to An <Col N="959" /> tÚdarás under this Bill, that statutory provisions should be made for the appointment of a student, or students, as members of An tÚdarás.  Under section 16 (1) of the Bill, where An tÚdarás are authorised to appoint a committee to advise them on matters relating to their functions, a student could, and should, be appointed under this particular section.  This would be within the discretion of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the question of university autonomy.  I have spoken on this on a number of occasions, and have given my own views, which are fairly well known now. Perhaps I should repeat them.  The concept of university autonomy is one which must be accepted in any society which subscribes to the principles of democracy.  It is in the definition of that concept, however, that differences and difficulties may arise.  In Ireland the revenue of the universities derives almost entirely from funds provided by society, through the fees paid by students and, to a very much greater extent, by State grants, both capital and current.  In its modern context the university is part of the structure through which society seeks its own good and the fulfilment of its individual members.  Society is dependent for its wellbeing on the competence of its members and on the natural resources which are available to it.  I have referred to this on many occasions.  It is for this reason that I speak of the dual responsibility of the university, namely, its responsibility to pure learning and its responsibility to the society which sustains it.</P>
    <P>University autonomy includes freedom of speech and freedom to publish the findings of research.  The university alone may set the standards on which entrants will be admitted and the standards on which its degrees or other qualifications will be awarded. In relation to entry conditions the university has a grave responsibility. I do not at all challenge its right to set standards, but its action in confining recognition for entry purposes to a limited range of subjects causes some concern and some disquiet.  The fulfilment of the individual is the aim of all education; it is the very core of the <Col N="960" /> university concept.  Everybody accepts this.  Yet, while at the first and second levels of education the emphasis is on the development of the individual's abilities and aptitudes, the university has, as it were, put a brake on such development by the narrow range of subjects it is prepared to accept for university entrance.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear here that I am not speaking of standards of achievement, but of the restrictive range of subjects which the university is prepared to take into account.  It is implicit in the acceptance of the university's prerogatives in regard to standards that one recognises its rights to define the courses leading to its qualifications.  Nevertheless, society has a right to expect, if not to demand, from both the university and from other third level institutions, that they should recognise that the community is in need of certain professional, technical and technological skills and that they should seek to supply that need. Universities and other institutions concerned should, within their own sphere, decide how best this might be done.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the appointment of the academic staff I do not deny the university's prerogative.  However, I cannot accept that the university should have autonomy in dealing with the remuneration of staff.  As the State must ultimately pay the bill, the State, through Dáil Éireann, must continue to have a final say in that matter.</P>
