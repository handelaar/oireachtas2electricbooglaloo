    <Title>Death of Mr. Seán F. Lemass:    Expression of Sympathy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The nation mourns the passing of one of the most outstanding men of our times in the person of Seán Lemass, soldier, statesman and master planner, who got the wheels of industry turning in a peaceful revolution that provided jobs for tens of thousands of our people and produced a nation which could export its manufactured goods in competition with those of any of the other exporting nations in the world.</P>
      <P>Seán Lemass, as boy of 15, began his service to Ireland in the GPO during Easter week, when his rifle spoke of the freedom for which he worked so hard and so effectively during all the remaining years of his life.  During the War of Independence he was at his post with his unit and during the final defence of the Republic he was there too.  I had the good fortune of knowing him for almost half a century.  I first met him at Republican Army Headquarters in the Four Courts, Dublin, a few hours before the building was shelled by Free State Forces in June, 1922.  If any man knew what the horrors of civil war meant to the people of this country, and what tragedies it could bring to a family, Seán Lemass knew it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All his life he followed the dictum of Wolfe Tone to the letter and in the spirit and his motto, which was the motto he provided so effectively for the party which he helped to build and whose fortunes he directed at election after election&mdash;the motto of Tone, to unite the whole people of Ireland and to abolish the memory of all past dissensions. If any man worked towards <Col N="164" /> this end, to heal the embers of civil war, to cure the bitterness and the hatred engendered by it, that man was Seán Lemass.  If any man had the courage and the ability to take the steps which were necessary to break the barrier and extend that abolition of the memory of past hatreds and dissensions to our separated counties in the North, it was Seán Lemass,</P>
    <P>Seán Lemass does not need any monuments in stone or mortar to perpetuate his memory in the hearts of the Irish people.  The great airplanes which fly our skies, the great airports which were built through his energies and enterprise, the great development of the peat resources of our country, the rural electrification poles which stretch from one end of the country to the other, the magnificant fleet of modern ships which bring the Irish flag over the seven seas, are some of the monuments which he has built for himself and which will last longer than stone or mortar.</P>
    <P>There is another one, however, to which we are too near to do justice to, another one which history will record as perhaps one of his greatest achievements. During the period of World War Two from 1939 to 1945 he was given the post of Minister for Supplies and asked to make certain that we could maintain our neutrality by making it possible for our people to obtain adequate food supplies so that we could not be forced into surrender by starvation.  Seán Lemass was able to do this.  Wherever he got the supplies, however he got the ships and transport to bring them here, he was able to do it and to see that the food was divided evenly among the people and that a reasonable ration was given to all.  That enabled us to survive during that period when pressure was being exerted by outside powers to make us change the course of history. As Monsignor Patrick Browne said on one occasion of Seán Lemass: &ldquo;He kept the drop to our lips and the bite to our mouths.&rdquo;  For that the Irish people will never forget the service which he rendered to this nation in time of stress.</P>
    <P>The workers of Ireland, too, will never forget him.  As I said at the <Col N="165" /> outset, his foresight energies and initiative in making Arthur Griffith's dream of a two-arm nation a reality, made it possible for a great industrial fabric to be built here; made it possible for trade unions to quadruple their membership in 15 years and made it possible for us to have in Ireland a corps of workers as expert in their jobs as those in any country in the world.  Side by side with that, he instituted, through legislation in the Oireachtas, a workers' charter which provided for such things as holidays with pay, conditions of employment, shop hours, wet time insurance and all the other benefits which workers have enjoyed as a result of the thought and concern for their interests which pervaded his mind during his whole life.</P>
    <P>I had the great privilege and honour of being associated with him and of enjoying his friendship and working with him, and I found him to be a most unassuming, gentle and considerate man, a man of great heart and of great human sympathy, a man&mdash; I know this from my own personal experience because I witnessed it&mdash; who would never turn away a charitable appeal and who could not resist a hard luck story.  He was a man whose whole life was devoted to the interests of his fellow men and women and a man who, in his lifetime, had the great pleasure of seeing most of his dreams realised.  This country was fortunate that, when it had a great national leader like de Valera who inspired the nation, it had a great architect of genius like Seán Lemass to translate into active practical reality the things which must be done in order to put this country on the map as a modern state.  That he did and for that we should always remember him.</P>
    <P>He also had something which is very seldom referred to and is very little known, I am afraid.  He had an abiding interest in the survival of the Irish language.  He did not know much of it himself but every encouragement that he could give he gave it. In many of his recent addresses you will find running through them a theme which has been the theme of nationalists down through the years, <Col N="166" /> that without a language this nation cannot survive except as a halfway house between two great English-speaking countries.</P>
    <P>The nation is the poorer for his loss and I would ask you on behalf of the Members here present to extend to his wife and family the deepest sympathy of the Members of Seanad Éireann in their great bereavement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I should like to join with the Leader of the House in the request to send from this House a message of sympathy to the widow and family and relatives of the late Seán Lemass.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have been in politics for some time and, perhaps even more so, those who have only recently come into politics, will realise by the passing of Seán Lemass how comparatively recently we have come of age as a nation.  Yesterday, one of those who had been associated with the parliamentary life of this country virtually from the beginning passed away; some months ago another such, in the distinguished father of Senator Eoin Ryan passed away; and a few years ago a very great man, in the person of the late William T. Cosgrave, passed away.  When we think that until very recently such men as these were with us&mdash;people who had played their part in the unfolding before our eyes of Irish history&mdash;we realise that we sit even today at the very feet of history in the making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the late Seán Lemass was concerned, it is true to say&mdash;and I know people say nice things about others after they die&mdash;that while people in my party always regarded Seán Lemass as a strong opponent, he held the respect and admiration of all of us who knew him.  We knew him as a great political realist; we knew him, as the Leader of the House has indicated, as a man who in himself and even in his work was entirely unpretentious. He had no sham or mockery about his approach to parliament or his approach to the work of the nation. I feel that the members of his party in particular must feel his loss very deeply in the political scene.  The loss <Col N="167" /> of the guiding hand of a man who was&mdash;and I have no hesitation in saying it&mdash;not merely a statesman but a great political tactician, even in his retirement, must be felt severely by members of his own party.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say&mdash;and I can only say this from my own personal knowledge and experience&mdash;that not merely his political friends and associates but his political opponents always received personal courtesy and friendship from the late Seán Lemass. I myself had at least one experience of that that I shall always remember.  It is not necessary for me to go into it but I should say that other people in my party and other political opponents of his had exactly the same experience. He was a man who was gentle and considerate in personal matters; he was courteous and friendly in personal dealings with people and at the same time was a very able opponent, a very able parliamentarian, debater and spokesman for the things for which he stood not merely in the parliament of this country but on the hustings.</P>
    <P>All of us in my party will feel a genuine sorrow at his passing.  We feel that it is a sad thing that a man who contributed so much to the country, who was dynamic in his approach to the tasks which he took in hand, was not able to have more than a few years of peaceful retirement when he decided to leave the political arena.  On behalf of myself and my party I would ask you to convey our very deepest sympathy to Mrs. Lemass and the family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might be so bold to add a few words on my own behalf &mdash;I have not consulted any of my colleagues who are Independent Members of the Seanad&mdash;in agreement with what has already been said about the late Mr. Lemass, I should like especially to underline something which Senator Ó Maoláin emphasised considerably, and that is Mr. Lemass's role in stressing the fundamental importance of economics in Irish life and of economic planning.  If it is true to say that man does not live by bread alone, it is equally and doubly true to say &ldquo;nor does he live by patriotism alone,&rdquo;<Col N="168" /> especially not by that kind of patriotism which relies on sloganeering and on making empty gestures.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the major contribution Mr. Lemass made to this country, building on the political and constitutional stability which I believe the early Fianna Fáil Government inherited from the Government that went before them, was the establishment of this principle as a prime principle in Irish political life.  One does not, I think, have to agree with every detail of his analysis of our economic situation and our economic problems, or with all the remedies he chose to apply to these problems, to believe that this was, and will be, his inalienable contribution to our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>To insert No. 2 before No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before speaking on the amendment I should like to associate myself with the expressions of condolences to the family of Mr. Seán Lemass and to the expressions of appreciation of him as an Irishman. I had the privilege during the last year on the Council of the European Movement of getting to know him to some extent and I share in the views expressed <Col N="169" /> from both sides of the House about this great Irishman.</P>
      <P>In moving the amendment to the Order of Business, I do so in order that the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, which is No. 2 on the list and which is tabled by Senators Horgan, West and myself, be given its First Reading by the House and the technical right to be published and circulated. This item was on the Order Paper last week but was passed over by the Leader of the House and on that occasion we did not object to this because we did not wish to give the impression that we were unduly pressurising the Government or that we were interested in obstructing the business of the House or in looking for cheap publicity for its own sake.</P>
      <P>I think the stage has now come where we cannot once again allow the matter to be passed over in silence because what now arises is the question of parliamentary privilege, of the privilege of a Senator to introduce a Bill and to have that Bill given a First Reading by the House, unless it is the intention of the Government to oppose it.  By postponing consideration of the matter in this way the Government are effectively preventing three Senators from exercising their privilege as Senators to introduce legislation in the normal way.  They are effectively censoring our right to introduce Bills and to have the public know what we are doing.</P>
      <P>I propose, in order to show the extent to which this is a curtailment of our parliamentary privilege and to show how serious this would be if accepted by the House as normal practice, to look very briefly at the Standing Orders of the Seanad in this respect and to compare them with the position in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in England.  I do not propose to take up much time over this but I think it is important.  I refer initially to Standing Order No. 72, one of the Standing Orders of the House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any matter for decision by the Seanad shall be brought before it by Motion for a Resolution or <Col N="170" /> Order, by the introduction of a Bill.</P>
    <P>It states: &ldquo;Any matter for decision by the Seanad...&rdquo;  If a matter is brought by the introduction of a Bill for decision by the Seanad I think it is something not contemplated in the Standing Orders of the Seanad that the matter be continually postponed by the Government and passed over and not taken on the Order Paper.  I think this is a hidden deprivation of privilege, deprivation of the right to introduce Bills, and it diminishes my understanding of what it is to be a Senator and my understanding of the power of a Senator to introduce legislation and I think that it is important that this matter be clarified.  If I may refer to Standing Order No. 73, which relates to the First Stage of Bills:</P>
    <P>When a Bill is to be initiated in the Seanad a copy thereof, authorised by the signatures of not less than three nor more than six Senators as proposers, shall be delivered to the Clerk, and its title and a short description of its purpose, prepared by the proposers and accepted by the Cathaoirleach, shall appear on the Order Paper.  The Senator whose name shall appear as first signatory on the said copy shall be deemed to be the Senator having charge of the Bill and shall move for leave to introduce the Bill.  If such motion be opposed the Cathaoirleach after permitting an explanatory statement from the Senator who moves, and a statement from the Senator who opposes the motion may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.  If leave to introduce the Bill be given, an Order shall be made for its second stage and the Bill shall be printed;</P>
    <P>It is this First Reading, then, that we are seeking today and I emphasise again that by postponing the taking of this item on the agenda the Government can indefinitely curtail our right to introduce legislation and our right to have the public know exactly what we are proposing.  This hidden possibility of indefinite postponement of an item, if it is abused as I suggest at the moment that the Government are abusing it, is not possible under the English system.  If I may quote very <Col N="171" /> briefly from Sir Gilbert Campion's <i>Introduction To The Procedure of the House of Commons.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, you appreciate that we are at present discussing the Order of Business.  I do not think that the procedure in other parliaments really becomes relevant on this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but what I was about to do in a few words was to stress that the First Stage in the British Parliament is a formal stage.  We get most of our parliamentary tradition, most of our attitudes on the importance of parliamentary democracy from the Westminster model.  We do not copy in detail but our general view is the same in stressing the importance of the legislature, the importance of parliamentary democracy. While I accept your ruling, what I proposed to do was to show that in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords once a Private Member introduces a Bill the First Stage is a formal stage.  If I might just very briefly quote from the relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that we have our own Standing Orders in this House under which we operate.  I have allowed the Senator to quote from various Standing Orders but strictly speaking all we are dealing with at the moment is the Order of Business.  The Senator has moved an amendment to add one item to the Order of Business.  I do not really think that this matter arises under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I accept your ruling.  It was, as I said, purely to establish the principle that the First Stage in the British Parliament is a formal stage and would not be either postponed or indefinitely put on the long finger in this way.  It is not my object to take up the time of the House.  It is not my object to seek cheap publicity about this matter.  It is my object to affirm the importance of the privileges of Senators, of the legislators in the system, and the importance of not allowing our privileges to be eroded by the indefinite postponement <Col N="172" /> of a matter by the Government, and to emphasise that the Order Paper is a matter for the House.  It is the Seanad which determines when a Bill is introduced whether it will be given its First Reading, and that this is a principle we should not let fall by the wayside.</P>
      <P>I appeal as a Senator, then, for the right to introduce this Bill with my two colleagues.  I appeal for the right to get a reading unless the Government intend to oppose it, and from statements both from the Taoiseach and other members of the Government it does not appear as though the Government oppose this in principle. The matter is not very clear but it is not evident from various statements which have been made in public that the Government intend to oppose this in principle.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned before, the Senators who are attempting to get a First Reading for this Bill are distressed at the extent to which we are being misinterpreted in the press and at the extent to which this is bad for the general opinion of the legislation when is comes up.  It is much more difficult now for the Bill to be given a neutral consideration when feelings are polarised. There is a feeling that we are trying to make legal the use of contraceptives. This is a misunderstanding. It is already legal to use contraceptives. I think this point ought to be emphasised.  It is legal to use contraceptives. We are concerned purely with the sale and availability and distribution of them.  This is a matter we ought to be allowed to put before the people, as we have tabled the Bill, and therefore I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>Would I be in order in saying that last Thursday Senator E. Ryan, in reply to a question from me, invited me to inquire again today when item No. 1&mdash;Enforcement of Court Orders Bill, 1971 &mdash;would be taken?  If it is possible for the Government to indicate when the First Stage of this Bill will be taken I should be very grateful, for reasons, I may add, of the same kind as those advanced by Senator Robinson in defence of her Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House what his intentions are as regards motions.  There are 14 motions on the Order Paper today. I have a motion which is a long way down the list.  It is a motion which, in my opinion, is very important.  As the pace in dealing with motions has been so slow it could be years before this motion will be reached.  This has happened before.  I have seen motions on the Order Paper that have never been taken before elections.  This is an insult to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>My motion is very important to the economy of the country as regards liver fluke but from the way in which motions are being dealt with it is obvious to me that this motion will probably never get a hearing in the House.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House what is his way of dealing with these motions.  What good are we doing in the Seanad?  We might as well abolish the Seanad.  A motion serves the purpose of Question Time in the other House.  We cannot get a word in here. I should like the Leader of the House to let us know what his intentions are in dealing with these motions.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion when we met there was some misunderstanding about Motion No. 20 which we felt would have been taken this week.  I can appreciate the position of the Leader of the House and the other Members of the House due to the death of Seán Lemass, but I would be anxious when the Leader is replying if he would convey to us that he would be prepared to take this motion next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I wish to support Senator Robinson in this amendment to the Order of Business. One of the reasons is that we have the quite absurd situation where we now have a nationwide debate on a nonexistent Bill.  There is considerable misinterpretation going on.  This has been pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion on a similar amendment in my name several weeks ago Senator Ó Maoláin advised anybody who had any doubt as to what the Bill contained to refer to radio and television programmes in which I have participated.  It seems to me that there <Col N="174" /> is considerable confusion here and one of the reasons why we are bringing in this amendment is to attempt to clear up this confusion.</P>
    <P>Before participating in radio and television programmes dealing with this general area of discussion, I went to considerable trouble to take advice as to the extent to which I could be allowed to publish details of this Bill. I received a great deal of advice, much of it contradictory.  More recently I have had very strong advice from somebody I regard as an eminent constitutional lawyer, that the failure to get the First Stage of a Bill through in the Seanad does not preclude publication elsewhere.  I, on the other hand, would prefer to be guided by what I consider to be the traditions of this House and not to establish any precedence travelling in the other direction. That is why any comments that I have made in public about the Bill have been as general as in conscience I felt I could make them.</P>
    <P>It is customary on motions of this kind not to debate the merits of the Bill itself.  I am absolutely convinced that there is another issue at stake&mdash; it is the one, broadly speaking, outlined by Senator Robinson, and it is the merits of this issue that we should be discussing&mdash;that is the competence of the Houses of the Oireachtas in general and in particular of our own House.  In this context I am particularly perturbed by the significance of the Government's refusal to give this Bill even a First Reading.  It seems to me that the business of the Government is to take vital decisions affecting the community.  This is perfectly understandable and justifiable.  It is the way in which all Governments should work.  What we seem to have operating at the moment on the Government side is a sort of sense of global panic which leaves them not just to take decisions but to take complete and virtual and totalitarian control over vast areas of our democratic process.  This is why I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words on this.  This amendment is in line with an amendment which was proposed some weeks ago by <Col N="175" /> Senator Horgan and I expressed my views at that time.  I think it is just as well that I should say again very briefly some of the things which I said then. One of the things that I think is necessary to say and to be quite clear on is that the amendment that is being proposed is an amendment to the Order of Business before us today. Whatever view individual Senators may take with regard to whether this particular item should be included in today's Order of Business should not be interpreted by anyone, in the House or in the Press Gallery or outside, as indicating support or approval for the particular Bill which is listed as item No. 2 on the Order Paper&mdash;the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 1971.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to make this clear particularly in view of the situation that was described by Senator Horgan who referred to a nationwide debate being held on a Bill which as yet does not exist.  I feel very conscious that a number of Senators would feel that the rights of Members of Parliament should be upheld in so far as obtaining a First Reading of a Bill is concerned and who at the same time, while feeling that strongly, may not wish, if they decide to support that point of view, to be tagged as supporters of this or any other particular Bill on this topic.  I think it is necessary to make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Members of my party are concerned, they have not been given any <i>diktat</i> or whip with regard to the particular amendment that is proposed today.  Some of them may decide that the arguments in favour of a Senator being permitted to have a First Reading of a Bill are such that they cannot be withstood and they may vote for the amendment.  Others may feel, as I feel myself, that there is no need whatever for this Bill to be introduced or for the time of this House to be taken up by discussion of this Bill.  So far as I am concerned, I see no reason why it should be ordered today.  I see no reason why it should be ordered any other day. We are reaching a situation&mdash;it is quite clear to all of us&mdash;where there is going to be a general election in the near future.  If anyone wants to put the proposals <Col N="176" /> contained in this Bill to the Irish people the time to do so is at a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment to the Order of Business.  In supporting Senator Mrs. Robinson I do not feel there is any necessity to look to the Standing Orders of the House of Commons or to any similar place.  In my opinion we have only to look to the Standing Orders of this House, the body of which we are Members, which say: &ldquo;That the business of the Seanad shall be in the order as laid down on the printed Order Paper unless otherwise decided by the Seanad.&rdquo;  Therefore, under our own Standing Orders, we start with the presumption that this House should discuss first No. 1, second No. 2, third No. 3, fourth No. 4 and so forth.  This is the presumption under our own Standing Orders.  It is possible under that Standing Order to vary our business but we should realise every time we do so that we are making a conscious decision.  It is not for the Leader of the House to stand up and to say, as a sort of lottery, that we will discuss this item or that item.  When he stands up each day to propose the Order of Business he is proposing, in fact, a variation from the standard, the norm, laid down under our own Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>Our own custom, if not our Standing Orders, place the First Stage of Bills before the Second Stage Bills on the Order Paper.  In doing this we follow the parliamentary customs to which Senator Mrs. Robinson has referred. We dispose of First Stages of Bills before we come to dispose of Second Stages unless we decide otherwise. Surely the Seanad should not except for weighty reasons make such positive decisions.  Accordingly I think that the onus of varying the Order of Business, the onus of not taking the First Stage of any Bill, the onus in regard to this particular argument, is on those who propose that the First Stage should not be taken.  The onus is not on those who propose that all First Stages be taken and that all Bills be printed without any necessary decision about when the Second Stage should be debated.</P>

    <P>That is what we have before us <Col N="177" /> today.  We have before us a proposal that the First Stage of this Bill be taken today and, if the House so approves, that the Bill be then printed. The proposition is not that the Bill be now printed and the Second Stage taken next week.  It is the simple proposition: that the House should be entitled to discuss the question of whether or not this Bill&mdash;the precise question that Senator O'Higgins has proposed&mdash;is one that should occupy the time of this House.  Whether there is to be a substantive debate on Second Stage is better debated on First Stage than on the Order of Business here.  I am sure the Chair at this time, 3.45, is sympathetic with that particular argument.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the complete onus is on the Leader of the House who seeks, in this respect, to vary the order laid down in our Standing Orders, to vary the practice of other parliaments. I want to make my position clear.  I support this amendment not because I necessarily support the contents of this Bill.  On that point I reserve my position until such time as the appropriate arguments have been made on First Stage and, if the Bill so survives, I further reserve my position until the appropriate arguments have been made on Second Reading.  It is on the basis that no Bill should be lightly denied publication, on the basis&mdash;and this has already been mentioned&mdash;that the debate is already taking place throughout the country, or on the basis that a substantial proportion of the people whom we represent are concerned about this particular problem that I support the amendment.  I believe it is the duty of this House to have this Bill, or if not this Bill some other Bill, printed without delay.  Whatever we may think about the merits of this case I see little validity in the argument that this matter should be continually postponed from day to day.</P>
    <P>I feel that in what was said on the last occasion and what has been said up to the present the onus of proof for departing from parliamentary practice has not been discharged by those who would ask us to depart from normal parliamentary practice, that the First Stage of a Bill should be automatic so <Col N="178" /> that at least we will know what we are talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support this amendment.  I was very encouraged that Senators should support the right of us three Independent Senators to have the First Stage of this Bill taken without necessarily supporting what is in the Bill.  We are talking about a basic right we have as Senators. I am, therefore, very encouraged by Senator O'Higgins and Senator Dooge saying that we are entitled as a basic right to have our Bill published without they necessarily supporting it. It is not the intention of Senator Mrs. Robinson, Senator Horgan and myself to steamroll legislation.  We know, as well as anybody else, that no Bill can become law without the approval of the majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, we feel that it is a basic right to have the Bill published. Therefore, I should like to support the amendment because it is one particular area of democracy which we should not allow to be eroded.</P>

      <P>I would be grateful if you could clarify a statement that has been made here that there is a basic right for Senators to have any Bill brought before this House and debated as of right.  If that is an established fact I do not know what we are arguing about.  Unless I have your ruling, or a statement, to that effect I cannot accept that any Bill, no matter what its contents or intended contents, has a right <Col N="179" /> to be debated in this House or in either House of the Oireachtas.  I made my position quite clear on the last occasion on which an effort was made to have this Bill introduced.  I do not think this is the proper way to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already indicated, quite clearly, that the subject matter of this Bill and other matters of a constitutional nature which, he suggested, might hinder better relations between the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six Counties, would be dealt with by the Government at an early date. I feel there is an obligation on the Government and the Taoiseach to deal with this matter, and in my opinion they are the people who should be dealing with it.  If there has been dialogue or discussion on a non-Bill it is not the fault of the Seanad. Again it augments the reasons I have given why this matter should not have been dealt with in the way it has been dealt with.  Discussion should have preceded introduction of a Bill of this nature and not have followed from its introduction.  A good deal of misunderstanding and, as Senator Mrs. Robinson has rightly said, a good deal of misinterpretation have arisen.  The fault must lie squarely with the sponsors of this Bill.  Bills of this nature, involving matters of a highly complex and delicate nature, should be discussed outside both Houses before they are introduced.</P>

      <Col N="180" /> More mileage has been got out of this Bill than out of any other Bill which I remember being introduced into this House.  Every day some newspaper carries a double column heading on the issue of contraception.  Our friends in Westmoreland Street make a point of ensuring that every time one of the Senators concerned speaks there is a lengthy verbatim report of every word uttered.  The people in general are quite well acquainted with what is in the minds of those who are introducing this Bill.  There is no secret about it. It is not a case of a non-Bill.  It is a Bill and everyone knows what is in it. If any point would be served by having it printed, then those who are so anxious to have the Bill actually in print for distribution, if they are enthusiastic enough to want to foist this on us without proper consideration, then they can get it printed and circulate it themselves.</P>

      <P>Senator Mary Robinson annoys me. I explained to her on the last occasion to which reference was made in connection with this matter what the position was.  That position still obtains. We are not going to be pushed by any amount of shouting, or by quoting what happens in the British Parliament or any other parliament, into doing what we do not wish to do until such time as adequate examination and consideration has been given to the whole thing.  As I said on that occasion, when that examination is completed and when the position has been decided on as to what the Government Party's attitude will be in the matter, the result will be communicated to the Seanad.  That is the best I can do in this regard.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Dooge's proposition about the printing of Bills, it comes ill from people who are always quibbling about extravagance in certain Government Departments to talk about printing something when there is no need to print it.  No matter how small the expenditure might be in regard to printing this Bill, it is something which I would not encourage and I do not see why anyone else should encourage it either.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the law bearing on the maintenance orders which could be made by the court to deserted wives.  These maintenance payments were originally provided for by the Married Women (Maintenance in Case of Desertion) Act, 1886, and in 1886 the weekly payment provided was £2. That was the year before Queen Victoria's Silver Jubilee.  It remained £2 per week irrespective of the number of children that a deserted wife might have to support until 1940 when the Enforcement of Court Orders Act by section 7 raised the maximum sum which could be awared by a court against an absconding husband from £2 to £4 and it has remained at £4 ever since, notwithstanding the enormous rise in the cost of living since that date and again irrespective of the number of children who may be dependent for support on this award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to mislead the House and I want to make it clear to any Members of the House, or to persons not Members of the House who may be interested, that this provision has nothing whatever to do with the social <Col N="185" /> welfare payments made to deserted wives, nor has it anything to do with alimony or maintenance settlements which may be privately arrived at or decided by a court in consequence of a separation action.  This is a provision which, quite apart from what I might call the litigious big time of separation actions, and quite apart from social welfare payments, entitles a deserted wife to recover from her absconding husband, if he is in the jurisdiction, a maximum of £4 a week irrespective of what children may be depending on her support.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill introduced by myself and two other Senators in the name of the Fine Gael Party was to remove this ludicrous ceiling of £4 and to relate the maximum amount which could be ordered by a court by way of maintenance against an absconding husband to the husband's earnings.  I am condensing our provision but we proposed that where there were no children the maximum amount which could be awarded should be one-half of the husband's earnings and where there were children the maximum should go up to two-thirds of the husband's earnings.  That, if you like, is a severe provision but we believe that it is justified.</P>
    <P>We do not think it is good enough for the Government to say that the Government are introducing, or will introduce, legislation which will look after this matter.  I have taken the trouble to go back through the Parliamentary Questions over the last three years and on no fewer than 12 occasions in the last three years, since this time 1968, Ministers have been asked in the Dáil about deserted wives and on all these occasions the matter has been put on the long finger with the same honeyed words as we have just heard from the Leader of the House.</P>
    <P>Since 1968, and for all I know since a long time prior to that since my inquiries did not go back any further, the promise has been made that amending legislation is on the way to raise this ludicrous ceiling, this disgraceful ceiling, which may mean that a wife is dependent on public charity apart from the maximum of £4 which <Col N="186" /> she can get from her absconding husband. Minister after Minister said the legislation was in the pipeline.  I know quite well the Government had their own difficulties.  There is no reason why that Bill should not have been introduced in this House and there is no reason why our Bill should not be accepted.</P>
    <P>The Government have a Civil Service at their disposal; we have not got such a thing at our disposal.  We do our best with our own private resources.  I am absolutely willing to be told by the Government that this Bill which Senator O'Brien, Senator Butler and myself have put in is in some respect not workable.  I am quite willing to be told that it could be improved.  I am quite willing to hear that amendments would make it a more satisfactory measure.  No opposition would have been forthcoming from us had the Government taken up that attitude.  We would have facilitated them and done everything in our power to achieve what the only object in our minds is, namely, to remove this scandal from the Statute Book whereby for the last 31 years, since before certain Members of this House were born, the maximum amount that a deserted wife could recover by a court order from her absconding husband was £4.</P>
    <P>I realise, and I am not trying to gloss over this fact, that there are problems in this matter which will not be solved merely by an amendment of the kind which we propose.  The main problem is the problem of the husband who absconds across the sea.  Our Bill will not solve that problem, and we admit it frankly; but there are husbands in the country who are within reach of the courts, who have perhaps set up establishments separately from their wives but are still within the reach of the courts, and these husbands are getting away with murder.  They are not contributing to the social welfare payment to their deserted wives and the maximum that can be extracted from them by a court order is £4 a week.  Now Fine Gael is black in the face asking questions about this.  No fewer than 12 questions have been put down by the Opposition, most of them from Fine Gael, in the last three years and all <Col N="187" /> we have got is the promise that legislation was on the way.</P>
    <P>That seems to us simply not good enough.  I want to protest formally against the Government attitude here that it is enough to shoot down this Bill by saying: &ldquo;We are going to bring in a Bill of our own.&rdquo;  What is wrong with this Bill that could not be amended here in this House by the advice of the Minister for Justice's Department? What is wrong with it that could not be healed by that advice if it were forthcoming?  I realise that the time of the Minister is limited but there is nothing in the Standing Orders of this House which requires the Minister to be present.  He has got a front bench; what else are they there for?  He has got men under him.  He can say to one of them &ldquo;come&rdquo; and he cometh and to another &ldquo;go&rdquo; and he goeth.  He does not have to be here himself. The Minister for Justice can have his permanent representatives and advisers behind him and his political associates in front of him.  He need not be here at all.  A Bill of this kind could pass this House in all Stages very quickly and with the minimum of controversy from either side and would right a major social injustice.</P>
    <P>We must express the deepest dissatisfaction that the Government are treating our proposal in this way.  It seems to me to be absolutely beyond belief that the Government put on the long finger a problem like this which is so simple.  It is not a question of taking money out of the public purse. Nobody will have to pay 6p more in rates or in tax if this proposal is carried through.  All we are proposing is that the absconding husband should be made liable for more than £4 per week where he is able to bear the load, should be made liable for it in order to support the wife and family that he has deserted, a wife, possibly, who is not able to support herself in sickness or through illness, where she has such a large family that she cannot go out to work.  It makes a queer sight of Article 45 of the Constitution, the directive principles of social policy, enshrined in our basic law at the instance of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It <Col N="188" /> puts that against a queer background when we now hear, not for the first time but probably for the 21st time, that legislation is in the pipeline to right this wrong.  This party object in the strongest way to the Seanad being treated like this, to Private Members' Business being treated like this and to deserted wives being treated like this.  I have to protest in the strongest possible language which I regret using to day to Senator Ó Maoláin.  I am sorry to speak like this to him.  I know that he has lost a dear friend and I unaffectedly sympathise with him and his other political associates in their loss.  But I protest very strongly at the way this House is being treated and at the way that Private Members' Business, as represented by this move of our party, is being treated in this regard.</P>

I exposed this thing in the Seanad before and I must do it again because I do not see any reason why this lie should be allowed to go around the country unchecked.  Fine Gael are in receipt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact remains that Senator Kelly has stated that the Government have a Civil Service, have <Col N="189" /> officials but Fine Gael have no source from which they can derive any facts, figures or anything else.  They have to work night and day to find them.  The fact remains that an allowance is made by Parliament to the Fine Gael Party for the very purpose of employing sufficient statisticians to provide them with ammunition to do whatever they can to defeat the Government and there is no reason in the world why Senator Kelly should come with that béal bocht story here now.

    <Title>Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to remove certain restraints on the operations of the Industrial Credit Company which experience over the years has shown to be no longer necessary.  The opportunity is also being availed of to increase the limits on the company's authorised share capital and borrowing powers and to introduce certain minor amendments to the existing legislation to give the company more flexibility in relation to the appointment of a managing director and general manager and to facilitate it in relation to the submission of its annual accounts to the Minister for Finance.  A provision in relation to the position of directors and staff of the company who may become <Col N="191" /> Members of either House of the Oireachtas is also included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The ICC has been in operation since 1933 when it was set up to provide financial facilities for Irish industry. During the 37 years since its establishment, it has provided capital for industry by way of loans, share investment, machinery finance and guarantees to the extent of more than £52 million and in addition it has underwritten capital flotations in excess of £21 million.  It has now established a position as the major institution providing long-term loan capital for Irish-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation&mdash;the Industrial Credit Act, 1933&mdash;the ICC may issue loans to companies operating in this country, whether or not they are registered here, but it may not take up shares in foreign-registered companies even to finance their Irish operations.  The restriction in relation to share investment in foreign-registered companies was originally based on the principle that, as share capital cannot be secured by a charge on the assets, there was no way of ensuring that finance injected into a company in the form of share capital would be used for a particular purpose.</P>
      <P>This differentiation is not considered to be justified in modern conditions and it sets an unnecessary limitation on the scope of the ICC's facilities. Section 3 of the Bill has the effect of removing this limitation and gives the ICC power to invest in the share capital of any company which operates a business in this country, whether or not it is registered within the State. The company will ensure that any such share investment is used for the benefit of projects within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill also provides that the ICC may issue unsecured loans.  Under present legislation the ICC may not lend money without security and this restriction is considered by the company to be anomalous. At times there are practical difficulties in obtaining adequate security for a loan and potentially desirable clients may be deterred from approaching the ICC for facilities because of their inability or unwillingness to give security for a loan.  Competitor organisations <Col N="192" /> are free to issue loans without security and the ICC feel that the existing legislation places them at a disadvantage.  In the event of the winding up of a business concern loan capital even though unsecured would rank before share capital in the distribution of the assets.  I might add that over 80 per cent of the ICC's investment in industry is in the form of loans including hire-purchase and leasing.</P>
    <P>With the advent of free trade it is already apparent that the need for Irish businesses to have external associations for the marketing of their goods abroad is becoming increasingly important.  While the ICC may at present assist Irish-based companies in the acquisition, establishment or development of overseas subsidiary or associated companies, it can only do so by lending to or investing in the Irish parent company.  It may not assist the overseas subsidiary or associated company direct.  This is considered to be a shortcoming which should be removed so that, if a particular situation requires, the ICC may provide finance directly to a subsidiary or associated company rather than to the parent company.  Section 3 of the Bill gives the extra power to the company in this regard subject to the overriding safeguard that such investment is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry within the State. Before a company can qualify for subsidiary or associated status for the purposes of this section, more than one-fifth&mdash;in nominal value&mdash;of its voting shares must be held by the parent company.</P>
    <P>In removing these various restrictions it has been considered preferable to restate in full the principal objects of the company rather than merely to amend the existing provisions of the 1933 Act.  Section 3 has been drafted with this in mind.</P>
    <P>The present authorised share capital of the ICC is £10 million while the limit on the company's borrowing powers is £15 million.  The issued share capital is now approximately £8.8 million, virtually all of which is held by the Minister for Finance, while total borrowing by the company is approximately <Col N="193" /> £12 million.  The company's activities have expanded rapidly over the past few years; for instance, the provision made in the Public Capital Programme for 1971-72 for assistance to industry by the ICC is £9.3 million &mdash;including £1.8 million for loans by its subsidiary, Shipping Finance Corporation&mdash;compared with an outturn of £6.3 million&mdash;including £2.0 million for Shipping Finance Corporation&mdash;in 1970-71.  It is expected that the present expansionary trend will continue and, accordingly, it is desirable to ensure that the statutory limits of share investment and borrowings will be adequate to meet the company's needs over the next four or five years.  It is proposed, therefore, to raise the share capital limit to £12 million&mdash;section 2 &mdash;and the borrowing limit to £30 million&mdash;section 3.  It is hoped that an increasing share of the company's new capital requirements will be forthcoming from non-Exchequer sources including receipts from its recently introduced deposits scheme.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation the ICC must have a managing director.  This arrangement is considered to be too inflexible as it requires that the chief executive must always be chosen from among the small number of board members.  In fact since May, 1969, when the latest serving managing director retired, the post of chief executive has been filled by a general manager in anticipation of amending legislation.  Section 4 of the Bill covers the proposed change in the arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned earlier that provision is being made in section 5 for raising the statutory limit on borrowing by the company to £30 million.  The same section also provides that the company may borrow in currencies other than Irish currency.  The existing statutory provisions relating to borrowing by the company have been interpreted as empowering the company to borrow in Irish currency only. Suitable opportunities for foreign borrowing may arise from time to time and in fact arrangements for a loan from the World Bank have been substantially completed.  It is considered that there should be no restriction on <Col N="194" /> foreign borrowing where it is in the national interest.  Since the 1933 legislation no borrowing could be undertaken by the company except with the consent of the Minister for Finance and it is not the intention to alter this arrangement. For the sake of simplicity section 5 sets out in full the new proposed borrowing powers which will replace the earlier provisions.</P>
    <P>At present the ICC is required to submit its annual accounts, duly audited, to the Minister for Finance within 90 days after the end of each accounting year.  As the volume of its business grows the company is finding it increasingly difficult to meet this deadline and has asked for some relief. Provision is being made in section 6 that in any year, on application by the company, the Minister for Finance may extend the 90-day period to whatever extent he considers reasonable.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee the company's borrowings.  As a consequence of the extended borrowing powers being provided for in section 5 it is necessary to extend similarly the Minister's existing powers to give guarantees and this is the main purpose of section 7.  The section also provides that in addition to guaranteeing principal and interest of a loan the Minister may guarantee any incidental expenses payable by the ICC in relation to such a loan.  The World Bank has specified that a condition of the loan, to which I have already referred, shall be that, in addition to guaranteeing the principal and interest, the Minister for Finance must also guarantee the commitment fee payable in respect of the loan and also any premiums for which the ICC may be liable in the event of its repaying all or part of the loan prior to the scheduled dates for repayment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes certain provisions&mdash;section 8&mdash;as regards membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas by directors, officers and servants of the company.  These provisions which for some time past have been included in legislation relating to State-sponsored bodies are not in the ICC legislation and it is considered that the opportunity offered by the present Bill should be taken to extend them to the <Col N="195" /> ICC.  No provision is being made, however, in regard to superannuation arrangements for officers and servants seconded to the Oireachtas because this is being dealt with in a general Bill concerning the directors and staff of State-sponsored bodies who become Members of either House of the Oireachtas which is at present being prepared.  The intention of the general Bill will be to introduce uniform arrangements for all State-sponsored bodies including those which already have their own provisions governing this matter in their individual legislation.  So far as superannuation provisions are concerned the intention will be to ensure that the period of Oireachtas service of a staff member may not be reckoned both for an Oireachtas pension and for a staff pension. If, however, he does not qualify for an Oireachtas pension he will on payment of the appropriate pension contributions have the period of his Oireachtas service, during which he was seconded from his employment, reckoned for pension purposes under his occupational scheme.</P>
    <P>Since it was set up in 1933 the ICC has operated on commercial lines with due regard to its role as an instrument of national development.  Its facilities have been availed of over the entire range of industry and in all parts of the country by large, medium and small undertakings.  It provides a full range of industrial financing facilities to promote both the establishment of new industries and the development of existing ones.  Its recent entry into the field of finance for the distributive sector, the establishment of a separate company &mdash; Mergers Ltd. &mdash; to initiate and facilitate mergers and the introduction of a scheme for the provision of finance for under-capitalised concerns are all indicative of the company's flexibility in servicing the varying requirements of the business community. The new mergers subsidiary specialises in the field of mergers and takeovers, undertaking share evaluations, advising on terms and assisting in negotiations for mergers.</P>
    <P>The capital requirements of both existing and new industries have <Col N="196" /> changed materially in recent times both as to their nature and extent, and the current activities of the ICC must, therefore, be seen against a much more sophisticated and developed situation than that which prevailed up to a few years ago when demands for capital were relatively small and the sources from which these demands might be met were very few.  It is essential that the company should be in a position to provide capital on very flexible terms towards the further development of Irish industry.  For this reason it is considered that in the present industrial environment the existing restrictions on share capital investment and unsecured loans should be removed. It is equally important that adequate funds be available for the company's expanding activities.</P>
    <P>I might say that Senators will have noticed that a motion was moved by the Leader of the House to dispense with the rule requiring three days' notice of this Bill.  The reason for this is that the World Bank Loan, to which I have referred, has been sanctioned subject to the enactment of certain provisions in this Bill.  Consequently, I should be grateful to the House if it were possible to take all Stages of this Bill today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the Bill as a further indication of the progress made by the Industrial Credit Company since its establishment in 1933 on the initiative of the man to whom generous tributes were paid today by the Leader of the House and by Senator Michael O'Higgins, the late Seán Lemass.  It is a pity that a Bill of this type was not initiated in the Seanad because most of us would agree that this is the type of work for which the Seanad is perhaps best suited.  I regret that the Minister now finds it necessary to ask for the co-operation of the Seanad in getting all Stages of the Bill through today, but I should like to assure him that we shall certainly cooperate with him in that regard.  However, it does prevent any question of amendments to the Bill and for that reason our discussions and observations must be largely of an academic nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> I should like to avail of the opportunity of paying a generous tribute to the work of the Industrial Credit Company since its establishment 37 years ago and, in particular, to its chairman, Dr. Beddy, who for many years has been associated with industrial development, the financing of new industries and the extension of existing industries.  He has shown himself to be a man of outstanding ability and a man who understands the national needs in regard to economic growth and expansion, and how important it is for the provision of increased industrial employment.  As one who has known him for some years, and who has had some experience in dealing with him in matters of industrial development, I am very happy to be in a position to pay a well-deserved tribute to Dr. Beddy.</P>
    <P>Since the ICC was established it has adopted a policy of taking calculated risks while at the same time exercising reasonable prudence in advancing the taxpayers' funds to commercial and industrial concerns.  In the vast majority of cases the investments have paid off, notwithstanding the fact that at all times they have not been free of political pressures.  Over the years the ICC have built up a team of expert and experienced personnel who are fully competent to engage in negotiations with industrial and financial experts over a wide field.  This is most important in this age of mergers and take-overs, which cross national boundaries and involve huge sums of capital, and to which the Minister has referred in his speech.  While naturally the primary consideration of the Industrial Credit Company has been the prudent use of the taxpayers' funds in companies offering opportunities of growth and expansion, the board of the company has at all times been mindful of the human element where employment has been in danger due to shortage of long-term capital, involving an element of risk.  In this way the Industrial Credit Company has filled a void which existed between the commercial banks, on the one hand, who understandably were principally concerned with the safety of their depositors' capital, and on the other hand institutions and individuals <Col N="198" /> whose main concern was the higher reward which they demanded for capital put at risk.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has indicated, the conditions which operated at the establishment of the Industrial Credit Company in 1933 and for several years afterwards have vastly changed.  The company was established in an era of protection which has now passed and we are engaged in an era of fierce international competition in which no rules or regulations in regard to the protection of national boundaries now obtain.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some brief comments on the Bill as presented to us and, while I realise that they cannot now be incorporated in amendments to the Bill, I hope that at least they will be worthy of the Minister's consideration, when he is bringing further legislation before the House in regard to the expansion of the Industrial Credit Company, which I hope will be reasonably soon.  I am sorry that the Minister did not see fit to increase the share capital to at least £15 million, in view of the continuing depreciation in the value of money and the penal rate of company taxation.  It is obvious that companies will, more and more, be unable to fund expansion from their own resources, and consequently will have to resort to the Industrial Credit Company for financial help.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that under the provisions of this Bill the Industrial Credit Company will be in a position to advance financial help to companies with subsidiaries outside this country. I hope that this means in effect that Irish companies with enterprising boards of directors will be assured of the necessary financial help if they should decide to expand overseas in any foreign country, either by way of establishing new industries, extending existing industries, or by taking over companies outside this country.  If this country is going to expand its industrial arm under free trade conditions, it is vitally necessary that an offensive attitude should be developed among more of our businessmen.  In other words, instead of thinking in terms only of defending our home market, which in some cases will be indefensible anyway, <Col N="199" /> we should be thinking of going into enemy territory, so to speak, and establishing new or branch industries in sectors which offer reasonable chances of expansion and profitability.</P>
    <P>In reading through the Industrial Credit Company's report for last year, I notice that a branch of the company was established in Cork.  I should like to suggest to the Minister, and perhaps through him to the board of the Industrial Credit Company, that it would be a wise provision to extend this establishment of branches to other areas outside Dublin and Cork. Naturally, I have in mind the Limerick-Shannon area but there are other areas in the country designated or indicated as obvious growth centres where a branch of the Industrial Credit Company could be established with considerable advantage to the area.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Bill provides for the appointment of a general manager for the reasons outlined by the Minister in his introductory speech. In securing personnel for the Industrial Credit Company the board should not be inhibited in any way.  If necessary they should go outside the country to get the best possible man for the important position of general manager. It would be very shortsighted policy if they were restricted in any way by appointing one of their own number to the position of managing director. This is a very useful provision and certainly opens up a much wider field for the selection and appointment of expert staff to the key position of general manager.</P>
    <P>When I first read through the Bill I thought that the Minister was going to take his courage in his hands and to bring in a Bill which, in respect of one State-sponsored company, would cease to include the provision that, if a director or a member of the staff or an officer of the company is nominated to either House of the Oireachtas, he must cease to be a member of the company.  However, I see that the Minister is now making a provision to include in this Bill that unwarranted provision to which a lot of people have objected down the years.  I cannot see any reason why if a man is nominated&mdash;it <Col N="200" /> does not mean elected&mdash;to a House of the Oireachtas he automatically ceases to be a member of the board or a member of the staff of the Industrial Credit Company.  I think this is a retrograde step.  This practice has crept into all the State and semi-State companies and now it is obviously going to be included in any new company that is set up by the State.  I think it is an indefensible provision. It is undemocratic.  I am sorry that the Minister found it necessary to follow what I think is a very wrong precedent in introducing it or bringing it into the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a very substantial increase in the borrowing powers of the company to £30 million.  This is a very wise and very necessary provision. It also provides that the company can borrow outside the country, which is another very necessary provision.  I agree with the Minister when he says that in this day and age a company that wants to succeed must get capital. It must not be inhibited from borrowing outside the country.  In saying this I think I have the Minister's agreement in the viewpoint that borrowing outside the country apart from the inflationary tendencies is, or rather should be, limited, and that the raising of funds inside the country is a far more desirable way of not alone expanding industries individually but also of providing capital for the expansion of industry generally.  I hope that the board, although they have got this permission to do so now, will be reasonably prudent in seeking capital for their activities outside the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other points of a general nature which I would like to make at this stage.  I should like to say one or two things when we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I welcome the Bill.  I think all the Senators welcome it as a further indication of the progress of this company. I hope that the Minister will be coming back to us shortly to remedy some of the defects that I see in the Bill.  They are of a minor nature but I hope that the company will be requiring an increase on the share capital limit of £12 million which is suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> The company have indicated to the Minister that they might find it difficult under certain conditions to comply with the requirements of the present Act by submitting their accounts within 90 days after the end of the financial year, which happens to coincide with the calendar year.  I looked at their last two or three accounts and I find that they have been extremely prompt in submitting them within two months of the end of the calendar year.  I am just wondering now why this provision is required.  I think they are asking for rather too much and I think that some provision should be made whereby a limit should still be written into the Bill to provide that the Minister may extend the period but not further than, say, six months.  I am still rather at sea as to why the company have put in this request having regard to the fact that they do not appear to have used the full 90 days in submitting their accounts.  That is all I wish to say at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill, I appreciate that at this stage, having regard to the fact that all Stages of the Bill had to be taken today, there is not very much point in suggesting what appear to me to be possible improvements that could have been made.  First of all I noticed that where 20 per cent of the capital of a foreign subsidiary is held by an Irish company loans may be made.  I would have liked to have seen that figure 25 per cent.  Subject to correction, I believe the law in this country, and I think in very many countries, is that you can make certain alterations in a company only if you have more than a 75 per cent floating capital.  That means that anybody who holds 25 per cent is reasonably secure. If he holds less than 25 per cent of the capital he is completely at the mercy of the foreign capitalists who have the money in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Bill gives power for borrowing abroad.  Like Senator Russell, I welcome that authority, but I feel that borrowing abroad has a very grave inflationary effect on the economy of the country and that is one thing in particular at the present time which we must be on guard against.  I would say that money could be got at home <Col N="202" /> much more readily by the Industrial Credit Company if they would make their terms for loans more attractive than they are at the moment.  I took the trouble, on behalf of clients who wished to lodge money on deposit either with the Agricultural Credit Corporation or with the Industrial Credit Company, of inquiring from both.  At first glance it would appear that the terms of the Industrial Credit Company are attractive but there is a provision that unless one leaves one's money there for 12 months one does not get the full benefit.  On the other hand, theoretically there is the same provision with the Agricultural Credit Corporation but they have found from experience that where clients approach solicitors&mdash;and very many people do lodge very substantial sums over the years through their solicitors&mdash;that though the money is on call within one month usually it is never withdrawn for a period of two, three or four years.  It would leave a very considerable amount of money on their hands instead of borrowing abroad and, therefore, it would avoid this inflationary possibility. It would be an encouragement also to saving money on deposit with the Industrial Credit Company.  I am sure they do not need any amendment of the Bill to do that.  I find from my experience that some people would have sums varying from £5,000 to £20,000 which they are prepared to lodge on deposit either with the Industrial Credit Company or with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I find that there is an inhibiting effect there and I would submit that it should be considered.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Russell I welcome section 8 of the Bill which provides that the director of a company may not be a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I did not say that. &ldquo;Nominated&rdquo; was the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Nominated.  If he is not elected he can later be reappointed on the board if they think he is really worthwhile.  It is most important that party politics and business be kept completely separated because not only must those in power act fairly, justly <Col N="203" /> and honestly in dealing on their merits but they must appear to do so.  Among other things it prevents unfair criticisms of the Government.  If somebody is appointed to a board of directors, even though he is very highly qualified if he happens to be a party supporter he is immediately open to suspicion and to criticism.  To avoid the possibility of such criticism I think that a provision to this effect dealing with all State companies is very useful.  Those are the only suggestions I can make in reference to the Bill.  I think it is a most useful piece of legislation and a most important and necessary one.</P>

      <P>In joining with other Senators in welcoming this Bill I should like to ask the Minister for some information, as somebody who knows very little about the Industrial Credit Company, but anything I do know is to the credit of that company&mdash;and that is not an unpleasant pun! I should like to ask the Minister the size of the staff employed by the company and if he could give an estimate as to the wages bill that the company pays out and the managerial expenses.  This is just to put it in perspective.  I should also like to ask if it is proposed, seeing that the company's facilities are being expanded and their borrowing power increased, to increase the actual size of the company in terms of employment and, therefore, the wages bill.</P>

      <P>The first question I was going to ask was answered by the Minister in his final remarks in his introductory speech, or at least he attempted to give an explanation. That is: why hurry this Bill through the Dáil in one day and through the Seanad the next day?  He gave as the reason that both Houses must pass this in order to avail of the loan from the International Monetary Fund.  I think that was his statement.  If that is so, we must have applied for a loan from the International Monetary Fund at some stage or other, and why could this Bill not have been introduced then and dealt with in the usual fashion? This is a point that is not very clear to me.  From what I know, this has been on the stocks since 1970.</P>

      <P>I see, the Minister referred to shares invested in foreign registered companies.  He said that the restriction on such investment was originally based on the principle that share capital cannot be secured by a charge on the assets.  In other words a loan will enter in as a common and ordinary debt but if a company goes into compulsory liquidation a share will not enter as a common and ordinary debt.  Its payment has to to await the payment of all common debts.  That is correct.  The Minister's point here is valid.  He ends up that particular paragraph on the second page:</P>
      <P>The company will ensure that any such share investment is used for the benefit of projects within the State.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I did not go through to the Bill.  I had no opportunity, of course, as the Minister will appreciate.  It is very difficult for the Opposition at this stage to be quite accurate, but I should like to know from the Minister in his reply how he can ensure that what he states will be done.  I am in agreement with what is in this Bill, but I have doubts about the implementation of certain things stated in this Bill.  The sureties given are not as adequate as they appear.</P>
      <P>Lending without security raises another grave doubt in my mind but again I will go along with the Bill and say that we have got to do it. However, it is something none of us likes to do.</P>
      <P>The question of foreign borrowing was dealt with by Senator Russell and Senator Nash, with both of whom I agree on this particular point.  Not alone is foreign borrowing inflationary and internal borrowing deflationary, but internal borrowing also allows the profits of the loans raised to be spent within the country, whereas with foreign borrowing the profits on those loans are spent outside the country. I cannot make a general statement that I would never accept the idea of foreign borrowing, but I would go 90 per cent of the way in saying we should not have foreign borrowing.  There may be occasions where it would be necessary. However, in general I dislike the idea completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will just advert to the point Senator Russell raised about membership of the Oireachtas and with which Senator Nash did not agree.  I oppose this provision.  I cannot remember exactly what Bill it was, but this provision was also contained in another Bill.  I opposed it but it went through. The Minister said he wants this to conform with other State bodies.  But if he means that, is there not an omission in section 8 which says: &ldquo;where a director of the Company is nominated he shall thereupon cease to be a <Col N="206" /> director of the Company.&rdquo;  Should there not be an addition here that, where a person is nominated to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, he should not therefore be appointed to the Company?  Is that not an omission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be very few.  I think the point which Senator Belton made on section 3 is a valid one.  It is one on which I should like to hear more from the Minister, that is, the question of the Industrial Credit Company being able to ensure that share investment of the type visualised is used for the benefit of projects within the State.  That is not what is stated in the Bill.  It is what the Minister argued when he was introducing the Bill and it may very well be that the Minister or the company have some scheme worked out whereby they can ensure that the share investment will be used for the benefit of projects within the State.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) (c) (ii) refers to where it &ldquo;is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State&rdquo;.  Again, in subparagraph (iv) of that section it says &ldquo;that every such loan or advance is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State&rdquo;.  That is as far as the Bill goes.  I should like to know if the Minister has something further in mind when he puts that&mdash;in the Bill the word &ldquo;likely&rdquo; is used&mdash;virtually on the basis of a guarantee that the company are going to ensure a particular thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make is in connection with unsecured loans.  I am a bit doubtful about this.  I can see the advantages from the point of <Col N="207" /> view of the Industrial Credit Company that their hands should be freed in the matter and that they should be put on a more competitive basis in being permitted by this legislation to give loans which may be unsecured.  But it is necessary to remember in this connection that here we are dealing with money provided by the State, that is, money provided by the taxpayer.  The position of the competitors of the ICC is that they are using their own money or their shareholders' money.  They are not using the State's money or the people's money.  I think it is only right to express some degree of doubt that we should by legislation in the Oireachtas give <i>carte blanche</i> to the Industrial Credit Company or any other State or semi-State body to give loans without security.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his statement that in the event of the winding-up of a business concern loan capital, even though unsecured, would rank before share capital in the distribution of assets.  That is all very fine but it is still not any security so far as the public, for whom we in this matter are trustees, are concerned.  We are saying here to the Industrial Credit Company: &ldquo;You may give money out on loan without any security at all.&rdquo;  That is the effect of this.  I know that the practicality of the matter will be that the Industrial Credit Company are not going to give loans without security unless they are as satisfied as they can be that the loan is all right and that it is going to be repaid.  However, I think it is only right that that doubt should be expressed in this House.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is on the question of giving loans direct to non-Irish based companies.  The Minister points out in his introductory speech that at the moment assistance can be given by the ICC by the machinery of giving the assistance to the parent home-based company but not direct to a subsidiary based abroad.  I think that summarises the Ministers remarks reasonably accurately. He then made the point that if a particular situation requires it the ICC may provide finance directly to a subsidiary or associated company rather than the parent company.  I <Col N="208" /> would like to know if in using the phrase &ldquo;if a particular situation requires&rdquo;&mdash;I take it that it was used deliberately by the Minister&mdash;if there was a particular situation in the Minister's mind or in the minds of the ICC when this particular relaxation was decided upon?  It does not seem to me to be any particular hardship, from the point of view of the ICC in any event, that the existing machinery should continue to be adopted, namely that the financial assistance or loan provided by the ICC should be to the Irish-based parent company and that the Irish-based parent company should then make their own arrangements with their subsidiaries for passing on the benefit of the loan or finance of an equivalent amount to their subsidiary companies.  It may be that some particular problem has arisen which requires this but in the absence of knowing that such a problem, which was of a nature that is not easily surmountable, has arisen I cannot readily see the necessity for bringing about this particular change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Senator O'Higgins in expressing doubts about unsecured loans is also, by expressing that doubt, expressing doubt about the desirability of the Industrial Credit Company investing in shares.  It seems to me that the order of desirability, from the point of view of the security of public funds, should be firstly secured loan capital.  The second desirability in order of preference is unsecured loan capital and the third is the investment of shares.  We reckon that secured loan is better than unsecured loan.  If you object to unsecured loan you must necessarily say that the Industrial Credit Company should be very wary indeed about purchasing shares in any concern.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to express appreciation of the general welcome given to this Bill by Senators.  Senator Russell paid a tribute to the work of the Industrial Credit Company and to the work of Dr. Beddy.  I should like to endorse that tribute which I think is well deserved.</P>
      <P>Now I should like to refer to the specific points raised.  First, I should like to refer to the point raised by Senator Russell where he thought that the increase in the share capital should be bigger.  All I can say to him is that it is envisaged that the increase proposed in this Bill in the share capital and in the borrowing limit should be adequate for a few years.  After that time it will be necessary to come back to both Houses of the Oireachtas to amend it.  As Senators will appreciate, this is the normal procedure with regard to State companies for which money is provided by the Oireachtas.  It is a machinery by which a periodic review of the work of these companies comes up and enables the Oireachtas to have a look at their work and comment on it where necessary.  I do not think that the increase would be inadequate for the next few years at any rate.</P>
      <P>A point which was raised by Senator Russell and referred to by a number of other speakers was the provision in section 8 about membership of the Oireachtas.  There is a difference in the section between the method of dealing with a director, a member of the board of the Industrial Credit Company and the method of dealing with an officer or servant of the company.  In the case of a director, he ceases to be a director on being nominated to stand for election or, indeed, on being nominated directly to the Seanad by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case it is felt that, as a member of the board, he is a policy maker and he is involved in the final decisions on loan applications.  If he were nominated to stand for either House he would clearly be involved whether he was a party member or <Col N="210" /> not, in canvassing and party political activity.  In these circumstances it is desirable that he ceases to be a member of the board of the ICC which is a part-time appointment.  The situation is treated differently in the case of an officer or servant to whom this applies; if he actually becomes a Member and serves in either House of the Oireachtas, he is on secondment from the ICC until his membership of either House ceases.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton raised the point that there is no provision in the Bill to prohibit the appointment of a director who has, in fact, been nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas. The Senator is correct in making that point.  It is a risk which hardly needs to be guarded against because the intention is set out in the section.  If a man who is a director has to cease being a director on being nominated, it is contrary to the spirit of the section that such a man should be newly appointed then as a director of the ICC.  I cannot conceive of any such appointment being made.  I will bear this matter in mind and see if we should tie up that end completely when further legislation in connection with the ICC is being brought forward.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to foreign borrowing and I agree that this is not as desirable as borrowing at home. Excessive foreign borrowing is totally undesirable.  I do not wish to get involved in a discussion on the economic aspects of borrowing.  If we must borrow at all, and we must to some extent, there is a good deal to be said for borrowing from the World Bank if we can do so.  The terms to be obtained from the World Bank are much more attractive than are available from other sources abroad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will realise that borrowing from the World Bank is not a simple proposition.  It involves putting forward projects which fit within the terms of reference of the World Bank and very detailed assessment and negotiation takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the point made by Senator Belton it is true that the Bill was prepared and was in the pipeline some <Col N="211" /> time ago.  This point made by the World Bank arose in the course of protracted negotiations and after the Bill had been prepared.  I moved an amendment to the Bill to deal with this point in Dáil Éireann yesterday.  I mention this to illustrate that the point arose late in the day and this is the reason it was not dealt with in the Bill originally, as the question had not arisen at that time.  It arose out of negotiations with the World Bank.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the 90-day limitation on the furnishing of the audited accounts of the ICC, the end of the financial year for the ICC is the 31st October.  Senator Russell was mistaken in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact the last account was some days late.  This illustrates the point I was making that the company are having increasing difficulty in meeting the time limit.</P>
      <P>The idea of laying down a time limit within which the accounts must be furnished, as suggested by Senator Russell, is an idea that occurred to me, but on further thought I felt that this could be an invitation to extend the time laid down in the Bill.  What we are providing puts the onus on the company in any year where they have to go beyond the 90 days to make a specific application to the Minister and then the Minister, having questioned as to why the extension is required, can lay down the limit appropriate to what the particular difficulties of that year are.  To lay down a limit now in the Bill would act as a permanent extension and inducement&mdash;inducement may be too strong a word but something similar&mdash;not to get in the accounts as fast as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the point raised by Senator Nash in connection with the 20 per cent or more than 20 per cent of voting shares being laid down as a requirement to qualify as an overseas subsidiary or associated company, this provision is related to the provision in the Companies Act, 1963.  It provides that the qualification for constituting one company as an associated company <Col N="212" /> of another is more than 20 per cent of the voting shares.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Nash's point about the attractiveness or otherwise of the deposit rates offered by the ICC and I will pass on his comments to the company.  Perhaps their terms can be altered in order to attract more deposits.</P>
    <P>Senator West asked a number of questions.  For the year ended 31st October, 1970, the number of employees was 71.  Wages and salaries amounted to £123,000 and administrative expenses £83,000.  There is no specific proposal to increase the number of the staff, but the activities of the company have been growing considerably. We are anticipating further growth and it is quite likely that there will be an increase in the staff.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of lending without security, there are two points I should like to make.  One is that the ICC are in competition with a number of other commercial companies who can and do on occasions lend without security.  Since they are in competition, their activities are somewhat restricted if they cannot have the same kind of approach where this makes sense.  Of course, there is no question of the Industrial Credit Company offering unsecured loans on a widespread scale.  Senators will realise that this is something that does not happen.  The kind of situation where it can arise is one in which the particular package deal that can be offered to a borrower might well include a loan which is secured and a further loan which is unsecured.  This can be related to the circumstances of the particular company in regard to its existing borrowing, and to its capital structure in general.  It is a situation which is unlikely to arise very often. However, in any case in which the board of the ICC were to decide to give an unsecured loan, Senators can rest assured that the assessment is made very carefully and that there is no undue risk being taken.</P>
    <P>There was a point raised about my use of the phrase &ldquo;The company will ensure that any such share investment is used for the benefit of projects within <Col N="213" /> the State&rdquo;.  This is in relation to section 3.  The phrase in section 3 corresponding with that is &ldquo;likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State&rdquo;.  Senator O'Higgins suggested that these are not the same things, that in order to conform with what I said one would really need a guarantee and of course one could not give a guarantee in these circumstances.  I would suggest that the Senator is mistaken because the company can ensure this in so far as they can lay down specific conditions under which they are prepared to make such share investment and ensure that such conditions are carried out before they make the investment; or at least they should have some form of right of action if the conditions laid down are not complied with.  To this extent they can ensure that the share investment is used for the benefit of projects within the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I was about to say something which perhaps misrepresents what the Senator has in mind.  It just occurred to me as I was about to say it.  I took it that what he was really saying was guaranteeing that in the long term this was going to be of benefit.  What I had in mind was that you cannot guarantee that a particular project will be successful.  It may go wrong, in which event I suppose it would not ultimately before the benefit of a trade or industry within the State. But in so far as you can ensure that the money is invested for the benefit of a trade or industry in the State, this can be done and will be done.  However, you cannot guarantee that it will, forever more, remain for the benefit of a trade or industry in the State, in the sense that the business may fail. Subject to that, you can ensure it in the case of any particular share investment by applying the necessary conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As the Senator will appreciate, however, not that the shares will be taken up in an Irish company but in a company abroad.  If it is £20,000 in shares, that £20,000 of benefit would accrue to the Irish trade or industry.  In so far as this can be ensured it will be ensured and this is the onus that is being put on the ICC in relation to such investments.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins also questioned why the ICC could not carry on as it does at the moment in dealing with a company abroad having a subsidiary here, and simply invest the money or give the loan to a company here instead of giving it to the parent company. I am not aware of any particular case having arisen which would call for this amendment, but I am aware or I can visualise circumstances in which this difficulty could arise.  If the Irish subsidiary were so geared financially that a further loan from the Industrial Credit Company would put its performance out of gear and would not be able perhaps to repay the loan, then one can see that the investment might perhaps have to be made to the parent company.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to clarify one point in the Bill which I cannot reconcile with his introductory statement.  As I understand it, under the provisions of this Bill&mdash;in fact I commented on this matter when I was speaking&mdash;an Irish company with a subsidiary company or associate company, say, in Great Britain or anywhere else, which wishes to expand or which, to go a step further, proposes to expand, the subsidiary can now get a loan from the Industrial Credit Company.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the subsidiary being abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not read that anywhere in the Bill.  It always refers to carrying on in the State.  In all subsections of section 3 the reference is made to &ldquo;the State&rdquo;, which I take to be this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that at present the Industrial Credit Company have in fact invested money in Irish companies where the parent company is within the State, and which has a subsidiary company abroad.  In the main this has been satisfactory in so far as they have been able to deal with the parent company which is within <Col N="216" /> the State, and for the benefit of the company abroad.  But if you have a reverse situation where you have the parent company abroad and the subsidiary company here, and the subsidiary company is looking for assistance from the Industrial Credit Company&mdash;in fact the subsidiary company may not even be registered in this country; it may be operating here but not registered&mdash;in those cases the ICC are not permitted by law to take up shares in the company because it is not registered here.  What we are providing for here is that in such cases the ICC may invest in the foreign registered company but where they do so they must be satisfied that the investment is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry within the State. It is the reverse of the situation that Senator Russell envisages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
      <P>While the ICC may at present assist Irish-based companies in the acquisition, establishment or development of overseas subsidiaries or associated companies, it can only do so by lending to or investing in the Irish parent company.  It may not assist the overseas subsidiary or associated company direct.  This is considered to be a shortcoming which should be removed.</P>
      <P>Where is it removed in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have referred to in my speech is the fact that you can assist an Irish registered company under the law as it stands.  This is enabling assistance to be given to an non-Irish registered company provided that they operate for the benefit of a trade or industry within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is an Irish parent company at the moment the only assistance that can be given is by loan.  Is that not correct?  So the Minister's speech said.  Now it is proposed to give the ICC powers to invest in the Irish subsidiary overseas.  I take it by invest it means taking up shares in that also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot read that into this Bill because it refers all the time to activities in the State or proposes to carry on activities in the State.  I just cannot see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The reading of it seems to confine it to &ldquo;operation within the State&rdquo;.  I think the question that Senator Russell is putting is: can a loan be given to an Irish company which has a subsidiary outside the State?  Could the money be directed towards benefiting that company, because there have been cases quite recently where Irish companies have taken over very useful channels of distribution overseas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we want to encourage.  I cannot see it in this.  I cannot relate the Minister's speech to any section or subsection of this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Bear with me for a moment until I examine the section more closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely section 4 says: &ldquo;provided that the person is engaged within the State he can also get money to operate outside the State&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Or &ldquo;proposing to engage within the State&rdquo;.  Again the same words are used.  I am talking about &ldquo;proposing to engage outside the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not negatived by the words that follow &ldquo;in which a person engaged&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The qualification is that a person is engaged or proposing to engage in the State.  That is the qualification.  If he is so qualified he can get a loan to operate anywhere. That is how I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided it is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words you <Col N="218" /> cannot have a situation where, say, a German who has never engaged in business here and does not propose engaging in business here can get a loan even though that might ultimately be of benefit here but if he is engaged in business here, even though the company is incorporated and may be operating in Germany, he could get a loan provided it is likely to be of benefit here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words if a foreigner&mdash;we will not mention a German specifically&mdash;proposes to engage in the State now by merely proposing to engage in the State he can get a loan or he can get shares taken up in an associated or subsidiary company, say, in Great Britain or France, by merely proposing to engage in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further qualification. It is not merely that he engages or proposes to engage but in addition the ICC must be satisfied that the project is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State. That is additional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the proposal we are talking about.  If he puts up a good proposal that is likely to be of benefit within the State he can then get assistance to establish the parent industry and concurrently assistance to establish a subsidiary outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot visualise a situation in which somebody outside the State can get a loan or investment from the Industrial Credit Company for an operation outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Both inside and outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is both in and out then clearly you can measure whether it is going to be of benefit to us here. If he is outside the State and he is proposing to operate outside the State and not within the State, I cannot visualise in any circumstances how this can be of benefit.  The Senator's point is that he is proposing to operate here and on that basis he gets in inside the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="219" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>He also gets assistance for a proposed subsidiary outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say to that is that he would have to have a lot more than a mere proposal to get inside this and to satisfy the board of the ICC that he should get assistance under this section.  If he merely had a proposal and was really interested in an operation outside the State how would he demonstrate in those circumstances that the operation was likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State?  He would have to go a great deal further than that to satisfy the board of the Industrial Credit Company that he came within the section at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is most unlikely.  But, in fact, as the Bill reads he can come along and say &ldquo;I want to establish a factory within the State to employ, say, 100 people but it will be necessary in order to do this that I have subsidiary or associate companies all over the place.&rdquo;  If he can sell that to the Industrial Credit Company he qualifies for several loans in that case or other forms of financial assistance.  It might never happen but that is how the Bill reads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In such circumstances it would be contingent on his actually setting up that operation within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="220" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal, but I am saying that in practical terms he could not get a loan which would come within the terms of likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State unless he had fair proposals.  The condition of the loan would be that he would set up the operation here which was going to benefit from it.  I think the House might take it that the Industrial Credit Company are not interested in, and will not be interested in, investing in any operation which is not going to be, in their view, of benefit to a trade or industry within the State however it is presented.</P>
