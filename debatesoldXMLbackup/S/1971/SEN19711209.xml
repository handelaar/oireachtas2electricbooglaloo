      <P>A few weeks ago the Leader of the House, in reply to a query of mine, said he would investigate the possibility of taking Motion No. 21, in the names of Senator Desmond and myself, on the question of the &ldquo;Interim Report on Equal Pay&rdquo;.  On that day all Members on this side of the House were in agreement that if the leader of the House could so arrange it we would, if necessary, have a special sitting to take this motion.  Could the Leader of the House inform us of the outcome of his investigation?</P>

      <P>With all due respect, a Chathaoirleach, I have had <Col N="1758" /> experience of that system for some time and I find, with the number of people who ask questions, that by the time we come to the end of the discussion I cannot keep track of half of the questions.  May I suggest that I should answer them one after another?</P>

      <P>It is not an orderly proceeding.  The Order of Business is a motion and the Standing Order provides that there may be one speech from each Senator on a motion and following this the Leader of the House should conclude.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Senator Ó Maoláin's reply in regard to Motion No. 21, and without prejudice as to whether that was orderly or not, I should like to put forward the point that it would probably be far more appropriate for the Seanad to discuss this motion before the Government reach the final conclusion on it. I think the Seanad&mdash;and I am referring only to the question of the time limit of taking this, and not to its merits&mdash; would be fulfilling a far better function in discussing a subject of great public interest such as this in full debate before a final Government decision has been reached.  In this way we could make a contribution which would be far better than that of discussing afterwards a Government decision which, in 90 cases out of 100, will prove to be immutable.</P>

      <P>I also am a little apprehensive about the reply of the Leader of the House to Motion No. 21. Like Senator Dooge, I feel that a discussion on Motion No. 17, relating to the White Paper on Local Government, would be more appropriate before the Government have decided on action arising out of that White Paper, especially in view of the fact that the White Paper suggests that it would welcome comment.  I should like the Leader of the House to give some indication as to when this motion is likely to be discussed.  I have asked about this twice before but I am sure, <Col N="1759" /> quite inadvertently, the Leader of the House did not manage to reply on the Order of Business as to when this motion might be taken.  It is now suggested that the local government elections are not to be held next year but instead a Bill is to be presented to amalgamate the Dublin authorities and have an election for them and them alone.  Obviously, if this is the case, a discussion on the White Paper would be very appropriate and very timely at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any indication of when the motions in which the Senator is interested will be discussed.  With regard to Senator Dooge's suggestion, if we are to bring forward the motion merely for debating it surely a debating society in one of his colleges would be just as good as the Seanad.  If it is a question of not taking these debates seriously and that you you do not want a governmental view of the situation then you might as well go to a debating society.</P>

      <P>Pursuant to Standing Order 75, a Bill which has been initiated in the Seanad and amended by the Dáil is, after its receipt back from the Dáil, deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage, the Minister, on the Question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, explains the purport of the amendment made by the Dáil, and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters that may be discussed is the Dáil amendment, which is as follows:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 4, line 43, &ldquo;personally&rdquo; added after &ldquo;served&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was moved by Deputies Cooney and Fitzpatrick on Committee Stage in the Dáil and provides for personal service only in an urgent case of summary jurisdiction. I accepted the amendment with considerable misgivings.  There are strong arguments for and against personal service in the type of case envisaged by section 15.</P>
      <P>As section 15 will be invoked only in a situation akin to a national emergency such as a threatened outbreak of foot and mouth disease, it will be essential to bring offenders to justice with the maximum possible speed.  This end will be hindered if a summons has to be served personally and the defendant chooses to evade service; the delay involved could severely threaten the national interest. A lesser consideration, but nevertheless an important one, is the extra work involved for the Garda in serving a summons on an elusive defendant.  If personal service is not effected in time, a fresh summons would have to be sought involving the fixing of a new date for the hearing and this, of course, might have to be repeated depending on the success of the defendant's efforts to evade service.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it was argued that as the minimum time for service is being reduced from seven to two days, the usual arrangements for service do not adequately safeguard the interests of the individual.  Rules of Court provide that a summons can be served personally or left at a defendant's home or place of employment with a relative or agent.  With a two-day summons the chances are very much greater that a defendant who has a perfectly adequate defence could find that, unknownst to himself, he has been convicted in court. Although he has the remedy of an appeal to the Circuit Court, where there will be a complete re-hearing, he will at the same time have suffered a grave injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty posed by this section is to strike the correct balance between the public interest and the interest of the individual.  I agree that, generally speaking, it is highly undesirable that a defendant should get only two days <Col N="1761" /> notice but it has to be accepted that all the principles that would normally form part and parcel of our law and our administration of justice cannot be adhered to rigidly in dealing with offences which, while they are classified as minor under the law, pose a serious threat to the national economy or wellbeing. I have been persuaded that if the section is amended to provide for personal service only, it will resolve as fairly as possible the conflicting interests of the State and of the individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has very concisely given the arguments for and against this amendment.  I am glad that he came down on balance in favour of the amendment.  It is not necessary to underline the points which the Minister has made and I do not propose to take up the time of the House in doing so.</P>
      <P>During the course of his remarks the Minister has used the expression &ldquo;personal service only&rdquo;, about two or three times in the case of these summonses with an abridged time for hearing.  As I read the subsection now, I am in some doubt as to whether in fact that is the position.  Clearly, it is the position that was intended to be achieved by the amendment.  However, it is necessary to point out that the subsection as it stands is permissive so far as the personal service of the summons is concerned. It says that it may be served personally any time not less than two clear days before the sitting.  From the Minister's remarks it is quite obvious that his intention, and the intention of the other House, in making this amendment was to provide that personal service in these cases would be obligatory, not merely discretionary.  In other words, if the intention of the Minister and of the other house, which I support, is to be carried into effect in this section, it should be worded: &ldquo;the summonses shall be served personally.&rdquo;  I have no doubt at all as to what the Minister has in mind, but if he looks at the wording of it he will see that what I am saying is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure how the Minister can cure this kind of thing but grammatically it appears to be open to the construction, as it stands, that while personal <Col N="1762" /> service may be effected any time not less than two clear days before the sitting some other mode of service would be applicable less than two clear days before the sitting, because the personal service is governed by the phrase &ldquo;at any time not less than two clear days&rdquo;.  That does not automatically rule out some other method of service at an even shorter time than two days before the sitting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the draftsman that &ldquo;may&rdquo; would not be construed with &ldquo;personally&rdquo;, but would be construed with the time element, in other words, any time not less than two clear days before the sitting.  If the draftsman had the opportunity of drafting this amendment&mdash;if it had not been one that I accepted in the House&mdash; he would possibly have drafted it a little more clearly.  I am satisfied and advised that &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not apply to &ldquo;personally&rdquo;; it applies to the time element only.  Such a summons must be served personally.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator O'Higgins is at least partially right in what he said in conclusion inasmuch as it does not rule out the other form of service where the service is more than two days.  It would allow the ordinary type of service on a second day notice being given in the normal way.  I do not see that the section, or the amendment, precludes the normal type of service if that service is effected seven clear days before the return date of the summons.</P>

    <Title>Trade Union Bill, 1971: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with the conditions for the granting of negotiation licences.  The Trade Union Act of 1941 introduced, for the first time in our law, the concept of a negotiation licence.  The Act provided that the Minister for Labour must grant a negotiation licence to a <Col N="1763" /> registered trade union if it maintained a certain deposit with the High Court. Provision was made in that Act for a sliding scale of deposits based on membership; the minimum deposit being £1,000 and the maximum, £10,000.  The requirements necessary for obtaining negotiation licences were, therefore, very simple and could easily be met by any small group.</P>
      <P>This Bill will make it somewhat more difficult for groups to obtain negotiation licences&mdash;I would stress, however, that trade unions which already hold negotiation licences will not be affected in any way by the Bill.  The main provisions of this Bill were originally embodied in the Trade Union Bill, 1966, which lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil in 1969.  The provisions of the Bill at present before the House may be summarised as follows: A trade union must (i) give 18 months notice of intention to apply for a negotiation licence, (ii) have a minimum membership of 500 persons within the State, (iii) keep on deposit with the High Court a minimum of £5,000, and (iv) there will be a waiting period of 18 months before the negotiation licence may be granted.</P>
      <P>As I already mentioned, the 1941 Act provided for a scale of deposits based on membership.  This Bill adheres to the principle of a sliding scale and the scales have been calculated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with those specified in the 1941 Act.  I feel that the amount of the deposits will not put any undue strain on trade union funds.  On the question of the proposed minimum membership, my thinking is that, should a group of 500 persons wish to form a trade union and be prepared to comply with the other requirements, such as the waiting period of 18 months, they could reasonably be regarded as a representative, responsible group and, as such, should be entitled to get a negotiation licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been far too easy in the past for small groups to break away from established trade unions and to set up rival unions of their own with all the status and influence of established unions.  Too often have we seen this type of precipitate action being taken <Col N="1764" /> because of trivial reasons.  The provision for a waiting period of 18 months will put a brake on this kind of action and will allow time to groups who may be contemplating &ldquo;going it alone&rdquo; in the heat of the moment to think again in a calmer atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not hinder existing trade unions who hold negotiation licences and who may wish to amalgamate; there is a provision in the Bill that the new conditions for the granting of negotiation licences will not apply to amalgamations.  A new amalgamated union can be established immediately without a waiting period.</P>
    <P>While the conditions governing the granting of negotiation licences will be somewhat more onerous than those hitherto in operation, I am satisfied that they are in the public interest.  They have, indeed, already been welcomed by all parties in the Dáil.  I can, however, envisage circumstances where people might feel that the establishment by them of a new union would not militate against the public interest and I have, therefore, inserted a provision whereby, if the Minister for Labour refuses to grant a negotiation licence either because the applicant has not met the conditions about minimum numbers or the waiting period, the applicant can appeal to the High Court for a declaration that, despite this, the granting of the licence would not be against the public interest. Should the High Court so declare, the Minister for Labour must grant the licence.  I consider that this provision should provide an adequate safeguard against the possibility of genuine applicants being denied a licence.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with the view which has often been expressed by trade unions and by employers alike that we have, in this country, far too many unions.  There is little doubt but that the multiplicity of trade unions has contributed in no small measure to many of our industrial troubles.  I would like to see some evidence of positive measures being taken by the trade unions themselves to remedy this situation.  However, any amalgamations which have taken place&mdash;and they have been few&mdash;have, unfortunately, been out-numbered by the numbers of new unions emerging.  The present Bill will I <Col N="1765" /> hope provide an incentive towards rationalisation and will help to prevent further fragmentation.  I realise that the measure at present before the House will not provide a panacea for all our industrial ills but it is, at least, a step in the right direction.  I hope to introduce further Bills dealing with areas where we can obtain a measure of agreement from interested parties and thus make more progress in this field.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to say that there are indications that some groups, who ought to await the test of the new rules, may be taking hurried action to make application for negotiation licences under the existing legislation.  I would be seriously concerned at attempts to circumvent the intentions of the Bill. Action of this kind would result in further fragmentation of the trade union movement which no one wants to see and I would, therefore, be grateful for the Seanad's co-operation in giving speedy consideration to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill and the arguments which the Minister has used in support of it are, in a sense, a confession of communal failure.  The Minister is virtually obliged to bring in a measure of this sort because of the inability of the trade union movement to rationalise its structure.  There has been no lack of effort on behalf of those at the head of the trade union movement in this direction, but as the Minister has said in opening this debate, the effort has gone unrewarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for regret that the right of combination of workers, free, unfettered right of combination, which was struggled for throughout the 19th century, sometimes at a great cost, should have to be limited in a drastic fashion as is proposed under this Bill and that a Bill such as this should come before us.  All the Members of the House will appreciate that it is not possible for the Minister to delay any longer.  Accordingly, all parties in the House will give an assent to this Bill and will do so conscious, as the Minister says, that it is a contribution towards an improvement of the working of our industrial society, but by no means a panacea.  It is welcome that the Minister <Col N="1766" /> has, under section 3 of the Bill, allowed for an appeal to the High Court in respect of particular combinations of persons who do not fulfil the conditions of section 2 but who, nevertheless, are given the chance to prove their case before the High Court.  This section is desirable.  It is probably also necessary in order to avoid the Bill being declared unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>In this regard there is just one comment I should like to make and that is the criterion which is laid down in subsection (2) of section 3 is that of the public interest.  I do not know how the High Court is expected to construe this term &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;.  I hope it is construed in the widest possible terms. There is a disease that politicians are subject to.  They are inclined to confuse the issue of public interest in the broad sense with the interest either of the Government or of the party.  It is a disease that tends to be somewhat dormant when politicians are in opposition and becomes distinctly more virulent when they are in office.  Sometimes it afflicts those of cabinet rank so severely that their faculties are impaired and they are completely unable to distinguish between public interest in the sense in which it is enshrined in the Constitution and the interests of immediate Government policy.</P>
    <P>It is a natural thing to happen.  It is a human thing but I express the hope that the construction of this particular section is such that the High Court is not obliged to construe narrowly what is the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; in this particular regard.  My colleagues, who are learned in the law, may be able to give the House more information.  I merely express a worry on the point.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that a constitutional right which is enshrined in the Constitution has got to be limited in the public interest.  We must agree with the Minister that the necessity is there.  One sees year after year the formation of new unions and groups breaking away from unions.  It sometimes appears that all the energy that used to go into the cattle raids of our heroic age seems now to find its outlet in some of these equally sporadic and sometimes equally senseless industrial breakaway movements.  Therefore, I <Col N="1767" /> would say to the Minister that this Bill will, indeed, be assented to but with some reluctance and with a hope that, small though its contribution may be, it will be a real contribution to better industrial relations and not only better industrial relations but a new industrial climate.  It is a small step.  There are many other and far bigger steps that must be taken.</P>
    <P>It may well be that in bringing in this measure the Minister is treating only a symptom and is not treating the disease. I do not wish to go beyond what is the narrow scope of this particular measure but the Minister, the House and everybody concerned with the future of the country will have to examine this point as to whether what we are trying to remedy here is not merely a symptom and that the whole of our industrial structure is not something that needs a complete and thorough overhaul.  I do not just mean that the Minister should bring in the further provisions of the Bill that lapsed within recent years.  It is necessary for all of us in this small closely-knit community to take a look at the nature of our industrial society and take a look at the relations that exist between all parties within our industrial society.  A few years ago we had a flare of interest in the subject of industrial democracy.  Suddenly it was the seminar topic of the season among employers and workers alike.  It seems now to have been replaced by other topics which have become more fashionable. In typical fashion we all became quite learned of a sudden and for a season in regard to the double directorate system of German industry, the experimentation in Yugoslavia and similar topics.  It has now been replaced. It may be that it is to topics like industrial democracy we will have to return if we are to cure the particular problem that faces us and that this Bill will be merely a holding measure, merely a small application of ointment to the body of our industrial structure. Please goodness, with the distraction of debates about the European Community and other matters behind us, we may be able to return to this extremely serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The trade union movement <Col N="1768" /> support this Bill and therefore will support the motion going with it.  I support it because in large measure it will help to rationalise and improve the present very unsatisfactory position regarding the formation of new unions. At the same time there is nothing in the Bill which will confer the right of judgment on the Minister or anybody else in respect of the formation of new unions.  The position still remains that any group of workers may form a new union even contrary to the advice of the central trade union authority, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  That is the way it should be.  The Bill will help to rationalise the whole situation and lead to bigger and better trade union legislation in the future.</P>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I could envisage certain difficulties and problems arising from the operation of this Bill.  Frankly, I am not going to speak about these difficulties and problems because the only way of eliminating the possibility of future difficulties would be to expand the scope of the Bill.  I am not in favour of that type of approach to such a complex matter as trade union legislation.  The way to approach this whole question is for the Minister to introduce a number of short uncontentious Bills and when that task is completed then to introduce a comprehensive measure.  If the Minister agrees with that approach, as he has indicated in his speech here today, I would respectfully suggest to him that his next step should be to introduce an equally short Bill making it easier for trade unions to amalgamate and start to tackle the very important problem of the rationalisation of the trade union movement.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to thank the Minister and his Department for introducing this Bill in such a speedy manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  The right to be in a trade union and the right to strike must be upheld in a free society.  I regard it as part of the proper function of democracy. This right, in democratic terms, to strike is often not available to many workers due to the structure of trade unions here.  Because of a multiplicity of unions and a consequent fragmentation of workers in this country <Col N="1769" /> their democratic right is frequently infringed by minority elements.  I presume it is partly because of this sort of problem that this Bill is being introduced.  It is obviously quite wrong, apart from the welfare of the community, that large numbers of workers should on occasions be deprived of a decision regarding stoppages of work, as has happened frequently.  It is not democratic and it is unjust both to workers and to the uninvolved members of the general public.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to hear Senator Kennedy welcome the idea of rationalisation and what we would all hope to see: a gradual amalgamation of unions in future years.  We all know we have far too many trade unions.  This makes it very difficult for trade unions to function in an ordered way and for employers, including the State, to deal with industrial situations that arise. This Bill is an incentive towards rationalisation.  I would see it as leading to a more ordered situation in which industrial progress can be made, because that is what workers, employers and the general public want.  I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill and welcome and support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a mild impertinence on my part to rise to speak on a Bill of this kind because I am not an expert on trade union problems.  I do not intend to lay down the law on them either to the Minister or to the Members of the House who know more than I about them.  I might make a contribution to this debate to this extent, namely, to give my opinion on the legal situation with which this Bill, if passed, may be faced and on the legal situation in which the Act of 1941 found itself when it was challenged a few years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the 1941 Act went a good deal further than this Bill goes.  It proposed that where a particular union failed to have a majority of workers in a particular industry enrolled in its ranks it might apply for virtually exclusive negotiating rights.  Although provision was made for the maintenance of more than one union in a particular industry the object of Part III of the 1941 Act was to do exactly what the Minister proposes should be done&mdash; although of course in a much more <Col N="1770" /> extreme degree&mdash;in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>The 1941 Act was disliked very much by the trade union movement at the time and in due course it was challenged. In the High Court, Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, who was a very liberal and fair-minded man, said that on consideration of the public interest&mdash;a phrase used in the Constitution which reappears in this Bill in relation to the circumstances in which the right of association could be abridged&mdash;he could see nothing objectionable in the 1941 Act.  On appeal of his judgment to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court said that the whole of Part III was a serious derogation from the right of association and they held that part of the Act invalid. In other words, an attempt, perhaps a drastic attempt&mdash;I do not want to express a view on this in the presence of ladies and gentlemen in the House who know far more about it than I&mdash;to achieve the object that we are all agreed on, namely that the trade union ought not to proliferate, was defeated by the Supreme Court in 1945.</P>
    <P>My own view of the Supreme Court's judgment, if it is of any interest to the House, is that it does not stand up to logical examination and that it is a far inferior judgment in quality of legal argument to the judgment of Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy which it overruled.  My own guess would be that this Bill, or even a Bill going further than this, would meet a different fate nowadays at the hands of the present Supreme Court.  My belief is that the present Supreme Court would approach a Bill of this kind taking a broad view of the public interest in much the same way as Justice Gavan Duffy did.  The Supreme Court would not be at all inhibited by the fact that its predecessor, or the 1945 Supreme Court, had taken a different course.  The Supreme Court here has within the last five years reversed previous decisions of its own on no fewer than three very important occasions. My own guess is that this legislation, even though a member of Senator Kennedy's party in the Dáil expressed fears about its fate before the courts, will not encounter any difficulty with the High Court or with the Supreme Court.  I will go further than <Col N="1771" /> that and say that even more drastic legislation&mdash;I am not of course asking for that but the trade union movement or the Department of Labour might feel it was necessary&mdash;perhaps even something as drastic as the 1941 Act, which purported to limit the number of existing unions, might very well be a test of constitutionality with the personnel of the Supreme Court being what they now are and taking the view of the public interest which I believe they would now take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in welcoming this Bill and make some comments relevant to this field.  I would agree with the Minister's comments that it has been far too easy in the past for small groups to break away from established trade unions.  The Minister mentioned that often the reasons leading to a breakaway union are extremely trivial.  This is a matter which has been of some concern to me as a lay spectator. In discussing this Bill it might be worthwhile to look briefly at the actual situation this Bill is trying to deal with and to look at some of the reasons which have led to breakaway unions.</P>
      <P>First of all, there has been a situation where a body of people in the rank and file of a trade union may be discontented or dissatisfied with the progress which the whole body of the organisation has been making in dealing with the particular problem or grievance.  It seems to me very important that the trade union organisation itself, and particularly the personnel involved in an established union, should make sure that they are all the time on their toes. As in the case of their counterparts in any other organisation, they have the same obligation to try to ensure that their offices are adequately staffed and that they have an adequate communication system between the rank and file and the leadership in the organisation. If there is discontent in the organisation they should be aware of it and the main organisation should be properly equipped to bring about a situation where at least no complaints of slowness of action or of not presenting a case properly can be laid at their own door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I should like to make, <Col N="1772" /> and it seems to me that it has been a factor in some breakaway situations, is that I get the impression that break-aways have almost followed a social pattern.  Some section of the organisation feel that, for some reason or other, their particular interests, or the interests of young people at the bottom of the wage scale, have been neglected by the overall organisation and they want to stand up and fight for their interests.</P>
    <P>I would make the point, and it was a point which I made in discussing the commotion about the nursing profession that it is very important that the older people in any organisation, even if they have been through a long, hard apprenticeship, even though they did not have rapid promotion or rapid wage increases in their days, should recognise that times are changing and that they should recognise the likelihood of great impatience among certain sections of their membership.  It would help us all if they had the flexibility of approach which allowed them to recognise the problems of the different interest groups, particularly young people in the rank and file of the trade union organisation.</P>
    <P>There is one other factor that seems to me to have been an element in breakaway situations, or may possibly be a larger element in the future.  I am referring to the sort of person&mdash;we will see more and more of him, I think&mdash;who sees the trade union movement not simply as an organisation for the promotion of the good and the interest of all its members, but as a tool for the destruction of the existing institutions of society as we know them.  A factor in a breakaway situation is that a breakaway can be used for political reasons, or political objectives, rather than the general interest of members in a trade union sense.  This underlines a point which I think applies to the other aspects of breakaway situations which I have mentioned, namely, the important fact that members of the trade union movement should always give high priority, if they possibly can, to attendance at meetings and to participation in the full working of the trade union movement.  In that way they will never have to say &ldquo;Look, I slept on this; my voice was not heard&rdquo;.  Every member <Col N="1773" /> whatever his political views&mdash;and happily we are in a situation where the whole community is represented in the trade union movement&mdash;should see that we have adequate attendance and participation in the trade union movement by all the people concerned so that it will be much less likely that we will see rash breakaway movements, or, indeed, that we will see situations of breakaway arising in unions purely for political or for opportunist reasons.  I thought it was worthwhile making those points.</P>
    <P>In that sense, in passing this legislation, we are legislating to help build up a strong trade union movement.  It is important that we should stress this, that everybody in the country should be in favour of a strong trade union movement.  I include employers in this because there are still some employers, I am sorry to say, who seem to be frightened of trade unions and tend to be extremely anxious about the prospect of a strong co-ordinated trade union movement.  I would ask them to put those fears to one side and to realise that, if they are negotiating with a strong, representative, properly organised trade union movement, they then have a guarantee that agreements will be kept and that matters will be negotiated in a properly informed and serious way.  That is of major importance to us all.  It is particularly encouraging, for example, that the present national wage agreement is an example of an agreement worked out on a proper basis between the trade union organisations and the employers as a whole.  This is the sort of pattern I should like to see maintained in the future and the sort of pattern that will help us to meet the crises which we face from time to time, particularly in the field of inflation.</P>
    <P>I was a little taken back by Senator Kennedy when he said that, even with this Bill, the situation will be that any group of individual trade unionists will still have the right and liberty to go ahead and form a trade union, even against the advice of the central organisation of trade unions as it stands at the moment&mdash;the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Of course, he is right in this.  I would hope that, in saying that, <Col N="1774" /> he was merely recognising an abstract right, if you like.  I would hope that in practice we would never see this happening, that we would never see this right used for the reasons I have just mentioned.  I think it is in all our interests that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should be strong and that the movement of the future should be towards fewer, better organised unions, where meetings are adequately attended and where all the members feel that they are genuinely part of an organisation which is representing their interests and acting in the community good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine I find myself in a minority in this House in not welcoming this Bill and in attempting to explain why.  Some of the comments which have been made already mirror the sort of confused situation with which this Bill is an attempt to deal.  I was particularly struck, for one thing, by the contrast between the two parts of Senator Dooge's speech.  At the very beginning he said that what was proposed here was to limit the rights&mdash;and I may be doing him an injustice here&mdash; but he spoke about the Bill as doing something in a drastic fashion.  The adjective used was &ldquo;drastic&rdquo;.  Later on in his speech, however, he referred to it as &ldquo;a small step&rdquo; and he spoke about the &ldquo;narrow scope&rdquo; of the Bill.  Is it a drastic Bill or is it a small step?  I think there is an unresolved contradiction in Senator Dooge's speech, and I myself go for the first interpretation.  I think it affects the right of free association in this country in a drastic fashion.  In saying &ldquo;in a drastic fashion&rdquo; I am echoing directly the words used by Senator Dooge.</P>
      <P>When we think, for instance, of the fact that in this Bill it is proposed to exact from trade unions the sum of £5,000 to enable them to acquire negotiating licences, and when we reflect at the same time that it is possible for a person in this country to register a company for £2, a company that may do any amount of public and private mischief, I think we will have no difficulty at all in endorsing the first of Senator Dooge's two, I must say, conflicting interpretations of this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to move from that to a <Col N="1775" /> couple of general comments about the situation with which the Bill is designed to deal.  It is a situation of confusion, perhaps in some areas of near chaos. Certainly there is an immense crisis of credibility in the trade union movement as a whole and there is a crisis of some kind, perhaps a crisis of frustration, in the area of government.  What has been responsible for this general atmosphere of confusion?  What has been responsible for the vociferous tendencies which produced the breakaway unions which this Bill is designed to control?  To me it seems that there are two basic things here and they are very closely allied.</P>
    <P>The first is a kind of absolutism in our thinking about almost everything. For very many people in this country, there is black and there is white and there is absolutely nothing in between. For very many people in this country something is either compulsory or it is banned.  Again, there is no middle area. There is no area of option which people can understand.  It has been suggested to me, and I endorse it, that this may have something to do with the moral absolutism that forms such a large part of Catholic teaching and in which such a large portion of our people have been brought up.  But its effects are undeniable.</P>
    <P>When disputes arise, the question of accommodation between the sides involved, if it is considered at all is only considered briefly.  The more usual procedure is for the minority who disagree with what the majority want to do in any given situation to take themselves off into the wilderness, not necessarily for 40 days or 40 nights but probably for a great deal longer and to languish out there in the luxury of the belief that they know they are right, even if nobody else does.</P>
    <P>This kind of procedure has a very definite advantage for the people concerned. They do not have to test the rightness or wrongness of their convictions by matching them against those of any other person or group.  It is this elitism, this exclusivism, ultimately a sort of absolutism, that is basically responsible for the situation we are facing today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> The other side of this absolutism, the other side of the coin, is a tendency to schism.  The late Brendan Behan, addressing the inaugural meeting of some society founded for some patriotic purpose the nature of which I now forget, before beginning his speech walked to the front of the platform and asked the assembled throng: &ldquo;Are we all Republicans here,&rdquo; to be greeted by a mass roar of approval from the body of the hall.  &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the first item on the agenda is a split.&rdquo;  To the best of my knowledge the organisation at whose inaugural meeting he was speaking did subsequently split.  Not only did they split, but they are still split.  This is something that, in our character and perhaps in our training and education, we have to take seriously.</P>
    <P>I would have been pleased to hear from the Minister of any indication that legislation of the type he is proposing has been found necessary in any other comparable country in Western Europe.  I do not think it has been.  The situation with which this legislation is trying to deal is one which results from this absolutist splitting tendency in the Irish character and that is why the Minister has brought in this kind of legislation.  It is basically an antidemocratic strain in our national character and one which we should earnestly strive to eliminate.  However, the present Bill, for all its worthiness in many respects, for all the genuineness of the Minister's motives and those of the trade union leaders who have supported it here and elsewhere, does not seem to me to be the right answer to this kind of problem.  The Bill, in my opinion, is inadequate for several reasons.  In the first place, it is inadequate because basically it confuses two problems.  It confuses the problems caused by the need to facilitate the merger of trade unions.</P>
    <P>Let me point out here something which may not be known to many Members of the House.  We had twice as many trade unions in the country in 1921 as we have today.  Therefore, when we look at things in an historical perspective it may not be quite as bad as people think.</P>
    <P>The Bill confuses two things.  It <Col N="1777" /> confuses the need to provide mechanism whereby unions may easily and satisfactorily merge with each other and it confuses the second issue which is that of the accountability of unions internally, domestically speaking.  I feel that the Minister's purpose would be far better served in regard to the first of these objectives by bringing in a very simple amalgamation Bill, perhaps on the lines of the amalgamation Act introduced in Northern Ireland in 1967, which would be non-contentious and, I would even go so far as to say, nonpolitical in character and which would be welcomed as such by the trade unions.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a much greater problem when the Government, whether at the behest of the trade union movement or not, strive to introduce legislation into the area of union accountability.  Union accountability, basically, is what we are discussing when we are talking about breakaway unions.  We are talking about the credibility of the big unions, of union leadership, about democracy within trade unions and of communication within each union from the bottom to the top and <i>vice versa</i>.  This area, as the Minister must realise, is incredibly sensitive and one into which any Government should be very slow to enter.  It seems to me that this is an area which is, and should remain basically, the responsibility of the trade unions themselves.</P>
    <P>I will not devote much time here to criticising the trade union movement. They get too much criticism as it is, most of it uninformed and some of it, quite obviously, malicious, but, I would ask them at this stage very seriously to reconsider their support for this kind of measure, for two reasons.  First of all, must they really welcome, as trade unions, the intervention of Government and subsequently of legislation in an area of their own failure?  Secondly, do they seriously think that this intervention and this legislation will act to remedy this failure?  I do not believe the trade unions should welcome or encourage or ask for this kind of intervention. Furthermore, such intervention is ill-advised because it will not even achieve the ends it has set out to <Col N="1778" /> achieve.  I say this with some regret, because obviously it would be very much to the advantage of all concerned if a very simple and short piece of legislation, such as this, could achieve the desired effects.  Given the presence and state of the trade union movement at the moment, I would almost lay a wager that this Bill, far from improving things, will actually increase the sense of frustration and the sense of alienation, of being ignored, which has sponsored so many of the breakaway movements in the very recent past.</P>
    <P>As I have said, my first reason for opposing the Bill is because it confuses the simple issue of union merger with the very much more complex and dangerous issue of union accountability. The second reason why I oppose this Bill is that, even taking for granted the areas of change which it tries to make, even taking for granted its goodwill and its attempt to improve the situation, its drafting seems to be open to serious question.  I wish to put a few specific questions which I do not wish to go into in very much detail at this stage but nevertheless, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to them.</P>
    <P>The first of these arises in relation to membership.  We have in one of the sections a requirement for the membership of trade unions which lays down a minimum of 500 members.  The Minister may be laying up more trouble for himself here than he is aware of.  How does one calculate the figure of 500 members?  Is it an average?  Is it at the beginning of the 18 months or is it at the end of the 18 months?  I can foresee all sorts of thorny legal problems arising here which could be and may very well be exploited by minority groups in the field of trade unions in an attempt to discredit this Bill, to discredit larger unions, to discredit the Government and to discredit the whole process of industrial bargaining generally.</P>
    <P>The second question I should like to raise with regard to the drafting of the Bill refers to the 18 months waiting period.  The introduction of the 18 months waiting period has a particularly fierce effect of which the Minister may not be aware.  In his introductory speech he said:</P>
    <P>Should a group of 500 persons wish <Col N="1779" /> to form a trade union and be prepared to comply with the other requirements, such as the waiting period of 18 months, they could reasonably be regarded as a representative, responsible group and as such should be entitled to get a negotiation licence.</P>
    <P>If at any stage during this 18 month period the group of persons concerned, assuming they are not involved solely within one employment, attempted to act in a representative, responsible way, in other words if they represented themselves to a number of employers as representing the people, be they 500 or 5,000, on whose behalf they seek to negotiate, they are committing a criminal offence under the law of the land and are quite liable to prosecution on foot of it.  The Minister's speech is much too vague on this point.  There is a built-in bias in the 18 month provision against the formation of any union under it because it lays down that during this 18 month period a union which wants to negotiate on a representative basis as such, is liable to criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>I am sure we are all aware of the psychological effect this would have on potential members of such a union.  If I am a worker in a certain industry and for one reason or another I feel that a newly-formed trade union, at present without a negotiating licence, could represent me to my employers better than any other established union, I am likely to be very slow to join such a union if it is impressed on me that for at least the next 18 months, if not longer, such a union will not be allowed to negotiate on my behalf.  I can see the point of the provision&mdash;it is to discourage people from joining breakaway unions&mdash;but this is an incredibly Draconian provision to insert in such a minor issue, comparatively speaking.  In other words, you are using a sledgehammer to kill a mouse in this provision. The restrictions on the right to negotiate and also, I would imagine, on the right to strike which are introduced by this provision are quite incompatible with the constitutional guarantees about the freedom of association.</P>
    <P>My third main point of criticism on <Col N="1780" /> this legislation is that, certainly in spirit and perhaps also in letter, it goes very much against the provisions of the European Social Charter which have been ratified by our Government.  There are two articles in the European Social Charter which are directly relevant to this Bill and to the effects it attempts to create.  They are Article 5 and Article 6. Article 5 is very brief so I propose to read it.  In reference to the right to organise it states:</P>
    <P>With a view to ensuring or promoting the freedom of workers and employers to form local, national or international organisations for the protection of their economic and social interests and to join those organisations, the contracting parties undertake that national law shall not be such as to impair nor shall it be so applied as to impair this freedom. The extent to which the guarantees provided for in this Article shall apply to the police shall be determined by national law or regulation.  The principle governing the application to the members of the armed forces of these guarantees and the extent to which they shall apply to persons in this category shall equally be determined by national laws or regulations.</P>
    <P>We are basically concerned with the first half of Article 5.  I doubt if the question of the police and armed forces comes up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should now like to quote from one of the most important bodies to have written on the subject, the Council of Europe Committee of Independent Experts on the European Social Charter. I quote from the Report and the Conclusions of the Committee of Independent Experts, Strasbourg, 1969-70.  On Article 5 they state:</P>
    <P>This Article sets out the principle that employers and workers have the right to form national or international associations for the protection of their economic and social interests.  The Committee noted that two obligations were embodied in this provision having a negative and a positive aspect respectively.  The implementation of the first obligation requires the absence, in the municipal law of each contracting State, of any <Col N="1781" /> legislation or regulation or any administrative practice such as to impair the freedom of employers or workers to form or join their respective organisations.  By virtue of the second obligation the contracting State is obliged to take adequate legislative or other measures to guarantee the exercise of the right to organise and, in particular, to protect workers' organisations from any interference on the part of the employers.</P>
    <P>I would stress again that the European Social Charter has been adopted by the Irish Government, not in its entirety. There are many aspects in which the non-ratification of this charter by our Government is a living disgrace to us but they have ratified it in broad terms and they have ratified Article 5 on the right to organise and Article 6 on the right to bargain collectively.  However, at this point we begin to run into trouble because it emerges from studying the relevant documents that this ratification is very far from satisfactory.  Again, I quote from the Report and Conclusions of the Committee of Independent Experts:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the report submitted by the Irish Government was very often incomplete or vague and, consequently, the Committee was unable to decide on many points, including some of the most important, whether or not Ireland satisfies the obligations which it has accepted.  In some other cases, it appears that the standard of social protection was inadequate in law or in practice to satisfy the provisions of the Charter. The Committee was well aware of the difficulty Ireland might find, in view of its general economic situation, in taking on certain burdens or introducing certain laws or regulations and it made considerable allowance for those factors.  But it was bound to point out, even in spite of those considerations, that a considerable effort would be necessary before Ireland could be considered as satisfying provisions of the Charter on many points.</P>
    <P>It so happens that Article 5 was one of the points on which the Committee of <Col N="1782" /> Experts concluded that the Irish Government did not satisfy the Charter &mdash;did not match up to what they said they would match up to when they signed it.  Paragraph 38 of the Conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the right to organise noted that the committee wished to receive additional information on the following points:</P>
    <P>(1)  on the application by legislation and case law of the right to organise set forth, in principle, in Article 40 of the Irish Constitution;</P>
    <P>(2)  on the conditions for the granting of the negotiating licence enabling workers' and employers' organisations to indulge in collective negotiations, particularly on the question whether such a grant is subject to the fulfilment of objective conditions which can be reviewed by an independent and impartial authority;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from comments on the subsequent section of Article 6 that they feel that this country does not satisfy its obligations.  In their comments on Article 6, which is paragraph 19 of the Conclusions, the Committee say:</P>
    <P>The Committee considered that Ireland does not satisfy the obligation arising from this provision of the Charter.</P>
    <P>That is the right of workers and employers to collective action.</P>
    <P>The following restrictions on the right to strike in Ireland cannot, in the Committee's opinion, be considered compatible with the Social Charter:</P>
    <P>(a)  the restriction whereby workers belonging to a union which does not hold a negotiating licence under the Trade Union Act, 1941, do not enjoy the right to strike...</P>
    <P>There are two other reasons, which are not relevant to the debate and which I do not propose to read, which they also gave for considering that this country in practice infringes the European Social Charter in respect of a provision which it has agreed and accepted.</P>
    <P>Later on we come to what the Irish Government said in response to the <Col N="1783" /> representations made by the Committee of Experts.  This is the report containing the conclusion of the Governmental Committee of the European Social Charter adopted on 4th December, 1970.  In this document the restriction whereby workers belonging to a union which does not hold a negotiating licence under the Trade Union Act, 1941, is referred to again and it is printed alongside the comments made by the Irish Government.  The comments made by the Irish Government on this question are very brief.  They read:</P>
    <P>... It is necessary to distinguish between the &ldquo;right to strike&rdquo; itself, and the legal protections for acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute e.g. picketing.  In the absence of a clear definition of the &ldquo;right to strike&rdquo;, it is submitted that section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1941, which reads:</P>
    <P>Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, shall apply only in relation to authorised trade unions which for the time being are holders of negotiation licences and the members and officials of such trade unions, and not otherwise,</P>
    <P>is not a denial of the right to strike.</P>
    <P>When you get rid of all the verbiage, the words and the whereases and the heretofores, what you are left with is the word of our Government against the word of the Committee of Experts.</P>
    <P>Even assuming that we give our Government the benefit of the doubt&mdash; and it is something that I am not prepared to do&mdash;we now have the situation in which even a legislative provision, which was adjudged by the Committee of Experts on the European Social Charter to be an abrogation of that Charter, is now being intensified. Frankly, I shudder to think what would be the reaction of the Committee of Experts to this legislation which is before us today.</P>
    <P>They have already criticised strongly the provision in the 1941 Trade Union Act as a restriction on the right to organise.  The Government have answered them after a fashion which I <Col N="1784" /> do not believe to be successful.  We are now asked to double up, if you like, to make even more drastic regulations on the right to have freedom to associate. I should not be surprised if this was struck down by the Committee of Experts.  They have no particular legal standing with regard to the European Social Charter, but they are a body of disinterested, expert and able lawyers. Any Government which ignore the stand they may take on any of our legislation are sailing into trouble.</P>
    <P>Finally, this brings up a general point. In the past our record in international fields has been an honourable one. When we have signed agreements we have done so with a reasonably clear appreciation of what was involved and with a pretty genuine intention to implement the obligations we assumed under these international charters, treaties and agreements.</P>
    <P>Looking at the European Social Charter and at the sections of it which we have agreed to without reservation, and comparing them with the legislation before us today, I am afraid that we are entering the era when international agreements are being ratified solely for propaganda purposes.  This is wrong in itself.  It is also a betrayal of our record in the field of international relations.  For this reason, with every deference to my friends in the trade union movement, I must oppose this Bill.  I can see, and I try to analyse the reasons&mdash;and they are serious ones&mdash; why it is being introduced.  I do not believe that the seriousness of the reasons which have prompted this Bill can justify the limitations which it places on the right to organise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>If one wishes to travel to a town to the north of where one is, and one comes to the conclusion that a mistake has been made in the compass, that by going in the opposite direction one is travelling towards the north when, of course, the further one goes the farther one gets away from the town which one wishes to reach, this appears to be what has happened Senator Horgan.  He is starting off on a premise that is completely wrong.  He has followed that premise and in the course of following it he has gone farther and farther away from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> Senator Kennedy said that there is nothing whatsoever in this Bill which takes away the right of any group, no matter how small, no matter how large, to organise in any manner whatsoever if they wish, and to associate in any manner whatsoever they wish.  That is a statement of fact with which no one could find fault.  It would be better if we ascertained the facts.  Any group of people, be it large or be it small, be it ten or be it 1,000 can organise and associate for any purpose whatsoever it wishes, be that purpose social, political, economic or vocational.  There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever about that.</P>
    <P>From a legal point of view, there are certain rights that every individual has and there are certain rights that society itself has.  In the ordinary course of events, no person or group of persons may injure others, conspire to injure others, break contracts, or damage their neighbour or the public.  If they do, they infringe what is the accepted common law of the land.</P>
    <P>An exception has been made to this rule in favour of trade unions under the Trade Disputes Act.  This is carried forward to groups who have negotiating licences and are trade unions in the accepted legal sense of the term.  By the Trade Disputes Act any group of people who have a negotiating licence may conspire together to injure another. They do not have to justify themselves or to prove that it is in their own interests or the interests of their members to do so.  They may injure not only the person with whom their original contract lies, who is their employer, but they may injure people with whom their employer has contracts or they may injure the general public. By virtue of the Trade Disputes Act, they are exempt from all responsibility, all liability, criminal or civil, in so doing.</P>
    <P>This is a special privilege given to trade unions or, in other words, associations who have negotiating, licences.  We start off, therefore, from the correct premise: that is, that any group or any number may associate or organise for any purpose they wish, be it social, political, economic, vocational or otherwise; but that group may not <Col N="1786" /> injure the other citizens of the State They may not injure the State itself. They may not injure other groups or associations unless they have a negotiating licence.</P>
    <P>A negotiating licence, then, gives the special privilege of allowing groups to injure others.  It necessarily follows that for the public good such a group of people must be a very responsible group. They should not consist of fragments that break off&mdash;people with chips on their shoulders or bees in their bonnets. Every responsible trade union is a most democratic body.  Every member or group of members can help to form their policy.  The members decide what decisions and judgments are to be reached within the framework of that policy.  If any small group of individuals feel that the whole union is out of step except themselves, their responsibility is to endeavour to win the judgments of their fellow-members in the union and show them where they are wrong.</P>
    <P>Within the union they have the powers of argument, persuasion, and logic for that purpose.  If having used these powers, they are unable to persuade the majority that they are wrong, surely it is more than likely that the majority are, in fact, right in their arguments?</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan stated that the Minister is introducing legislation which, so far as he is aware, does not exist anywhere else in Western Europe.  I do not know if this is correct, but I can give a few facts.  Take any large organisation in this country, such as CIE.  We are a small country with a population of approximately three million.  There are probably two or three times as many people in West Berlin. In the whole of West Germany there must be 20 times as many.  But there are more trade unions in CIE, fragmentary and otherwise, than in the whole of West Germany, which is probably the most industrialised nation in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to have an ordered framework of policy in this situation. Trade unions and their leaders in this country have shown themselves to be most responsible bodies.  The union leaders are citizens of the State and have a big stake in the State.  The <Col N="1787" /> employer puts capital into a business, but the members of trade unions invest their lives and their future security and the future of their children &mdash;and their livelihoods&mdash;in that business.  They are not likely then to undertake anything which will create a situation of chaos.</P>
    <P>Throughout the history of this State it is not possible to find a situation in which our large trade unions, associated and guided by Congress, have ever done anything which was not responsible and for the public good.  It is essential that there should be legislation such as the Trade Disputes Act.  As I have already stated, when the worker has nothing else to offer except his work, he is entitled to withdraw his work provided that his trade union and the people among whom he works feel that this is the only proper responsible remedy to adopt.  This can cause a great deal of harm and must be done within a responsible framework.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan also made the point that, if a new trade union is being formed and if during the period of 18 months they attempt to negotiate, they are committing a criminal offence. There are a number of lawyers present here and I am satisfied they will all agree with me that there is not the slightest foundation for this statement. Any group of people not belonging to a trade union can negotiate with their employers if the employers are willing to negotiate with them.  But any group of people cannot say to their employers: &ldquo;We will conspire to injure you; we will conspire to ensure that you will not keep your contracts with your customers or with your manufacturers unless you do what we want you to do.&rdquo; This is a different matter.  The trade union movement is the essence of democracy and if democracy is to be split and shattered into fragments it is a negation of all democracy.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with what was said by Senator Kelly that in the light of what is considered public policy as today understood, because social ideas change often from year to year and certainly from decade to decade, there is no doubt whatsoever that a Bill of this nature, even though very much <Col N="1788" /> stronger, would find itself by a decision of the Supreme Court within the framework of our Constitution.</P>

      <P>There would be a slight difference but fundamentally the premises on which you would find would probably be the same.  There is one aspect of this Bill which I thought should go a little bit farther.  Because trade unions and the Congress of Trade Unions in this country have proved themselves responsible I would have in this Bill given a right to existing trade unions, or certainly the Congress of Trade Unions, to object to a negotiating licence being given to groups who even complied with this, provided they could establish to the satisfaction of the court that the giving of such a negotiating licence was not in the public interest.  Very often that would be the case.  However, that is not included here.</P>
      <P>I would feel that every citizen of this State, whether a trade unionist or the ordinary John Citizen who has to pay in the long run, will welcome this Bill. I look forward to seeing further areas of agreement between the Congress of Trade Unions and the Department of Labour which will, as they are agreed upon, lead to more progressive legislation of this nature.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful for the good reception the House has given to this Bill and their realistic appraisal of its contents. Thank God I am not a constitutional lawyer.  If I were I would have great difficulty in bringing legislation before the House in relation to matters of this kind.  There is one thing which to my mind always transcends any legalistic constitutional arguments and that is the common good and common sense.  We are all united today in acclaiming the damage that undoubtedly can accrue from the fragmentation and proliferation of unions.  I do not have to repeat again that we are over-unionised already and legislation to bring about amalgamation, as suggested by Senator Horgan, would be an interference in the <Col N="1789" /> freedom of unions.  I want to say that the purpose of this legislation is to support the legitimate efforts of trade unions and others to prevent things happening which in the national interests should not happen.  Any legislation that I would attempt to bring in at any time to control matters pertaining to what should be primarily the business of management and trade unions would only be after consultation, after mutual agreement, without which legislation can be ineffective.</P>
      <P>It has been said by my predecessor and others that one cannot legislate his way to industrial peace.  The attitudes and the many things which go to make up mutual agreement are the essential ingredients to industrial peace; and legislation should only be attempted when it is necessary to support attitudes which are commonly agreed in the national interest.  When I say agreed I mean agreed by all the parties concerned. I am not going into the constitutionality of this measure.  It will be open at some stage for anybody to test that.  Our Constitution lays down the right of people to form associations or unions, subject to public order and morality.  In the same Article it also states, however, that laws may be enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the foregoing right.  That is exactly what I am endeavouring to do.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to say anything further about the constitutionality of this legislation, on which I am not competent to speak.  I think it is in conformity with the national requirements. We have more than enough unions. We have this question of emotionalism and certain attitudes which take place when a union is negotiating an agreement. Some sections may be opposed to what they are doing for particular reasons of their own and may, on the spur of the moment, try to set up their own union to negotiate in their own way.  By the 18 months here, which is a cooling period, they may have come to see more clearly the common sense of what their own union has been trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the provisions in the Bill, I have been asked to explain why it should be £5,000 and why it should be <Col N="1790" /> 18 months.  What we are endeavouring to do in this piece of legislation is not to oversimplify this whole problem of forming unions but, to get away from the simple formula that certain persons could form a union if they simply deposited £1,000.  We have tried to strike an optimum in that the value of money is different now from what it was 30 years ago.  The 500 is a reasonable figure which would not debar legitimate groups from forming unions and 18 months is a reasonable period in which it may be proven that the group have the same sincerity as when they set out.  They may have been activated by some ulterior motive, such as spleen or spite, when they first set out. These are efforts at striking an optimum to make it not impossible for legitimate groups to form unions and not to make it too easy for splinter or fragmented sections to form a union.  That is why these particular figures have been arrived at.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Bill provides that any group may, on appeal to the court, seek to prove that it is not against the public interest that they should form a union.  It is conceivable that certain specialised groups, professional or other types, may be able to prove that they could not have 500 members but that they are a distinct entity and for that reason should have a negotiating licence.  It is open to them to go to court and, if the court decides that it is not against public interest, that they should form a union the Minister has no option but to grant the licence. They need not wait 18 months to do that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deposit, it is not a registration fee.  It is merely a deposit and is still the property of the union. There was such deposit on an ascending scale in the 1941 Act, the minimum being £1,000 and the maximum £10,000, related to the number of members.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House further in referring to any of the matters raised. By and large the Bill was well received. I should like to say that it is a separate piece of legislation dealing with one particular problem and taken from a more comprehensive Bill, which lapsed with the dissolution of the last Dáil. <Col N="1791" /> While it is dealing with one separate problem I and my Department, after consultation with interested parties, decided that the parts of that proposed legislation, which lapsed with the 1969 election, should be implemented by way of separate Bills rather than as a global Act or Bill comprehending all the different parts of legislation.  I am already moving in the direction of bringing in quite a number of the items covered in that particular Bill.  To get a measure of consensus with regard to any legislation referring to industrial relations or trade union matters is essential and highly important.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other item I should refer to.  Some Member suggested it was a pity the Bill was necessary and others referred to whether or not other countries have recourse to this type of legislation to prevent proliferation.  Any legislation which exists in European countries does not, as far as I am aware, make for easy proliferation and fragmentation of unions.  Certainly, if we get away from Western Europe, legislation in the United States is fairly restricted in this respect.  The Committee of Experts, with reference to the Social Charter was referred to quite a bit by Senator Horgan.  My latest report from the Committee of Experts is that they are satisfied that the legislation is not in conflict with the spirit of the Charter. They always express their reservations, keeping an eye, like <i>The Skibbereen Eagle,</i> on what we are doing.</P>
    <P>This Bill has one particular function. It is of some urgency in that it is not retrospective.  It only becomes law when it is signed by the President.  It is for that reason that I have sought to have it sighed at the earliest opportunity, because Members of this House will appreciate that the purpose of the Bill can be defeated by groups who may seek to secure registration in the interim between its passing in the Dáil and the the signing by the President, in which case I could be forced to conform to the requirements of the existing legislation. That would be defeating the purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Some have come in. In so far as I can examine them, they are legitimate applications which ordinarily one would not reject.  I suppose they simply sought to get in under the easier terms rather than wait when perhaps they might have to have an appeal to the court.  There is the possibility that this could happen and for that reason it could defeat the purpose of the Bill.  I should like it to be treated as a matter of urgency for that reason.  I could have inserted a clause making the date of operation to correspond with the circulation of the Bill, or its introduction, or some other time, but it is not always considered good to have retrospective legislation.  For that reason I decided to take a chance that there would not be much delay in the Bill becoming law.  I thank the House for the way they have received the Bill and for the very interesting debate.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to contribute 4 million US dollars to the current international programme to provide additional funds for the International Development Association.  The funds are required so that the association may be able to continue and expand its work of promoting the economic development of the less developed countries.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association was set up in 1960, to provide aid on easy terms, as a subsidiary of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  At present it has 107 member countries, including Ireland.  It makes interest-free or low interest loans repayable over periods up to 50 years.  Usually there is an initial grace period of ten years during which no repayments are required. The need for this type of organisation arose from the fact that many developing countries were finding it increasingly difficult to finance their development programmes by borrowing on normal market terms.  Market borrowing was straining their credit-worthiness and was creating a serious debt-servicing problem for them, a problem which has tended to become more acute in recent years.</P>
      <P>The association is closely linked with the World Bank in its management, staffing and general operations.  Many projects in developing countries are financed by a combination of bank and association loans, the bank funds being provided on more conventional terms. The overall effect is to reduce substantially the cost to the borrower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At an early stage the association decided to concentrate its activities on developing countries whose <i>per capita</i> income did not exceed £300, about £120, a year.  From its inception in 1960 to June, 1971, it made available a total of £3,340 million.  This comprised 274 <Col N="1796" /> loans to 58 countries.  There has been a steady increase in operations, particularly since 1967, according as the association has had access to greater financial resources.</P>
    <P>Loans are usually provided to finance specific projects and are normally intended to cover the foreign exchange costs involved.  Sometimes funds are given to assist a general development programme or reconstruction measures. For example, a loan to assist reconstruction in Nigeria was made earlier this year.  Every project is carefully evaluated and the association must be satisfied that it will contribute to the economic advancement of the country concerned.  A large proportion of lending has been for agricultural purposes but transport and communications, irrigation, power supplies, education and technical assistance have also benefited.  An important feature of the association's aid is that recipients are not tied to any particular suppliers for the purchase of machinery and equipment needed for their projects but can &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; to get the best value.</P>
    <P>The organisation depends largely on the 19 richer member countries for funds.  In 1960, when it was set up, those countries, which are known as Part I members, subscribed £751 million in convertible currencies.  The other members, called Part II members, comprising the less industrialised countries, like ourselves, and the developing countries, paid £265 million but only 10 per cent of this sum had to be paid in convertible form.  In 1964 the association found it necessary to replenish its resources and the Part I members contributed a further £741 million.  A second replenishment in 1968, also provided by the Part I members, brought in a further £1,200 million.  Earlier this year agreement was reached on a third replenishment to provide a total of £2,450 million over the next three years.  This replenishment has not yet become effective as the necessary procedures have not been completed by sufficient members.  It is hoped that the formalities will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been a Part II member of the association since its inception in <Col N="1797" /> 1960.  Our initial subscription was £3.03 million.  Although the conditions required that only 10 per cent of this sum be paid in convertible currency, we paid the subscription in full in foreign exchange as an indication of our support for the association's work.  In common with the other Part II members, we did not participate in the replenishments in 1964 or 1968.  On the present occasion, however, approaches were made by the Association to the more advanced Part II members, including this country, asking that they share in the latest financing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The demand for concessionary aid is almost insatiable, as more and more of the poorer countries find themselves unable to finance their development programmes by conventional means and meet rapidly rising burdens of debt repayment.  &ldquo;Soft&rdquo; aid is one of the most important means at present of ensuring a real transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world.  The Commission of International Development, set up by the World Bank under the Chairmanship of Mr. Lester Pearson, former Prime Minister of Canada, in its Report published in September, 1969, called for a massive increase in this type of aid. We are committed to increasing our development aid according as our economic circumstances improve.  The Government have decided, therefore, that it would be reasonable to increase our contribution to the International Development Association, subject to the passage of this Bill.  As already mentioned, the additional contribution proposed is £4 million.  I might mention that Spain, Switzerland, New Zealand and Yugoslavia have also agreed to contribute.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to authorise payment of our further contribution out of the Central Fund.  This is necessary because a firm arrangement must be made at the beginning to commit the sum in three annual instalments, so that the association will have some assurance that funds will be available to enable it to meet its commitments to developing country borrowers.  Actual disbursements may be apread over a longer period and will be a matter for agreement with the Association.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> It has been said that our aid effort is too small and that we are not keeping up with the efforts of other countries. The great bulk of the aid we provide officially is made available through international bodies, such as the various United Nations agencies, the World Bank and the International Development Association.  This helps to ensure that it is applied to the best advantage of the recipient countries.  International statistics indicate that our performance in such multilateral aid-giving is not unreasonable in comparison with other countries.  Other countries, however, also give a large proportion of their aid bilaterally.  Much of this kind of aid is between the major powers and their former colonial territories, and a high proportion is tied in one way or another to the purchase of goods, perhaps machinery and equipment, from the donor countries.  Thus, the donor countries may be doing little more than extending credits from which they will get valuable benefits in production and exports.</P>
    <P>Our case is quite different.  We do not benefit to any extent in trade and a definite sacrifice of resources is, therefore, involved.  It must be remembered, too, that we have to import capital in sizeable amount to finance our development programme.  As long as this is so and as long as we have a serious balance of payments problem, our ability to provide capital for overseas countries must necessarily be limited. Nevertheless, the amount of our aid has been increasing.  It has grown from £673,000 in 1964/65 to £1¾ million in 1970/71 and the increase of £4 million now proposed will provide a further boost.  This is an earnest of the Government's wish to do our best by the Third World.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House that Ireland has for many years been making significant contributions also through the missionary effort, which includes contributions in such fields as education, medicine and nursing.  We have also made personnel available to international agencies for technical assistance missions and educational and training facilities have been provided in our universities for students from the less developed countries as well as training facilities in the Army <Col N="1799" /> and other public services.  When these contributions are taken into account, our record is not, perhaps, as small as the bald comparison of statistics might suggest.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a practical expression of our willingness to share in the international development effort.  As such I have no doubt that it will be readily welcomed by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for myself and for my party, I unreservedly welcome this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when introducing it, referred to the Third World.  We should not think so much in terms of ourselves and themselves&mdash;of a Third World, and presumably the other two are: the rich capitalist countries, more or less rich; and the more or less rich communist countries.  We should think in terms of and that we are part of that world; one community, and that we are part of that single community.</P>
      <P>Just as it is universally accepted that in a polity such as ours those who have more should be taxed to give to those who are in need, likewise, this concept of the distribution of income within a nation, within a country, or polity must be extended and made universal to the single community of man.  It was a happy expression of the Parliamentary Secretary when he referred to the contributions of our missionaries.  Not that we can claim credit for what they have done, but they, in their efforts, by the dedication of their lives, have at least indicated what the best elements in our community wish even if they be not missionaries themselves or even Christians or if they be not the particular sect of Christian to which the missionary belongs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill, I do so, having regard to the statement made by Lester Pearson, not in his Report of September 1969&mdash;which, incidentally I do not find in the Library of the Oireachtas&mdash;but in a contribution he made to a subsequent debate and reported in the proceedings of the World Bank for the year 1969. He said that, in fact, to understand the situation we must realise that the developing countries are at that stage of development that Western Europe was <Col N="1800" /> at before the Industrial Revolution.  A startling figure was given by Mr. Lser in a table contained in a paper he read at the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland.  He said that the countries with low levels of industrialisation, having two-thirds of the world's population share in one-eighth of the gross national product.  At another point Lester Pearson, again in these proceedings to which I referred earlier, said that development is part of their unfinished revolution, another stage in their struggle for freedom.  It is a common observation in any of the writings on this subject that unless there is a licking of the problem, as someone called it, the gap, which has been widening notwithstanding the contributions since 1960, and indeed earlier contributions since the end of the war, will widen even more.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of our present international situation that we ought to look at the contribution which the Oireachtas will decide that Ireland should provide.  It was resolved by the United Nations General Assembly in 1970 that the target to be aimed at for aid should be 1 per cent of gross national product.  That is a figure which has been revised, in the terms of the judgment of what will be possible to be attained in the year 1975 to 7 per cent. It is worth looking at what has been done by those countries.  The communist countries, for example&mdash;I hope I am allowed to refer to the communist countries and to point something out about them without being described as illiberal&mdash;firmly refused to commit themselves to the 1 per cent gross national product target.  In the Pearson Report it was established that in the years 1965-1967, the period considered, total communist aid represented only 3 per cent of the total net aid given to those countries.  There has been a stepping up in communist aid since then, taking China, Russia and the rest of the Eastern bloc together, but the contribution that has been stepping up to mask the falling contribution from the Soviets has been the contribution from China. A sharp Russian drop has been concealed by an increase in the Chinese contribution.</P>
    <P>The only countries in 1970&mdash;and it is <Col N="1801" /> worth looking at them because there is a tendency to say that the rich European countries are failing particularly in this regard&mdash;to reach the target were Belgium, Holland, France, the United Kingdom and, surprisingly, Portugal. Added to the group of European countries should be Australia.  America has, in terms of their gross national product, always done worse than the other advanced countries and as a result of the Senate decision made in October&mdash;perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to tell me whether the House of Representatives have yet dealt with that decision&mdash;this contribution is going to be lower still. Why I am mentioning the communist countries, on the one hand, and the European countries and America, on the other hand, is that much of this aid-aid which extends beyond what is covered by this Bill&mdash;consists, as economists discreetly put it, of the puffing-up of rickety client States, the bringing of succour to war-devastated areas, the placating of doubtful friends, the arming of potential allies and the provision of markets&mdash;to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred&mdash;for products of the donor countries.</P>
    <P>In connection with that last point&mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary was quite right in drawing the attention of the House to it&mdash;it has been calculated that one-third of the steel exports of the United States are purchased by aid countries.  Something in the region of 140 million dollars worth of chemical manufactures are similarly purchased as a result of those aid programmes and 265 million dollars worth of machinery production.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for us here to stand in judgment on the performance of America in relation to this. Countries which want aid should remember the old rule of diplomacy that if you want to get the assistance of some country you should do so without antagonising that country.  Among the reasons which have led to the cutting of American aid is that 40 of the countries which were getting foreign aid from America voted against the American desire to retain Taiwan in the United Nations.  If you are being honest in trying to get an overall picture of <Col N="1802" /> this you have to remember that if you want money you have to be on reasonably good terms with your bank manager.  You cannot expect him to ignore your cocking a snook at him as he passes in a car that is better than yours.  Anyone concerned to advise client states in the developing areas will only be misleading them if he encourages them in the idea that they can have the luxury of a foreign policy which ignores the realities of their own circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is possible to look at this question of aid&mdash;I think this is called concessional aid which comes under this legislation and this international agreement&mdash;without remembering that the amount of aid which actually reaches the developing areas, through this source, represents only about 11 per cent of the total.  The other forms represent a very much larger portion, but it has the advantage that the money is administered by people who are aware of the problems arising in the countries which are receiving the money, who have expert accountants, expert engineers, people who are realistic about political corruption and whose job it is to see that the project which is being financed is the project which is, in fact, financed, and that as little as possible of the money is spent on nest feathering.  That is why it is good to see us coming in with this particular contribution to this body.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to discuss the proposed contribution without referring to the whole question of population growth.  In relation to this, I find myself broadly able to comprehend the arguments without being able to come down with certainty on one side or another.  However, I approach it optimistically when I reflect on the fact that 150 years ago, or thereabouts, Thomas Malthus produced his famous essay on population in Britain, when the population there was a fraction of what it is at present; at that time in Britain he foresaw all their efforts at wealth creation being frustrated by the operation of this principle, this tendency for population to grow in geometrical progression whereas, because of the scarity of resources, wealth could grow only in an arithmetical progression. <Col N="1803" /> He saw this as constantly preventing the creation of wealth on a durable and politically stable basis.  By this approach, Thomas Malthus affected the economic policy of Britain&mdash;to Britain's advantage and to our disadvantage incidentally. He was proved to be wrong, if we only look at the last 150 years in terms of wealth creation in Britain, Western Europe and America.  He was simply a pessimist when those who were optimistic on this were right.</P>
    <P>I view the future of the world with a recollection of how he viewed the future of his world and how wrong he was with regard to it.  We must take note of the fact that, while projections for the future may be unrealistic because the factors may change, the present rate of population continues&mdash; the world's population was 1½ billion in 1900&mdash;in another 80 years it will be 25 billion.  One might say: &ldquo;Do not be worrying.  In 120 years from now it will be 50 billion.&rdquo;  We must take note of these facts and of the opinions of people like Gunnar Myrdal, in his <i>The Challenge of World Poverty</i>.  He says that there is a clear necessity for lowering birth rates in these countries in order to make sustained economic development possible.  Father Arthur McCormack wrote in <i>The Tablet</i> on 5th June, 1971, and commented on the United Kingdom Population Report which had just been published.  Referring to the optimistic view to which I have given expression, Father McCormack said &ldquo;To my mind this view is no longer tenable.&rdquo;  On the other hand, Colin Clark takes Barbara Ward to task. While he agrees with her that the most essential need to deal with the short-term problems of these countries is simply to produce more food there and increase agricultural production, he disagrees with her that this task is hampered by an increase in population. He gives figures published by the OECD in respect of the national accounts of the less developed countries for the years 1959 to 1968.  They show that the rate of increase of agricultural production increases with an increase of population.</P>
    <P>The article was a very striking one and brought out facts that never appear in <Col N="1804" /> newspapers.  While there was a genera average increase of 5 per cent in agricultural production in all these countries, this general average masked two surprising facts.  Firstly, countries such as Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Ethiopia, Sudan, do not, or those who have been helping them do not, get many compliments.  During this period these countries increased their agricultural production at the rate of 15 per cent per annum.  These are quite surprising figures.  During this period there was an 11 per cent per annum increase in Brazil and a 19 per cent increase in Mexico and in a number of Latin-American countries.</P>
    <P>One fact masked in the 5 per cent average was the serious decline in agricultural production due to political disruption and attempts to collectivise agriculture in Cuba, Algeria, Tunis, Uruguay and Indonesia, all of which, with certain other slight declines, pulled down the average to 5 per cent.  These facts are worth examining.  At the same time note should be taken of the fact that, as Lser again said in the paper I have already mentioned, there is little doubt that at the initial stage of industrialisation a fast population growth is an obstacle, as it tends to divert urgently needed resources from the industrial section.  At a later stage population growth can act as a stimulus and has apparently done so.</P>
    <P>I have referred to these matters and come back again to Clark, when he talks about the justifiable economic grievance of the developing countries because of the fact that the terms of trade have been turning against them during the relevant period.  What they were getting for their exported food was declining in terms of what they had to pay for their imported manufactures. I am sure that nobody in this assembly needs to be reminded of the strength of the farm lobbies in different countries that have dealt with this.  The same can be said of the trade union lobbies that have maintained quota restrictions and taxes on some of the things that developed countries do not produce, such as coffee, tea and cocoa.</P>
    <P>What does not appear from the Act which is being amended, or from the Bill which is amending it is: who <Col N="1805" /> administers our policy with regard to these contributions?  We have votes. How are these votes cast?  Is there a section in the Department of Finance which determines this?  Is there any report as to how we voted on a particular issue?  Who makes it?  Does Parliament determine the policy in any way?</P>
    <P>The Library has the annual reports but it is a pity that in the original Act there was no provision for presenting the annual report to the Houses of Parliament.  This would give us an opportunity of having this kind of debate, more often than once every 11 years; and it is the clear duty of a Christian to form a view as to what we should be doing and how much we should subscribe.  As a people, the more we were involved, the more we were conscious of the extent of our contribution&mdash;and of the cost, too, in terms of human suffering, of our not making a contribution&mdash;the better it would be.</P>
    <P>I should like to get an explanation of a point which the Parliamentary Secretary made in his opening speech.  He stated that our initial subscription was 3.03 million dollars and, although the conditions required that only 10 per cent of this sum be paid in convertible currency, we pay the subscription in full in foreign exchange.  Now I will become technical and ask by what authority?  The International Development Association Act 1960 states: &ldquo;The Government were entitled to make payments under subsections (a) to (d) of section 2 of Article 2 of the Agreement.&rdquo; If you look at sections (a) to (d) there is a provision for the payment of 10 per cent in foreign currency and for 90 per cent in our currency.  That was the authority given by the Oireachtas. By what authority did you pay the 90 per cent in convertible currency?  If we give the Government authority to spend £1,000 million, does that entitle them to spend £1,000 million in convertible currency?  I suggest most strongly that it does not any more than it entitles a Government to give a guarantee, which can be sued out in foreign currency if the statute entitling the country to give the guarantee does not expressly entitle the Government to guarantee in foreign currency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> Why is this amendment necessary? The articles of agreement of the International Development Association provide for an initial subscription payable as to 10 per cent in one form, 90 per cent in another.  It then provides for additional subscriptions under Article 3, section 1 and I presume it is under that section of that article that we have been paying whatever has been paid in addition to the initial subscription. If it were possible to pay 90 per cent of the additional subscription which was authorised to be paid in Irish currency in convertible currency, why is it not possible to use section 1, Article 3 to make this additional subscription to what is technically incorrectly described as a subsidiary of the World Bank?  It is not a subsidiary of the World Bank, if I understand the use of language.  It is an association whose members are and have to be members of the World Bank. This does not make it a subsidiary of the World Bank, though the two work closely together.  Is this not also covered by the provision with regard to supplementary resources?</P>
    <P>There was no provision in the Act governing this for the operation of section 2, Article 3.  Is this the section of the Articles of Agreement under which this additional subscription is to be made?  If so, the amendment proposed does not seem apt.  A more simple amendment would be needed of the provisions of section 3, subsection (2), of the Act providing for payments under section 2 of Article 3 of the Agreement which would be a better way to fill the gap left in the Act governing this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude with a question.  I notice that Switzerland and New Zealand are mentioned as having agreed to contribute.  They did not sign the original document or had not signed it at the time of its deposit with the United Nations.  This surprises me with regard to New Zealand.  Is it possible that we are in the same category financially as Switzerland?  Is Switzerland in Part 2?  They are damnably clever if they are in Part 2 with us and not in Part 1.</P>

      <P>It is a satisfaction to support a Bill of this nature.  Our <Col N="1807" /> ability to contribute to international funds of this kind must depend to a great extent on our willingness to develop and expand our economy.  It is a good sign that we are in a position to contribute four million dollars to the underdeveloped countries and the less fortunate section of the world's population.</P>
      <P>Although we are still developing our own economy to provide for our own people, we should be seen to be contributing to this fund.  As a nation we have experienced poverty and backwardness in the past and it is right for us to set a good example to the better off countries, many of whom are in a better position to contribute to funds of this nature.  I am pleased to support this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Alexis FitzGerald and Senator Brugha I support and welcome this Bill.  As Senator Brugha pointed out it is good that a small country like this can give some support to the underdeveloped and emerging countries.  There are one or two points which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear up. He has been handed an armful of problems by Senator Alexis FitzGerald but mine will be simpler.</P>
      <P>In the second paragraph of the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech this evening he states:</P>
      <P>The International Development Association was set up in 1960, to provide aid on easy terms, as a subsidiary of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. At present it has 107 member countries, including Ireland.  It makes interest-free or low interest loans repayable over periods up to 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1960 we have contributed over $3 million.  We propose now to contribute $4 million to the International Development Association.  It would appear from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that this money is being loaned out at low rates of interest, or interest-free, up to a period of 50 years.  Does this mean that the <Col N="1808" /> money we give to the International Development Association will be repaid at some particular time in the future? In other words, is it only interim aid?</P>
    <P>This is the first point I should like to have cleared up because the Parliamentary Secretary also pointed out that while 19 wealthy countries are contributing much more per head of population they are perhaps contributing much less than a small country such as ours.  He also pointed out that these wealthy countries who contribute so much are able to get repayment in kind in view of the trade they are able to do with these emerging countries.  We all welcome the chance to help these underdeveloped countries in their efforts to emerge but there is an old saying &ldquo;charity begins at home&rdquo;. A sum of $4 million is a lot of capital. We have a number of small industries that could do with a small injection of capital.  While we should do our part we should not try to keep up with the Jones's and do more than our part. There is quite an amount of aid needed in our own country in areas that need development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the point Senator J. Fitzgerald has made that it is often difficult to assess the values in spending abroad in development aid at a time when certainly the need for funds at home seems pressing and paramount.  I would like to advise Senator J. Fitzgerald that I take seriously the title which the Irish hierarchy's Commission for Justice and Peace chose for their pamphlet which dealt with this matter of development aid and the problems of other countries. They called this pamphlet &ldquo;The Third World War&rdquo;, and indicated that in their view the third world war, which is the war to combat poverty overseas, which if not combated now would create a problem which would engulf us all, was already going on and we shirk our responsibilities in this war at our peril. I take that view where any contribution we can make towards dealing with the problems of world poverty and underdevelopment is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to welcome the brief statements of principle that the Parliamentary Secretary has put into his <Col N="1809" /> Second Reading contribution here, particularly the statement of our commitment to increasing our development aid according as our economic circumstances improve.  It is important to make that sort of statement now when we are about to enter the EEC, a Community who have been criticised in some quarters for their attitude towards development aid to the third world.  It is important that our attitude in this matter as we enter the EEC should be quite clear.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make is that the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the component given to our aid contribution by the voluntary work of Irish people overseas.  In September this year proposals were put to the Government for the formation of a central unit which would co-ordinate voluntary work overseas and provide a focus for further recruitment of volunteers and the development of this work.  I should be interested to hear if the Government have had an opportunity to consider this proposal.  It is a proposal that should have very serious, and I hope, favourable consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the welcome to this Bill and the intentions behind it.  From the point of view of information it is a pity that a table was not given to us showing the contribution to the various countries so that we might be in a position to gauge our contribution both in direct aid and what is acknowledged as aid in other ways under bilateral arrangements. In voting a sum of 4 million dollars, or almost £2 million, in fairness we are entitled to have this information. I hope the first possible opportunity will be availed of in future to provide information on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project itself is a laudable effort to help the Third World.  Our contribution looks reasonable for a country of our size but I am a little worried that all our contributions are of the direct type.  As the Minister's statement says, we are giving very little in the way of bilateral aid where there would be a certain benefit accruing to this country from the spending of that <Col N="1810" /> aid.  Personally, in this case where we are giving 4 million dollars I would prefer if half of it was by way of bilateral aid, not under this International Development Association where it has to be given direct without strings attached.  Yet, in reckoning our contribution under this, the amount we have given by direct aid under bilateral arrangements would be reckoned in that.  Indeed, we should see that it is reckoned.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the concluding two paragraphs of his speech that we are making contributions through the missionary effort and so on, but so far as I am aware no public money has been spent on that.  The plea I am making now is that at this point in time, and probably for the next decade, we have a superabundance of trained personnel.  We find that the development of second level education has resulted in a greater number of people being trained than we are likely to be able to use.  This applies to both graduates from the universities and from the technical colleges.  The Government should keep in mind this very valuable resource we have got and it should be quite free at the expense of the Irish taxpayer by bilateral agreements with countries in the Third World, especially the African countries with which we have strong missionary links. We should be prepared to see sizeable numbers of graduates, at the 200, 300 or 500 level, going out for a specific period of time, where they could make a contribution as teachers or as engineers or as business people.</P>
    <P>This contribution would be of immense value towards developing those countries.  It would be of greater value than anything we can contribute financially. I am quite conscious that some of this is being done by the missionary orders, but it is being done on a very limited scale because their funds are very limited.  If half the present fund or something of that order was available in a three or five year period for financing this type of work, then obviously we could send out a very large number of trained young people to carry out the great work they can do in those areas.  On the one hand it would help us in so far as we have at present <Col N="1811" /> a rather difficult situation with regard to employment for our graduates and trained people.  That is not unique; the same holds true in England and America and other places.  It is not for the good of the graduates or of the nation that those young men and women should be idle.  I think we could gain a great advantage by sending them out.</P>
    <P>Looking at the other side of the coin, what is in it for us?  What is in it for us is that these young people, returning home after three to five years working in those countries, might be convinced that Ireland is not such a bad place after all.  Their standards would be much more realistic than they would be immediately after graduation.  Having endured the rather difficult conditions in those underdeveloped countries, I feel certain that when they came back they would be far better able to get down to real development work here and they would make an immense contribution.</P>
    <P>We may have a rough period or a period where we have a surplus and where the world around us has a surplus for the next four or five years, but after that I would hope that we would see an expanding phase where we would be able to use the talents of those people.  It is something we should keep in mind, and when I see some sum like the 4 million dollars that is mentioned here I think half that spent in a way in which we think these countries can benefit would probably be of more advantage to them than the same sum going through the international organisations. I would appeal to the Minister in future to keep this in mind and to keep in mind our real wealth in dealing with the Third World and the tremendous number of trained people we have got.</P>
    <P>They can contribute, and the Third World is short and very short of all those trained personnel.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister and the Government not to lose sight of this. Also, I should like to see at some time some Government publication &mdash; the Department of Foreign Affairs very often issue those&mdash;setting out Ireland's contribution and showing its relative position in comparison with the contributions <Col N="1812" /> made by the other countries in Class A and in Class B.  With those reservations, I commend what we are doing and I think it is only right and proper that we should play our part in all this work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief on this.  I understand, I think, the point of view that was expressed by Senator Quinlan and the arguments that he has put up, but it would seem to me that the comparison that we require in connection with this Bill or the giving of assistance of this kind is not so much a comparison between what we contribute and what other countries contribute, even on a relative basis.  I think it is a comparison between what we contribute and what we can reasonably afford to contribute.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Quinlan, I am a little disappointed that in introducing the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary did not give us those kinds of comparisons and that he did not spell out for the Members of the House what on a percentage or a <i>per capita</i> basis, the kind of contribution we are now making would amount to.  I do not know&mdash;and because the Parliamentary Secretary did not mention it I do not suppose anyone else here knows&mdash;exactly what 4 million dollars means on a percentage basis here relative, for example, to the gross national product or even on a <i>per capita</i> basis relative to wage and salary earners in this country.  It would seem to me that what we should bear in mind here is that, even though we may be comparatively speaking a fairly poor country ourselves, the person with a pound in his pocket is a rich person as compared with the person who has only a penny in his pocket.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly that our contribution to schemes of this sort, which I think is an extremely good one, should be governed very much more by what we feel we can afford to give rather than by what other countries, whether they be wealthy or poorer than ourselves, give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me on to the next point I wanted to mention, and it is this. Whatever contribution we make is a contribution being made through the <Col N="1813" /> agency of the Houses of the Oireachtas. All right, but in fact it is a contribution being made by the ordinary people of this country, the people who, one way or another, have to pay the taxes which raise the money that is dispensed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, in a very real sense any contribution we make under this Bill is a contribution being made to poorer countries and to poorer individuals in those countries around the world by the ordinary people of this country.  We should not regard this, in any sense, as a contribution that is being made by the Irish Government or by the Irish Parliament, even though they may be the agency through which the money is voted.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the point made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald in this connection.  We realise the true significance of this contribution&mdash;that we are all one world&mdash;because it is made by the ordinary people of Ireland to their poorer brethren elsewhere in the world. Because our country is very nearly 100 per cent Christian, we would not alone feel an obligation to assist the less well-off but would welcome the opportunity to do so in a practical sense.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is that I feel Members of this House should pay a very warm tribute to Senator Alexis FitzGerald for the analytical way in which he dealt with this matter and for the amount of research he made on the subject.  Were it not for this detailed information&mdash;by this I do not wish any disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I feel a number of us would not have regarded this matter in its proper context.  I think it only proper to mention this point.</P>
    <P>Somebody made the remark in the course of the debate that charity begins at home.  This is a relevant matter. There is also the old saying that God helps those who help themselves.  If we are midway up the ladder, so far as prosperity goes, we should not hesitate, by consideration of any clichés, such as the above mentioned, to play our part: we should give as best we can according to our means to less developed countries even if it means the temporary postponement of some of our own plans at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> These are only some general observations on the subject.  In the future I think there should be a fixed agreement on our percentage contribution to the International Development Association. The structure of this association, in the division between Part I and Part II contributors, reflecting the distribution of wealth among States, is a good idea. The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned a target of 1 per cent.  I do not know if this was ever agreed on.  Obviously, we in this country are not committed to this percentage.  If we were we should have an Act whereby the Government, having assessed what the percentage would be in money terms, could make such a contribution without further legislation.</P>
    <P>As far as my party and I are concerned, I would suggest that the proper method&mdash;and this view was expressed some time ago&mdash;would be to fix a percentage contribution which we could afford to make whenever the need or the opportunity arose rather than having to enact further legislation when asked to contribute.  My concern in relation to this matter, as my colleagues will be aware, is not that we may be contributing too much but if we are contributing what we can afford.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate for the attitudes which they ave adopted, in particular the constructive research which Senator Alexis FitzGerald has obviously put into this matter.</P>
      <P>Ireland's contribution in official aid to developing countries has grown from £¼ million in 1961-62 to £1.8 million in 1970-71.  Our commitment to contribute to the International Development Association means that, assuming no change in the amount of our aid under other heads, there will be an increase of official aid to a level of more than £2 million for each of the next three years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater part of Irish official aid is provided, multilaterally, through the various UN agencies, the United Nations Development Fund, the World Bank, IDA and so on.  It is true, as Senators have pointed out, that the <Col N="1815" /> aims set out by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was 1 per cent of the gross national product.  This percentage has been refined by the Pearson Report to 0.7 per cent for official aid and the balance to be given by private assistance.  These targets are to be reached by 1975.</P>
    <P>The Irish aid effort has been frequently criticised as being too low and as falling below the international aid targets and the efforts of other countries.  Senator O'Higgins referred to this matter in his address.  In relation to multilateral aid I should like to put on record how we compare, in this aspect of aid, with other countries.  In Ireland we contribute 0.10 per cent of the gross national product; in Belgium it is 0.14 per cent; in France it is 0.05 per cent; in Germany it is 0.03 per cent; in Italy it is 0.03 per cent, in the Netherlands it is 0.13 per cent; in the UK it is 0.07 per cent; in Denmark it is 0.17 per cent and in Norway it is 0.25 per cent.  That sounds quite satisfactory but, as has been pointed out here, there is also the question of bilateral aid.  Ireland is not in a position, as countries like the United Kingdom and Germany are, to use this method of giving credit to countries to enable them to buy materials that are produced in their own countries.</P>
    <P>As regards the 1 per cent international target, it has been recognised that this did not necessarily apply to countries such as Ireland which are still in the process of development and which have to import capital for their own development. When the 1 per cent target was being discussed, a target of 0.2 per cent or 0.3 per cent was suggested for countries such as our own.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald referred to the Third World.  He mentioned that the gap between the developed countries and the underdeveloped countries is widening continuously.  The majority of the world's population live in the less-developed areas and on present forecasts this majority will rise to between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the total population by the middle of the next century.  The present aid structure in developing countries shows a high <Col N="1816" /> percentage of dependants; the age groups of 15 to 64 in developing countries comprise less than six in every ten of the population and they must support the remaining four in ten. This question of population has been raised in different ways here.  The various Papal Encyclicals and statements, notably <i>Populorum Progressio</i> and the <i>Constitution of the Church in the Modern World,</i> have pointed out the obligations that we have towards the poorer nations.</P>
    <P>I was also asked how the votes are cast and who determines our policy. The policy in regard to the IDA is determined by the Minister for Finance. He is the political head of the Department responsible and he is also a member of the association's board of governors.  Technically, 118,000 dollars of our four million dollars will be regarded as an additional subscription. Voting power in the association is being adjusted to reflect the actual financial contributions of members over the years and each member is being given the opportunity of subscribing for sufficient extra votes to maintain its relative voting position.  At present we have 1,106 votes&mdash;that is 0.43 per cent&mdash;of the total.  Under the new arrangement we shall be entitled to 3,825 votes which will be also 0.43 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>As regards the payment of our initial subscription of three million dollars in full, the position is that the first 10 per cent was paid in freely convertible currency as permitted specifically in the 1960 Act.  The remaining 90 per cent was paid in Irish currency in the first instance, as also permitted by the 1960 Act, and this was subsequently converted into foreign exchange, as permitted under the Exchange Control Regulations.  I should like to inform Senator Alexis FitzGerald also that Switzerland is not a member but they make contributions on a free basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Jack Fitzgerald, while he welcomed the Bill, said that in his opinion charity should begin at home. He suggested that the £1.8 million might be better spent on the establishment of small factories throughout the country and that additional help should <Col N="1817" /> be given to the IDA or other agencies connected with industrial development. I should like to point out to the Senator that this has been done.  It is not many weeks since the Minister for Finance allocated an extra £6 million to the Industrial Development Authority.  It is a question of priorities.  I should like to say to Senators, and to Senator Jack Fitzgerald in particular, that any criticism we have had in relation to this Bill has mostly been to the effect that Ireland has not been doing enough and that it should do more.  In the last ten years &mdash; taking the relative values of money into account &mdash; we have more than doubled our contributions to relief of this kind.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan was concerned about obtaining more information on what each country contributes.  I have the documentation here in relation to that but I am sure the Seanad would not wish me to read it out.  In order to meet this point I will arrange that these tables will be made available in the Library.  The tables are quite complex and cover a number of years and show how votes are related to contributions and so on.  In Class II the biggest number of votes are held by India who, proportionately, are making a very substantial contribution.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan raised the question of direct aid and spoke about the graduates.  In my introductory statement I pointed out what we are doing in relation to aid of this type, in training or sending out trained staff to other countries.  I think Senator Quinlan should realise that in this country, as industry expands, we are now finding a shortage of skilled labour in certain fields.  This, of course, will have to be borne in mind by the training authority, AnCO, and when speaking of the requirements of industry.  We are at present going through a period of complete reorganisation and new approaches because we are now coming into the concept of being one of the more industrialised European countries and we will have to be able to provide for the needs of our own people.  This is not, as Senator Jack Fitzgerald has said, a question of charity beginning at home but I think we should continue, as we have been doing, sending trained personnel, such as nurses and civil servants to these countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> I do not think there is anything controversial in the Bill.  I do not think there has been any suggestion that it should be amended.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to make provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtála, to enable that body to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish exports.</P>
      <P>The Export Promotion Act, 1959, under which Córas Tráchtála was established, fixed at £1 million the total amount of grants which might be made to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Subsequent Export Promotion Acts raised this limit; the last one, in 1969, raised it to £9 million and the present Bill proposes to raise it to £15 million.</P>
      <P>There is little need for me to emphasise to this House that moneys made available to Córas Tráchtála are well spent.  Senators are well aware of the vital importance of the board's task and of the efficiency of their operation.</P>
      <P>It is 12 years since the Export Promotion Act of 1959 set up Córas Tráchtála as a statutory board, taking over the functions of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta.  During those 12 years, Córas Tráchtála have made a notable contribution to the development which brought total exports from the level of £130 million in 1959 to £468 million in 1970 and, at the same time, increased exports of industrial goods from some 32 per cent of this total to 53 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" /> As industrial activity expanded in volume and range, Córas Tráchtála's operation was coherently and constructively extended to provide exporters with the aids and services they needed and to help them in opening up new markets and consolidating their foothold in existing markets.  An indication of the expansion involved is that Córas Tráchtála, in 1970, dealt with more than 1,000 Irish firms, including new industries, and estimate that their services are used regularly by 95 per cent of the country's major exporters.</P>
    <P>The board has been quick to provide new services as they saw industry's needs for them arising.  Thus they have provided specialist consultancy services in market research and design management; and a special industrial exports section to help exporters of engineering and capital goods.  They have, while maintaining their general range of services, used their resources constructively by directing major efforts successively on different markets.  They opened new offices as required in Britain, North America, Australia, Germany and France and they intend to open two more offices in Brussels and Milan, giving them four centres, initially, within the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Export development cannot be separated from industrial development as a whole and Córas Tráchtála have played their part here also, their specialised knowledge being in many ways at the disposal of Irish industry. They have pioneered in the field of industrial design development and they collaborate with the IDA and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on consultative and working commitees dealing with re-equipment, and research and development grants. They also participate in the work of the Committee on Industrial Progress, which was set up under my Department to assess the progress made by industry in preparation for free trade, with special emphasis on product policy and marketing.</P>
    <P>Payments to the board by way of grant-in-aid up to 31st March of this year totalled £7,611,885, which left a balance of £1,388,115 out of the existing statutory limit of £9 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> This is less than the board's financial requirements for the current year, which amount to £1,754,000.  I am sure that Senators will agree that Córas Tráchtála must have adequate funds for its work, on which so much depends. I confidently recommend provision of an additional £6 million for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There is one additional provision in the Bill.  This is the amendment of Section 3 of the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1969 which provided power for Córas Tráchtála to assist architects and engineers in relation to certain design and planning services in connection with engineering and construction works abroad.  There was no intention to exclude quantity surveyors from benefiting under the earlier Act. Their exclusion was merely an accident of drafting.  They are equally concerned with architects and engineers in design and planning services and the present amendment proposes to enable them to benefit to the same extent as architects and engineers at present benefit under the 1969 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a comfort to the House and to the Minister, whom we welcome here, to know that I have very little to say on the subject.  However, basically I should like to welcome what is proposed. From all the information that I have about Córas Tráchtála, I should like to observe that they do their work most excellently and are thoroughly deserving of the additional support which is proposed to be given them by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is not wrong that a body such as this is as good as it is permitted to be by the funds that are made available to them and by the quality of the staff under their distribution control, and also by the capability of the people who tender advice.  They can only give advice and assist exporters with suggestions and recommendations and other material assistance in their power.  Córas Tráchtála cannot go beyond that.  They can bring the horse to the water but they cannot make him drink.  The extent to which Córas Tráchtála have succeeded in making that horse drink is indicated from the opening words of the Minister when he <Col N="1821" /> indicated the remarkable development in exports which has taken place between the years 1959 and 1970.  I think it might have been more interesting to have let the figure run from 1956, when the export tax reliefs were introduced first.  They have also played a notable part.  Córas Tráchtála would not dispute perhaps an even more notable part in bringing about this development, which resulted from the positive proposals made in the years which preceded 1959.</P>
    <P>I should like to end with this observation and I am sorry that the leader of the House is not present to hear it, but he is well represented.  The last words of the Minister indicate the desirability of patience on the part of the Government and on the part of the majority party in both Houses, when they get irritating and pettifogging points, made apparently by people who have to debate measures with a view to trying to improve the drafting.  Now I am told that it was not intended to exclude the quantity surveyors from a benefit which, if the Bill had been properly drafted, they would have got since 1969.  Obviously they have not been slow in making their needs felt. It indicates the desirability for patience in the matter of Committee work done both in Dáil Éireann and in Seanad Éireann and the usefulness of good Committee work and the opportunities which should not be missed by Deputies and Senators in trying to improve legislation which is offered to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to think, now that we are moving into this new challenging community, that bodies such as Córas Tráchtála might, in collaboration with other bodies, consider this whole question of invisible receipts and invisible exports.  The earnings of architects, engineers and quantity surveyors are now recognised in the last Act and in this Bill as being real earnings for the community, as if goods had been exported by them instead of the services which were rendered by them.</P>
    <P>The whole range of services that might be rendered by this economy in the new context of the European Community ought to be considered with a view to seeing what we can do, either to develop new services, or to encourage the rendering of existing <Col N="1822" /> services, not necessarily limited to those that are dealt with and enacted in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will get a welcome from everybody.  None of us would like to think that our export efforts would be hindred in any way by lack of finance.  Throughout the years Córas Tráchtála have done a good job and it is right that they should have the money placed at their disposal to help us to increase our export trade.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about how this money will be spent.  We have the IDA, with offices abroad.  We have Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála, both with offices abroad and we have our Embassies. It would be a practical step to have all these offices housed in one building. They have different functions but a type of Ireland House in the countries of the EEC would be a good idea.  Our Embassies should play a greater part in selling Ireland.  It is good prestige-wise to have nice residences for our ambassadors. We have two ambassadors in Brussels at present.  We are still a poor nation and should recognise this and do our housekeeping accordingly. Our ambassadorial residences should be in the centre of cities to promote the trade and the exports of the country as well as the prestige of the country.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the appointment of personnel in Córas Tráchtála.  The day-to-day running of the board is very rightly the concern of the members of the staff, but they are, under section 20 of the 1959 Act, answerable to the Minister for their functions.  I should like to know what qualifications are needed for jobs in Córas Tráchtála.  The advertisements for some of these jobs are gloriously vague.  On asking for an explanation as to what type of qualifications are needed, one comes up against a stonewall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, Córas Tráchtála advertised for an interpreter-translator.  One would think that normal procedure as is followed by the Local Appointments Commission would be adopted and that a written test and an oral test would be held in the language which the translator-interpreter would be required to use.  This was not done.  Instead, there <Col N="1823" /> was an interview held in English and the unsuccessful candidates got a letter saying that &ldquo;having assessed your qualifications, the job has been offered to another candidate&rdquo;.  There was no semblance whatever of a test in the required language before these candidates were turned down.  When this letter was queried further, we were told &ldquo;Oh yes, there will now be a test and the successful three or four, who are short-listed, will have to undergo this test&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If one is applying for a job as an interpreter-translator, the first thing that should be done is to hold a written examination.  I, in my innocence, protested to a member of the staff of Córas Tráchtála about this procedure and I was told &ldquo;Who do you think you are to try to buck the Establishment?&rdquo; As a public representative and a heavily taxed one&mdash;and some of my taxes will help to pay this body&mdash;I will try to buck the establishment any time I can.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to bring up about CTT is that they held a seminar recently for small industries to help them get organised for export.  I should like the Minister to tell me where the people who organised that seminar in CTT got their list.  I know of at least one manufacturer who would have been very glad to avail of that seminar but was not invited.</P>
    <P>Lest it be thought that I am completely anti-Córas Tráchtála, I am not. I have got good service from members of the staff in getting an enterprise moving and I should like to pay tribute to their dedication and their work.  I feel very strongly about the procedure that is being adopted in appointing people to CTT.</P>
    <P>There are many appointments in this country where the candidates must have a good knowledge of our language. I wonder how a number of people employed in CTT were examined in their knowledge of Irish before being appointed.  One day I rang up CTT and I thought the wires had got crossed and that I was on to a British Department.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is wrong to bring in people from abroad but we should <Col N="1824" /> have a policy about our language and it should be adhered to.  The Minister should look into the procedure of appointments to CTT and remedy it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can welcome this Bill.  Senator Farrell is to be congratulated on her outspokenness on the points she has raised, which are of great concern.  We must see that appointments are filled properly and fairly.</P>
      <P>This is one symptom of the difficulties we always have with statutory boards.  It is high time that a committee of the Oireachtas was set up to deal with those.  The only time we ever hear about them is when a Bill comes to us for another £10 million or £15 million.  We simply withdraw it at that stage and we hear nothing for years afterwards.  That is not good enough.  It means that the Oireachtas is not being used to encourage any reasonable public dialogue with such companies.  We should have a number of those boards.  Córas Tráchtála should be concerned with spending.</P>
      <P>The issue is important enough to ensure that we have a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas that would meet two, three or four times a year so that we could get an up-to-date report on how things were going.  We can, of course, get some information from the annual reports that are always well turned out, but it is no substitute for a committee where questions can be asked and where, in most cases, the board concerned will be able to give a satisfactory answer.  The committee provides the ideal vehicle for getting to grips with such problems. The points raised by Senator Farrell are ideal committee points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously such committees would be manned by persons who had a direct interest.  It would be possible to divide up the work of exercising this type of supervision of statutory bodies between the various members of the Oireachtas.  We would feel we were making a contribution if we had that facility.  Otherwise we will be accused of praying or, as Senator Farrell has said, almost told to mind our own business.  As public representatives we have a duty to the taxpayer to take a <Col N="1825" /> much more positive interest in those bodies.  I have no crib against Córas Tráchtála, which is doing an excellent job.  However, there is a lack of co-ordination between our various State boards.  The fact that they are not working together as a unit is not good. The tendency when setting up boards, which we have used very much in recent years, is to set them up with a certain job to do and if they can save some money by doing it in a particular way, even though that may interfere with another State board, according to their statute they are charged with doing it in the cheapest way possible.  This type of overall co-ordination for the common good is something which is very difficult to achieve and with the multiplicity of boards, is something which has to be achieved.  They are all there essentially to serve the community as a whole and to develop the resources of the community in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can say that a single Minister in charge of all those boards is really in a position to exercise that type of control and co-ordination in the national interest.  Very often the conditions attached to the setting up of the board do not permit that.  That is the dilemma of the statutory boards.  It is the total effort of all the boards that has to be maximised, not the effort of one board.  How we do that I do not know. A first-class Oireachtas committee would be a solution.  Before such a committee there would be an opportunity for board A to say their task was made more difficult by a practice pursued by another board.  The practice pursued by board B might be sound economics, might be saving money for them, but the cost to board.  A might be such that there was a net loss.  Such a system could not possibly go on if there was a committee in charge, because they would insist that the national good demanded that the job be done in this way by board A so as to ensure that the results produced by board A and board B were the best possible for the national economy.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have heard a lot about the question of control of statutory bodies but nothing has been done about it.  Now that we are moving <Col N="1826" /> into the Common Market this is one of the areas where we should get more involvement of the Oireachtas.  The central position of Córas Tráchtála highlights this involvement.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to try and let us see something positive by way of State involvement in and control over statutory bodies.  This is by no means a criticism of Córas Tráchtála.  I am speaking on the general principle involved.  What is in the Minister's speech is rather inadequate and misleading. While we want to see the best picture, it should be an accurate and factual picture.  The figures quoted that total exports increased from £130 million in 1959 to £468 million in 1970 do not give an accurate measure of the expansion that has taken place, because we had a great devaluation between 1959 and 1970.  The 1970 £ is worth less than half the 1959£.  If we are going to deal in 1970 values, we start with £250 or £260 million.  The actual gross volume expansion that has occurred would be a much more accurate measure to use.</P>
    <P>There is another factor in weighing this.  It is stated that the increased exports of industrial goods went up from 32 per cent to 53 per cent.  That means that the imports to produce these increased exports have increased very considerably.  I would say there was a very high import content in raw materials of the finished products exported. I would like to know can the Minister give us the net figure.  In 1959, what was the net value of the exports of £130 million, that is, gross less the imports of raw materials?  Could he also give us the net value of the exports sent out in 1970 in terms of 1959 values? In other words, what was the true percentage increase achieved in the decade between 1959 and 1970?  If we start giving figures on something like this which is purporting to show an expansion, they should be the best figures that can be given and should convey the real position.  The real position was quite good in that decade. The expansion is probably of the order of 7 per cent to 8 per cent per annum in real terms.  That would be satisfactory, but I would like to have those figures.</P>
    <P>Finally I would appeal for a greater involvement of Córas Tráchtála with <Col N="1827" /> the universities in the country.  I would like to see two-way traffic there.  It should be quite commonplace for Córas Tráchtála to ask university personnel to go on some of their terms, may be for six months or a year or so, on temporary duty.  While that would bring additional expertise in some facets of marketing or exporting to Córas Tráchtála, it would also provide a very valuable opportunity for university staffs to see the other side of the picture, the world for which they are trained as graduates.  Their university training would considerably benefit from that close contact with the real problems.  Likewise, Córas Tráchtála would benefit very much by being able to get such expertise when and where they want it.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know about this Amendment Act, 1969, which went through here and for which we had high hopes, that is, in relation to exporting professional services, architects and engineers.  Could the Minister give us any idea as to how this has developed over those two years?  Is there any report on it where we could gain guidance on something that is very well worth while developing?  While the Bill was going through the House, many valuable contributions were made as to how the range of services involved might be expanded.  Did the Minister draw the attention of the board to those many contributions that were made, especially the Seanad contributions, on the way in which this service could be widened and expanded?  If he did, has he got any report from Córas Tráchtála as to whether they implemented some of these suggestions or not?</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  The increase to £15 million is, if anything, inadequate at this time of rapid expansion, but we are not tied to limits and it is really providing an additional £6 million. The Minister or some other Minister will be back to us again for an increase in this amount when we reach the limit and, from my point of view, the sooner the Minister comes back saying they have reached the limit the better.  That will be a sure indicator of industrial progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking from the point of view of practical business as experienced by one who has to engage in competition whether he likes it or not, improved percentage figures are ever satisfactory to a businessman because they could always have been better.  But the information given here by the Minister, indicating an increase in industrial goods exports from 32 per cent to 53 per cent between 1959 and 1970, is good news.  However, as I have said, from the point of view of anybody who has to engage in competitive business it does not matter what your achievement is at the end of the year, it could always have been better. This is the approach that I would like to see every single industrial unit in this country adopt.  Many of them do of course adopt it, but some do not.</P>
      <P>While the Senators opposite were speaking my mind was going back about 14 years to a seminar of the NAIDA which I attended and at which two foreign trade attachés spoke, giving fairly blunt criticisms of ourselves and their experiences here.  This would be in the period from the forties to the end of the fifties.  They criticised our efforts to break into the export markets.  The Dutch attaché said that some years earlier this country had signed a trade agreement with Holland and added: &ldquo;We were expecting on the following Monday at least one plane load of Irish travellers to arrive at The Hague. Six months later nobody had arrived.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Swiss trade attaché, when speaking of a period now 15 years ago, regarding the experience of his own country and what he had seen here, said he had spent some part of his holidays in West Cork.  The area reminded him of an area in Switzerland which he had visited as a young boy about 40 years earlier.  He said there was no difference from the point of view of population shrinkage and emigration.  In fact, there was an area outside New York which was named after this place in Switzerland, but he was back there in 1956 and there was so much industry and such a growth in population that there was no room for any further expansion.  This was his way of describing what could happen in this country if we wanted it to happen. <Col N="1829" /> If the business element, the management element and the worker element wanted to get the results, those results could be got.  From my point of view, it is encouraging to learn from the Minister that 95 per cent of major exporters are using the services of Córas Tráchtála.  I wonder how many of the smaller units here are not using the services of Córas Tráchtála.  I also wonder what standard in relation to delivering on time our industrial units are maintaining on foreign markets.  I have some information on some units here, which I will not specify, in relation to delivery times which are not satisfactory.  I wonder how far does Córas Tráchtála go in research abroad, to ensure that Irish firms have efficiently fulfilled their orders on time. This is the most important time in our history from an industrial point of view. We have a breathing space until the the year after next.  I would question the Minister as to how many Irish manufacturing representatives are already in the present member countries and prospective member countries of the European Economic Community before these markets open up to us, as I understand European representatives are in Britain and here.</P>
    <P>I do not think &mdash; and here I am not being specific because I have not got the information &mdash; that it will be at all good enough for Irish industry to wait until we become members of the European Economic Community and until the tariff barrier has been dropped to go in and start looking for business. It has got to be done now, or, as the Americans would say, &ldquo;yesterday&rdquo;.  I should like to say personally to Senator Alexis FitzGerald that I certainly welcome many of his contributions on drafting.  Another point which I should like to stress to the Minister in regard to the relationship between Córas Tráchtála and industrial exporters is the importance of having representatives who have a knowledge of at least two European languages.  My experience of business people in Europe is that they are far too down to earth and practical to be taken in by either our good looks or our blue eyes.  To them an Irishman who can only speak English is not as likely to get as far at all as an Irishman <Col N="1830" /> who can speak German or French fluently.</P>
    <P>I believe that we need to make here a total all-out effort, an effort of community consciousness in relation to exports.  We should have in all industries a &ldquo;sell Irish&rdquo; ambition as a first aim to ensure the continuance of employment here, the survival of employment here and the expansion of our economy.  I think these are the most essential things to us in the coming 12 months and I would urge the Minister to put this across as strongly as he can at every business meeting at which he speaks and through Córas Tráchtála.  I welcome the increase proposed in this Bill which is very necessary.  I hope it is adequate, and I fully support the Minister in introducing the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a few questions.  I see here that Córas Tráchtála have provided specialist consultancy services in design. I want to know if these are provided to small industries, because I believe that it is only on quality industries that we can survive in the future.  I see that they have opened new offices in Britain, North America, Australia and Germany. Senator Brugha has spoken about the Continent; I should like to know about Australia.  I think it would be much better if an Irish-Australian were appointed on missions such as Australia, because when I was there there was a big Irish house opening.  I happened to be there at a world conference and I did not even know that this opening was taking place.  I also see that Córas Tráchtála have pioneered in the field of industrial design and development. None of us would have even opened our eyes, only for the Swedish report. I want to congratulate the Kilkenny Design Workshop on what has been done as a result of that report.  We commissioned the Swedes to investigate our designs in this country, but our designs up to then had been atrocious. Now that we have got the help and the advice of the Swedish design people and our own Kilkenny Design, I hope we shall go on and develop our own design based on our own traditions and our own dúchas.</P>

      <P>With a Bill of this nature, <Col N="1831" /> one normally expects that it will be welcomed.  I think in general that there was a wholehearted welcome for this provision of the additional £6 million for Córas Tráchtála.  On the whole, the House subscribed to the view that Córas Tráchtála was doing an extremely efficient job of work, despite the fact that Senator Quinlan was not as impressed as he should have been at the growth in the value of exports from 1959 to 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I wanted to get an exact measure of it.  I did not say I was not impressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald has indicated that it was quite an impressive leap from £130 million in 1959 to £468 million and Senator Quinlan drew attention to the fact that the buying capacity of £468 million in 1971 would not be the equivalent of the buying capacity of £468 million in 1959.  I think that is a fair interpretation of what the Senator said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, as regards the suggestion that the Minister had made no effort to quantify it, there was no question of my being responsible for misleading the House in relation to the volume of exports.  This is the impression that the Senator gave to me, that I was not factual enough and that the jump in exports here was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between &ldquo;factual&rdquo; and &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;. I did not say &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;.  I was looking for more facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the record will show whether I was right or wrong. The fact that increased exports of industrial goods rose from 32 per cent of the total volume exported to 53 per cent of the total is an indication of the progress that has been made by four industrial exporting firms, with the assistance of Córas Tráchtála.  It would not be a practical operation to endeavour to convert those two figures into straightforward net values.  This is the reason why the figures for industrial goods exports were projected in the form of a percentage of total exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> I think that Senator Alexis FitzGerald and other Senators who complimented Córas Tráchtála on their achievements, and on their personnel and their dedication to the work on hands were justified in their commendation.  Since I was appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce, I feel that Córas Tráchtála have been doing an extremely good job of work.  This view is, I think, shared by all Members of the House, despite the fact that there may be criticisms, as were mentioned this evening, about what I would term minor aspects of the company.  Let me deal with the criticism outlined by Senator Farrell, in this regard.  I wish to direct these comments both to Senator Mrs. Farrell and Senator Quinlan.  It is not the most admirable thing to suggest to the responsible Minister in control of any of our semi-State bodies that he should interfere unduly in their day-to-day operations.  A Minister who has within his jurisdiction a semi-State body is too often criticised in the wrong for interfering with the day-to-day work. The most common criticism is in the allocation of positions within the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>You would remove all that if you had an Oireachtas Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point.  I was coming around to the suggestion made by Senator Quinlan that the surveillance of a semi-State body be handed over to an Oireachtas Committee.  You would then have the situation that before any of the personnel within the semi-State body could do anything he would have to check whether the Oireachtas subcommittee were happy about the way he was approaching the particular job. I do not agree with having a subcommittee of the Oireachtas established to supervise the day-to-day running of a company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters that has been mentioned, which is engaging the attention of the Minister for Finance at the present time, is the question of a <Col N="1833" /> Committee of the House to look into the overall accounts of semi-State bodies.  This would not mean that a subcommittee of the House would dictate to the personnel or board of any semi-State body as to their form of selection of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the context in which the argument was made this evening.  In supporting Senator Farrell in the point she was making Senator Quinlan went on to suggest that this matter could be dealt with if it were accepted that a Select Committee of the House would be appointed to supervise a semi-State body.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Senator's word.  From the experience I have of CTT I feel that it is functioning well and doing an extremely good job.  The excellence of the personnel operating at home and abroad on behalf of CTT is an indication that the board and its senior executives have been doing an extremely good job down through the years.  I am conscious of the problem referred to by Senator Farrell.  She drew my attention to section 20 of the 1959 Act, which says the board shall submit to the Minister such information regarding the performance of its functions as he may from time to time require.  She suggested that under that section the Minister should investigate the mis-appointment of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She outlined to the House a particular complaint she had.  I wish to say emphatically that I do not condone the action of any senior operative within CTT in replying to a Member of this House in the manner in which Senator Farrell claims her protest was dealt with.  On the other hand, I would not <Col N="1834" /> ask CTT, under section 20 of the Act, to give me an account of their stewardship with regard to the appointment, in whatever manner they feel is appropriate, of, say, an interpreter they might wish to use in their organisation.  My understanding of the situation was that there were two distinct types of interview and that a certain number of applicants were called in a second time, whereas the people who were interviewed &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be quite frank about it.  A person may have extremely good qualifications, such as very fluent German or French, but may not have the particular type of personality that the organisation require.  If, in relation to following through on the long-term with a view to bringing across some experts from perhaps Germany to interview a select few, I see nothing wrong with the CTT operating a system whereby they interview 40 or 50 applications in English under IQ headings, personality and so on in order to narrow it down to five or six and to subject them to a final examination.  From my experience, especially of CTT personnel operating in their offices in Europe, the US and the UK, I have nothing but the height of admiration for the quality of the personnel operating in those offices.  From my point of view it is a very satisfactory indication of efficient selectivity.  I would not feel obliged, therefore, to ask the board of CTT to change their system of recruitment on the grounds that the end product they are getting is not up to required standards. This has not been my experience.</P>
      <P>Some people contributing to this debate made reference to the fact that in this Bill I am seeking to raise the level of money that can be advanced to CTT by only £6 million, from £9 million to £15 million.  It was mentioned that the figure was inadequate, certainly in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan drew attention to the fact that we only get opportunities of dealing with semi-State organisations when the responsible Minister comes before the Seanad to seek sanction for the advancing of further money for them.  I am seeking an increase from £9 <Col N="1835" /> million to £15 million on this occasion although I am not anticipating that this amount of money will be sufficient to enable Córas Tráchtála to undertake the work they have on hands for a period longer than approximately two years. The object of confining the increase to that amount is to enable both Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss the progress of this organisation in two or three years time.  This has been an established pattern in relation to this type of amending legislation.  From my point of view it would be just as easy to come to this House and seek, and I am sure obtain, sanction to raise the ceiling from £9 million to £25 million; but in that event the House would not have the opportunity it now has of discussing the progress, or lack of progress as the case may be, of Córas Tráchtála over the next five or six years.  This is the reason why we are aiming at a ceiling of an extra £6 million under this Bill.</P>
    <P>A Senator mentioned that he hoped the Minister would draw the attention of CTT to the contributions made in the Dáil and Seanad in relation to their work.  It is not normally necessary for the Minister to do so because all semi-State bodies &mdash; and that would include CTT &mdash; are very watchful of what is being said regarding their progress or lack of progress in either of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As far as CTT is concerned, the contributions and criticisms of Members of both Houses are carefully noted with a view to obviating the necessity of having criticisms of that nature in the future.  If it becomes necessary for me to draw their attention to Senators' contributions and criticisms I will certainly do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell queried the manner in which seminars are organised.  I would be anxious to have further information from the Senator in regard to the specific seminar she has in mind &mdash; she said that a number of small producers were not aware of the seminar &mdash; with a view to taking the matter up with CTT.  I understand that they are always anxious to try and attract the greatest number of people possible to attend seminars where they feel that such a seminar can be of benefit, especially to small industries, in developing their <Col N="1836" /> export potential.  If there is disappointment at all, that disappointment is usually on CTT's side because of an insufficiency of favourable reaction or favourable attendance following their organisation of a seminar.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the Dáil to the necessity for CTT to organise language courses.  In fact, Senator Brugha spoke about the necessity for the personnel of CTT to have a sufficient knowledge of continental languages to be able to deal with problems on the Continent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Industries on the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was industries. CTT have established courses, especially in German, and the response from industry has not been satisfactory at all. Admittedly, those courses were established sometime ago and I would hope that now, with our imminent entry into the EEC, potential exporting industry will be more aware of the need for equipping themselves for this development. This is a matter that is engaging the attention of CTT at present.</P>
      <P>Both Senator Farrell and Senator Quinlan spoke about the lack of co-ordination between the various bodies such as CTT, IDA, Bord Fáilte and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is very easy to say that there is a lack of co-ordination.  There was also a reference to the fact that our embassies should be put to greater use.  Senator Farrell talked about the Ireland House idea.  If you take a case such as Germany, where we have an embassy in Bonn but the CTT office is in Duesseldorf, you can see the unsuitability of an embassy premises from the point of view of endeavouring to promote trade. It is often necessary to have embassies in a particular locality in a city, which might be a non-trading sector of the city, but such a locality would be the wrong place to have an export promotion centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why put the embassy there?  Why not put it in the centre of a city where it would be a real advantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  If <Col N="1837" /> we are observant we will note that no foreign country has an embassy in Henry Street or Grafton Street.  For instance, Washington is the capital city of the United States and it would not work out if we were to establish an embassy in Fifth Avenue, New York, to aid our industries.  On the other hand, we have Ireland House in the business centre of New York where you have a number of organisations under the one roof.  This is not feasible in a number of other areas.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there is at present very close liaison between the personnel in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the personnel in CTT and the IDA. The latter two bodies, which are within the ambit of my Department, work in very close harmony.  If they were all collectively under the one umbrella, I do not think that there could be any greater co-ordination. My experience of Irishmen operating abroad on behalf of CTT, the IDA, An Bórd Fáilte, or on behalf of the State, has been that they all look upon themselves as ambassadors of our country.  It is quite possible for somebody travelling to cities abroad where they operate to experience disappointment under some minor headings. Overall, the operatives from all those semi-State organisations are not, first, nine to five people and, secondly, are not people who just reserve themselves to their specific organisation and are not willing to lend a hand to the sister national organisation in the same city. I do not think that we experience this lack of co-ordination that is so freely mentioned.  I am not in a position to deal specifically with the question of offering temporary employment to university students by CTT as a means of helping CTT on the one hand, and as a means of broadening the mind of the student on the other.  However, it is a particular factor that I shall mention to CTT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked what progress had been made in relation to the special measure that was taken two years ago regarding engineers and architects.  It has taken quite a time to make progress under this heading. Shortly after the enactment of the Export Promotion Act, 1969, Córas <Col N="1838" /> Tráchtála organised a symposium in conjunction with the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland on the export of engineering services.  CTT have now reported that a consortium of 16 major consulting engineering firms has recently been formed to market engineering services abroad.  In addition, it is expected that this consortium will appoint a chief executive early in the New Year.  In the meantime a number of contracts have been obtained by individual firms.  It is only now that the provisions of the 1969 Act are coming to fruition in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha asked how many of our exporters are already established in EEC member countries.  There is no possibility of quantifying this number at the present stage.  CTT have been exhorting our exporters to see the potential for development in that field. They are encouraging them to get on the job and will provide all of the expertise and experience that they have collected over a period in order to assist them.  Arrangements have been made for the opening of an office in Brussels and long-term arrangements have been made for opening an office in Milan, in order to provide the maximum assistance to the exporter who is anxious to develop the European market.</P>
    <P>Senator Uí Eachthéirn asked about the specialist services for industrial design. CTT are, by advice, by assistance in design consultancy within their own organisation, and by way of the provision of grants for the two industrialists for the engaging of consultants, in a position to help existing industry.  If the Senator knows of any small industrialist who can be assisted in this way, Córas Tráchtála are only too anxious to help and have services made available to them.  Under the craft design heading the Kilkenny Design Workshop is doing excellent work and has been of assistance to a big number of industrialists.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to Senator Brugha's final word on selling Irish.  On this Second Reading we have been talking about the activities of Córas Tráchtála, the Irish Export Board, in endeavouring to sell Irish produce on the foreign markets.  The Senator suggested to me that I should use every <Col N="1839" /> opportunity I could to get across the message about selling and buying Irish. I have used every possible opportunity and every public occasion to spell out to the Irish people the necessity for making the fullest use of quality Irish goods for export.</P>
    <P>It may be late in the day to start falling in with the Irish Housewives Association in their movements during the past few weeks but it is a rather appropriate week for me to compliment them on their approach to the Buy Quality Irish campaign.  I should like to use it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <P>They share with me an overall anxiety and desire to keep down prices.  I want to compliment them on their specific effort to induce all of their fellow-housewives to buy quality Irish. I exhort them not to let the effort die at the end of this week, but to try to turn it into a Quality Irish campaign the whole year round.  Nobody can influence the distributor as much as the housewife who insists, when she goes into a store, on being supplied with Irish articles.  I am afraid that we have not been sufficiently <Col N="1840" /> insistent in this regard.  I exhort the nation, through this debate, to be more conscious of the necessity of giving every possible support to Irish industry by insisting on Irish quality produce, of which we exported £468 million worth last year.</P>
