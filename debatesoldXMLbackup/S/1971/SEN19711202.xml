      <P>The House will not be sitting on Wednesday of next week. Government business will be taken on Thursday and, consequently, it does not appear possible to take a motion next week, but the leader of the House will be here later on and perhaps the Senator could raise it again, if necessary.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Report of the Council of Trustees of the National Library of Ireland for the year 1969-70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the rules of order allow me to move only one motion, we on this side proposed, out of consideration for the Minister or, as I now see, his Parliamentary Secretary, that these motions should be taken together.  We are willing that that should be done purely to save time.  The situations of the two institutions envisaged by these motions have only this much in common: that both of these institutions are in a disastrous condition.  In all other respects there are differences between their situations and they require separate discussion and separate consideration. Of the two I would say that the National Library's position, although bad enough by international standards, is the less desperate.  The National Library is not exposed to the same kind of risk which the museum is exposed to, namely, having the contents of its building decay and rot under its very eyes.  At least if that danger exists, it does not exist to quite the same degree.  That is the only reason the National Library's position is slightly desperate than that of the National Museum.  It seems to me a hard and sad thing that, in the island of saints and scholars, in respect of the national collections of books and of antiquities represented in the National Library and the National Museum, we should be solemnly discussing here <Col N="1651" /> measures of an everyday kind which in other countries would require no comment and excite no interest, but are designed merely to keep these things from deteriorating.  That unfortunately is the position we are faced with in both these institutions, but, as I say, more particularly in the National Museum than in the National Library.</P>
    <P>Having said that by way of introduction I will deal with these institutions separately, but I want to make this much clear: I have no special inside knowledge of these institutions.  In the nature of things I cannot have, nor can anybody on this side of the House. Whereas the Government, naturally and rightly, has at its disposal the advice and goodwill of the entire permanent Civil Service, Opposition Senators discussing a matter of national importance like this are naturally at the disadvantage that they may be in the position of having got some of its facts wrong and being open to contradiction because they cannot, in the nature of things, penetrate into the recesses of the Department of Education or into the recesses of the National Library and National Museum and extract the sort of information which is forthcoming frankly and immediately to a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The first thing I want to say about the National Library&mdash;and, indeed, the same goes for the National Museum&mdash; is that the conduct of affairs in regard to it has been characterised on the part of the Department of Education, so far as I can see, by an altogether inappropriate degree of reserve, fear and secrecy.  I notice that in the Report of the Council of Trustees under discussion&mdash;indeed the same complaint is repeated in the report of the following year&mdash;Dr. K.W. Humphreys was commissioned to present a review on what he thought were the proper space requirements of the National Library.</P>
    <P>The Humphreys Report on space requirements in the National Library has been with the Minister since April of this year.  It has been with the Minister for nearly eight months, and it has only now begun to reach the Trustees.  My information about this is <Col N="1652" /> at second or perhaps third hand, and I am willing that the Minister should contradict me, but my understanding is that, although the Trustees are the people one would have thought would be primarily concerned with the proper running of the National Library, this report on a matter vital to them has been withheld from them by the Department and by the Minister for the last eight months.  That seems to me to be an eloquent comment on the way in which the Department of Education regard its duty in connection with the National Library and, indeed, with everything else under their control.  I think it is scandalous that people in the position of Trustees, people who by definition have no vested interest, have no axe to grind, have no profit to make, have nothing to fear or nothing to gain by doing their duty, should be treated as though it was dangerous to disclose to them what the gentleman commissioned to report on space requirements has recommended until the Department have thoroughly digested it.  That is no tribute to the Trustees, although no doubt the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary will fall over himself in paying the usual facile compliments to the trustees on the good work they have done.  If they are that good, they deserve to be shown a report about the space requirements of the institution which is nominally under their charge.</P>
    <P>The space problem in the National Library is one obvious to anybody who walks in the door there.  If I were conducting a party of my academic colleagues around Dublin&mdash;and it is a thing which I occasionally have to do&mdash; one place not to bring them would be the National Library, because if I brought them in the front door of the National Library they would suspect they were being brought in by the tradesman's extrance.  It is stacked almost to the ceiling with maps, boxes, shelving which ought to be elsewhere, and the general impression created there is one of clutter, neglect and decay.  I know that this sort of thing cannot be solved overnight and I know that the suggestion has been made&mdash;I do not know whether it is incorporated in the Humphreys Report or not&mdash;that the National Library's problems might <Col N="1653" /> be alleviated, or perhaps even entirely solved so far as space is concerned, if they were to take over the premises of the College of Art next door.  That, of course, will become a possibility if and when the College of Art, as the Minister for Education envisaged when he was here a couple of weeks ago, is transferred to a new building in Morehampton Road.</P>
    <P>Let me observe that even here we have not been free of administrative indecision and muddle, because when the Morehampton Road site was first acquired for the State it was envisaged that the National Library would be placed there.  There has now been a change in official thinking&mdash;if &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; is not too dignified a word to use in regard to the intellectual operation which produced this muddle&mdash;and we are now going to have a College of Art in Morehampton Road, for which, as I have said before, no competition or advertisement has been held, and the likelihood is&mdash;although I cannot tell what is in the Humphreys Report&mdash; that the additional space required for the National Library will be made available in the premises or on the site now occupied by the College of Art, which, although the entrance to it is small, is actually a fairly big site.  I understand that the total area which the accession of the College of Art premises would make to the existing National Library would be twice the volume of the existing National Library, and I understand&mdash;though again necessarily at second or third hand&mdash;that the space problem of the National Library would probably be solved, at any rate for the immediate future and perhaps even for the foreseeable future, if that space could be made available to it.</P>
    <P>The problem is a very urgent one, and if it is to depend on the construction of the new College of Art in Morehampton Road, then the sooner we get ahead and do that the better, because the conditions of overcrowding in the National Library are indescribable.  I have been in there on occasion and I can see it for myself.  I can see, for example, in the offices that people of professional grade in order to get to a filing cabinet of drawers have to ask a typist to stand up and get out of the way.  That is the <Col N="1654" /> degree of overcrowding which there is in there.  Somebody who works in there and whose name, naturally, I am not going to reveal&mdash;I did not interrogate this man; we were talking about something quite different&mdash;spontaneously described his own working conditions as those of a &ldquo;research slum&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said might be sufficient to indicate the great urgency of the space problem in the National Library.  Let me add a few details to it. The space problem in the National Library is so severe that large parts of the National Library's collection have had to be moved and sent elsewhere.  In particular, large series of newspaper holdings have had to be taken out of the National Library and sent to makeshift quarters under the Four Courts, if you please, so that if somebody wants to consult one of these papers&mdash;and as anybody who goes to the National Library will know there are always people in there consulting newspapers&mdash; there seems to be a sort of permanent population in this country and city who hunt through old newspapers in search of knowledge, antiquarian or otherwise, and that is what the National Library is there for&mdash;in order to facilitate people of that kind in search of the kind of newspapers that have been removed to the Four Courts, a special van has to be sent to the Four Courts to collect it and bring it back.  That, of course, is an altogether inordinately expensive and difficult operation for the purpose of facilitating a single reader, and the result, not unnaturally, is that the staff, in their own polite way, try to discourage people from making that sort of demand on them.  Not only is it an absurdity that the National Library's collection should be fragmented in that way by the transference of newspapers which, as everybody knows, are frequently consulted, to the basement of the Four Courts, but I understand that the site in which they are lodged in the basement of the Four Courts is subject to periodic flooding.  It may not happen very often that the Liffey floods to such a degree as to endanger this particular site, but I am told that it is not unknown for the cellars or basement in which these newspapers are housed to be flooded.  I ask the House to consider <Col N="1655" /> what would they think of a situation in which irreplaceable holdings of our National Library are housed in a basement which can be inundated by the Liffey at a moment's notice?</P>
    <P>The fragmentation of resources in the National Library are something which no library should have to experience and the result of it, of course, is&mdash;and again I am relying on a second or third-hand opinion, because I have no other way of producing information &mdash; that this falling-off of resources, that this effective diminution in services in the National Library, has been the direct cause of a falling-off in readership there.  I notice from the report of the Council of Trustees that the average daily readership in the year 1966/67 was 170.  The average daily readership in 1970/71, after a continuous decrease in the intervening two years, was 145.  That is a falling-off of 15 per cent.  When I saw these figures first, it occurred to me that perhaps the falling-off was due to the provision of new library facilities in Trinity College and the removal of a large part of University College to Belfield.  Of course it is true that the National Library, particularly in the long vacation, was heavily used by university students.  I am still inclined to think that this falling-off may be in part due to the extra library facilities elsewhere. I am assured, admittedly at second hand, by people who are closer to the National Library's operations than I am, that this falling off is not accountable for by the extra library facilities elsewhere, but that it is directly attributable to the cutting-back in the library services.  As one of the people to whom I spoke about this said: &ldquo;What else can you expect?  Can you expect people to come to a library in which the services are becoming progressively worse?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bad services are one thing; they are something from which the public suffer, but a library, like any academic institution, depends on highly qualified staff, staff who are able not only to do mechanical jobs such as filing, but have got some facility in research and investigation into the nature of material and so forth.  The National Library has some staff of this kind, but again, I <Col N="1656" /> understand some of those staff members are threatening to leave their jobs through frustration.  This is a carbon copy of the situation I described here 18 months ago, when we last discussed the National Museum.  I stated then that there were people in the National Museum who had left or were about to leave their jobs there because they simply could not stick it any longer.</P>
    <P>Admittedly people who do academic types of jobs are privileged people in the eyes of the community.  I have admitted here before that I consider they are privileged people, and I have never tried to pretend that people with an academic kind of job are other than people who have got it lucky from society at large.  I know that such people are favoured by society and to that extent owe society a corresponding duty.  However, to do a research job properly you need conditions of peace. You cannot carry out research properly if you have to get up frequently in order to allow somebody else to reach a filing cabinet.  Such a job cannot be done properly in conditions of clutter, muddle and noise.  It cannot be done if typewriters are banging away in your immediate vicinity.  You need peaceful conditions if you are to do such a job effectively, and those conditions just do not exist in the National Library at present.  I understand that is the main reason why there is constant apprehension that trained, valuable and, perhaps, irreplaceable staff will move elsewhere, to places such as universities in which conditions in some respects have been improving, or leave the country altogether.</P>
    <P>It is largely because of space difficulties that such a situation has arisen, but it is also because of the lack of the facilities which are normal in libraries, facilities of a technical kind which I am not qualified to understand or explain and which are vital to the proper functioning of a library.  I understand that the facilities in our National Library are in many respects defective. There is not as much as a satisfactory method of binding manuscript letters there.  If the National Library wish to have manuscript letters bound as they should be bound, with a special process of inter-leafing, they have to send them <Col N="1657" /> either to the Public Records Office or perhaps to Belfast.  It is not long since a collection of letters of a highly important national kind had to go to Belfast for binding because there were no facilities in the National Library for doing such binding.</P>
    <P>I realise that the greater part of this problem in the National Library is connected with money.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that we cannot do everything we would like to do, that we cannot have everything we would like to have and that we have to cut our cloth according to our measure, but I am complaining about the fact that, in the scale of priorities which this Government erects, the people that have the hind tit are the cultural institutions.  That is completely wrong in a country such as this which has such grandiose pretensions to aspirations of a non-material kind, to a cultural background and heritage second to none, which contains Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries who, every day of the week, are telling schoolchildren about how they should take a pride in their past and a pride in their surroundings.  I believe those sentiments are honestly expressed, but the Government should put its money where its mouth is and not leave the National Library in a position where it is a reproach to us.  As I said at the beginning, the National Library is a place to which I would be ashamed to take a foreign colleague because of the conclusion he would draw about this nation if he were to have a look at the National Library's condition.</P>
    <P>The curious thing&mdash;and a contradictory thing in a way until one understands the kernel of the problem&mdash;about the National Library is that because of the shortage of money, which is the root of their problems, they are not able to acquire enough material.  Its acquisitions are almost nil.  For example, the Library gets an annual grant, but that grant runs parallel with the ordinary financial year, and my information is that the National Library at present has not one penny to its account and will not have another penny to its account until 1st April next.  If Trinity College were to decide to sell the Book of Kells tomorrow, the National Library could <Col N="1658" /> not even bid for it because they have not got the money to buy anything.  My information is that their annual grant has already been spent, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I am sure he is too much of a politician to say something which would involve him in getting a black eye with public officials &mdash;will not tell us that such a position has arisen because of prodigal spending in the first part of the year.  The spending carried out by the National Library is of the most frugal type.  The people who work in the National Library freely admit that the reason why they are able to acquire material of Irish interest at all is because of the generosity and patriotism of private people.</P>
    <P>The National Library are able to make acquisitions of capital national importance, not at the price which the owners of that material could have commanded on the open market, but at a ruinous price for the owners, whose sense of patriotism and public duty has induced them to offer material to the National Library at a fraction of the price such material would have commanded on the international market.  It is shameful that the National Library should be dependent on the patriotism and self-sacrifice of private citizens, who perhaps may need the money, to make such acquisitions.  It is shameful that they are not in a position to offer the price which those people could get if they were to go abroad to sell.  But the truth is&mdash;and this is where the paradox comes in&mdash;that even if the National Library were to be given a larger current grant for acquisitions, they would not make many more acquisitions because they have no room to house them.  In other words, as it was graphically put to me by someone who is more closely connected with it than I am, a larger grant for acquisition purposes would be an embarrassment to them, because, except for a volume of unique interest and of very small dimensions which would cause no particular housing problems, it has no place to contain important collections. It just has not got the room for them. I understand, again through a graphic description given to me, that as soon as they rehouse some part of their collection by shunting it down to the basement <Col N="1659" /> of the Four Courts, the space left vacant by that removal is filled up in the twinkling of an eye by something else.</P>
    <P>The open-shelf space for reference works in the reading room of the National Library&mdash;which all of us I am sure have had occasion to use in the past&mdash;has been grievously curtailed because of an accession of a very large series of parliamentary papers from the Irish University Press which take up a colossal yardage of shelf room.  The result is that papers that previously were there in their entirety, such as the Dáil reports to which I referred frequently before I got access to the Dáil reports elsewhere, have been curtailed in the last four to six years.  The Dáil reports from 1922 onwards used be in the open shelves but the first 35 years of the Dáil reports have now been taken out of the open shelves and sent elsewhere in order to make room for other books. Although the National Library can reasonably complain that they do not get enough money for acquisitions, if something were to come on to the market tomorrow&mdash;I mean on the market and not simply the subject of a free gift&mdash;the National Library would not be able to house it even if they were in a financial position to acquire it.</P>
    <P>I see this position of acquisitions as being comparable to a sick man being deliberately kept in a condition of disease so that he will be economical on food; he is deliberately being kept in a weak condition so that he will not eat much.  I am afraid that that simile may be an injustice to people in the National Library and the Department who do their best for the Library but it is a shame on the Government in particular.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when the concerns of the Department of Education in this area were being discussed, I remember a Senator on the far side of the House&mdash;after we on this side had shown how disgraceful the conditions in the National Museum were&mdash;saying that the blame for that must be spread broadly on the shoulders of the people. The blame for anything must be borne by the Government in office during the relevant period.  When we are in Government we will get the kicks and <Col N="1660" /> accept them with good heart and not complain about how we are being blamed for something which should be taken by the people.</P>
    <P>This Government has a poor cultural record.  I want to say in extenuation of that remark that I make a generous allowance for the fine restoration of the National Gallery.  No one could say that it is anything but a fine job.  I do not want to lessen the force of that tribute when I say that there is a point of view being expressed&mdash;I do not necessarily subscribe to it myself&mdash;that it is remarkable that of the three cultural institutions, geographically so close together, the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library, the one singled out for spectacular and absolutely magnificent improvement should be the National Gallery in which the proportion of specifically Irish interest is minuscule, compared with the proportion of material of Irish interest in the other institutions.  I have heard the suspicion voiced&mdash;I do not adopt it as my own as it may be unworthy&mdash;that it is a case of sodar in ndiaidh na n-uasal, that it is a case of putting up a shop front so as to provide us with a National Gallery, such as exists in other cities and other countries, in which foreigners can see paintings by the Flemish, Spanish, Florentine, eighteenth century English Schools, and so on and that, while they are there, they might throw an eye into the Irish Portrait Gallery. In that way they can see that the &ldquo;Paddies&rdquo; know about Titian and about Goya.</P>
    <P>I have heard that suspicion voiced. The real &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; material&mdash;and I use the word with affection and not in derision&mdash;which is in the National Library and in the National Museum is not allowed to be seen.  It is relegated to boxes in damp basements; it is in a situation of decay, rot and neglect.  I have heard that suspicion voiced and, while I do not adopt it as my own because it may be unworthy and may be perhaps too vicious to be true, it requires a reply.  We require to be told why it was that the National Gallery should have got this absolutely magnificent&mdash;I say so unreservedly&mdash;restoration, while the other two neighbouring <Col N="1661" /> institutions, which are of greater pertinent significance to the Irish people, whatever about Europe or the world at large, are left in this condition of neglect.</P>
    <P>I shall now refer to the National Museum.  The last debate which we had on the National Museum took place on 11th June, 1970, which is all but a week short of 18 months ago On that occasion we, on this side of the House, were in the fortunate position of being able to make use of material which had been compiled by the professional branch of the Civil Service Association, in which they examined and criticised conditions in the National Museum. That was a unique opportunity for us on this side of the House We were presented with something which was as good a brief as a Minister could have received.  And signs on it; because the Minister was not able to contradict a single word of this report, it being at least as good as the information available to himself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner, who was only then newly appointed as Minister, had at that time made a good impression with the staff of the National Museum, by at least visiting the museum and by seeing and speaking to them.  They were grateful for that show of interest on his part.  However, I am sorry to say that there has been no material of this quasiofficial kind made available since then. There has not been another report by the professional branch of the Civil Service Association, and I have had to fall back on hearsay, on my own private inquiries, which are not perhaps very efficient, for information of what has been going on there since.  Conditions during the last 18 months have not materially changed, in spite of the very definite assurances and promises given by the Minister at that time.</P>
    <P>I should like to go through the various points which were prominent in the debate of 11th June, 1970.  The first one was the question of staffing.  I understand that since 11th June, 1970, four vacancies have been filled in professional grades.  These were established posts which were vacant at that time.  They do not represent an increase in the museum establishment. The National Museum establishment, <Col N="1662" /> even with these four vacancies filled, falls far short still of the minimum establishment recommended for the National Museum by a commission which sat in 1927.  Norwithstanding the enormous increase of material which the National Museum has acquired&mdash; most of it lying around in packing-cases because they have nowhere else to put it&mdash;it takes no account of the enormously expanded dimensions of ordinary education fo both adult and juvenile; it takes no account of the expanded importance which the sort of material housed in museums can have in the field of industrial design.  It took no account, in 1927, of the huge inflation of importance which a museum would have in the following generations. Norwithstanding that, the establishment of the National Museum at professional level is below what was recommended in 1927, 44 years ago. Last year the Minister promised that new appointments of technical grade were in the pipeline.  My understanding is that no such appointments have yet been made, and that they are still only at the advertisement stage.  I understand that six technical assistants will soon be appointed, and even that modest number will be regarded by the National Museum people as an absolute Godsend.</P>
    <P>I am complaining about the fantastic, unbelievable delay in getting anything done, when it comes to dealing with the National Muesum or, indeed, with the Department behind it.  Why should we have had to wait 18 months, since the Minister's positive assurance here in June, 1970, that these posts were being created and filled?  Why should we have had to wait 18 months and find that the people who are candidates for these posts are out now making themselves known and coming for interview?  What is the explanation of it?</P>
    <P>I want to put that in some perspective. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not accuse me of doing what the Minister accused me of doing last time he was here, namely, of denigrating the Civil Service; I am not denigrating anybody. However, I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Civil Service personnel has increased roughly by 25 per cent since 1960.  In <Col N="1663" /> the last 11 years, for every four civil servants there were in 1960, there are now five.  The gross cost of the Civil Service has virtually doubled; in fact, I think it has more than doubled during the last 11 years.</P>
    <P>This is natural and right because of the salary increases which the fantastic rise in the cost of living has justified. What I am complaining about is the kind of priority which this figure discloses. The State are well able to employ between 8,000 and 10,000 extra civil servants, but they are not able to recruit another six technical assistants for the National Museum.  Where is the sense of that?  Where is the reason in it, in this island of saints and scholars?  My blood boils when I look at a figure like that, and when I read the newspapers about Ministers, ex-Ministers, or aspiring Ministers lecturing the people about the &ldquo;quality of Irish life,&rdquo; when they cannot appoint six technical assistants to do absolutely rock-bottom work in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>The quality of Irish life is crated and cobwebbed in damp basements: That is the quality of Irish life and that is where it lies.  It does not lie in the affluence reflected in sprouting neo-Georgian suburbs on the outskirts of Dublin.  That is what I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister who stands behind him, and all their colleagues, ex-colleagues or future colleagues, whether in Government or Opposition.  They are neglecting the real quality of Irish life.  Everything that is really important to the Irish people, or which should be important to them, is pushed to one side and rendered unimportant: there are not enough votes in it.  Everything which is secondary, which is cheap and marginal and uncharacteristic of Ireland which can be found duplicated in Leeds and Scunthorpe in Oberhausen and in Milan is &ldquo;the quality of Irish life.&rdquo; That is the kind of message we have been getting from Fianna Fáil and that is what I must complain about bitterly. In the context of this debate it is more than relevant.</P>
    <P>A second problem faced by the National Museum which I mentioned last year is the problem of space.  Of <Col N="1664" /> course, there has been no improvement in that respect either.  On that occasion I told the House that the information provided by the professional arm of the Civil Service Association was to the effect that the collections of the National Museum were scattered, not only in every part of Dublin but all over the country.  Senators may have forgotten some of the more laugh-provoking items here, namely that the National Museum's collection of coaches is housed in the military barracks in Kilkenny.  On my last information it was decaying rapidly.  I particularly asked the Minister last year if he would see that this decay proceeded no further and his reply was &ldquo;The Senator can rest assured that that aspect is also being looked at.&rdquo;  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House, 18 months later, what has been done to arrest the deterioration of the National Museum's collection of vehicles and carriages.  I want him to tell us specifically what has been done since the 11th June last year to arrest the decay, of which I then had evidence, but of which I have no further evidence.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I told the House that the herbarium in the National Museum, which has now been rehoused in the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, was housed in a place, the roof of which was leaking in 50 places, and which had to be covered by polythene sheeting at night.  That was the way this island of saints and scholars treated their collection built up over 150 years, and representing the life work of several scholars. The Minister has stated that the roof has sinced been repaired.  But I should like to tell the Parliamentary Secretary about another leaking roof in the museum.  This is the main hall of the museum, where there was a nice tintawn carpeting laid for the Rosc exhibition. The Parliamentary Secretary can see this for himself; and if he goes there during a shower, he will be rained on.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a plan to give the museum new premises in the &ldquo;Quality of Irish Life&rdquo; office block to be erected at the corner of Molesworth Street and the space requirements of the museum will be alleviated by this. I am not a museum expert, and I will not pronounce a positive judgement on <Col N="1665" /> whether the Setanta building will be the appropriate place to house the overflow from the Kildare Street building. I do not think it will be satisfactory. It will be a fragmentation, it will pose academic and administrative problems for the museum staff and it will not surprise me if professional and academic advice will be heavily opposed to that solution.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us whether it is proposed definitely to go ahead with this solution, without having first got some expert advice, apart from such advice as is available inside the walls of his own Department.  This solution may be called temporary but when once adopted will be with us for 50 years and I should like to know if that solution will have the approval of an expert outside consultant, not somebody under the Minister's thumb.</P>
    <P>It brings me, having mentioned the question of a consultant, to the central point of what this side of the House was trying to do when we last debated this question.  This, I have at first hand because I was part of a deputation which originally raised the matter I told the House that when Deputy Lenihan was Minister for Education he received a deputation in July or August, 1968 representative of the two bodies who have a statutory duty in regard to the museum and from whose connections the museum originally developed, also the RDS and the Royal Irish Academy.  These bodies recommended that a committee of outside consultants, people with no axe to grind and no prejudices in regard to Ireland should be employed to advise on the whole future of the museum.  I am not talking about things like space, but the whole philosophy behind the museum.  I will deal with that point briefly in a moment.  As I have stated I was on that deputation and can speak from first-hand knowledge.  Deputy Lenihan received us courteously, he refrained from saying there were &ldquo;no problems&rdquo;, which was an agreeable change, but he did not dissent from the proposition that outside advice might profitably be sought.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Faulkner succeeded Deputy Lenihan as Minister for Education he specifically told this House and <Col N="1666" /> gave an undertaking that a consultant would be appointed within a year.  This is reported at column 557, Volume 68, Seanad Official Report.  Admittedly Deputy Faulkner said that the consultancy question would have to wait until more progress had been made in Kilmainham but he did say that a consultant would be appointed within a year.  That was in June, 1970.  According to my information, no consultant has yet been appointed.  Leaving aside that fact, which speaks for itself, we questioned then, as we question now, the necessity of waiting until work had been done in Kilmainham or elsewhere before getting popular outside advice on what the future of the museum situation should be.</P>
    <P>This is a serious question of policy and even of philosophy.  Do we attribute any importance to the museum's potential in adding a dimension to primary or secondary education?  What do we think its role in research should be? Do we think it should be centralised or de-centralised?  Should it be maintained under one roof or should it be split up under several roofs?  Should collections be divided under large general headings? These are important questions which neither I nor anyone else on this side of the House is capable of answering with authority, but someone should be able to answer them.  No consultant has yet been engaged, despite Deputy Faulkner's promise to get expert opinion on these matters.  I do not see why we should have to wait until something is done in Kilmainham, in Earlsfort Terrace, in Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, or the barracks in Kilkenny before a consultant should be called in.  It is now, when things are in chaos, we need a consultant; not when chaos becomes worse in a few years time, as may easily be the case if past experience regarding the museum is anything to go by.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary again to tell us explicitly why that consultant has not been appointed, if I am correct in stating that he has not been appointed, and when it is intended to appoint him, and who he will be or how the Department proposes to go about appointing him.</P>
    <P>I said just now, in fairness to Deputy Faulkner that he had linked the appointment <Col N="1667" /> of a consultant with the question of the former Royal Hospital at Kilmainham. He said it was envisaged that this would be the centre of a folk museum in which ancient and modern Irish skills and products, and so on would be represented and to which a fair amount of the national collection in the museum would be removed and properly displayed.  No one on this side of the House questions that the size of the building in Kilmainham would be appropriate and that building itself would be a proper setting for this.</P>
    <P>What is happening in Kilmainham? My information is that work there has come to a standstill and nothing has been done for months or years.  I have even heard a rumour that one wing has practically fallen and has been declared dangerous.  If I were in the Government's position I would raise this question of the policy behind the idea that the national collections should have to wait for proper disposal until Kilmainham has been repaired.  This is a colossal job and I do not need the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us that it will be a serious drain on the national purse.  If that is so, it must raise a serious question as to the advisability of linking Kilmainham with the proper housing of the national collections in the museum.  If a serious architectual or preservation problem has arisen in regard to Kilmainham, we should forget about it as a site for the rehousing of the museum's exhibits or non-exhibits, as they are at present, because no one can see them.  If Kilmainham is a serious problem we will have to think of somewhere else for these collections.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to be specific in his reply about, firstly, what is happening at Kilmainham, what is envisaged regarding it, and whether he would concede that if the restoration of Kilmainham has to be put on the long finger for financial reasons, some other urgent solution must be found for the national collections.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, I am not an expert in such matters, but something which occurs to me as a possibility&mdash; and I may as well throw it out, fly the kite and see if anybody will comment on it favourably or otherwise&mdash;is that <Col N="1668" /> one site which could be used in the fairly near future for rehousing and proper display of, at any rate, a section of the National Museum's collections, perhaps the Irish antiquities, would be the Earlsfort Terrace site of University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the intentions of the college or the Government are in regard to that building.  I heard it said that the Earlsfort Terrace building will be taken over by the Civil Service in due course, but I want to warn, if I may do so within the rules of this House, the Civil Service, through the Parliamentary Secretary, that they will not be comfortable there.  Earlsfort Terrace is a very seedy decrepit building.  It requires quite disproportionate maintenance of a mop and broom kind to even keep it clean.  It is totally unsuitable for use as Civil Service offices.  I feel that if the Civil Service take it over it will not be very long before the place is pulled down, until the same thing happens to it as has happened to other quarters to which public officials have been sent and which were never suitable for them.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not saying this in a dogmatic tone but it might be that University College, Dublin's premises at Earlsfort Terrace, if UCD no longer needs them and that may be the case in the foreseeable future, could be used to house and house well, if the building were reconstructed, perhaps the Irish antiquities or fine arts section of the National Museum's collections.  That is a suggestion which I have no authority from anybody to make and I hope I do not get into trouble in UCD for having thrown it out.  It seems to me that Earlsfort Terrace is likely to be abandoned within the foreseeable future when Belfield is completely constructed and Earlsfort Terrace, although very seedy and insanitary to some extent inside, is at least not ruins.  The L-shaped building which fronts on Earlsfort Terrace, the north wing facing towards St. Stephen's Green, is not ruinous.  It is a solid building and could, I believe, be used for a purpose like this without excessive expenditure.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of matters I want to mention.  I realise I have taken up a fair amount of time.  One of them is an <Col N="1669" /> important matter which I will leave to the end.  There is a marginal matter which I feel I should mention before I come to this and that is the question of the public's knowledge of the National Museum and its function.  My impression is&mdash;it is backed up by what I hear people connected with the National Museum saying&mdash;that the public do not know much about the National Museum or its function and are not informed about the National Museum's particular function in regard to finds of Irish antiquities.  My information is that people who find objects of Bronze Age period, medieval period or objects whose antiquity or uniqueness are of historical importance or makes them significant in any way, tend not to know that the National Museum is the right place to apply to for information about them.  All sorts of bodies who have no direct connection and no statutory responsibility in the matter are approached by people who find these things.  The National Museum literally does not know what is being found in the country at the moment. These unlisted finds frequently either find their way abroad or into informal local collections.</P>
    <P>I am not against the idea of local museums.  When we last debated this subject strong pleas were made by Senators Quinlan and Horgan for local museums.  I am not against the idea. All I say, in regard to the whole museum situation, is that we should be properly advised about it.  It should not run on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis of the kind on which it is running at the moment.  We should get proper expert advice about the role of a country like this in regard to the preservation of its own antiquities, whether these should be centralised or whether it is educationally or nationally better to decentralise them.  There is no policy about these matters at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is no policy and no form of public information in regard to items of antique interest, and I use antique in the broadest possible sense, which turn up all the time here and there throughout the country.  My information is that travelling buyers, people who in the past were called tinkers, set up as antique buyers, go round the <Col N="1670" /> country to people who know very little about what they have got and buy up material which in many cases deserves a place in a museum setting.  The public are so uninformed about the national importance of something which may be lying unregarded in a corner of a house or dug up in a garden that the National Museum is literally ignorant of what is being found, what is going out of the country and what is being placed in local museums.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary ought to let us know if he proposes to do anything, even something as humble as putting up posters in post offices and garda barracks.  That is humble enough, God knows, but it is done in regard to saving certificates, recruitment for the Garda etc. and I cannot see why it should not be done in regard to people who find or think they own objects of antique interest.  I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary would be in favour of a campaign to inform the public of the potential national interest of ancient items, which they may have themselves or which they accidentally find.</P>
    <P>There is one other small matter I want to mention, before I wind up, which is very relevant to the National Library as well as to the National Museum, and that is the whole question of items of national interest of a documentary or pictorial kind disappearing out of the country under our noses.  The only legislation we have in this regard is the Documents and Pictures Regulation of Export Act, 1945.  Under this Act, which is provided with no penalties for an infraction of the duty which it lays on people&mdash;it is a <i>lex imperfecta,</i> you can disobey this Act and so far as it is concerned no penalty at all can be applied to you&mdash;the Minister for Education is entitled to declare that a document or a painting, or documents or paintings of a particular class&mdash;I am condensing the provisions&mdash;are of national, historical or literary interest and should not be exported from the country.  But no effective machinery is provided for making sure this does not happen.  This Act might as well never have been passed.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary has not had notice of this and if he <Col N="1671" /> prefers I will get a colleague in the Dáil to put down a question about it, but I should like to know, as a matter of interest, how many times a Minister has made any order under this Act in the last 26 years.  I would say very seldom indeed, and naturally so because anybody with an item of a literary or pictorial kind which is worth money, who knows that such an Act exists and who is not patriotically minded in the way that I have described many of the donors who give items to the National Library, will keep quiet about it, will take it out of the country and sell it elsewhere and not a thing can be done about it.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  So little regarded is this Act that I am told when a picture comes to the notice of any public authority, and the suspicion arises that this ought to be kept in the country, the people to whom the picture is sent for an opinion are not the National Gallery, but the National Library.  So, in addition to the conditions in which it has to work the National Library is saddled with this absurd duty, which no one there is capable of performing, unless by accident he may know something about painting, of judging whether or not a picture is suitable for an order retaining it in the country or whether it can be exported abroad.  If my information is correct how can that be defended?  It is a small thing but, if it is true, it is absolutely symptomatic of the kind of disgraceful neglect and indifference with which this whole area of national life is being treated by the apostles of the &ldquo;quality of Irish life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My last point is very important.  The Board of Visitors of the National Museum, I am told, have in this calendar year repeatedly sought an interview with the Minister for Education and my information is that they have been stonewalled and refused consistently a meeting with Deputy Faulkner.  Of course, like everything else, there are probably two sides to the story and naturally I will listen with interest to what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say, and if he contradicts me I will withdraw my following remarks.  If the people who were seeking an interview with Deputy Faulkner had <Col N="1672" /> been a delegation from Hackball's Cross looking for a telephone kiosk they would have been quick enough to get it, but when they are people who have serious statutory duties in regard to the National Museum, they have no access to the Minister in whose hands lies the solution of their problems.</P>
    <P>Now these visitors have repeatedly recommended during several years past that the whole conduct of the affairs of the National Museum should be taken away from the Department of Education and be entrusted to an independent authority, an independent board.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House last year pressed that that point of view should be accepted by the Government. It has not been accepted.  I hope it will be accepted.  It seems to me that no other solution will be possible, at any rate, for the National Museum.  The National Library is perhaps not in quite such a desperate condition.  No other solution seems to me to be possible than to take away and give to an independent board these important national functions which the Government are unwilling to discharge, and which the Department of Education are incompenent of discharging.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to what Senator Kelly has had to say and I am sorry that I think most of the points of substance he has made&mdash; his account of the situation as it affects the National Library and the National Museum are accurate.  Having said this, may I add what Senator Kelly probably regards as my customary note of regret? Whenever he speaks I must perform this exercise.  I constantly feel that if I go through what he had to say with a blue pencil, removing the little shafts and barbs and terms that are aimed effectively in a political way, it would considerably reduce the volume of what he had to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that comment I think, in terms of the factual points he has made, the situation is much as he describes.  At the same time, it is only proper on this side of the House to put on record some of <Col N="1673" /> the points of marginal improvement in the situation, particularly in the case of the National Museum, some marginal points recorded by the Board of Visitors. Also I should like to concentrate on the point, as Senator Kelly conceded, that the matter is largely a financial one&mdash; how money might be spent most effectively&mdash;and to try to define or limit the financial problem because there is a serious danger that people may see the situation of the National Library and the National Museum as an enormous financial problem, whereas in fact relatively small sums properly spent on an immediate basis could go a long way to alleviate the condition.  I would certainly hope that the long-term major capital expenditure will take place.</P>
    <P>This is the context in which I should like to say a few words.  Senator Kelly dealt initially with the National Library Board of Visitors' Report for 1969-70. It seems to me that the basic points he made regarding storage are extremely valid.  There were two other points that he did not mention specifically, one of which I should like to mention because I regard it of very great importance.  It is the availability of publications of international organisations.  That is a matter which the trustees have recorded as being a serious problem because the storage is not available to make this international material available.</P>
    <P>Also, I think the trustees' comments on the deterioration of the catalogue in the National Library is a matter of very great importance.  I think the reason why it is difficult for politicians to sell libraries and museums as an asset is that the number of people, as a proportion of the population or whatever it might be, who use these facilities is probably extremely small.  The point is that the National Library and the National Museum are absolutely essential assets.  They are an integral part of our obligation to store the physical history of our country, and that material is only valuable if it is properly indexed and catalogued so that if and when an individual wants to find out something about a particular piece of material or look up a particular piece of reference, he can do it.  That is why cataloguing and indexing are such a vital matter and why it is a point I wish to stress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> In the same way I was interested that the 1969-70 Report of the Trustees of the National Library recorded the growing interest in the preservation of business records, again with the caviat that this was presenting space problems. I certainly welcome the increased attention to the preservation of business records and similar archive material.  I hope&mdash;just as Senator Kelly has made the point about the National Museum's responsibility where the members of the public may find artifacts of an ancient nature&mdash;that people, particularly in the business world, would remember that they may well have old records, which to them may seem to be just waste paper but which may be an extremely important record of the economic development of our community and valuable as archive material.  Such things should be kept for at least an expert's view on their value.</P>
    <P>These are the points I have noted with interest in the National Library Trustees' Report for 1969-70.  May I add to my opening remarks by saying what is likely to be the cost and so on? It seems to me that the question of storage is one which is common not only to the National Museum and the National Library but must indeed be a problem where the papers of other Government Departments and so on are concerned.  As I understood it, basic accommodation and storage, proper temperature control, and so on would never be wasted in any circumstances, even if at some future date, for example, the premises of the National College of Art became available to the National Library and it became necessary to remove material that had been stored off site back into those premises.  I suggest to the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary that whenever a case must be made for additional storage space this point must be underlined.  As I see it storage space would never be wasted, it would remain an asset of this estate regardless of which particular wing of State reponsibility was using the storage space at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly referred to the difficulties of off-site storage space where the service of readers of the Library would be concerned.  Often the provision of something like a small van, which seems <Col N="1675" /> to be unthinkable to Departments and institutions under State control, in many circumstances is the sort of small thing that should be considered seriously. Again if one could overcome the red tape which ties up so many of these things and have a small van available to a number of institutions of this kind, I am confident that the usage of this van or vehicle would be 100 per cent and that in some cases when it comes to conserving historic papers or historic objects the availability of that van, even if it were taken out of its business of ferrying material from storage points to the Library for 24 hours, could save vital material without any purchase cost to the State.</P>
    <P>Particularly where business archives are concerned, economic material, the records of companies closing down for one reason or another, a situation has arisen that material was available if only a van could have been got there to take it out to get it away.  The problem in some cases literally has been as simple and yet as complex as that.  When the question arises in administrative terms of how does something like the Museum or the National Library get hold of a van for a day and pay for it, apparently that simple question in a commercial context can raise enormous problems.  I put in that point to illustrate that that sort of flexible approach to some small problems at apparently little cost could alleviate a number of problems and might add immeasurably to the treasure of the State in some instances.</P>
    <P>I should like to move on from the National Library to the Report of Board of Visitors of the National Museum.  The first report we are asked to look at is the Report for 1967-68.  It points out that much could be achieved with relatively little financial assets.  I agree with that.  The reference to &ldquo;relatively limited financial assets&rdquo; is in relation to simply the small improvements that are required to allow the staff to work with their ability and qualifications freed from incumbrance. In the same way the reference refers&mdash; it is hardly worthy of the name &ldquo;additional expense&rdquo;&mdash;to whatever would be involved in making sure that posts in the National Museums were filled <Col N="1676" /> promptly and indeed preferably filled in a way which allowed a measure of overlapping.  To say that must raise the horrors in establishment offices in the Civil Service.  It is sad to see this recorded in the Museum Board of Visitors' Report for 1968-69.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly said one is supposed to apologise to some extent for criticising civil servants.  At the same time, it is the role of a politician, regardless of his party, to assert the importance of public interest overcoming what seems to be definite bureaucratic blockage.  It is recorded in the Museum Report that a delay in the transfer of the botanic material from the National Museum&mdash; I am glad to see it has definitely gone now&mdash;to the Botanic Gardens was delayed because of difficulties between the Departments of Finance and Education in co-relating the salaries of the staffs involved.  It seems to me that that sort of delay is extremely serious particularly in the sort of field I am talking about.  I have been arguing for overlapping, not just for replacement.</P>
    <P>A lot of the value of the people who work in the National Gallery or National Museum is inside their skulls. They have great knowledge of the material they have been working on and that is irreplaceable.  It can be passed on only in the conversation of one scholar to another and in the proper exchange of information about the progress of cataloguing work, and so on.  For that reason any gap in the replacement of staff in these institutions is really disastrous.  It is imperative that they should at least be kept up to their current establishment all the time. No delay of any kind should be permitted. One of the encouraging things in the Museum Board of Visitors' Report for 1968-69 is their statement that they understand adequate candidates for the sort of vacancies available in the National Museum are now, in general terms, available.  Speaking as experts with a knowledge of our educational institutions, they are correct in that statement.  There is no reason why the posts should remain unfilled at any stage.</P>
    <P>Continuing on the theme that relatively small contributions would help the matter, Senator Kelly expressed his <Col N="1677" /> topical interest, again in the very strong way which he usually does, in increasing the Garda force.  It is very difficult to compare these things, but I feel, possibly as strongly as Senator Kelly, that our Garda force needs to be increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>At least they should be allowed to do the job they are supposed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on that.  It costs about £1,500 a year to increase the Garda force by one man. It is probably not fair to compare these things, but in a sense&mdash;increasing the staff of the Museum or the Library by one can make a much larger contribution for posterity and the development of our society than the provision of one garda.  I say that as I am trying to get across what is involved.  Although I agree that both types of individual should have the best possible training and expertise, by the nature of the work and the opportunities available for research and as a contribution to the educational process in the National Museum or in the National Library, and because in this one central institution a small item of expenditure can cover so much ground, if the Minister for Education has to argue in the Cabinet for even a small increase of this kind, of one member of staff in the National Museum or the National Library, comparatively at this time a very strong case can be made for increasing the strength there.  I am purposely taking the example of something which many of us feel is an emergency situation in the Garda Síochána and I think the Minister for Education could sustain the case for increased expenditure in the Museum in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say&mdash;and Senator Kelly may be interested to hear this&mdash;that my experience since the last debate on this topic in the Seanad has been that on the one occasion when I went, in this case to the Minister for Finance, with an emergency plea in connection with the work of the Museum, I am glad to say the matter was met.  I refer to the serious situation that arose earlier this year where, somehow or other in the Estimates, the provision for the continuing <Col N="1678" /> excavation of Winetavern Street was cut.  It became apparent at the start of the digging season that there were no funds available and an urgent lobby to the Minister for Finance brought virtually instant action on this matter of great importance and the Winetavern Street excavation could be continued. I am not too much without hope, therefore, and I hope Senator Kelly, if he was not aware of that situation, will be interested to learn of it.</P>
    <P>May I say, too, that at that time, when I was concerned about the availability of funds for the excavation of Norse Dublin, the suggestion was put to me that the Norwegians might have as much interest in this matter as we would have ourselves and that Norwegian shipowners and people of that kind are occasionally interested in a philanthropic way in supporting work of this kind.</P>
    <P>That underlines a point which is relevant to what Senator Kelly had to say about the National Gallery.  The great benefit which the National Gallery has is the Shaw Bequest.  When we are talking at a time of financial stringency and about institutions which are of international importance, I wonder if the National Library or the National Museum or people with an interest in supporting them have done as much as they can to explore the possibilities of some international support or philanthropic interest in the work they do.  I can see that there may well be international institutions or philanthropists who would be interested in the work they are doing, and particularly might be interested when they can see how much might be done for a comparatively small outlay.  I would hope that no stone will be left unturned in looking for additional support of this kind to add to whatever increased contribution the State may be able to make.</P>
    <P>I thought Senator Kelly was a bit hard when he said&mdash;and he conceded it was not an expert's view, nor is my view an expert's view&mdash;he had doubts about the additional accommodation in the Setanta Building.  I think that almost any accommodation, in some circumstances, would be welcomed, admittedly as a temporary or immediate measure, to either the National Museum <Col N="1679" /> or the National Library, to help their situation.  I notice, for example, that the Board of Visitors of the National Museum, in their 1968-69 report, said that a proper laboratory building, apart from what is convenient to the Museum, would help their situation. That is a point I am prepared to accept. I hope that nothing said here will lead the Government or the Department of Education to hold back on any plans they may have for making accommodation available in either the Setanta Building or in the new Department of Agriculture building.  Space is a sufficient priority in any building near Kildare Street for the needs of the National Museum and the National Library to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to deal with some points not raised by Senator Kelly, apart from commenting on the points he made.  I should like to say a few words about the appointment of consultants. I am not convinced, though I know the Board of Visitors of the National Museum are seeking this, that this is necessary.  I would almost prefer to see the expenditure involved going to help the situation in the two institutions.  The appointment of a consultant could in a sense simply delay urgent attention which is required to some matters there.  Although I agree with Senator Kelly that matters of cultural or educational policy are important technical matters, nevertheless I have great faith in the technical and academic staff we have available in many of the fields covered by the museum and some of the museum staff, if given the time and the conditions in which it would be possible for them to think about policy matters and particularly&mdash;and this, of course, is the old chestnut canvassed by the Board of Visitors&mdash;if they were under an independent board of governors they could go a long way in framing policies for the future.  They could do thinking which would be fully up to international standards in this regard and would have the additional merit that the people involved in it were people entirely familiar with the qualities and nature of our Irish heritage.</P>
    <P>I think I have almost exhausted the <Col N="1680" /> point I wished to make.  I wish to add my personal voice of urgency to the situation, to underline that I think much could be accomplished by little. By any standard, the situation in the National Library and the National Museum is worthy of high Government priority.  I can only endorse the points that have been made about the contribution of the National Museum to education.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at the points of detail, even about the occasional closure of various galleries in the National Museum due to shortage of supervisory staff and so on raised by the Reports of the Boards of Visitors and to give them any attention he can.  I wish to stress, in particular, the point made on the recruitment of staff.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to stress the sense which I was trying to get across when I said that museums were a community responsibility or that there was community involvement in them.  Money is more likely to be channelled to an institution when there is genuine widespread public clamour for it.  One small thing which, if provided in the National Museum, would go a long way towards creating an interest in that institution&mdash;and in the long term would make it more likely that generous funds would be channelled in that direction&mdash;would be the provision of a general descriptive brochure for visitors to the National Museum.  It was a source of disappointment to me yesterday when, in advance of this debate, I went on a lunchtime stroll through the museum and found that even Dr. Lucas's book on the National Museum, which has a place in the cultural life of the nation, was not available when I asked for it.  Small omissions such as this can amount to disappointment to those of us who have a genuine interest in the collections there.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider our opinions favourably because there are people on this side of the House who are very anxious, in a constructive way, to pinpoint the shortcomings in the National Museum and the National Library.  I wish to underline that we recognise the financial <Col N="1681" /> problems involved.  We are anxious to see something done about them and we feel that much could be done with a little further financial assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that the only proper solution to the problems being discussed in these two motions is to take the running of the National Library and the National Museum out of the hands of the Department of Education and to put them under the control of a board which has some autonomy, power and legislative standing. Only in this way will we get to the root of the problems which we can see very clearly from the reports we are now discussing.  I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary will endorse my feelings that the Department of Education is greatly overworked.  My fairly frequent visits to sections of the Department of Education give me the impression that they are trying to deal with too many things at the one time. Whereas I feel that their main duty is connected with education and the schools and universities of this country, because of the tremendous pressure&mdash; financial, administrative and otherwise &mdash;on the Department, side issues such as the National Museum, the National Library, the National Gallery and the National College of Art have been pushed to one side.  These side issues have not got a powerful enough lobby inside the Department and the lobby they have is not capable of responding to the pressure people have been trying to build up to expose the plight of these institutions.  Therefore, the problems of the National Library and the National Museum tend to get pushed aside in the general overall difficulties in the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely essential to take the running of those two bodies out of the hands of the Department and put them in the hands of a board, as has been done in regard to the National College of Art in legislation which has just passed through this House.  In a country where we have many literary and historic treasures which need to be stored, processed and catalogued, there is a tremendous amount of work to be done.  We have only to read the reports now before us to realise the magnitude <Col N="1682" /> of the task the people in the National Library and the National Museum face.  When we read those reports we become aware of the disgraceful condition which has come about through departmental neglect over the years.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery made one very interesting point about company records.  I know something about the point he referred to.  In one specific case there was a Dublin firm of solicitors, whose records went back over many, many years and whose records contained a considerable amount of valuable information which needed to be sifted and sorted, who decided for one reason or another that they had to clear out their old records. Because there was no transport or means of carriage available when those records were offered to the National Library it was not possible to accept them.  Purely because of the efforts of one economic historian, who got his own car and with the assistance of his family on a Saturday morning loaded the records and brought them to his office in Trinity College, those important and interesting manuscripts were saved for the nation.  That case illustrates the problem involved.</P>
    <P>The National Library, working through the Department of Education, has no flexibility.  They do not seem to be able to carry out their functions properly.  Everybody, on both sides of the House, must recognise that the whole administrative system needs to be changed if we are to get to the root of the problem.  On the other hand, I think that is something that is slightly long-term although tremendously urgent.  It is something that one cannot put into practice within a short time.  I hope the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will commence the preparation of legislation to this effect at the earliest possible date; but there are things, as Senator Keery said, that can be done with proper reorganisation and with modest amounts of money. In the long term a great deal more money will be needed for both those institutions if they are to function properly.</P>
    <P>It makes sad reading&mdash;I am specifically sticking to the National Library report here&mdash;to turn through the pages <Col N="1683" /> of the reports for 1969-70, which we are discussing in this motion, and the more recent report of 1970-71 and see the statements made by the Council of Trustees who are chaired by a distinguished former Member of this House and who form a body of the most stable, well-intentioned and intelligent citizens one could possibly assemble.  I do not think that a body such as this would be given to making wild and emotive statements were they not, in every sense of the term, justified.  But they make emotive statements in this report because they have to make them.</P>
    <P>On page 6 of the 1970-71 Report, the total grant shown for acquisition of manuscripts for the National Library was £14,000 for that year.  On reading this, one realises the gross inadequacy of this grant and the problems faced by the National Library when manuscripts of genuine Irish interest come on the market in this country or, as they often do&mdash;and we must face this fact&mdash; in Britain.  As I have tried to point out on another occasion in this House, there is an added disadvantage to the National Library when an Irish manuscript of historical value comes on the market.  Turnover tax of at least 5 per cent must be paid.  No other country has to pay this tax.  This makes the task of purchasing valuable manuscripts more and more difficult.  Surely something can be done about this.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a point made by Senator Keery on the Appropriation Bill last year, in which he spoke about the disgraceful fact that parliamentary papers and publications of international organisations are lying in the basement of the National Library in large boxes, unprocessed.  When I try to get at these, the staff there cannot provide them: they are there but they cannot get at them.  They have been left in this condition because they have not had sufficient space to deal with the problem of storage and cataloguing.  This affects every Member of this House.  We need the information which is contained in publications of international organisations and in parliamentary papers and we cannot get at them.  They are here. They come in in tremendous quantities and there is nobody to process them, <Col N="1684" /> or there is nowhere to store them, if they were processed.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I should like to quote some sections of the Report for 1970-71, which is not the Report we are debating. However, it contains more up-to-date information which can show us that the complaints made in the 1969-70 Report have not been adequately dealt with.  For example, under the section dealing with accommodation on page 8, it reads:</P>
    <P>Extensive reshelving of areas formerly occupied by newspapers, now stored in an off-site location, is necessary to make such areas useful as a relief to congestion, but this has, unfortunately, not been undertaken so far.</P>
    <P>We are glad to learn that the premises of the present National College of Art are going to be used by the National Library.  This is a matter of extreme urgency and, as pointed out by Senator Kelly and Senator Keery, the storage situation is chronic.  The sooner the National College of Art can be moved to its new quarters and the sooner that the extra adjoining space is available the better.</P>
    <P>Under the section dealing with staff and administration the Report reads:</P>
    <P>Last year it was reported that another post in the Assistant Librarian grade has been created, but this has not yet been filled.</P>
    <P>This highlights the fact that the people in the Department of Education have neither the will, the means nor the manpower to get this whole business under control.  In addition, it illustrates what I have been trying to say all along, that the sooner an independent board with power is put in charge of these organisations the better for everybody concerned, and for the Department of Education, who have a tremendous problem.  I do not see how the Department of Education can run these institutions successfully in the remote way&mdash;that is in the geographical sense&mdash; that it is forced to.  The Department are not located on the site of the National Library.  Decisions in connection with <Col N="1685" /> the National Library are presumably taken somewhere else in the city.  The sooner a board operates actually on the site, that board meetings are held regularly, that the Department of Education and officials of this board are brought face to face with the problems, by having their meetings regularly in the Library, the better.  Over the years the Department of Education have apparently not been aware of the problems that face the National Library and the National Museum.</P>
    <P>In the section dealing with staff and administration the Report reads:</P>
    <P>Chronic shortage and mobility of clerical staff has only recently been relieved...</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Reading Room Catalogues&rdquo; it reads:</P>
    <P>About nine thousand entries now await typing.</P>
    <P>That refers to typing into the main catalogue in the National Library.  Nine thousand entries show a backlog of some considerable time.  The number is slightly less than that of the previous year.  It is clear that further staff are needed to deal with this problem.  When we are talking about the National Library and the urgency and importance of doing something about it let us recall that we have the lowest stock of books of any country in Europe, proportionate to our population.  We also have the lowest <i>per capita</i> expenditure on books of any country in Europe.  These statistics can be obtained from the Librarians' Association.  In the light of this, it is essential that this House, and the country as a whole, put pressure on the Department of Education to do something, and do something urgent and radical, about the National Library and the National Museum.</P>
    <P>The section of the Report of 1970-71 dealing with newspapers reads:</P>
    <P>Owing to lack of storage space for additions to files a number of periodicals dating from 1968 have now been withdrawn from service.</P>
    <P>This was the point made by Senator Kelly when he said that the excellent acquisition from Irish University Press <Col N="1686" /> is so large that the National Library are unable to deal with it as it stands at the moment, and have had to put some important parliamentary and other papers into positions in which they are not so easily accessible as they were before.  This highlights the problem and again I would like to quote under the section entitled &ldquo;Official Publications Division&rdquo;.  There is a sad passage which reads:</P>
    <P>The Trustees, in an appendix to their report for 1902-3, quote a statement forwarded by them to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction on the 23rd January, 1903 in which, discussing American Government publications received from the Smithsonian Institution, they state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Their value is very great, but there is no proper place anywhere in the building where they can be safely unpacked, checked...  At present this valuable collection, occupying... large packing cases, encumbers and disfigures the entrance hall of the Library, and with existing library accommodation there is no immediate possibility of the unsightly obstruction being removed.  The unpacking of the books in the hall would be unsafe, if not impossible. Suitable accommodation for Library treatment of works of this character and number is imperatively required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The present Trustees feel compelled to reiterate this statement. American Government publications have not been unpacked since 1960. Boxes again litter the front hall. Others are deposited in basement passages, or wherever a makeshift space can be provided, but sometimes, we regret to have to report, under conditions not conducive to their preservation.</P>
    <P>There is no other way of describing this section of the Report but to say that it is a disgrace to the Government and to the nation, as a whole.  The sooner that we realise that the administration of these two bodies, as <Col N="1687" /> they stand, are just incapable of carrying out their duties properly, the sooner we will realise the need for complete reorganisation, and the sooner we will realise that even under the present system if the money voted to these bodies through the Department of Education is not increased, the whole system will grind to a halt through having to repair holes in the roofs, as Senator Kelly has pointed out, and the necessity for the unpacking of books which have not been unpacked since 1960.  Imagine the volume of literature that has come in from United States Government institutions and the Smithsonian Institute, which is so valuable to this country.  It would require an army of staff to deal with this accumulation and until the present staff are increased considerably the hope of ever tackling this backlog and getting it up to date and having it rehoused and recatalogued is out of the question.</P>
    <P>As a person who deals with libraries and to a lesser extent with museums I should like to register the strongest possible protest at what has happened and at the way our National Library and National Museum have been dealt with since the foundation of the State.</P>

    <P>So far this debate has been on a very high level and this is one of the most important debates we have had in the House for a long time.  I am glad the two motions are being debated together as there is a close connection between our libraries and our museums.  These are important in the life of any nation taking second place only to our national language.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to page 2 of the Report of the Board of Visitors for 1968-69 in which these powers are defined.  Under the heading &ldquo;Powers and Duties of the Visitors&rdquo; it refers to the agreement of March 1st, 1881, between the Department of Science and Art, as it was called then, the Commissioners of Public Works and the Royal Dublin Society.  Article 17 of this Agreement states:</P>
    <P>The duties of the Board of Visitors shall be to make annual reports to the Department on the condition, management and requirements of the Museum and to advise on points affecting the administration and a copy of such reports shall be laid before the Parliament by the Department.</P>
    <P>These visitors require the highest commendation for the candid and thorough manner in which they have carried out their duties.  Four were appointed by the State, three by the Royal Irish Academy and five by the Royal Dublin Society.  We need not go into the historical reasons as to why we have such a representation from the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society.  They have done their duty candidly and fearlessly.  The position is a matter of grave concern to those of us who value these things and who are anxious that our museums, and our National Museum in particular, and our libraries should be the very best.</P>
    <P>In this report reference is made to what, in my opinion, is one of the most important documents to be published in recent years on museums.  I refer to the document mentioned on page 4 <Col N="1689" /> entitled &ldquo;The National Museum, its place in the cultural life of the Nation&rdquo;. by Dr. A. G. Lucas.  Dr. Lucas is the Director of the National Museum and his article is something which should be in the hands of every Member of the Oireachtas and every member of the community who has an interest in the precious relics of the past and who has an interest in the future, particularly the cultural future of our people.</P>
    <P>In that document, Dr. Lucas states much better than I could, what should be the prime objects of the National Library and the National Museum.  I should like to quote a short section from it.</P>
    <P>It works relating to this country, the ideal of the National Library is to have on its shelves a copy of every printed book, booklet, periodical, pamphlet, magazine and newspaper published in Ireland or containing matter of Irish interest and, as well, to acquire and preserve, either in the original or in copy, all documents of a similar nature which exist in manuscript form.  The aim which the Library attempts to achieve is, as far as possible, to collect and maintain the whole written documentation of the people and the country of Ireland in literature, history, biography, topography, arts and crafts, natural and physical science and all other fields of knowledge. The aim of the National Museum is to collect and maintain the documentation of the people and country of Ireland in things.  The books and the manuscripts in the Library are a record of all the information available about the country and its inhabitants and, at the same time, raw material which can be utilised for expanding that information further and further. The Museum collections are, similarly, at once a record of man and nature in Ireland and the raw material for extending knowledge about both.  Naturally, the written documentation in the Library is more immediately communicative than the things of which the Museum collections are composed, but these things can be made communicative by study and research.  This is true whether the things are plants, animals, <Col N="1690" /> minerals or artefacts.  Moreover, the more diversified the methods of research applied to them, the more varied the knowledge they can be made to yield and while some of this knowledge may be of purely scientific interest, some of it may have very practical applications.</P>
    <P>That puts very clearly what the objects of the National Library and National Museum are.  If the general public, and possibly many of our public representatives, are not fully aware of these objects then there is some truth in the point made by Senator Keery when speaking on this subject last year that the fault lies, at least to some extent, broadly on the shoulders of the nation.  Unfortunately, and I say this with regret, at this stage we are possibly more inclined to look at material things rather than things of the mind and culture in general.  Maybe it is because we were starved for so long of the bare necessities of life.  Maybe it is because of the dreadful struggle for existence we have had down through the centuries, particularly the 18th and 19th centuries, that we are so overjoyed now at having comparative opulence that we are inclined to neglect the more important things.  For that reason I suppose the nation is to blame, to some extent at least, for the neglect there has been as regards the upkeep and expansion of the National Library and the National Museum.  These points have been made not alone by the Board of Visitors but by Senator Kelly and the other speakers who preceded me.</P>
    <P>Among our natural characteristics we have much to be ashamed of and much to be concerned about.  One of the things which comes to mind on an occasion like this is our neglect of some of the most precious things we have. Think, for example, of our neglect of the great arts.  It is notorious that of all the civilised countries of Europe we are probably the most careless about the resting places of our dead.  We are a religious people, maybe not as religious as we used to be, but still we think about the departed ones and pray for them.  Still, we utterly neglect their resting places with the exception of cemeteries which are kept very well in large centres of population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> We are neglectful of many of our monuments.  Our standard of cleanliness in public is deplorable.  You have only to go along any of the roads to see litter and plastic bags strewn on both sides.  We are inclined to overlook, ignore or not be cognisant of these things.  Maybe it is the same type of thinking that causes us to take no notice of what I am sure is not deliberate neglect, but possibly neglect through force of circumstances by the Departments involved.  The provision and maintenance of proper facilities, particularly for our National Museum, is a vital necessity.</P>
    <P>For various reasons, which one does not have to go into at this stage, we lack what is called pictorial documentation of our people down through the centuries.  For example, Holland has magnificent pictorial records in her museums of the lives of the people through the various centuries.  Here we have nothing at all of that kind.  Such things did not exist.  Even if we go back to the early Christian period when we were known as &ldquo;the Island of Saints and Scholars&rdquo; and when we deserved to be known by that title, pictorial representations on monuments very rarely depicted any scenes native to this country.  We have many examples on our white crosses of Biblical scenes&mdash; Cain killing Abel <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;but very little which would give us a picture of the type of clothes people wore at that time, the kind of utensils or weapons they used.  We have very little pictorial documentation of our life in all its aspects down through the centuries and, indeed, the literary word is not a great help either.  In our own language and in the English language such references are very scarce.</P>
    <P>In the 18th century we did have a very small number of foreign visitors. They did quite a lot.  Visitors from England, of course, with their minds made up beforehand, a typical British characteristic, came and wrote about what they wished to see, more often than not.  Because of the fact that we have very little pictorial documentation and because the literary word is not adequate, we depend a great deal, <Col N="1692" /> possibly more than any other country in the world, on the artefacts in our National Museum to supply the knowledge. Modern research methods can extract quite a lot of knowledge from the artefacts.</P>
    <P>As time goes on we shall have more sophisticated methods of research, more sophisticated methods of dealing with chemical reactions and so on and various substances in these artefacts. Further knowledge will be available because, in my opinion, one of the primary functions of the National Museum is research work and the giving of knowledge on what they have, so as to complete the picture and give a full documentation of our people down through the centuries.</P>
    <P>Of course, a museum has another function too, that is a display function. However, not much can be displayed at any one time and to a certain degree, displays are, so to speak, superficial.  If you go into the National Museum you see quite an amount of material on display, but it is nothing at all to what is hidden away, here, there and everywhere. This was referred to already by a number of speakers.  Because of the fact that we must depend on the artefacts to supply what we lack in pictures and in the literary words, our National Museum takes on a new importance. For that reason it is deserving of the fullest consideration that can be given by the Government and the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell for a moment on the question of the libraries in general. We all know the true value of books.  A good book is man's best companion.  At the moment, we are simply inundated with books, a large percentage of which are utter rubbish, being evil in their content and deliberately provocative in their presentation.  We are dealing, at the moment, with serious literature.  While the Department has had many hard words said about it since we began this debate this morning, I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to them for what they have done as regards the provision of good library books and books of reference in the primary schools in this State.  Certainly splendid libraries, and especially reference libraries, are being built up in all the <Col N="1693" /> national schools at the moment, and that good work is to continue.</P>
    <P>A library, especially nowadays, is a very very important service in the life of a student.  These reference books and library books in general are made up very attractively.  They would want to be because a library is fighting a very grim battle with the attraction, first of all, of these wretched books known as comics and, secondly, this other, should I say, intrusion on our privacy known as television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabh mo leithscéal, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.  Tiocfaidh mé thar n-ais.  The greatest necessities for both our National Museum and our National Library may be summed up in the three S's: space, security and staff.</P>
      <P>Now the question of space has been dealt with at some length already, and I shall not go into that matter myself.  As regards security, one of the reports we have under discussion, that for 1968-69, it is stated on the top of page 4.</P>
      <P>Relative to this matter of risk to the National Collections, we are glad to be assured by the Director that the security arrangements which are maintained are most thorough and would seem to be totally adequate.</P>
      <P>While I have great respect for the Director, I find myself rather worried, especially nowadays when nothing at all seems to be sacred, as far as the activities of vandals and people with twisted minds are concerned; and I shudder to think of the consequences if some lunatic walked into the National Museum, as he could easily do, and planted a bomb in there.  Bad and all as it is to wreck buildings of nothing more than commercial value, the destruction created by such an occurrence as I have mentioned would be disastrous, not alone at the present time but right down to the end of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a situation I think that should merit very careful consideration, that is, this question of security, and to ensure that no unauthorised person would be admitted to cause even the <Col N="1694" /> slightest damage to any of our collections.</P>
    <P>On the question of staff, I understand that the National Museum, in particular, is still understaffed.  I learned from the Director, in the last week or thereabouts, that conditions had improved very much as far as staff were concerned, and whatever deficiency there may be in numbers, is more than made up by the dedication of the staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another way of saying they are very much overworked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt they are overworked.  Anybody who is worth his salt in this life makes sure he is overworked. It has often been said that if you want anything done you go to a person who is overworked already, and he will do it.  The dedication of the staff in both our National Library and our National Museum are something of which we can be very proud.  In conclusion, I would like to refer again to this publication of Dr. Lucas.  He ends and I cannot do better than end in like manner, by saying:</P>
      <P>The course of history has, unfortunately, left us without many of the means to information about the past which are so abundant in other countries.  To make good this deficiency there is left to us one&mdash;and only one&mdash;source to draw upon: the material in the Museum.  History has, thus, thrust upon its collections an importance unparalleled among the national collections in any other country of Europe.  This enhances further the vital role which the Museum has to play in the life of the nation in preserving the documentation in kind of the country and its people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ideals set out in connection with the National Library and the National Museum could possibly be expedited by the transfer of the responsibility from the Department, which everyone knows is already overworked, to a special board whose duty it would be to look after these particular institutions, much like the board which is about to be set up to look after the <Col N="1695" /> National College of Art.  It is true that the Department of Education is overworked, especially nowadays with the impact of school transport and so on. Perhaps when the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary is replying he will deal with the feasibility of relieving the Department of the responsibility and privilege of looking after institutions which are as important as the National Museum and the National Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>From our visits to the National Library and the National Museum, we find a gigantic task ahead calling for more space, more equipment, more modernisation, more staff.  Much the same tasks are faced in many other fields which, through shortage of resources, have not been developed.  The same applies to both institutions which we are discussing today.  The time has come for a drastic reappraisal and a drastic examination of the task ahead. It is something that cannot be solved piecemeal; for instance, adding the space being vacated by the College of Art is only a temporary measure. Indeed, the aims and objects as delineated by Senator Cranitch are so all-embracing that they cannot be solved by the approaches which have previously been adopted.  They certainly cannot be solved by providing space in what is by far the most expensive property development area in Dublin. We must find it a little disquieting that the numbers using the National Library are relatively low.  The number given in the report mentions an average of 153 per working day.  On the other hand, we have the question of storage and display.  There is not much point in having wonderful collections if our people are not encouraged and trained and have not got the facilities to avail of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approaching this then I would suggest that we should aim at decentralisation, certainly not the type of decentralisation that has found storage space for packing cases all over the city but real decentralisation where specific sections would be located.  I do not see why there should not be attached to the Trinity College Library, the UCD <Col N="1696" /> Library and all other libraries specific parts of the National Library collection. That would call for grading the National Library collection into grades one, two, and so on.  I would give a rather low grading to the voluminous reports that all the Governments put out, including our own, to OECD's publications and so on.  Provided they were available and the central authorities knew where they were located, that should discharge most of our responsibilities in that regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the comments on the position of Parliamentary papers, again that should be worked in with the library facilities for the Oireachtas.  I do not know if it is possible to have any extern readership use in that regard. This decentralisation should not stop in Dublin of course.  It should be the aim to spread it as widely as possible commensurate with the gradings and the security of the material involved.</P>
    <P>In page 9 reference is made to the remaking of reading room catalogues. A catalogue based on the present form was planned in 1916 and projected to last for 50 years.  Some changes were made in 1960.  I suggest that cataloguing has made spectacular advances in the last ten to 15 years.  Today the computer is becoming an essential feature of that. With a decentralised approach it would obviously be necessary to get the location and availability of the article concerned.  It is almost on a par with airline reservations, although I would not for one moment say that we could aspire to a computer system as costly as this.  Yet expenditure on a relatively expensive computer, something of the order of between £25,000 and £50,000 a year, should certainly provide full control and an adequate information service.  These are the lines on which we should be thinking when planning for the future.  Availing of the vacated College of Art should only be looked on as a tempory measure.  Let us make a proper plan and not be afraid of the expense involved.  It must obviously be what we can bear, but would have to be considerably more than we have at present.  Above all, let the aim be to have the National Library used, not with the numbers reported to be using it at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> On the National Museum side, I think there are priorities there.  Decentralisation should work very well. I know of private and semi-private museum collections; there is the one collection developed in FitzGerald Park in Cork; there is the one developed in Kinsale and so on.  Developments of that size, if given a boost by being associated with some part of the national collection, would be a two-way benefit.  It would benefit the museum in question and it would also further our aim to get the people to know and to use all we have in those areas.  It is most important to take the long overdue step of divorcing those activities from any Civil Service Department and put them on a basis somewhat like that on which we would have put the National College of Art if we had the Parliamentary Secretary playing his part.  We would have got the changes that would have made it really and effectively independent of the Department of Education. We shall have to do this for both the National Museum and the National Library.  The same board should be able to embrace the two.  It is a structure and a reorganisation we shall not achieve quickly.  A five year term would be a reasonable transition period in which to achieve this.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming the fact that we have the two motions relating to the National Library and the National Museum before the Seanad for the second year running.  I think this public scrutiny is a very important role of the Seanad so much so that I should like to see it becoming an annual recorded debate on which comments can be made the following year.  This could be a very useful forum for discussing those two important institutions.  I should like to apologise if my thoughts may seem to be somewhat disjointed.  I was held up by fog on my way back from Brussels yesterday and spent the night waiting for a flight which I finally got this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to begin my contribution by talking about the National Museum. As always&mdash;and I am sure other <Col N="1698" /> Senators have mentioned this&mdash;the problem is very much a problem of money but I believe it is also a problem arising from the lack of a museum policy.  We need not only the provision of facilities but also a completely different approach with regard to it.  The National Museum has been the subject of a good deal of criticism particularly during last year and I am glad to see that some of the really pertinent criticisms arose out of the Seanad debate which took place here last year.  It stimulated an interest in the National Museum, articles were written about it and comments were made arising out of that debate.  I think this was a very good way of bringing home the reality.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems underlying the situation of the National Museum is that it is regarded as an institution located in Dublin and, therefore, it appears to many people in the country to be more a Dublin museum than a National Museum.  Secondly, it is too enclosed within itself; it is not a reality for the citizens or the schoolchildren of the country or even for visitors from abroad.  This means that the National Museum lacks one of the important criteria for becoming a politically appropriate body with regard to getting funds.  It lacks the widespread interest and the widespread support which is so essential to it.  The National Museum should try to correct this situation.  It ought to have a useful and educational influence on every child's life.  If it was something which was in the thinking of every school child, which was a matter of reality to the parents, and which was of great interest and publicised to visitors from the country and abroad, then it would be a matter upon which public spending would make a great deal more sense and where we might be talking in terms of millions and not of thousands of pounds.  The idea should be that it would serve the whole population and not just a very small proportion of it.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the National Museum has come in for a great deal of criticism.  It was described, in one comment by a distinguished archaeologist last year, as &ldquo;An absolute, Goddamn scandal and disgrace&rdquo;.  In an <Col N="1699" /> English periodical&mdash;and I think it is sad when we read about the neglected state of our national institutions in English magazines&mdash;called <i>Current Archeology</i> of September, 1970, at page 290, we read:</P>
    <P>The National Museum is usually considered by archeologists in Ireland to be a national disgrace....  Partly this is due to a lack of funds....  But partly it is also due to the fact that it is a Civil Service department, and thus compares very badly with the National Gallery, which, under an independent Board of Governors has prospered exceedingly.  Thus guidebooks and lecture programmes which have been introduced at the Gallery are unheard of at the Museum.</P>
    <P>When a British magazine, writing about Ireland, is able to state such an unqualifying condemnation it really is time to look at the matter seriously and to have changes brought about.</P>
    <P>In an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 24th September, 1970, Ian Blake, again a noted commentator in this field, had some very critical things to say under the question of &ldquo;Do we need a National Museum?&rdquo; I quote from that article:</P>
    <P>If we do then it is about time we were given a proper one.  What we have at the moment is a fossil, long defunct, dusty and without much hope.  Admittedly, it is staffed by a number of dedicated men and women, but even they must despair that they will ever see a satisfactory museum in their own lifetime.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to condense what he feels needs to be done into a paragraph</P>
    <P>We must insist that, first and foremost, more money is made available. The present museum display is an anachronism.  The museum must have funds to excavate and to restore.  It is essential that it has, at once, the full staff for its present establishment, and that steps are taken to ensure the appointment of liaison or educational officer is top priority.  We must insist, too, that this museum clearly serves all the community&mdash;not merely the <Col N="1700" /> fortunate few.  Above all, I believe we must ask the Department of Education to come clean about its museum policy.  Does it consider a National Museum has any educational value? Is there a Minister or a civil servant who will stand up and say that it has not.</P>
    <P>We need a museum policy and a Museum that is a reality, especially for people living in the country&mdash;particularly the young people.  In order to achieve that there must be a whole change in the orientation of the National Museum.  It must look outwards and it must be available to the people living in the country.</P>
    <P>These are harsh and sad criticisms of our National Museum.  Nobody to whom I have spoken, who either works in the National Museum, who researches in it, or who has visited it with children, really has a very good word to say for it.  I shall list rather briefly some of the present disadvantages. First of all, there is the shortage of staff, which makes it very difficult to have proper research carried out there. Apparently there is only one photographer, and this is inadequate, to cope with some of the work demanded.  If he is ill, there is nobody to replace him. There is inadequate restoration and conservation of the material in the National Museum.  It is a scandal that such valuable material is rotting in various storerooms in the city.  It appears to be rotting in conditions where it is deteriorating, as well as being inaccessible to the public.  I shall return to this point later.  The lack of adequate storage space and the present bad condition of storage space aggravate the crisis in cataloguing.  Very many valuable materials are not catalogued at all.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Kelly&mdash;I did not have the advantage of hearing him this morning, but I read his statements on the debate last year&mdash;that what is necessary and urgent at the moment is, first of all, that a committee of independent experts should be asked to survey the whole National Museum situation.  We spend a great deal of money setting up expert committees and commissions.  This is one area where it would be valuable to have a committee, <Col N="1701" /> perhaps with a very severe deadline, to look into the present situation and to see how, in terms of better facilities and a better approach to our national life, we can prevent the necessity for appalling criticism of this institution by ourselves, for ourselves and by outside magazines.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I agree with the suggestion that the affairs of the National Museum should be entrusted to an independent board of governors and should be removed from the Department of Education.  The present set-up is improper. It would be preferable if the National Museum had the running of its own affairs under a board of governors, that it fights its corner and justifies its existence to the community, and justifies the further allocation of funds to it.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the idea of making the National Museum more meaningful and more outgoing in our national life.  This can be done principally in two ways.  First of all, in service to the schools, and secondly, in general publicity and the provision of booklets and so on. Service to the schools has been mooted by various people and it is an excellent idea.  It need not be very expensive or very cumbersome to put in motion.  It would be possible to have a number of clear and well-documented displays focussing on antiquities, on our national heritage, and on flora and fauna.  These could travel around the country and could be displayed in central halls in particular towns, in which local schoolchildren could view them.  It would not even be necessary to have an expertteam oflecturers travelling around the country. It would be possible to use the audiovisual techniques, to have tapes and a film script to go with them, and to use slides.  The effect of this would be to awaken interest in our heritage, to awaken interest locally in the geographical and other riches throughout the country.  It would mean that it would be central to the education of young Irish people, that they would have a far greater knowledge of our country.  It would be an enriching of their education in the best possible sense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> In addition to this service to the schools, which would be an important contribution, it is also astonishing that the National Museum has such minimal publicity.  The only type of guide-book published in 1971, provided by the National Museum is a very miniscule outline guide to the principal collections, which has lists of publications, postcards and transparencies and is a completely inadequate little booklet. It merely lists various things and would be meaningless to the average child who is fortunate enough to come to Dublin at the moment and to visit the National Museum.  It would be meaningless as an accompaniment of a service to schools around the country.  When children come, and if CIE were to lay on educational tours, or these displays were to travel around the country, the young visitors would like to have&mdash;and it is very useful for them to have&mdash;a good booklet with some well-illustrated examples of the various things they have seen, with explicit accounts of them. This would be very useful information to have available for visitors who come, either from other parts of Ireland or from abroad.  They could bring away a souvenir of the National Museum. At present there is no such souvenir.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the comments made by the Minister for Education in the debate on the subject last year, on Thursday, 11th June, 1970.  At Column 550, he said:</P>
    <P>In the course of a meeting with a deputation which I received recently reference was made to the question of guide books.  I should like to inform the House that it is intended to cater for the visiting public by the provision of additional guide books to various collections.  A number of these are at present in the advanced state of preparation.</P>
    <P>I know that sometimes there are problems about getting books published. If this is what the Minister was referring to, then it is neither adequate nor is it a collection of illustrated guide books showing the valuable collections which the National Museum has, and serving as an educational form.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the <Col N="1703" /> scandal that boxes of valuable material belonging to the museum lie moulting in damp storerooms throughout the city. This gives rise to two serious problems: inaccessability and also the fact that the collections are deteriorating.  This is not merely a scandal but a crime against our own traditions and our own historical riches.</P>
    <P>In the same debate last year, the Minister opened by saying that the lack of storage facilities was one of the great problems.  At column 553 he said:</P>
    <P>I feel, however, that there is a silver lining in the dark clouds hanging over the museum in this matter of accommodation difficulties. The answer in my view to the immediate and to the long-term accommodation problems lies in the work of restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>If that is the silver lining, no wonder there is despair in the heart of anybody who knows anything about the Museum or its problems in the country.  The Hospital in Kilmainham is in a very bad state of repair.  It is closed.  I asked a leading Dublin architect for a fair estimate, of how long it would take to restore it, if the work began tomorrow. He said that it would be a difficult question to answer because of all the variables.  Given goodwill, and going ahead with it straightaway, it would take at least ten years.  In the meanwhile, windows have been broken.  One valuable collection of eighteenth century pictures lies stacked up, one picture beside the other.  I know of one frustrated expert who went to see them and she was unable to do so because of the way hoarding had been built up around them. She observed that both rain and pigeon-droppings were coming in through the window and that the pictures were deteriorating.  If the silver lining is Kilmainham we will not see the sunshine in the lives of any of us here in terms of a museum with a proper exhibition hall and other facilities.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have better news for us than that, to provide as a silver lining for this year's debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> I should like to mention the question of regional museums.  This has been spoken about and is an excellent idea. Too much of our cultural heritage is centred in Dublin and although this is often said it has never been more strongly felt around the country.  Anybody who travels and who speaks about any aspect of life has this feeling of a denuding of the country towards Dublin and the necessity to create a better cultural life and better community facilities throughout the rural areas.</P>
    <P>As a poor country we must have a good deal of centralisation.  This can be harmonised with devolution to bring culture to local areas and yet through central control we can maintain standards. If regional museums should be set up&mdash;and on looking around the country either the Board of Works or similar institutions have the buildings which could be made available, such as the Spanish Arch in Galway or Cahir Castle&mdash;the effect of this would be twofold. It would create an interest by the local community in the riches of that particular community.  It would be possible to use some of the present materials which are stored and inaccessible by diverting them to the localities from which they came, where they would be seen and appreciated. Secondly, it would encourage people to lend valuable contributions.  Nobody would wish to lend or present anything to the National Museum at present to have it stored away for ever and probably stored under conditions where it would deteriorate.  They would lend to a local museum which would foster local and regional interest, which would encourage the children of the locality to visit it and give them a sense of pride and extend the meaning of our National Museum to a countrywide effort and not just an institution located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>These are the main points I wished to make on the first motion dealing with the National Museum.  My comments may appear to have been rather harsh but they are justifiably so in the sense that the scandal is great, time is passing quickly and we must galvanise the resources to deal with the problem.  I will finish with a comment of the Director of the National Museum in <Col N="1705" /> his booklet &ldquo;The National Museum. Its place in the cultural life of the Nation&rdquo; which was published in 1969 and which was reprinted from an earlier article in 1968.  He ends the article at page 12 as follows:</P>
    <P>The course of history has, unfortunately, left us without many of the means to information about the past which are so abundant in other countries.  To make good this deficiency there is left to us one&mdash;and only one&mdash;source to draw upon; the material in the Museum.  History has, thus, thrust upon its collections an importance unparalleled among the national collections in any other country of Europe.  This enhances further the vital role which the Museum has to play in the life of the nation in preserving the documentation in kind of the country and its people.</P>
    <P>I would submit that at present this function is not being discharged by the National Museum, and that is verybody's fault and ought to be remedied forthwith.</P>
    <P>The situation in the National Library is a little better than that in the National Museum perhaps because the National Library has apparently got more supporters. It has the support of the National Library of Ireland Society. Before looking into the situation in the National Library I should like to refer to the annual general meeting of the society, which will take place this evening, and to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a motion for discussion.  It is that: &ldquo;The National Library of Ireland Society calls on the Minister for Education to publish the Humphries' Report on the National Library&rdquo;.  I should like to associate myself with that motion and hope it will come to the attention of the Department and that the Humphries' Report will be published.  Reports of this kind are of great value in education and in influencing change.  I am joining the movers of that motion which I am sure will be adopted.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions one could raise on the position of the <Col N="1706" /> National Library.  I can understand that the Royal Dublin Society made an important contribution to the National Library and they should have the opportunity of nominating some members of the trustees, but eight out of 12 is a very high proportion.  I wonder in what way these people are nominated by the RDS?  It might be better for the National Library if other bodies were able to nominate, such as universities, the Institute of Advanced Studies, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, or perhaps the Arts Council. There are various groups who would have an equal claim now in Ireland to nominating the trustees of the National Library.</P>
    <P>The question of staff is one of the real problems of the National Library.  Anyone who has visited the National Library will know the staff are exceptionally courteous, but how many of them are trained librarians?  There is nobody trained to look after the archives.  It is now stated that the library will move into the Kildare Street premises of the College of Art when the College of Art moves to its new site.  I can understand the reality of the situation, but I feel it is not adequate to transfer to the premises which are at present occupied by the College of Art.  If one looks at the needs of a library, such as catalogue rooms, a reception area where security is seen to, reading rooms, reference rooms, periodical rooms, manuscript rooms, microfilm facilities, photographic space, cloak rooms, canteens, and so on, it is impossible to think that this will be catered for in the College of Art buildings even if the change took place tomorrow.  If it takes place within the next few years, we are catering badly for the short-term and catering extremely badly for anything from five or ten years' hence.</P>
    <P>The problem at present is one of inadequacy of space.  The trustees in their reports describe the various depositories of books being used in the city, and from some of these it is either difficult or practically impossible to obtain any material.  I have known of a refusal to make certain manuscripts available which are kept in the Genealogical Office.  If we are to encourage scholarship, that is a scandal.  There is insufficient seating space in the library and at <Col N="1707" /> times there are more readers than there are seats available.  During the past year rain has been dripping on to the seats in vulnerable places.  Material is stacked in the passage ways and corridors and this might give rise to a fire hazard.  The library lacks obvious amenities such as public telephones or any refreshment facilities.</P>
    <P>There is the question as to whether some of the manuscripts are properly stored.  Again, this is analogous to the question of the valuable material in the National Museum.  There is a possibility that some of it is not stored in the proper temperature or is subject to humidity.  I can speak for the collection of architectural drawings.  A friend of mine is doing research and he is extremely critical of the storage of architectural drawings.  Needless to say, there is no proper catalogue of the architectural drawings of which there are a few thousand in the library.  Some of the drawings are literally crumbling away and no real steps of restoration or conservation have taken place.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of security, the National Library, like all libraries, has an increasing problem.  Too many of the books are disappearing from the premises.  The arrangement is too informal. Instead of checking the tickets of members going in, readers are just asked to sign a book at the entrance.  It is necessary to have some sort of control. Some of the informal arrangements of allowing readers to reserve books indefinitely under the shelf give rise to the possibility of walking away either accidentally, or on purpose, with books. This is wasteful of the books that are there.  Most libraries have had to face this problem of security and have faced it in different ways, either by having somebody there or using electronic testing traps.</P>
    <P>As to the service by the National Library staff, they are courteous but inefficient to a high degree.  The handing out of books is quite speedy but the failure rate is abominably high in that books are missing or cannot be located.  This may be because of the problems of insufficient cataloguing or careless reshelving.  It is nevertheless <Col N="1708" /> remarkable when compared with the experience in other libraries.  The photographic department is inadequate to cope with the demand for reproductions, and the reference facilities are extremely poor.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the present inadequacies of the National Library. If the decision to move to the National College of Art premises in Kildare Street goes through, each of the items I have listed will become worse.  What is needed is a totally new approach and new thinking in the provision of equipment, proper facilities, a proper building and above all trained librarians and an expert trained in archives.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say about the National Library and the Museum.  I finish with a repetition of the comment I made at the beginning.  I believe it is very valuable for the Seanad to be able to discuss these motions.  I hope that what is put into the record of the Seanad annually will have a certain power to influence change.  The Minister's reply is there to be read.  If from year to year there is no progress as a result of this public debate then it raises a very serious question as to the responsiveness of Government to the parliamentary process.  I welcome the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary is here today to listen to the very serious criticisms made in good faith of these national institutions, that they may be made better equipped and more of a reality to the citizens of the country. I hope that when replying to the debate he will give undertakings which will show that the seriousness of the situation has been comprehended and that steps are being taken in relation to the National Museum and the National Library to improve the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to speak, but Senator Robinson's speech stimulated my mind on the question of the National Museum.  Some years ago some people and I decided to start a local museum in my own town.  I had heard stories of the immensity of the problems they had in the National Museum, where they were not able to put on display a great amount of the material they had.  I visited the National <Col N="1709" /> Museum and got very little encouragement. I was told that things which had been stored in obscure places had rotted away and that they were purely for scientific investigation, that they would not be suitable for local museums.  I was told in a few words that local museums were a pure cod.  They would not even contemplate them.  I was very glad to hear Senator Robinson say that it was time the National Museum began to look outwards, not inwards.  It is fine to say this has a great educational benefit for the young people, but they have to come up from Cork, Kerry or west Clare.  Parents cannot afford to send their children to be educated for a day in the National Museum.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether &ldquo;regional&rdquo; or &ldquo;local&rdquo; is the word I should choose, but I feel that the management of the National Museum should activate themselves in making available to regional or local museums some of those articles that have been stored away and are reputed to be rotting before their eyes.  I feel very strongly on this because these articles are not their personal belongings.  They belong to the nation. They should be sent to local museums on loan for short periods so that schoolchildren can see them in their own localities.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Hillery was Minister for Education he included in his Estimate provision for a van to be used for the bringing of this material to Limerick, Cork, Waterford or wherever there was suitable accommodation. There was no action taken.  Local authorities are given power under an Act of about 1850 whereby they can strike a rate to provide a museum.  Few urban councils do it because they cannot get round the barrier that is in the National Museum.  They have agents all over the country, in particular the Board of Works, and any discovery they make is lorried up here and put into one of these cellars.  That is the end of that, although it should be given to the local museum in the place it originated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is futile for people to be talking about the educational value of a National Museum if everything is to be stored around the city in cellars when there is plenty of accommodation <Col N="1710" /> throughout the country.  These various articles could be put into storage from where they could be transferred periodically from one location to another.  I cannot understand the attitude that if a person from Cork wants to see some article that originated in Cork he has to come to Dublin to see it.  You do not have to go very far outside to see the collection that came from Clare.</P>

      <P>It was the Senator who asked the question.  I am depressed listening to the criticisms of the National Museum.  They have their difficulties, among which is this storage problem, but I think, as Senator Robinson says, they should start looking outwards and solve some of their problems themselves.  They cannot be solved here with present attitudes.</P>
      <P>There are many places in the country&mdash;Senator Robinson has mentioned some of them&mdash;where these articles could be put on display and would be of great local interest, indeed of great national interest, to people who are travelling around the country.  I would much prefer to find articles connected with a particular area being located in that area, provided, of course, the security arrangements were adequate. Local authorities have the power to perform a certain amount of this work and it would be of great interest in their areas if they were able to do it, but unfortunately they cannot do this work because they are being obstructed by the people in the National Museum.  I feel very strongly that there should be a wider distribution of the articles which the National Museum cannot display because of lack of space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> With regard to the National Library, I do not believe that many people visit it.  Occasionally when I go there it always annoys me to see the material which is piled up just inside the door, again for lack of space.  I was even down in the vaults, and it is amazing how anyone could be expected to conduct a library in such circumstances.  I feel we should do away with the National Library if we are not going to have a proper one.  We do not have to go any further than the front door to see the confused conditions that exist.  I do not know the solution to this, but one must be found if we wish to preserve these records, and the sooner we make an attempt to find a satisfactory conclusion the better.</P>

      <P>The House will probably agree with me it was a good thing that Senator Kelly telephoned me and asked me to subscribe my name to the motions before the House.  It is proper that we should debate these matters.  In regard to the debate we had here 18 months ago and to the apparently nil results that emerged from it, the whole question of the value of these debates arises.  It seems quite clear that we justify ourselves in so far as the Government, who conduct the business of the Oireachtas permit us to do so in that we legislate&mdash; even if we have to pass things that some of us regard as completely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder about these motions.  Who read this debate of June, 1970?  The Department of Education are, I suppose, in the hot seat today&mdash;perhaps unfairly.  Perhaps it is not the Department of Education that ought to be in the hot seat on this matter.  Perhaps it ought to be the Department of Finance. Perhaps it ought to be the Cabinet or those who determine priorities in the matter of expenditure.  When we come here to this assembly, glad to be Members of it, we must ask ourselves the question from time to time: what good are we doing?  I am addressing the Parliamentary Secretary, if he listens to me, not that I have very much to say. I suppose I could do this over lunch with him.  There is no reason for assembling the Seanad to have this opportunity. <Col N="1712" /> Does the whole Public Service pay attention to what goes on in the debates of this House?</P>
    <P>There has not been a division along party lines here today and I am very happy about that&mdash;though, of course, it is not making a party political point; it is making a point I would make against my own people if they were in Government at this time.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Parliamentary Secretary that his party have been in Government for 14 years and they cannot shed the burden of responsibility by saying the load should be spread evenly on the shoulders of the people, as Sentor Keery said on a famous occasion.  Fourteen years of opportunity is a very long time of opportunity and it is the Government's responsibility now to do something about that.  Why I do not make it a party political point is because I wish I could be sure that the Government which would replace the present Government would have a different set of standards to apply to this.</P>
    <P>The motions before us ask the House to note certain reports.  While I suppose those who are contributing in some way to this debate, certainly the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers, have read all these reports and considered them and have observations to make about them, it is desirable that some of the more outstanding points in the reports, dull though it may be for the House to have to listen to me doing it, should get transferred from the reports to the records of the proceedings of this House.</P>
    <P>Taking the National Library of Ireland Report for 1969-70, which is the subject of this motion, it referred to the fact that it had seen an interim report of one aspect of the survey, namely, that relating to space requirement. Although Dr. Humphries is an expert in this field and of international reputation&mdash;I think I am correct in saying he did not make his full report until April, 1971 and he made an interim report relative to this matter more than a year ago, certainly before December, 1970&mdash;this report regarding space has not so far as I know, been published.</P>
    <P>The Trustees, reporting as they do <Col N="1713" /> annually on this matter, said that they read this interim report although the report later refers to the fact that they have not had an opportunity of reading the full report.  They said they were deeply concerned about the need for temporary accommodation for some of the National Library's collection.  This is a comment on Irish Government and our ability to govern.  Some tons of unprocessed National Library material lie in the basement of the premises at No. 4 Kildare Street.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to refer to the location in the basement of the Law Library of a large quantity of the Library's newspaper collection and periodicals.  It goes on to comment on this situation as follows:</P>
    <P>Volumes from this lot can be served to readers only by a spectacularly disproportionate expenditure per request.</P>
    <P>Dealing with staff and administration in this report, the Trustees welcome a gesture with regard to two appointments in the Department and express it as being:</P>
    <P>a first step towards the provision of an adequate staff to deal with the vast expansion in the Library's collections and activities over the past 20 years.  The Library is also labouring with inadequate staff and space to provide an up-to-date information service, and at present the secretariat of the Irish Association for Documentation and Information Services is housed in the Library.</P>
    <P>How valuable these reports are. Would that we had similar independence from other bodies that had to report to the Government.  How valuable is the independence?  As far as I know the Trustees are not paid.  They give their services free and they express their views freely.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Service to readers is suffering heavily through deterioration of the main reading room catalogues.</P>
    <P>Note the language of academic people, people who are not journalists.  Any journalist present will allow me to contrast the academic with the journalist. They include a very distinguished <Col N="1714" /> historian, Professor Ryan, appointed by the State, a former eminent member of this House, Mrs. Sybil Le Brocquy and Dr. Seán Ó Faoláin, and there are eight appointees by the Royal Dublin Society.  These people say in language which is just not carelessly used that:</P>
    <P>The Trustees are appalled that the Library in its present neglected condition&mdash;</P>
    <P>Neglected by whom&mdash;by us, by the Government, the people of Ireland, by selected representatives, by executives.</P>
    <P>cannot carry out its commitments in relation to the parliamentary papers and the publications of international organisations such as UNO, UNESCO and WHO which it receives. These lie unopened in hundreds of large cases scattered about the Library but, until space and staff are provided, they cannot be processed and made available although the Library has a double obligation in this regard: (a) the obligation to the government or organisation from whom it receives them, and (b) the obligation to this nation on whose behalf it receives them so that they may be made available to readers.</P>
    <P>Then it referred to surveys that have been carried out in the library by interested bodies.  It states with regard to these bodies that &ldquo;grave dissatisfaction has been expressed by them at the failure to provide adequate accommodation for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the case of the National Museum of Science and Art for the year 1967-68, the Board of Visitors who report under this code to the Minister say:</P>
    <P>We must from the very nature of our duties as visitors refer critically to the fact that the present role of our museum and education is no more than a casual and almost completely inactive one.  Its great potential in this respect is quite neglected.</P>
    <P>The same language is used by the Trustees of the National Library:</P>
    <P>It holds no lectures and in fact has no facilities to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the National History Division they say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> We cannot evince any satisfaction with the condition of this division which in nearly every respect shows signs of deterioration.</P>
    <P>This is not Oliver Gogarty.  This is a Report of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum of Science and Art.</P>
    <P>It goes on later to say with regard to the natural history division again:</P>
    <P>The overall position in the division remains unchanged from last year.  In certain details it has deteriorated.</P>
    <P>What was our national growth in 1967/ 68 and 1968/69?  While some people's tummies were growing, the natural history division was deteriorating, a continuation of the decline which had gone on for many years.  We share the directors' concern that the National Museum's storage collections are housed in many separate premises in different parts of the city.  The board cannot even examine them and it is difficult to be certain that they have not undergone further serious deterioration in the past year.  There would be a new version of Parkinson's Law in this, I imagine.  If you make the insult grave enough it is not an offence.  This is the most diabolical criticism of a regime.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>It will be remembered, of course,&mdash;</P>
    <P>Will it be remembered?&mdash;</P>
    <P>that in the past priceless scientific material has been totally destroyed in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to zoology it says:</P>
    <P>We are, however, disappointed to note that the Upper Gallery, which contains a systematic display in invertebrates, would now seem to be closed for a great part of the time.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is the part of the zoological gallery which illustrates secondary school courses on the subject and there is at the moment no other substitute for it.</P>
    <P>With regard to geology, in respect of this particular year, they sadly remark:</P>
    <P>The collections remain in storage at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, <Col N="1716" /> while additions accumulate after labelling on the stairs at the rear end of the Natural History Museum in Merrion Street.  Here they are gradually developing into a major encumbrance.</P>
    <P>The Report in respect of the following year says with regard to the transfer of botanical collections to the Botanic Gardens that it is imperative that it be settled.  It is a matter of correlation of salaries, which I hope has been settled by now.  If the scientifically priceless national herbarium is not to risk deterioration this valuable working tradition of the section must not be radically interrupted.  The Visitors are brave enough to contemplate a future. They say with regard to this:</P>
    <P>From our annual reports it may be inferred that the task of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum is a painful and discouraging one.</P>
    <P>It is indeed.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>It must be more so for those devoted servants of the Government of the State who work there.</P>
    <P>After more than 40 years of national Government&mdash;it is nearly 50&mdash;only the Irish antiquities division is in any way adequately supported and shows progress at all comparable to that in museums elsewhere.  Despite that, with reference to the Irish Antiquities Division, the Report goes on to say that the Visitors had noticed that progress in the division was severely handicapped by insufficient staffing and by the gross overcrowding of office space.</P>
    <P>I shall end with one other citation from the three Reports which are being noted by the House:</P>
    <P>The Geology Section of the Division is now without staff.  Its collections have been in storage at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, since 1962 and are virtually forgotten.</P>
    <P>These notes are worth putting on the record of this House for the sake of the improvement that I imagine we all want to bring about.  I am quite happy to sit here or somewhere else and discuss with a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister or anybody else how to bring about these improvements.  The need is so <Col N="1717" /> obvious that any conscious direction of intelligence twoards the solution of the problems must help.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister has allowed these motions to be debated without publishing Dr. Humphries' interim report or his full report.  The Minister has had the interim report for more than a year and the full report for almost nine months.</P>
    <P>With regard to the National Library, though I agree with Senator Kelly that its condition is less desperate&mdash;if you can say that a man with hardened arteries is in a less desperate condition than a man suffering from a disease which is going to kill him at the same time&mdash;the great need is new space.  You do not even being to solve the problem until you face it.  When I have read these Reports to the House I think probably we will agree that the staff in the National Library is very good.  They may not be sufficient for all the jobs that have to be done.  The staff are good enough for the job they have to do, but they have not got premises capable of being a National Library.  It is about eight years since Bloomfield was bought. At that time we all though it was a reckless decision for the Government to pay £20,000 an acre; in fact it now seems to have been a most prudent gesture and a decision that could be completely justified in economic terms. Why have we had Bloomfield for eight years and done nothing about it?</P>
    <P>I do not know the contents of Dr. Humphries' report.  Somebody who is very well informed on this tells me that we need a library twice the size of the present one to deal even with what we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>Dr. Humphries has, at a public meeting, said that we need an additional 10,000 square feet immediately to deal with present overcrowding.  I am sure that accords with his report.  Will we get that space from the National College of Art when they vacate their present premises?  When are those premises to be vacated?  What factors influenced the Government decision to build a new National College of Art where the new National Library was to be built?  Dr. Humphries said at this meeting&mdash;and I think our chairman <Col N="1718" /> was present at the meeting&mdash;that the new National Library would require at least 250,000 square feet of space. I should like to invite the Parliamentary Secretary to ask his colleagues about the present position.  I imagine there must be some meeting at some time of the year when some body of persons determine what capital sums are to be spent.  The Cabinet may not make such a determination but there must be some body of people whose task it is to determine such capital sums.  Those people ought to consider the possibility of institutions such as the National Library, the National Museum, the National Gallery and the universities having an economic potential.  I am not speaking now in the sense of a direct flow of income&mdash;this would be wholly deluding&mdash;nor in terms of the educational value and the return in terms of the people, to use Senator Kelly's quality of life test, but generally in terms of what would inspire Irish, English, German or Dutch people to work and sacrifice for their community.</P>
    <P>There was a Prussian, called Adam Mueller, who spent his life in the service of the Austrian Emperor.  Critical as he was of the liberal economists, he talked about the spiritual capital of a nation.  Jocose as this may sound, he talked about an appreciation of the value of the constitution, regard for laws, a sense of history.  Obviously, the centre of his thought would have been institutions such as the National Museum, the National Library, the National Gallery and the Arts Council. His point was that, from the point of view of the long-term generation of growth, not the short-term production of income, this spiritual capital was economically important to preserve.</P>
    <P>I, certainly, should like to participate in a debate in this House for the purpose of deciding, if there was £1 million to be spent on the National Gallery or £1 million to be spent on poor people living in wretched conditions, what are the factors which should be considered in reaching decisions.  It is a very difficult matter and to me it needs a philosophy, which I am not capable of expressing, to satisfy myself.  Where we have conditions of complete neglect and deterioration and overcrowding <Col N="1719" /> such as we have in the National Library and the National Museum, the demand is upon us to spend money.  This should be done irrespective of the cost because the cost is there in terms of what has to be left undone.  The real cost of putting up a new National Library will be the cost of so many houses not built and yet I feel, if I had to cast a vote on it, that this cost must be incurred.  In other words, we must forego cost of building an alternative in order to build a National Library.</P>
    <P>If we remember <i>The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, James Joyce, we will have noticed that he remembered sitting on the steps of the National Library.  If one reads the splendid book, insufficiently noted by people, <i>The History of the Literary and Historical Society of University College</i> by James Meenan, who was the editor&mdash;he was a very distinguished former Senator and a colleague of Senator Ryan and Senator George O'Brien&mdash;one will see a reference to his memories of having seated himself on the steps of the National Library.</P>
    <P>In my opinion there seems to have emerged from this debate an appreciation&mdash;put more or less kindly, according to the mood of the speaker&mdash;of the fact that those bodies should be free from departmental control.  We should try to express views in public which will deviate, to some extent at any rate, from British practice.  The British tradition, in Tudor times, which was one of centralisation of Government, and of civil servants advising a Cabinet which was collectively responsible, should not be so slavishly followed by us.  We are really overfond of British ideas of nationalism and anti-coalition views.  They are almost entirely British views which are not to be found in any other country.  Nationalism, of course, did spread over the rest of Europe from Britain and France but the idea that things should be centralised, to the extent that they are now centralised, is very bad indeed.  We should have something equivalent to a semi-State body to take care of our institutions.</P>
    <P>In some year&mdash;I am afraid I do not have the exact year with me&mdash;the law <Col N="1720" /> with regard to covenants was changed. Now if a taxpayer enters into a covenant in favour of an individual he can deduct the gross sum he covenants to pay from his surtaxable return.  There is an income tax recovery available to the recipient.  This is true also of covenants in favour of scientific operations.  The covenant will have a problem with regard to the National Library and the National Museum in terms of money. Why not extend the idea in regard to scientific operations to the National Museum, the National Gallery and the National Library?  Some of the money would possibly come from people who are inspired to give it.</P>
    <P>I should like to end with a suggestion of a modest kind.  There is the copyright obligation to furnish to the National Library copies of books that are published.  Many people are not aware of it.  Could something be done about publicising this?  Perhaps the most revealing aspect of our times might be contained in publications that are not very widely circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be even more brief.  In listening to the debate from both sides of the House, and in particular from Senator Alexis FitzGerald's side, I find myself in considerable agreement with what is not entirely criticism but statements of fact in regard to both the National Museum and the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some information on the question of the National Museum because earlier this year I served on a sub-committee dealing with the National <Col N="1721" /> Library through my connection with people who have given books to it.  Some Senators have pinpointed the responsibility as being on the Government; others have suggested that it is on us, as a people.  I find it difficult to find on whom the responsibility lies.  The expenditure of the taxpayer's money is determined to a considerable extent by the public attitude and the public evaluation of what should get priority. The influence of public opinion, when it is behind any project, makes it very easy for a Government to support that project.  It makes it easy for the administration to direct money collected in taxes in the direction which has public support.  For example, if we were to be invaded at the present time there is no question but that the Government would have no difficulty in finding the funds for defence.  They would be providing for joint and individual security and this would obviously be of paramount importance to people.  The fact that sufficient funds have not been made available on a current expenditure basis, and on a capital basis, is a criticism of ourselves and a criticism of our total attitude towards our national heritage.  We all bear some responsibility at one level or another in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senators have covered a wide area.  I should like to refer to particular aspects and I shall limit myself.  Senator Kelly referred to the National Gallery and to a criticism of ourselves in the sense that the National Gallery, because it was exhibiting things which were from other countries, was a reflection on ourselves. I agree with this to some extent.  I should also like to point out that the National Gallery has the advantage of lending itself more to a public popular approach to display, publicity and so on.  It might also be coincidental that the National Gallery is under the direction of a board of governors and that the National Library and the National Museum are not.  The Report of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum referred to the final Report of the Commission for Higher Education, which suggests that it might be that a board of Governors in which control and administration would be vested, would help the situation.  An independent board or a council might help to <Col N="1722" /> resolve some of the problems.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could take a look at this, if not in replying, at least in consideration later on.</P>
    <P>In relation to the current problems to the National Museum, I do not think that it would be unreasonable for me to suggest that.  I should like to give credit where credit is due.  The National Museum staff are doing very well&mdash; perhaps better than they might&mdash;in the circumstances in which they find themselves. The National Museum is the treasurehouse of our heritage.  It suffers from inadequacies in storage space, in facilities for research and for the proper preservation of the very, very large quantity of museum items which have been acquired over the years and which are still being acquired.  More could be done by the National Museum in providing modern display and as Senator Robinson stated, in providing more publicity material for visitors.  I may be talking as a businessman but this approach might help to popularise the museum, and something which is popular with the public gets more support.  There is a new guide book available but more could be accomplished.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled as to the reason for the neglect of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham.  It is the property of the museum now and was to have been restored.  I have not been able to find reference to any money set aside for this purpose.  While we cannot deal with such a wide area very quickly, because there is too much money involved, therefore what is needed is some sort of comprehensive policy or plan covering a five- or ten-year period.  The cost of restoring Kilmainham Hospital is frightening.  Senator FitzGerald has referred to what has to be left out. Looked at from the point of view of the Government, the Exchequer is faced with such a wide variety of demands under the headings of education, social welfare, agriculture, housing, all the essential infrastructure that is vital to the continuance of life in this country, that one wonders what is most important.</P>
    <P>What is needed urgently is a five-year plan of capital and current expenditure <Col N="1723" /> in order to at least restore the National Museum and the National Library to something of which we will not be ashamed.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues that some means be found to deal with this situation.  We might consider perhaps a ½ per cent in the forthcoming value added tax, which is 30 per cent on luxury items, to pay for this, because the demands on the Exchequer are so great.  It is obvious that if you need education, houses, roads and other essential services, that money spent on other things must be measured very finely.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to a policy. I would prefer to think of a plan, in concrete terms, for the expenditure of money over the next five years.  The Department of Education are constantly trying to get more money for schools, and perhaps these institutions should not be left under this Department. They could be put under some independent body where they might be in a position to secure a higher order of priority in our budgetary system.</P>
    <P>Despite what Senator FitzGerald has said, the debate was a worthwhile one. We are all, as individuals, concerned with this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to your point about time, I intend to be brief. I agree with Senator Brugha that this has been a worthwhile debate and credit must be given to the mover and seconder of the motions.  We are concerned with something which is of fundamental importance to our philosophy of life, our cultural heritage and our identity as a nation.  In the building in which we are at the moment we have flanking us the two institutions which are under debate today.  The whole problem is on our doorstep.  We seem to have been overlooking it.  I will not add to the harsh indictments which have been made here today of the situation as it exists regarding the National Library and the National Museum.  I will make the positive suggestion that the Minister and his department should, at this stage, issue a comprehensive policy plan, for a number of reasons. Firstly, it would be most opportune to have this now on the point of entry into <Col N="1724" /> the EEC.  Many people fear entry into the EEC, not for commercial or industrial reasons but for cultural reasons.  People argue that if we go in we will be submerged.  Like the decimal and metric systems, everything will be standardised.  We, as people, will be standardised.  We will be the same as the country next to us and the country beyond that.  We will have lost our national identity.</P>
      <P>Senator Brugha stated that in a time of emergency, under the threat of war, money can be found to defend the nation. In the expenditure of money here on the National Library and the National Museum you have a tremendous form of defence.  History teaches us one thing, that people can never be submerged and kept submerged for centuries.  They always fight back against the oppressor and generally come out independent and free.  This is the course of history.  We have seen examples of it in our own lives over the past few decades.  Empires cannot keep people down by force of arms, but the best defence that a nation or a people has is defence through its own thinking, its own philosophy of life, its own identity.  It would be worth while spending money on ringing ourselves around with a cultural wall of defence.  Money poured into the development of the National Library service and also into the National Museum service is money well spent in defence of our nationhood.</P>
      <P>Another point is that in the North of Ireland a considerable advance has been made in the museum institutions and here there must be some form of cultural unity.  We see the divisive forces operating every day of the week but here is something which could be examined.  A liaison could be established between the Republic and Northern Ireland in order to identify and develop that cultural unity.  Apparently&mdash;and I have posed a number of questions to people who are very close to the activities of the National Library and National Museum&mdash;decisions in respect of both institutions have been more or less on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Here also there would be an advantage in an overall policy statement which would take into account the following points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, the provision of more <Col N="1725" /> space.  You cannot develop either institution unless you have space; that is fundamental; secondly, more staff and staff amenities; thirdly, the launching of a public enlightenment campaign to bring home to the public that money must be spent on these institutions.  If you enlighten the public on the necessity for expenditure on these institutions you will get public support, and nobody will criticise the expenditure involved.  Another point is the examination of the educational potential, particularly in respect of the National Museum?</P>
    <P>The point has been made here today that our attitude should be outgoing. We should take the National Museum out to the people.  The result of the policy statement should stimulate an interest in the establishment of local museums with the co-operation of the National Museum.  By means of films, film strips and slides the content of the National Museum could be brought into the classroom and children could be indoctrinated from the infant stage right up, so that when they leave school they will know what is in the National Museum.  It will not be necessary for them to come up on a CIE tour and visit it.  Colour slides could be brought down and projected in the classrooms. In that way an interest in our cultural heritage and those things which are in the National Museum would be stimulated.  These visual aids would be most stimulating in the teaching of history as a subject.  History can be a very dry subject, depending on the teacher.  With some people history can be a most interesting subject; with others it is dry and arid, just a series of battles and dates.  With the provision of these visual aids history could become alive and be more meaningful for children.  In this new subject environmental studies which is developing now in the national schools under the new curriculum slides and film strips could be of tremendous value.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that the time is opportune for a dynamic policy statement from the Minister and his Department in respect of the National Library and the National Museum.  If he looks for <Col N="1726" /> support from the public I am certain he will get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, like the other speakers, I welcome the opportunity to review these reports, to assess our attitudes towards them, and, in making an assessment of that sort, to acknowledge that there is room for considerable improvement.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald asked what purpose these motions serve.  If there has been a constant theme in this debate&mdash;and it is not one with which I would disagree&mdash;it is the need to create an awareness, possibly an awareness that is lying dormant or in many cases that has not existed at all, amongst the community at large, amongst all of us at every level, of the cultural importance of the institutions we are discussing here this afternoon, of the contribution which they can make and must make to the life of the nation and, indeed, of the great potential in connection with both institutions which it must be acknowledged has not as yet been in any way exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I welcome the fact that, even by the standards of the Seanad debates, there has been almost unanimous agreement in the tone and content of what has been said, with the possible exception of Senator Kelly, who seemed to suggest that it was the <i>profanum vulgus</i> of Fianna Fáil who were totally responsible for the ills of the nation in this respect.  While the Government are charged with the responsibility, I would, without seeking an excuse on their behalf, point to the fact that even the speakers from this side of the House&mdash;and they seemed to be more numerous than those from Senator Kelly's party&mdash;expressed the same concern.  To start on that basis, I would hope then that the few things I have to say could be of some consequence. The Seanad has served a very useful purpose in debating these motions, and I would hope that the increasing public awareness that Senator Robinson referred to, the public impatience that one might expect to arise from inactivity, even this will ensure that the Government will be in a <Col N="1727" /> position, with the confidence of public support, to undertake much needed programmes in these areas.</P>
    <P>In view of what Senator Brosnahan has said, it is particularly relevant that at this time, irrespective of what associations we may form in the future, we do need to establish our own identity and cultural integrity in a way that has not been as urgent up to now.  These two institutions can and must play a very important part in the promotion and development of this establishment.</P>
    <P>Senators generally have agreed that the position of the National Library, while not being ideal by any means, is less disastrous than the position which obtains in the National Museum.  With regard to the Library it is agreed by most, although it has not been greatly referred to here this afternoon, that it is very desirable to maintain the location of the library in the centre of the city, for a number of reasons.  In conjunction with the National Museum, being adjacent to the gallery, even to this cultural complex in Leinster House and to other institutions of cultural and academic prowess, it is an appropriate place to site and develop our National Library.</P>
    <P>As Senators have been clearly aware, the front-of-the-house library as such is only one aspect of the accommodation problem that is involved in the National Library or for that matter in any library. The National Library is of its nature a permanently growing thing.  It must continue to be that because of the constant influx of books which, by right as well as by inclination of donors, comes into the National Library every year.</P>
    <P>The first problem one must look at, even on a short-term basis, is that of accommodation.  That is not to say that the problem of staff or other matters referred to are not in their own way urgent also, but if one has to take a priority to solve any one of them, the first thing one must take is accommodation. There are books and newspapers that are not required for daily use.  Some concern has been expressed that so many of them are stored at various places throughout the city and cannot be made available immediately.  I think <Col N="1728" /> this is one of the facts that we will have to accept until such time as we can have a National Library which is a perfect and complete unit in itself.  One cannot walk into a library and place a request for anything&mdash;from the parliamentary documents to which reference was made to historical newspapers&mdash;and expect that one can have them delivered across the desk on that day, or possibly even on the following day.</P>
    <P>For that reason storage space, particularly, must be made available convenient to the library.  Anyway it must be made available.  I like the suggestion of Professor Quinlan in this connection that, in view of the fact that, quite nearby there is a very prestigious library in Trinity College and also one in Earlsfort Terrace of the same dimension or quality, we should consider the possibility of some kind of decentralisation and, if necessary, even common storage between the various institutions.  In the long run, it is the Government or some arm of it that will pay for these institutions.  Therefore, rationalisation of storage between them might be considered.  It is important, as I have said, that the library here would be maintained in its present position.</P>
    <P>I think Senators will be aware of the fact&mdash;Senator Kelly and all other Senators were concerned about this&mdash; that provision is being made in the new building in Molesworth Street, the Setanta building, for 33,000 square feet of extra space.  It has been suggested that the Department, the Minister and the Government have been slow in dealing with this matter.  There are one or two things one can say in regard to the priorities.  It may not have been dealt with as urgently as other matters in the Government's programme have been.  The proposal was that, when the College of Art became available, it would be used as an extension for the National Library.  It was, however, recognised, even as a result of the previous debate here and, indeed, as a result of the recommendations in the report of the trustees, that this was long term.  Some of the Senators have said it is needed now or as soon as possible.  For that reason, I am pleased to say that the building operations will <Col N="1729" /> commence, as far as can be ascertained now, in 1972, on that site.</P>
    <P>While Senator Kelly, in particular, in proposing the motion, seemed to think that this building might not be in character with the existing buildings and to imply that it was typical of &ldquo;the Philistine quality of life attitude of the present Government&rdquo; nevertheless I think he will agree that the provision of facilities so near the existing site, having regard to the desirability of maintaining them where they are, is of major consequence.</P>
    <P>I may tell him that it is estimated that 10,000 square feet will accommodate 100,000 to 125,000 volumes.  Accordingly, 33,000 square feet should be capable of accommodating 300,000 to 375,000 volumes.  Depending on how it is used or how the space is allocated, 10,000 square feet would make provision generally for 100 readers or, in this instance, 300 readers and a considerable&mdash;I cannot say how considerable&mdash;number of staff.</P>
    <P>How the space will be allocated between the existing National Library and the new building will be a matter, of course, which the library authorities themselves will have to consider and which the Government and the Minister will note particularly from the report of Dr. Humphries.  Here, may I say, as already mentioned, the interim report of Dr. Humphries referred almost exclusively to accommodation, and it was as a result of that, as well as other things, that the accommodation programme just mentioned has been undertaken as a first priority.</P>
    <P>I note the dissatisfaction of Senators that the final report has not been published, and I will convey that to the Minister.  I would hope that it will, in fact, be made available to the National Library and to the Department.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that this extra space can be utilised to effect a considerable improvement in that area.  Over and above that, when the College of Art does become available, it is as well to acknowledge that it, or any new development on that site, will not be completed before 1977.  There is no point in making any other suggestion or statement.  Even if it were to be started as soon as the college was <Col N="1730" /> vacated, our advice and information is that it could not be completed and be, in fact, adapted for library purposes until that date.  This would bring into effect another 50,000 to 60,000 square feet.  Therefore, taking the 33,000 square feet that is planned for the Setanta building, the 50,000 square feet of the present usable space of the library&mdash; that is, 83,000 square feet&mdash;and another 50,000 square feet, that is a total of approximately 140,000 square feet.  It is very short of the total of 250,000 square feet which has been suggested here as being the requirement stated at Dr. Humphries's public meeting and which is consistent with the report which, I am sure, the Members will soon see.  Having regard to the fact that the storage space to which I referred and the rationalisation of storage space must be looked at, it is hoped at least that the present critical position will be alleviated considerably.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say more in regard to accommodation except to add that it is the first priority, because staff need space and, as all the Senators, some of whom have been most critical, have acknowledged, even the present staff, are very cramped in existing conditions. Therefore it would be almost pointless to consider a staff expansion programme unless it was done after the accommodation programme had first been completed.</P>
    <P>I might just mention that in the National Library there is a constant demand for newspapers of the period 1916-1925, not surprisingly.  Because of this usage and the damage that is done to them, even by virtue of being uncovered and brought back to their place, although handled carefully, it has been decided to withdraw them temporarily from the library simply for the purpose&mdash;and I hope this will reassure Senators&mdash;of having them microfilmed.  They are very precious documents not just on a national basis but on an international basis.  Therefore, we will have complete records which will be available to the public and the originals probably can be protected from any damage.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say as regards the National Library that the Trustees will be having discussions with the <Col N="1731" /> Minister tomorrow.  This is just a coincidence because it had been arranged for some considerable time and before notice of this motion in the Seanad was given to the Minister.</P>
    <P>As regards the National Museum, I will try to deal with some points that various speakers have made.  All of us acknowledge that any museum represents the physical manifestations of our own history.  Senator Cranitch, in particular, pointed out that we suffer from almost extreme poverty in that direction by comparison with other nations.  For that reason it is probably even more urgently desirable that we would preserve, maintain and develop the National Museum and its collections.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the urgent need for additional accommodation, the Minister has got sanction to acquire approximately 22,000 square feet floorspace in the same building, the Setanta building, for museum purposes.  Here the position is somewhat different to that in the library because it will be a matter for the museum authorities themselves to determine how best to utilise that space.  I appreciate the suggestions by many Senators of the need to employ consultants and seek their advice.  We can acknowledge, having regard to the present need and urgency, that those who are already directly involved, the Director and his staff and the Board of Visitors, can immediately point to the dire necessity for accommodation in this instance without the delay and expense of acquiring consultants for that purpose. This is, nonetheless, a desirable suggestion and certainly one that the Minister will favourably consider in the future. This extra floorspace in the Setanta building will shortly solve some of the chronic space problems at the museum. The museum building is a Victorian-building with Victorian-type cases.  It may not necessarily accommodate as much as it might if one were in a position to readapt it according to presentday museum presentation ideas.  It seems very likely that in the new building we will be able to cater for much more presentation and display <Col N="1732" /> than we would by using the equivalent space in the existing museum.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it has to be acknowledged that the position at the National Museum is critical.  The museum differs from the library to this extent: whereas the library will always have to have significant storage space, the actual display section in the museum is one of the smallest sectors of the museum's activities.</P>
    <P>Some Senators suggested that a programme be adopted whereby the museum could allow much of its exhibits and collections to go on a loan basis to regional museums.  The only immediate problem which occurs to me there is that the security and protection of these collections would pose a major problem.  Secondly, material, which might appear to be wasted in basements or in places where it is not on public view, is not in fact being wasted.  So much research is going on that it is not necessarily being underutilised simply because it is not on display.  This is something those who would suggest that material should be put on display down the country would do well to remember.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we must also realise the importance which the National Museum can play in stimulating the attitudes of the country generally.  The fact that it happens to be located in Dublin does not exonerate us from the responsibility we have of creating awareness of the museum's function throughout the country.  It is a matter which I will be pleased to report to the Minister for discussion with the museum authorities to see if the appropriate safeguards can be undertaken so that this very important aspect of our cultural heritage can be further extended throughout the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other accommodation situation in the museum, the Minister on his last occasion here in the House referred to the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever description he may have applied to it, as the Senator has suggested, the silver has <Col N="1733" /> become somewhat tarnished at this stage.  In any event, because of staffing problems in the Board of Works and also because of financial exigencies, there have been delays in implementing the programme to which I have already referred of leasing the floors in Setanta House.  I acknowledge that this is a matter of extreme urgency and would hope that, possibly as a result of the Senators' views here today and the very trenchant comments contained in the Report under consideration, it would be possible to continue with the programme which has already been started in the Royal Hospital of Kilmainham.</P>
      <P>The other recurring theme in this discussion has been the Department of Education.  No Department, whatever Department it might be, is geared to promoting or even maintaining the existence of these institutions in their present form and developing them to their fullest potential.  There are good reasons behind many of the arguments that have been posed.  I was gratified that no Senator who spoke made any special criticism of the officers of the Department for failing to discharge their responsibilities.  I think it was more appropriate that the responsibility was placed in a global fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot but note that the proposal has been supported from all sides of the House.  Beyond telling the Seanad that the Department of Education is not the only Department concerned with this, I may say that the accommodation programme, for instance, is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works; staffing, which has been a matter of some concern and criticism, is undertaken by the Civil Service Commissioners; and the actual funding for current costs comes from the Department of Education. There are problems to be faced before the Minister for Education or I could give any undertaking.  I can say that I will note the consistent, if not unanimous, <Col N="1734" /> view of the House that this matter must be immediately considered.</P>
      <P>Some comment has been made on the staffing position in both the National Library and the National Museum.  I think the proposal before me will alleviate some of the apparent depression that has settled on discussion of the attitudes.  I will give the House, as far as I can, the up-to-date position of the staffing situation in both the National Library and the National Museum.  To take the National Library first, there were comments from many Senators and I cannot either correct or acknowledge the accuracy of what they said, except to say that in 1968-69 there were no vacancies in the National Library.  Here I acknowledge Senator Kelly's point about the establishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1968-69, within the existing establishment there were no vacancies.  There was a new post of assistant librarian created in 1969-70 and this post was filled this year.  At present there is one vacancy in the library attendant grade, which may be confused with the library assistant grade.  An interview for this post was held last week and it is hoped that it can be filled.  The sanctioned staff for this grade is 13.  An additional assistant librarian post, bringing the total to six, was created in 1969-70 and this post was filled during the course of this year. The number of clerical assistant posts has been increased to five in 1969-70, an increase of one over 1968-69, to eight <Col N="1735" /> in 1971-72 and all of these posts have been filled.</P>
      <P>At this stage I should like to join with Senators in expressing to the staff the appreciation of the Minister, of the Government and indeed of the public for the manner in which they are discharging their duties in what one must acknowledge are far from ideal circumstances.</P>
      <P>With regard to the staffing position in the National Museum, in 1967-68 the following vacancies existed: two assistants in the Irish antiquities division; one assistant keeper and one assistant in the arts and industries division; one assistant keeper, one assistant and one technical assistant in the natural history division.  This makes a total of seven.  In 1968-69, in the Irish antiquities division, two assistants; in the art and industries division, one assistant; in the natural history division, one assistant, making a total of four.  All of these vacancies have been filled.  A vacancy now exists for an assistant keeper in the natural history division and this post has been advertised.  Further, a total number of 12 technical assistant posts have been sanctioned, which is an increase of seven on the 1967-68 figure and an increase of six on the 1968-69 figure. Only four such posts are at present filled but it is expected that three other appointments will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>Another extra post of photographer has been created and arrangements are in hand to hold a competition to fill this post shortly.  Finally, sanction of the Department of Finance has been sought for the creation of a post of librarian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to put that on the record to show that from the staffing point of view within the existing structure&mdash;and I qualify it by saying &ldquo;within the existing structure&rdquo;&mdash;at least some progress has been made and that the constant priority must be accommodation.  I do not think there is anything further I can say. There are many points of detail which were raised in the course of the debate and, if I had more time, I could comment on them.  I find myself in the position of agreeing in principle with almost everything that has been said, particularly the concern that has been <Col N="1736" /> expressed by all sides of the House. I hope that concern will manifest itself in a further development and a more urgent course of action in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House and the Parliamentary Secretary for the spirit in which these two motions have been received and, having often spoken hard words about the other side of the House, I should like to acknowledge now that I was gratified that so little party spirit was shown today and so much genuine concern with a matter of national importance.  I am particularly gratified that suggestions which we pushed here very hard last year, and which met then with no particular response, were this year taken up and, as the Parliamentary Secretary frankly acknowledged, almost unanimously supported, in particular the suggestion that these two institutions should be placed in the hands of independent bodies and removed from the direct control of the Department of Education.  I know that that may be looked at in political terms as a bitter pill to swallow, and I would like to acknowledge unreservedly the sense of public duty which led Senators on the other side to lend support to that suggestion.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly on the points made by other Senators, in the order in which they spoke, or in which I noted them.  Senator Keery referred to his regret that guide books suitable for informing a visitor to the museum were not yet ready.  I do not know whether Senator Keery realises it or not, but the Minister, when here 18 months ago, said that these guide books were in an advanced state of preparation.  This will give the House an idea of the kind of time-scale we are dealing with, that brochures that were &ldquo;in an advanced state of preparation&rdquo; in June, 1970, are not yet available.  That is the kind of time-scale which I am afraid we have been dealing with here in regard to the affairs of both these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the comparison which I drew between the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National <Col N="1737" /> Library, Senator Keery referred to the Shaw Bequest and, although he did not say so in so many words, I think I had the impression of him that his understanding was that the Shaw Bequest money had been used in the fine restoration of the National Gallery.  I am open to correction, but my understanding is that the Shaw Bequest relates only to acquisitions, and it was the plain people of Ireland who paid for the restoration of the National Gallery, every brick and stone of it.  I do not fault Senator Keery for mentioning the Shaw Bequest, but I want to make it perfectly clear that that was a policy priority of the Government's to which the Shaw Bequest was totally irrelevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Senator on that point.  The Senator will appreciate that in the light of the Shaw Bequest the Government were naturally placed in a position where they were either going to accept the conditions of the bequest or they were not.  In order to do so certain work was undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Keery spoke about the possibility that philanthropists abroad, in particular Norwegian sea captains or ship owners, might help in a project which might be of some ethnic interest to them, such as the preservation of Viking remains in Dublin.  I do not mean to deride Senator Keery's contribution&mdash;it was a very fine contribution&mdash;but it reminded me of Deputy Corry's suggestion in the Dáil a few years ago, when the Government were looking for money, that we might have collection boxes at each corner to help them out of their difficulties.  I do not deride the suggestion that we might get help from outside sources, but that should be a marginal source of assistance and we must be prepared to deal with the problems with our own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Senator Keery on the initiative which he showed in extracting extra assistance in regard to the Wine-tavern Street excavations.  I wish I had the same kind of instant access to a Minister for Finance that he seems to have.  Perhaps I will have before long. He has certainly made the best use of <Col N="1738" /> it, and I am gratified that he took that much interest in what was going on in the old centre of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Keery and the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the question of the new accommodation which is planned for the Setanta or &ldquo;Quality of Irish Life&rdquo; building.  I do not feel that this will be satisfactory but I am not an expert on such matters.  I am not expert enough to say whether it will be satisfactory that the museum or the library should be bi-located on opposite sides of Kildare Street.  However, I should like to know on what expert advice this decision has been made.  It seems to me&mdash;and I am speaking here as a layman&mdash;to be extremely expensive accommodation. Everybody knows that the speculators who erect this type of office accommodation get a very high return for their money.  The usual rental of such areas, of which the Parliamentary Secretary glibly speaks, of 22,000 square feet will be stupendous, if we are to pay the equivalent amount of money for it which the Government pays for accommodation for ordinary Departments.  I doubt very much if it will be economical.</P>
    <P>Even if I am wrong on that point, is it going to be academically or administratively a long-term practical solution?  I should like to know from the Minister what advice the Department sought before taking this decision. Presumably the people building the &ldquo;Quality of Irish Life&rdquo; building at the corner of Molesworth Street have a definite expectancy of renting this space to the Government.  I want to know what advice the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary took before they went to those speculators and said: &ldquo;We will take no less than approximately 55,000 square feet in the &ldquo;Quality of Irish Life&rdquo; building from you&rdquo;.  I cannot discern from anything the Parliamentary Secretary has said that any expert advice, other than that available within the four walls of his own Department, was sought before that decision was made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might intervene for a moment.  The building will be constructed according to specifications specified by the Board of Works for this <Col N="1739" /> purpose.  The Board of Works have been in consultation both with the National Museum and with the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, of course, that it has not been done by the gentlemen of the Board of Works without reference to the two institutions concerned, but it brings me on to this other point and one with which the Parliamentary Secretary did not deal satisfactorily, namely the question of outside consultancy, not so much in regard to the National Library as in regard to the National Museum.  The Parliamentary Secretary's Minister positively said here 18 months ago that it was proposed within a year to employ an outside consultant.  I now find his Parliamentary Secretary politely backtracking from that, and throwing doubt on whether it is a sensible thing to have a consultant at all.  Among other things, the Parliamentary Secretary drew attention to the expense involved in such a consultancy, but I cannot see the sense in the Government complaining of the expense of consultancy advice in this case, when the context in which it is retained is oftentimes enough to make a cat laugh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are getting a lady from Chicago to advise us on public attitudes towards the Irish language.  If we can afford a lady from Chicago, who has never been in Ireland in her life, to instruct us about public attitudes towards the Irish language, surely we can afford a number of museum experts from Germany or Sweden, where they understand such things, to tell us about a museum which contains exhibits of much the same kind as they themselves display.  I am not at all impressed by the argument that it would be a waste of money, but even if I was impressed by it, what the Parliamentary Secretary has said represents a most disappointing retrogression from the position which his own Minister expressed here 18 months ago.  I am sure I speak for the learned bodies represented in the Board of Visitors of the National Museum when I say that they will be very, very disappointed to hear that this point of view, which they have have been pressing for so long, has now been completely brushed aside.  One and a half years ago there was a definite <Col N="1740" /> undertaking that there would be at least one consultant engaged, and we are now merely hearing from the Parliamentary Secretary that at some time in the future it might be worth doing, while he held out no hope that it would in fact happen.  I am sure the RDS and the Academy will be very downcast indeed when they get that news.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch paid a tribute&mdash; from which I do not dissent for a moment&mdash;to the way in which the staffs of the institutions carry out their duties in adverse conditions and with cheerfulness. They are entitled to very great credit for that, but I do not think we are entitled to say, when it is clear that those people are overworked, that every man worth his salt should overwork and therefore they should be made to overwork.  We all know there are people drawing public money&mdash;some of them in this House&mdash;who are not giving a fair day's work for what they are getting. There are thousands of people in this country drawing public money who do not give a proper return for what they are getting.  I do not think it lies in the mouths of public representatives in this House or in the Dáil to say&mdash;I do not mean to attack Senator Cranitch in making this reply because I know he meant it well&mdash;it is good enough for these people that they should overwork because any man worth his salt will do more than he is paid to do.  That does not lie in our mouths to say.  It might lie in the mouth of St. Francis or the Little Sister of the Poor to make comments of that kind but it does not come well from people who are themselves drawing public money and, in a sense, drawing it relatively soft.  I do not intend that, in the slightest way, as an assault on Senator Cranitch, for whom I have great personal regard, but I would not let him or anyone on that side of the House&mdash;or on this side of the House for that matter&mdash;away with the idea that it is satisfactory that professional people should not only work under difficult conditions, but should do more work the more difficult the conditions are.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan mentioned three points in his speech which I wish to refer to briefly.  He spoke of regional museums.  I also spoke of them in my opening speech and I hope that nothing <Col N="1741" /> I said gave him the impression that I was against regional museums.  I said that we need&mdash;and Senator Brosnahan subsequently said this too&mdash;a statement of Department policy.  By a statement I mean an instructed and enlightened statement, a statement made after proper consultation and advice, on general museum policy throughout the whole of Ireland in which the question of regional museums will naturally play a part.  What is happening at present is that the things are springing up in certain towns, through the local development associations or some particularly adventurous or energetic individuals, in districts like Kilkenny or Kinsale for example, which produced museums of their own.  They deserve every credit for that.  However, I am complaining that there is no overall national policy in regard to whether we should centralise our museum resources &mdash;and there may be something to be said for that&mdash;or whether we should distribute them to provincial centres or whether we should try and strike some kind of medium way.  There has been no proper advice sought on that, no proper consultation on it, no policy on it, no philosophy on it.  Everything has been done on a hand-to-mouth basis and that is the chief burden of complaint so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan and other Senators also spoke about the use of museum material in touring around Ireland to back up environmental studies in the schools.  Of course I am in favour of that.  If I were asked if I were in favour of environmental studies, naturally I would say that I was.  But this forms part of what must be a total philosophy about the situation of the museum.  We cannot look at this in a scrappy way and decide: &ldquo;We'll send a few rock samples down to a school, say, in Borrisokane.&rdquo;  This is a district with which the Parliamentary Secretary is familiar in its educational context at the moment.  We cannot send a few rock samples there unless we do it for everybody.  The whole thing should form part of an integrated museum policy of a national kind, made after proper consultation with people who understand such things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> Senator Brugha, in common with other members of his party, is prepared to look at the problem in an objective way.  He said that perhaps one of the reasons why the National Gallery had got a bigger slice of the cake than the other institutions was that it had an independent board of governors.  That may be the reason.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be doing a good day's work if he honoured, in the spirit as well as in the letter, his promise to go back to his Minister and tell him how unanimous the feeling here was that these institutions should be taken away from the Department and vested in some kind of independent control of a kind which would be able to cut through bureaucratic red tape, or would not have it at all.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to mention a couple of matters which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke about.  I am glad that he had the frankness to say that the College of Art premises could not be reconverted for use by the National Library until 1977 at the earliest.  It is far better that we should be given bad news than to be strung along, as some Ministers have done in the past, by saying that there is no problem.  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary was frank enough to say that there was no point in thinking about the College of Art premises as an extension to the National Library for the next six years; though if I could be sure that it would happen in 1977, I should be happy.  At least we are getting somewhere in the technique of government if we have a Parliamentary Secretary who will frankly give bad news and not try to conceal it.  Members who take part in future debates on that subject will be that much wiser.</P>
    <P>However, the main problems that I outlined in my opening speech this morning have not been dealt with.  I had anything but a satisfactory response on the issue of consultation with an outside expert.  We do not appear to have progressed on that front; on the contrary we appear to have retrogressed. In regard to Kilmainham, the Parliamentary Secretary admitted that there had been delay there.  Senator Robinson asked him &ldquo;in what programme?&rdquo; there had been delay.  It is a nice <Col N="1743" /> philosophical point if, when work has come to a total standstill for a year or more, you can speak of delay.  It is like a train which is delayed so long that grass begins to grow around its wheels. Can you speak of the train merely being &ldquo;delayed&rdquo; any longer, or has it ceased to function as a train?  It is a point, with which the Parliamentary Secretary, despite his training in that discipline, did not see fit to deal.  He brushed it aside by simply speaking of it as delay.  We all know that work at Kilmainham has come to a standstill.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also failed to deal, in any shape or form, with my specific question about what had been done to halt deterioration of certain of the museum's collection, and in particular the collection of coaches. I have no particular interest in coaches: they do not excite me one bit.  There are other people in whom they do excite an interest and for that reason they are worth preserving.  I have still to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what has been done in terms of the Minister's positive assurance here 18 months ago that the deterioration would be halted and something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary again to the complaint which I made in my opening speech about the way in which the Board of Visitors of the National Museum have been treated by the Department in being prevented from having an interview with the Minister. I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary give a positive undertaking that the Minister will see these Visitors, and discuss their problems with them. It is outrageous that responsible people who have no axe to grind, and nothing <Col N="1744" /> to gain or lose, should be treated in this way.  It baffles description.  People with a political problem would be in with the Minister in three minutes, or through to him on the telephone in two minutes.  The Board of Visitors of the National Museum cannot have an interview with the Minister for Education because, presumably, it does not suit somebody in that Department to let them at him.</P>

      <P>I should like to conclude by thanking the Parliamentary Secretary and the House for the way in which these motions have been received.  In case the Parliamentary Secretary might think that we are going to let up on the matter, I wish to let him know that today I have put down notices of motion that this House should notice the following two years' reports on both these institutions. Assuming that the leader of the House behaves fairly towards me, as he has on this occasion, we intend to go over all this ground again in the near future. We shall exact the same kind of account from the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary, as we have done today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 20, to delete &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that for the coming financial year it will be possible for committees of agriculture to demand sufficient moneys from the rating authorities to ensure the continuation of their full services.  This amendment was tabled by my colleagues and myself in case this would not be possible under the terms of the present Bill.  It would be disastrous if even one county committee of agriculture found they were unable to continue with the same quality, volume and scope of service they have been giving.</P>
      <P>We must remember that there is an ever-increasing demand on the service by the farmers.  We should be pleased to see this because, looking back 20 years, farmers were not seeking out and getting advice on new techniques and aids to more economic production. Last week I heard two lectures from the World Bank and they left me in no doubt as to the financial position of Irish agriculture.  Neither the commercial banks, nor the ACC will entertain applications for loans or for facilities from farmers unless the farmers have a farm plan.  The drawing up of these farm plans by our advisers are a time-consuming operation and they must be executed in great detail and with great care.  They must take into account the ability and the capacity of the farmers to meet the projections and figures in these plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of service is coming more in demand and will be even more in demand in the years ahead.  No county committee of agriculture is sufficiently staffed to meet this demand.  The Minister is well aware of the relative success of the small farm incentive scheme.  This throws a considerable burden on our advisers and we should like to see this scheme developed to a greater extent.  Yesterday the Minister <Col N="1746" /> quoted figures for some counties, but there must be still one or two counties which have in the current year utilised the maximum demand they could have made on the rating authority.  Despite that, they find themselves extensively in the red with their treasurers.  This is not a desirable situation for such important bodies.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted last evening for Counties Mayo and Kerry by the Minister indicated conclusively that the personnel of these county committees of agriculture have been very responsible and conservative and they did not misappropriate funds.  In both these counties there is an awareness of the difficulty of the ratepaying community to meet the current demands.  These people, in their wisdom, decided not to go to their county councils for the maximum to which they were entitled by law.</P>
    <P>Members of county committees of agriculture are responsible men and the Minister can quite safely raise the ceiling to ensure that for the year ahead no county will find itself in the position of having to curtail its services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not so much blame the Department of Agriculture for some county committees of agriculture being in the red.  In his reply yesterday evening the Minister mentioned two county committees of agriculture which are in the red, namely, Mayo and Kerry.  Senator McDonald stated this evening that this proves that the committees of agriculture were responsible and were prudent and were not making excessive demands on their rating authorities.  I disagree with this because, if they are in the red and are not getting sufficient funds to enable them to keep out of the red, then something is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know, if the Minister has the information, were the agricultural committees' estimates cut by the rating authorities when they were presented to the Mayo and Kerry County Councils?  What I am concerned with here, in trying to amend this figure of 15p to 25p, is to ensure that we will not have amending legislation of this type year after year. If you look at the Bill, it amends <Col N="1747" /> section 2 of the Agriculture (Amendment) Acts of 1958, 1964 and 1970, and we have this amendment again in 1971. The reason for this is that the Department of Agriculture and the Oireachtas have been cheese-paring in allowing only a very small increase.  For example, this is an increase of only 9 old pence, or 4p, in the £ over the figure for 1970.</P>
    <P>There must be a reason why there are committees of agriculture in the red. The reason may be that the county committees of agriculture were inhibited by the Act of 1970, which set the figure of 2s 3d as an adequate one.  As a result, a number of county committees of agriculture throughout the State reached that figure and, as they were not able to demand more from their rating authorities, they found themselves in the red.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised when the Minister gave us the correct figures of what the demand was in the Mayo and Kerry committees of agriculture and we found they had not reached the old figure of 2s 3d.  The Minister and other Senators may think that I am making a case here against the amendment, but the case I want to make for the amendment is that we should have a greater increase on the figure for 1970 than 4p. We should therefore make the figure 25p rather than 15p.  By doing so we will not have the insinuation in future that committees of agriculture are inhibited from seeking greater demands from their local authority because the maximum figure they can seek is so low.  By giving the increase now, it would be a long time before a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would have to come back here with an amending Bill.  While we have this Bill before us the Minister should accept the amendment and thereby spare himself, his officials and the Oireachtas the pains of having to bring in amending legislation in perhaps 12 months or two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  The fact that so many committees of agriculture are in the red is an indication that the ceiling is too low and inadequate.  Senator Nash said here the other day that the fact that <Col N="1748" /> so many committees did not utilise the amount allotted to them was a case against this amendment.  I believe it is a case to support the amendment because it is an indication of the type of people who are on those committees.  Very responsible people are picked from the county councils.  People with a deep interest in agriculture are picked to act on these committees.  The greatest danger at the moment existing in rural Ireland is that the committees of agriculture are about to be abolished. This uneasiness was not removed by the Minister's speech in the Dáil when he referred to it as a temporary measure which would be reviewed.  That could have a dangerous effect on the small farm schemes: many farmers would not be inclined to get involved in such schemes because of the danger that the schemes might be abolished.  In 1971, when we hear so much about our entry into the Common Market, I do not think it is right to have a ceiling. Those are the only committees I know of, with the exception of the vocational education committees, which have a ceiling.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  I should like to point out to the House what strikes me as the paradox in the arguments of Senator W. O'Brien and Senator McDonald.  Each in turn says that members of committees of agriculture are very responsible people and they have demonstrated their responsibility by not reaching the permissible ceiling which was allowed them.  This is one half of the argument. The other half, which in my opinion does not match the first part, is that in the case of certain committees who have not done their housekeeping, for reasons which may or may not be within their control, and who at any rate find themselves in the red, the ceiling should now be raised.  At the same time they say these men, being prudent, did not incur all the expenditure they might have done under the ceilings which existed.  There seems to be a paradox there that I cannot resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator J. Fitzgerald said that this amendment ought to be accepted on the grounds that, if it is not, it will be a <Col N="1749" /> recurring thing.  He suggested there was cheese-paring involved and that the action of committees was in some way inhibited.  I was at pains to point out, both to the Dáil and to this House, that the measures we are contemplating are of an interim nature.  It is the intention of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to reorganise the advisory services on the lines that I touched on when I spoke on the Second Reading. Since that is the case, we would hope that this measure before the House would be of very brief duration.  The shorter the better.</P>
    <P>There is no ground for Senators to be concerned about the curtailment or withdrawal of any service.  The contrary is the case.  With the new farm development service I would hope that a far better service would be provided than the one provided by committees of agriculture in the past.  I do not mean this to be a criticism of the work the committees have done.  Within the machinery available to them, committees and their staffs have done a very great service indeed to the farming community and to the country generally. It is well that this be recognised.</P>
    <P>The inescapable facts of the matter are that only a comparatively small number of committees find themselves in any serious difficulties and the Bill, as it stands, should enable these committees to get out of their difficulties if not in one year then in a very short number of years.  Nobody need contemplate a curtailment of services.  This is not contemplated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  There is no necessity for this.  The statistical information that is available to us about the financial positions of the various committees bear this out, especially the committees in the western part of the country where three-quarters of the Bill is met by the Department.</P>
    <P>I realise of course the acute necessity there is in that particular area of the country for a specialised and highly-efficient development service.  That was why we were talking about an interim measure, a short-term measure to tide the committees over this particular period until the service we now know is replaced by one that is accepted by the farming community as being better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> We would hope to have a full and better discussion of that in due course, fairly soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said last evening about two committees, but I am still worried because I am quite certain there are a couple of committees which have made the maximum demand for the past financial year but who still find themselves in the red.  Now, what hope have these committees of paying their way in the coming year and, in addition, paying back the backlog?  There is no machinery I know of by which these committees can actually meet their obligations, other than to reduce their schemes. Surely, in 1970, when we are on the threshold of the Common Market, this is not the way to approach this problem?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to my statement that county committees were not spendthrifts and that they took their responsibilities quite seriously.  The only point I was making was that, even if the Minister raises the ceiling, it does not automatically follow that every county committee of agriculture will go up to the ceiling.</P>
      <P>The Minister must have on the list before him at least three counties which have been on the maximum demand this year, are presently in the red and have no hope of continuing their present scheme if the bank manager decides otherwise.  This is a serious situation for such an important statutory committee. I would appeal to the Minister to have a careful look at this matter.</P>
      <P>The 75 per cent contribution by the Minister and his Department to the twelve western counties represents Government policy.  We cannot say they are very generous in this regard.  It is part of Government policy to give this type of aid and to follow through with pilot scheme in that area.  This was a pilot scheme.  According to Dr. Scully, I do not think it has proved to be that successful&mdash;something which surprised me very much.  I want to emphasise that this is a Government policy and that these counties are entitled to a trial run at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says this is a short-term measure.  I do not mind it being a short-term measure if the measure itself is <Col N="1751" /> adequate.  My information is that it is not adequate and that committees are going to find themselves inadequately financed for the foreseeable future or until the end of their existence.  This seems to be the underlying fear.  I take it from what the Minister has said that we will have the opportunity of discussing his proposals in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument on this unless he can assure me that, with the proposed ceiling of 15p, every committee will be able to meet their commitments without reducing their schemes in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this, which Senators who are not members of agriculture committees may not realise is this: we have in the county committees of agriculture this deplorable situation whereby a very high percentage of the instructors are temporary and are, as a result, on the minimum scale of salary. If the Appointments Commission, who appear to operate more slowly as the years pass, decided in the morning to make all these instructors permanent, the salary bills for the committees would shoot up dramatically.  This is something the Minister has not taken note of. I think it is, to a large extent, responsible for so many committees being in a reasonable and satisfactory financial state at the present time.  I know that, in my own committee, if all the members of our staff were appointed permanently &mdash;something we have been advocating there for years&mdash;we would not have a credit balance at the end of the present financial year.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, therefore, to give me an assurance that the figure he has in the Bill will ensure that every county committee of agriculture which avail of the maximum allowed will be able to pay their way in the current financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed to hear the Minister say that he was not prepared to accept this amendment or to amend the figure in any way.  His reason appeared to be that the advisory services are about to be reorganised and that this is only an interim measure.  He indicated that the <Col N="1752" /> reorganisation is going to take place sooner than we anticipate.  If that is so, then it must be going to take place very, very quickly.  It appears there is going to be very little consultation before this becomes a <i>fait accompli</i>.  If the Minister were to accept this amendment and increase the figure to 25p, it would not in any way inhibit the reorganisation of the advisory services.</P>
      <P>The 4p local authorities will be allowed to provide in the coming estimate will not go very far towards bridging the gap in the case of those committees who are on their maximum but who find themselves in the red.  It may enable them to provide a better service and keep out of the red, but will it enable them to pay off the money and the overdrafts that they now owe?  I presume the Minister and his officials have the figures and that he knows they will be enabled to do that.</P>
      <P>On many occasions, when previous Ministers brought in similar measures we were told that it was an interim measure and that certain revisions were about to take place.  We have had interim measure after interim measure and yet we seem to have no revision of any kind taking place. Perhaps&mdash;and I am prepared to take the Minister's word for this&mdash;this reorganisation and revision of the advisory services is now about to take place before the end of the coming financial year.  If that is so perhaps we, as committees of agriculture, will not exist any longer and our ratepayers will no longer be responsible for servicing the advisory services within their council areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned&mdash;I took note of the phrase last night&mdash;that they would &ldquo;pick up the tag&rdquo; of 75 per cent for the 12 underdeveloped counties.  I should like to remind him that on my Second Reading speech I referred to the fact that the Department does not pick up the tag for the 50 per cent in a number of other counties.  I gave the figures for my own county already.  I should be glad if the Minister would give us the reason why the tag for the full 50 per cent is not picked up by the Department for the Meath County Committee of Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few small points to add to what has already been said.  I should like to support the amendment although I do not think the amendment, taken at its face value, will do any more than help the few counties that are in the red.  When I spoke here yesterday evening I spoke without the full knowledge of the facts because, for reasons which would be of no interest to this House, I was not returned to the committee of agriculture after the last election.  However, I wish to impress on the Minister that in some counties there is a financial deficit but in Mayo, due to the fact that it is the highest rated county in Ireland, we have a deficit in work and in the usage of the facilities provided by the committee of agriculture. It is a far greater deficit not to be able to provide services than a deficit in hard cash.  That is the reason why I tried to impress upon the Minister that in the designated 12 counties, where he is paying 75 per cent in grants to offset charges incurred purely in the employment of additional instructors, he should give that blanket coverage to the services as a whole.  If this happens&mdash; and I see no other way of increasing services in counties such as my own county and providing the instruction that will be far more necessary in the conditions we will face within the EEC &mdash;it will result in a great improvement in the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should look kindly on the various counties that are already covered in order to ensure that, in view of the tremendous burden of rates which they bear&mdash;£7.10 in the £ in Mayo&mdash; they will not be denied the services they so vitally need.  You cannot have second-class farmers in certain counties as compared with the richer counties.  In County Meath if you put 1p in the £ on rates it would bring in over £2,500.  In Mayo the same sum would bring in £1,500 and in Leitrim £600.  It was mentioned here last evening that urban dwellers have to pay.  The urban dwellers do not pay those rates but people living in small towns have to pay it.  Those people have never cribbed about paying it even though it is to provide services for a class of people other than themselves. On the other hand, as I pointed out last night, farmers have been <Col N="1754" /> providing facilities for town dwellers, such as footpaths, lights, libraries and so forth.  Even though this is an interim arrangement, I would ask the Minister to ensure that he gives the 75 per cent grant to all counties designated under the order so as to ensure that they can carry on their services at the highest possible rate.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in the background of this debate there is the feeling that changes are about to take place, but nobody knows anything about those changes.  The representatives of the farmers here are entitled to know well ahead of time exactly what is in the Minister's mind and in the mind of the Government.  Changes in structure, necessary though they may be, will need long debate and we all wish to have the type of agreement that the Department, the Government, the farmers and the economy as a whole will welcome.  Without undue delay the Minister should outline what proposals are envisaged so that they can be fully debated and so that we will not have a collision course between the farmers and the Oireachtas.  I should like the Minister to think seriously about this matter so that full information can be given to us well ahead of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the exercise of ordinary prudence on the part of any committee, even the committees under the most severe strain, should ensure that they will be in a happier position within a short period.  Senator Jack Fitzgerald mentioned that there had been very little consultation in the review of the services that must precede its replacement by a new and, we hope, a better one.  I want to assure the House that before any such change is made full consultation will be made with the farming organisations and with all interested parties.  Senator Lyons is quite right in saying that people should be kept fully informed of what is proposed.  Naturally, they will be fully informed of what is proposed by way of improvements in the advisory services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet got from the House any acceptable argument for the raising of the ceiling higher than the 15p set out in the Bill.  The likelihood of the withdrawal or of any diminution of the <Col N="1755" /> services provided by committees, in the light of what Senators have told me about the prudence of the committees who operate them, is very small.  No such diminution of services is contemplated. It would be necessary for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to take a very hard look at the situation if any such a diminution of services were to be contemplated, and I am certain the Department will do this. I do not think there need be any anxiety on the part of Senators on this score. The services, as they are being provided, will be maintained.</P>

      <P>A relevant factor in this is the performance of individual committees, not only this year but in the years which have led up to it.  Some of these deficits are the cumulative result of overprudent housekeeping on the part of county councils or the committees themselves.  I do not know whether the detailed information sought by the Senator would be relevant.  In the list before me one of the counties in my own constituency&mdash;Carlow&mdash;is at the maximum and they have a deficit of £3,828.  Donegal have a small deficit but they are a good deal under the 27d. ceiling; they are at 17.89d.  We have spoken about Kerry, Kildare have a relatively small deficit of £4,847. Leitrim have a very negligible deficit of £338.  Louth have a deficit of £1,500; Offaly have a deficit of £6,500.

      <P>Sligo have a deficit of £5,000; Tipperary North Riding <Col N="1756" /> £10,000; Waterford, £2,479; and Wicklow, £555.  Does that meet the Senator's requirements?</P>

      <P>In the case of Offaly, what hope have they of clearing that? I assume they have 9 per cent interest to pay also.  This will tend to run down the advisory service in an important county.  The Minister, I am sure, appreciates the fact that quite a number of farmers in Offaly were badly affected by the Erin Foods failure this year and had produce left on their hands.  We really need an increased advisory service there.  It is unfair to the members of the committee.  Would the Minister like to give the House an assurance that his Department will pay off these arrears by some means other than by the 50 per cent grants?</P>

      <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the case of County Offaly with a deficit of £6,500.  With an increase from 27d. to 36d., even in ignorance of the product of a penny in the rates in County Offaly, I should think that with any kind of prudent housekeeping on the part of the Offaly committee their deficit should be eliminated in a short time.</P>
