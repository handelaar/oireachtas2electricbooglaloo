      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to the grant of incremental credit for previous experience to married nurses who accept temporary appointments in local health authority institutions.</P>
      <P>Heretofore, a married temporary nurse was conditioned to enter the salary scale at the minimum following which she could proceed by annual increments to the maximum.  However, earlier this month, following consultation between my officers and the county managers, I intimated that my sanction would be forthcoming to the grant of incremental credit to married nurses, other than psychiatric nurses on the following basis:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit, up to a maximum of five increments, for previous post-graduate experience in a recognised hospital, <Col N="1036" /> and the payment of annual increments thereafter.  The concession may apply to married nurses already employed in a temporary capacity, provided that it will not place a nurse beyond the fifth incremental point.  A married nurse who has received incremental credit under this arrangement and who is obliged to break her service for a short period owing to domestic reasons may be re-employed at the salary which she had immediately prior to the break in her temporary service.</P>
    <P>The effect of this sanction, which may be implemented with effect as from 1st July, 1969, is to give married nurses in temporary employment the same incremental advantages as their permanent colleagues&mdash;with added concessions should their service be interrupted for domestic reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins  Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Timmins</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will arrange for the setting up of a proper staff structure for those who specialise in geriatric nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the question relates to nurses engaged in geriatric nursing in hospitals.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any reasons why a separate staffing structure should be devised for geriatric nurses.  If the Deputies have in mind that the numbers of posts in particular hospitals are inadequate I shall be glad to consider any proposals received from the appropriate health authorities whose responsibility it is, in the first instance, to consider whether existing arrangements are satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the matter of promotion, candidates who have overall general nursing training are more liable to get promotion than those who have concentrated on specialised geriatric nursing?  Does the Minister consider that a satisfactory situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a rather complicated position and it would be difficult to describe it in detail.  The usual staffing in hospitals run by religious orders is matron, assistant matron, <Col N="1037" /> ward sisters and staff nurses.  The matrons usually are members of religious orders and until recent years there was no supervisory staff other than assistants to the matron.  This position has been changing and in some county homes there are posts of ward sisters, appointed, agreed and sanctioned.  It is a mixed picture.  I would hope the local authorities would do their best to deal with the matter in the most appropriate way in order, where possible, to provide the kind of promotions the Deputy has in mind and at the same time to bear in mind the existing structures in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to take a special look at this because of the great difficulty there is in finding geriatric nurses?  As the Minister knows, this is a type of nursing which is unattractive in many ways and it is extremely difficult to get nurses to do it continuously.  If nurses are to lose out further in the matter of promotion, surely there is something wrong in the whole structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know that in St. Kevin's and St. Mary's Dublin, and, indeed, in St. Finbarr's in Cork and the city home and hospital in Limerick the staff nurses are supervised by ward sisters and assistant matrons and that to that limited degree there are promotion opportunities.  Local health authorities are now able to pay additional increments to nurses who look after a geriatric cases.  That has also been agreed. I think it is £80 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is the awarding of marks in deciding promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, to enable public health nurses to get the leisure to which they are entitled, he will appoint a mobile nurse to cover several districts to enable such public health nurses to have periods off duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of public health nurses in a particular area is primarily a matter for the health authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that the appointment of substitutes is a necessary part of the <Col N="1038" /> local arrangements made in order that public health nurses may have reasonable off-duty hours, apart from periods of annual and other leave.</P>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will consider the advisability of appointing a night sister for the larger operating centres in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is primarily a matter for individual health authorities to determine the nursing staff required for their hospitals.  I am not opposed in principle to the appointment of night supervisory staff.  I have already approved any proposals submitted by health authorities to create posts of night superintendent for large general hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that tutor nurses who transfer from voluntary hospitals to local authority hospitals are placed at the bottom scale in spite of any period of seniority they may have had in the voluntary hospitals; and if he proposes to take any action to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Standard practice in the local health authority service is that an officer who accepts an appointment enters the appropriate salary scale at the minimum and then proceeds by annual increments, subject, of course, to satisfactory service, to the maximum. The terms and conditions of appointment are published in advance of the competition for any particular post.</P>
      <P>A departure from the standard practice has been authorised, in response to recruitment difficulties in certain areas, for the basic grade of staff nurse who may now enter the salary scale with the benefit of up to five increments in respect of previous experience.  Since there is no recruitment problem as respects senior nursing posts a similar concession is not warranted at the present time, but I will keep the matter under review.</P>

There is no waiting list for such persons in Laois, and in Offaly there is only one person on the waiting list.  My Department has been for some time endeavouring to procure suitable institutional accommodation for this person alternative to the accommodation in which she is at present but without success so far.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to a recent question, the overall maternity accommodation in Dublin has been adequate to meet the needs of the situation, although the unequal incidence of demand has put pressure on some hospitals.  This pressure has arisen, for example, in the Rotunda Hospital while, at the same time, there have been on average during 1969 about 38 vacant beds in the maternity unit of St. Kevin's Hospital.  I am, however, keeping the position under constant review and if developments are such that additional beds are needed, I shall give special considerations to their location so as to ensure that the most efficient service is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received complaints from people who are unable to obtain hospital facilities in the city of Dublin for maternity purposes. Surely, with the expanding population in Ballyfermot, Finglas, Coolock and other such areas, there must be a need for a maternity hospital in that area?  There is no maternity hospital there except small nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are keeping the positions under review.  Between 1964 and 1968 the total number of births in the Dublin city area did not increase. Then there was a rather surprising increase in 1969.  We are looking again at the future requirements. It is quite essential, in my view, that the vacant beds in the first-class maternity unit of St. Kevin's Hospital should fully be occupied.  At the same time, we are looking at the position in the Rotunda in regard to some pre-natal beds and some improvements in the Rotunda generally.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of investigations in Britain which disclosed serious danger to health from an occasionally fatal form of food poisoning known as salmonella if frozen chickens are cooked without being thawed out for at least eight hours; and that eight people died in Liverpool in 1968 as a result of eating chickens infected with salmonella; and, if so, if <Col N="1042" /> he intends to compel vendors of frozen chickens to affix a label advising purchasers of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report of investigations into an outbreak of salmonellosis in Liverpool in 1968 caused by the consumption of portioned cooked chickens.  These chickens which were spit-roasted, had not been adequately thawed out after removal from deep freeze and before cooking and, according to the report, were subsequently handled under unhygienic conditions.  I think the Deputy was misinformed on the question of deaths. My information is that there were no deaths in Liverpool in 1968 as a result of persons eating chickens infested with salmonella.</P>
      <P>I have had the public health aspects of this problem under consideration and and I am awaiting further information about some scientific aspects of the matter.  When this comes to hand, I shall decide, after consultation with the appropriate interests, the action which should be taken.  One of the points which will be considered will be the measures necessary to alert the catering trade and consumers generally as to the precautions to be taken in thawing-out and cooking deep-freeze chickens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is of interest whether or not it would be proper for the Minister to give grants and loans to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to provide more fishing vessels in that area if there is a factory there not getting its full tonnage of fish out of which to manufacture fishmeal?  The report of the Minister's consultants in Denmark said there was 40 years supply of sprats in the Irish Sea from which to manufacture fishmeal.  Surely this is a political matter and something the Minister should consider.  I put down the question because I want to find out whether there should be more grants and loans for boats; we have the fishermen.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary let us know if the Minister will provide more grants and loans for boats in the Clogherhead area?</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider it is good economics to fish only for catches for fishmeal, and is he aware of the fact that sprats at the moment are fetching £100 per ton in Hamburg, whereas we are only getting in the neighbourhood of £10 per ton for them for fishmeal? In view of that and because of the general scarcity of fish would he ensure that only immature fish and fish offal are used in these factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the boats <Col N="1052" /> working there at the moment are getting full and satisfactory catches or is there a shortage of fish or a shortage of landing craft?  Before this industry got a grant there was ample evidence from Bord Iascaigh Mhara that there was an ample supply of both sprat and sand eel in that general area to keep an industry of that kind going.</P>

The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Childers, told us that an agreement had been made for the payment of £7,000 annually&mdash;if my recollection is correct&mdash;and that that payment, together with the payment of rates, which every citizen has to make, are the only payments falling on the Gulf Oil Company at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not have regard to the fact that there is a depth of water there which will allow these ships to bring their full tonnage and that nowhere else in the world, except Kuwait, is that depth of water available and that Gulf Oil at Kuwait had to put the biggest underwater pipeline in the world ten miles out at sea to get that facility?  Does he think that we as a nation should give that facility, not 300 yards out at sea for nothing when, in fact, the ordinary tonnage and port dues, as given in reply to my Question No. 14, on Thursday, 21st November, 1968, would indicate an income for a harbour authority there of £1 million a year and, even if we gave one half of it back because of transhipment, it would be £½ million a year?  Surely the Minister would say that that facility of that depth of water is worth something to this nation, as he admitted to me on the Estimate only a little while ago?  I feel very strongly and would ask the Minister, please, to look at it, realising that if he goes back on the debate of 21st November he will find clear evidence that Gulf Oil in their own magazine, by their own statement, indicated that they had no objection to paying port and tonnage dues and no objection to the establishment of a harbour authority.  I do not want to hold up the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet excess expenditure on certain subheads of the Vote which could not be foreseen when the original Estimate was framed.</P>
      <P>A sum of £114,650 was provided under subhead A to meet the cost of technical advisers, representatives abroad and other personnel of the Industrial Development Authority.  Due to the expansion of the authority this amount has proved insufficient and a further £16,250 is now required.  The balance of the £20,000 provided in the Supplementary Estimate is made up of an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment of £3,750 paid to the estate of a former member of the Fair Trade Commission.  The excess on subhead B.2 arises from the expansion of the Industrial Development Authority and the necessity to acquire additional premises to accommodate the extra staff with consequent increases in expenditure on telephones <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>In the case of subhead C&mdash;Advertising and Publicity&mdash;the sum of £4,170 provided in the Book of Estimates has proved to be inadequate.  Expenditure to date has exceeded £6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for 1969-70 was reduced in the expectation that advertising under the Mineral Development Acts would be lower than in the previous <Col N="1075" /> year.  This reduction did not materialise and in addition advertising in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts has been greater than anticipated.</P>
    <P>The total amount provided under subhead J for An Foras Tionscal for 1969-70 was £12,000,000.  Expenditure to 31st January, 1970, came to £11,180,000.  It is anticipated that expenditure up to 31st March, 1970, will reach £15,000,000.  The increased expenditure is due in the first place to the inherent difficulties in the framing of estimates of annual expenditure by An Foras Tionscal.  These difficulties derive from various circumstances in the timing of claims for payment of grants and the number and size of projects which may be approved for grants in any particular period.  In the current financial year An Foras Tionscal is faced with exceptionally heavy outlay in respect of a number of large new industries for which substantial grants were approved.  In addition, expenditure on the industrial estates at Galway and Waterford has accelerated because of the increasing number of applicants for accommodation in these estates coupled with an increase in building costs.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on technical assistance under subhead M has been greater than anticipated.  It is expected that a further £100,000 will be required to discharge claims which are likely to be lodged before 31st March, 1970.  The technical assistance scheme is designed to encourage and assist firms to improve the efficiency of their organisations. Under the scheme grants are available towards the cost of engaging consultants to advise on the improvement of efficiency in production and distribution.  Grants are also available towards the cost of visits abroad by representatives of firms to study aspects of industrial and distributive organisation.</P>
    <P>The national productivity year which was inaugurated by the Taoiseach in November, 1968, is organised and run by the Irish National Productivity Committee.  The Government approved expenditure of £92,000 towards the running costs.  A provision of £51,000 was made in <Col N="1076" /> respect of 1968-69 and £41,000 for 1969-70.  As a result of the unavoidable deferment of the opening date, expenditure in 1968-69 amounted to £28,000 only and the balance of £23,000 has been carried over into the year 1969-70.  Provision in the Book of Estimates for 1969-70 was £41,000 so that a Supplementary Estimate for £23,000 is necessary.  In the broadest terms the programme&mdash;or the Move Campaign as it is popularly known now&mdash;is promotional and directed at two different audiences: the decision makers, comprising 4 per cent approximately of the population, and the rest of the community.  The purpose of the campaign is not to set up new structures to influence the decision makers; rather it is to supplement and support the organisations and services which already exist.</P>
    <P>The provision for receipts arising from the Minerals Development Acts under subhead U4 was shown in the Book of Estimates at £416,000.  These receipts are likely to fall short by about £47,000 due to unexpected setbacks arising from labour and operational difficulties.</P>
    <P>The gross amount required in this Supplementary Estimate is £3,201,000. There is an offsetting saving of £80,000 on the provision for shipbuilding subsidy under subhead P.1 which brings the net requirements to £3,121,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that this year our discussion of industrial affairs was unsatisfactory because we had a whole series of bits and pieces.  We had extremely important bits and pieces such as the Industrial Grants Bill and now this Supplementary Estimate, but it would have been far better if it had been possible to discuss the whole framework of industry at one time. However, the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate gives us an opportunity to discuss the various facets involved here and also our present situation so far as Industry and Commerce is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely referring to the unsatisfactory nature of the matter.  However, whether or not it is unsatisfactory we can discuss what is in the Vote before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Foras Tionscal grants I should like to make the point that we are now merging Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority and, of course, we on this side of the House believe that this is not sufficient and that, in fact, we should have merged Córas Tráchtála and the other industrial organisations into one body, one governing body, one administrative body, which would mean that industrialists who were applying for grants such as we are now voting supplementary money for would not have the irritating experience of having to jump several hurdles, of having to go to the Industrial Development Authority, to Foras Tionscal, to the Industrial Credit Company and set up a whole complex application, each particular facet of which must fit into a matching grove in some other State organisation, <Col N="1078" /> before they got to the stage of enjoying a grant or enjoying the other facilities they might wish to apply for, such as industrial credit from the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>I believe that duplication could be very easily avoided and that work could be done much faster if the policy of the Fine Gael Party, namely, the regrouping of all the numerous State services into one industrial development corporation, were put into effect. It has not been put into effect.  We on this side of the House have no objection at all to the voting of this money for Foras Tionscal.  We merely want to make the point at this stage that we feel it would lead to greater efficiency if all the numerous State agencies were grouped in one body.</P>
    <P>Having made that point in relation to the policy of my party, I should now like to discuss the question of re-equipment grants for which portion of this money is being voted in subhead J.  The up-to-date position, as I have ascertained from the Minister by Parliamentary question, is that when we passed the Industrial Grants Bill it went to the Seanad at Christmas and the Seanad complained, very volubly, I understand, about being rushed into passing this legislation.  Yet, according to the Minister, we are still not in a position to pay out re-equipment grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Adaptation grants, perhaps, but not re-equipment grants. As I told the Deputy the other day, I think it is expected that payment will be made in about two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, and if we are not voting money for re-equipment grants, the Minister is spared my criticism until a later occasion.  I must stay in order.  It appears to me that this Supplementary Estimate is quite vague then, because there is no information available to a Deputy here that re-equipment grants are not being dealt with.  In fact, before the setting <Col N="1079" /> up of re-equipment grants, because of the activities of the Opposition on this side of the House who sought to have them established, adaptation grants and new factory grants were always grouped under the one heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <P>I am afraid the position is that there was a great difference, a difference which did not suit Irish industry at all.  We succeeded in convincing the Minister that there should not be global disqualification of certain industries, as was the case under adaptation grants, and that we were not tied entirely to export industries because the defence of jobs was just as important as the creation of new ones, and the defence of jobs which did not involve the production of goods for export in freer trade conditions was important because there could be a very serious loss of employment if something was not done about it.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to discuss the question of the small industries grant now.  In my work as a Deputy I have found that what happened in the case of the adaptation grants is now happening in the case of the small industries grants.  A firm which went into the cabinet-making business is now employing 18 people instead of the one employee with which it started off and, because it is now employing 18 people, it is disqualified. I do not know why.  The employer was merely told he could not get a small industries grant because he was in competition with others, and so on and so forth.  I do not think it is good policy that there should be a recurrence of what happened in the case of the adaptation grants.  There was a long history.  A bakery could not get an adaptation grant.  A laundry could not get one.  Now, in the case of the small industries grants, a cabinet maker cannot get a grant.  How many more global disqualifications are there?  How many more agitations will we have to carry on to get someone who is disqualified into the category of being, at least, able to apply?  Small industries giving employment and creating new jobs should get their grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is legitimate to discuss the degree of failure in regard to grants.  The Minister indicated on the Industrial Grants Bill that the number of failures was 10 per cent initially but, by getting some other industry to take over, the <Col N="1081" /> failure rate was reduced to 4 per cent. No one relishes naming particular industries here and I, for one, have always eschewed doing so.  It is true, however, that in some cases where the failure rate of 10 per cent was converted into a failure rate of 4 per cent by the installation of another firm the second occupant was not nearly as important as the first from the point of view of the economy and the employment potential.  The Minister, the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal have to compromise but one can pay too high a price for compromise from the point of view of the economy and the employment capacity. In one particular instance the initial applicant would have employed male labour in the order of 400 or 500 men. The occupant who succeeded him employed girls exclusively and that in a town where female labour was quite scarce.  That sort of thing militates against the Minister's statistic and the end result is not as good as it might appear to be at first sight.</P>
    <P>We have then the case of Potez. Potez is a household name now.  The four walls still stand.  The position is highly unsatisfactory.  I understand the Minister cannot take over the property. It would appear to me that the grant was not properly applied in this case. Sufficient safeguards were not demanded. I think some stricture should be written in so that assets would be available should production not commence or cease within a certain period. No stricture was applied in the case of Potez obviously and so the debacle goes on.  I am sure the Minister and his predecessor tried to get some way out of this and I hope the efforts will continue and a way out will be found. What is done is done.  There is no point in trying to make political points out of this now.</P>
    <P>I believe the failure rate is higher than the Minister's statistic.  I believe it is more unsatisfactory than the Minister's statistic would seem to prove. This is a position that could be improved by a change in the approach to the giving of grants.  There is necessity for a closer appraisal than that carried out in either the Devlin or the Buchanan reports.  When large grants <Col N="1082" /> are in question there should be a most detailed appraisal of the infra-structure of the situation so that we will know exactly where to establish the industry and what the manpower potential of the areas is.</P>
    <P>Entry into the EEC is important in this respect.  Grants should not be given to industries which might be less than viable in the EEC conditions. Employment must be long term if a grant is to be justified.  Permanency of employment is most important from the point of view of risk capital and we must bear in mind at all times the likely changes which may occur on our entry into the EEC.  There are two figures I should like to give the House, figures indicating our weakness as far as the manipulation of our own affairs is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have employed in industry here 200,000 people, or 18 per cent of our labour force.  In Britain 38 per cent of the labour force are employed in industry. We have here a tariff and duty situation which gave us a sort of Shangri-La.  It was possible for people to negotiate wage demands in industry, not on the basis of what the community could afford but on the basis of what they could force their employer to give. He, in turn, duly applied for a higher level of tariff or a lower degree of quota on the goods which were competing with him from abroad, paid his workers and we all lived in a well-insulated, warm atmosphere.</P>
    <P>That will no longer be the case when we go into the EEC.  A very doctrinaire socialist&mdash;the Right Hon.  Barbara Castle&mdash;produced in Britain, with direct regard to Britain's industrial situation if they went into the EEC, a prices and incomes policy which did not succeed.  It only partially succeeded.  In Britain where they could not even dream of applying for membership of the EEC there was a change over to a situation whereby, apparently, as far as industry, the balance of payments and everything else are concerned they have achieved at least a position in which they can apply.  We here were insulated against that sort of exercise but we are no longer insulated because our industry will be subject to the full blast of British competition in 1975.</P>
    <P>It is far tougher than that because it <Col N="1083" /> is quite clear that as tariffs are reduced a stage is reached where they do not matter any more and, again, there is a question of dumping.  When goods produced here are sold the end cost includes many factors such as advertising, transport and many other costs and when proof is needed as to whether or not there is dumping this is particularly difficult.  Therefore, in a situation in which there is a tariff of 10 per cent or 15 per cent on some commodities, our industrialists here will face a very severe blast of competition in 1971 and 1972.  In such a situation we have got to examine our whole industrial structure and ensure that our industry prospers and that more jobs are provided.  Only 4 per cent of the work force in Great Britain are engaged in agriculture. With their cheap food policy for the industrial worker it paid off to subsidise those people to bring up their incomes to something comparable to the industrial worker.</P>
    <P>That meant that we had to export to Great Britain our butter at very much lower than cost price.  When that changes and when the Common Market agricultural policy is applied to Britain, even though they will get some years to adjust themselves, our food prices will go up but not as much as in Britain because we were not insulated by the Queen's subsidies to farmers.</P>
    <P>Our costs over the years went up more than Britain's.  In 1963, for instance, Britain had an increase in costs of general consumer items of about 1¾ per cent.  Ours was 2½ per cent but by the time we reached 1970 our annual increase was about 5½ per cent, whereas in Britain the increase was only 2¾ per cent.  Industrially this could not be a worse situation for us at the moment because it means that our workers are all demanding more pay because they find it more difficult to live and this means that the cost of our goods in competition with British goods is at a disadvantage.  However, let us look at what will happen when Britain enters the Common Market.  Various pundits are putting the increased figure at anything from <Col N="1084" /> as high as 30 per cent to as low as 18 per cent.  When food prices increase 25 per cent it is estimated and accepted in a British White Paper issued last week that there will be a wage increase of around £5 a week.  The very best industrial situation for us would be if our industrial worker had fewer pound notes than the British industrial worker but was living better.</P>
    <P>The tide has being going against us in that regard over the years, due principally to the cheap food policy in Britain, but the tide now could change and the reality of the Common Market could lead to the removal of the disadvantage under which industry now suffers.</P>
    <P>One must consider where we are going at the moment as far as remaining competitive in the export of our goods is concerned.  The Taoiseach indicated, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply to questions last week clarified, that the sort of income increase that could be afforded in this country this year was 7 per cent or 30s a week, whichever was the greater.  Now we have awards of 23 per cent in the case of paint workers and awards of that order are not uncommon at the moment.  This means a weakening of our competitive strength and a situation in which the export of our goods becomes less significant.</P>
    <P>We may as well face the truth about this matter.  Price control, as applied by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this regard, has not worked and I believe it is impossible for it to work.  I should like to instance one experience I had of a businessman, well known to you all, whose name shall not be mentioned, who told the story about price control and when you had to buy eggs from the ladies of the parish because nobody else would buy them.  You always suffered quite a severe loss on the purchase of those eggs but you could not pay them any less because they would not accept any less.  It was the same with tea. When matters became so bad that you could not tolerate it any more you reduced the quality of the tea and charged the same for it.  That was in the days when all the shops in Ireland <Col N="1085" /> mixed and blended the tea themselves. This is the story of a good, decent businessman who had to face up to realities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just a fact of life.  This happened.  We are now in a situation in which our competitive position has been harmed by a consumer price index which, let us face it, is incorrectly compiled.  The consumer price index has two facets to it which most of us who have been here for a long time know all about.  You have a list of goods and then you have got the amount the ordinary family uses. Deputy Cosgrave puts down a question every three months on the consumer price index, which appears in the Official Report, and which is very useful to us to see what way the cat is jumping.  When you look at it you see in the list of goods various items which when they were compiled many years ago were in common use and now are not.  The fact is that the increase in the cost of living for the ordinary person has been far greater, based on his ordinary pattern of consumption over the range of goods desired than any figure in the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>This is something again which in relation to those grants will be a disincentive as far as our competitiveness is concerned.  I do not want to go into a general debate on this matter but we are voting a large sum in grants and, therefore, we have got to look at whether or not such sum will bring the reward we need.  Of course, it is quite true that when we go into the Common Market there will be advantages as well as disadvantages.  While the cost of food may go up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There will be competition for our existing factories and motor assemblers.</P>
      <P>On the subject of advertising and publicity, we, on this side of the House, accept the Minister's explanation that there is need for the supplementary grant.  The Minister has given us the reason for it, namely, that there was more expenditure on advertising under the Mineral Development Acts than was estimated.  This was done to allow objections to be lodged.  We are not worried about the situation in regard to technical assistance.  Such assistance is absolutely necessary and will bring our industry up to the necessary degree of efficiency.</P>

    <P>The Minister inaugurated National Productivity Year in November, 1968. This has been a reasonable success.  At the time, with a general election in June, 1969, I was suspicious of the motives behind this move.  It might have been considered a good thing to <Col N="1087" /> have us all very interested in the promotion of Irish industry and working hard to expand such industries, while at the same time allowing ourselves to believe that the Fianna Fáil Party were somewhere at the back of it.

      <P>Present company excluded, I would attribute very base motives to the Government.  It did not really matter whether or not it was an election year.  It was a good exercise to go out to try to sell Irish productivity and expansion of industry. We on this side of the House have no objection to the subhead referred to.</P>
      <P>Coming now to the offsetting saving we have on the shipbuilding subsidy, I wish to say that we all have a very great interest in the maintenance of Verolme shipyard in Cork.  The interest arises from Votes here from time to time of large sums in subsidies for shipbuilding.  All over the world similar assistance was being given.  We either had to let the industry die or follow the pattern.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the present position at Verolme dockyard.  I am aware that this is an Appropriation-in-Aid and that there is a saving of over £80,000. In order to help the people employed at Verolme we would like to understand the present position there.  The Verolme company in Holland has been aided by an older shipbuilding company with the intervention of the Dutch Government.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with what Deputy Donegan has just said.  It is unsatisfactory that, through no fault of the Minister, we have not had an opportunity of discussing the departmental Estimates of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They have been coming up piecemeal on very important matters such as the IDA and again we have this Supplementary Estimate this afternoon.  We cannot discuss at great length the general policy lines of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There is important work elsewhere in the city which could have an important bearing on policy here at some future date.</P>
      <P>On page 2 of the Minister's speech in relation to An Foras Tionscal it is stated:</P>
      <P>These difficulties derive from various circumstances in the timing of claims for payment of grants and the number and size of projects which may be approved for grants in any particular period.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks about a heavy outlay in respect of a number of marginal industries for which substantial grants were approved.  It might help our discussions here if these projects, which are responsible for such a large amount of extra money being sought, were actually listed.  Perhaps the Minister was attempting, very wisely, to avoid a general discussion on these projects at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister to arrange as rapidly as possible <Col N="1089" /> for his Estimate to be presented? On our side we are very anxious to get to his Estimate.  The Minister could say that we should stop talking on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government but that is also a very important area.  We are very anxious to discuss some of the underlying principles of the Department of Industry and Commerce at present and a discussion as soon as possible would be helpful.</P>
      <P>We have no opportunity to speak at length on this Estimate but I noticed that in regard to advertising and publicity a sum of £4,170 proved inadequate and that expenditure to date has exceeded £6,000.  Evidently this increase resulted from extra advertising needed under the Minerals Development Act. It seems highly paradoxical that the State should be involved in this kind of advertising under our arrangements for minerals exploration here and that in fact all the enterprise involved in mineral exploration is in foreign hands. While it does not come precisely within this Estimate may I say that it corresponds to other weaknesses in our economy that this important area should be totally in foreign control.  It is a serious situation.  While there is a part for foreign enterprise to play in any new undertaking it is time the State itself embarked on mineral exploration at least in one or two areas.  There is nothing revolutionary in this idea; Michael Collins suggested something similar half a century ago and he was no revolutionary in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be another Bantry Bay exercise when we find ourselves arranging for all the advertising and legal facilities and then standing back and allowing foreign enterprise to take the cream of the profit.  The general criticism one could make of the new moves regarding the IDA and An Foras Tionscal and their amalagamation under a general industrial development authority is that all industrial policy in the State appears now to be satisfied merely with the provision of more jobs. Nobody appears to worry very much any longer about who controls the jobs, who owns the capital or whether there is any Irish control or direction in these firms.  While we can accept mechanical improvements made in <Col N="1090" /> legislation such as the incorporation of An Foras Tionscal in the new IDA, the amalgamation of grant giving facilities and promotional activity, the fact is that this is neutral legislation in that in our industrial policy we now appear to have given up the battle to ensure that economic control, to some extent, would remain in our own hands.  This is not the appropriate place to discuss this matter at length but there are certain warning signals in our economy indicating that we are steadily approaching the point of no return in relation to control of important assets.  Grant aids to new industry at the moment provide roughly on average, 2,000 new jobs per year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Eleven thousand seven hundred&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>But an average per year of about 2,000 new jobs.  I know we could vary it for different years but it is around that figure.  The problem is that we are on very shaky ground even where we make the best grant giving facilities available when so many of the new jobs are in foreign hands.  Basing expansion solely on the extension of foreign subsidiaries in this country is very doubtful economic wisdom and if this policy is adopted to a large degree and if we pin all our basic hopes on this kind of development we risk terrible failure at some future stage, in our dependence on foreign markets.  I do not propose to go into detail on this but the Department and the agencies they set up must consider this growing problem of foreign control in retail outlets, manufacture, property and in many traditionally Irish-owned areas.  The Department must also consider the growing possibility of larger free trade areas in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always looked with a cold eye on Common Market developments and it would be best to continue in that attitude in the future.  It could be argued that there will be something inevitable about it, should Britain go in, seeing the dependence at this stage of our economy on Britain.  The argument will probably devolve on the kind of relationship that will exist with the new Common Market area but it would <Col N="1091" /> be the height of nonsense to think that there is any new salvation, any new prosperity to be found in this large market area.</P>
    <P>I consider the Minister's Department to be the most important Department and the Minister will be glad to hear that had this Party secured a majority in the last election his Department would have been the major Department, responsible for devising and implementing a national development plan.  These are the things that could have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be just the shadow of a shadow of a shadow.  We do not have shadow spokesmen but what I am saying is that the Minister's Department would have been a most important one.  We regard the Department of Industry and Commerce as the Department that has greatest responsibility in the government of a country with the problems this country has.  However excellent improvements may be in legislation setting up amalgamating bodies to see that the aid that the State gives to industry is improved and that we make more discriminatory the grants we give to ensure that they are given to industries with a future and so on, if the Department stands aside from the growing threat of foreign control of the home market then, in effect, we are largely handing away taxpayers' money.  This is an unfortunate trend in the figures relating to grants given. The export consideration means that in too many cases&mdash;in the majority of cases in the last figures I read&mdash;we tend to give more grants to foreign-controlled firms than to home-controlled firms.  The Minister may say that winning exports is the real job and that this, to some extent, in relation to new industries is inevitable, but allied to the growing threat of foreign control of the home market, it is something we must look at once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister when we come to the Estimate will consider this matter. I have addressed several questions to him over the last few years on the subject and the departmental attitude <Col N="1092" /> is to see no grounds for alarm particularly in the areas cited at present.  The Opposition is in the predicament that our figures and knowledge cannot be exact.  I have a question down for tomorrow in regard to how many hotels have come under foreign control and there are many other areas where Irish enterprise should be self-sufficient and should need no aid from abroad to manage its own affairs.  I can see the point where we are attempting to gain certain markets that foreign participation may be necessary but this criterion seems to be going overboard very rapidly and official policy appears to be to give grants on the basis that the only <i>quid pro quo</i> will be a job for a grant.  There are more serious things at issue.</P>
    <P>One must question how secure the job will be and how much benefit accrues to the community from that extra job.  An extra job can be provided at too high a cost if it is not based on a secure foundation.  This is something we must ponder especially if it is a job not controlled largely within this country.  In such a case the taxpayers' money is not being spent wisely nor do we give the man who gets the job a very secure future.  These are questions that I hope we shall have an opportunity of discussing in more depth when the Estimate comes along because there are quite a number of points that we must raise.  It is all right to improve, as the Minister is doing, the legislative framework under which his Department and their several agencies operate but this Department cannot be neutral in the important matter of providing new jobs and seeing that control is maintained in this country.  I am not saying that any of us today can depend exclusively on an unadulterated Sinn Féin economic policy.  This may not be possible in today's world, especially in today's Europe.  However, I do not know of any country which embraces as fully as we have been doing recently a policy of total dependence on other countries.  I feel this is an erroneous and rash policy, yet several Government Departments&mdash;indeed it is in our economic policy in general&mdash;appear to be embracing it without reservation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's enthusiasm and expertise are most gratifying.  Here we have a dedicated Minister dealing with the creation of employment and the building of the economy.</P>
      <P>Recently great emphasis has been put on the need for industrial development away from the greater Dublin area.  When a new industry is mooted for Dublin people are inclined to throw their hands up to heaven and say: &ldquo;Not Dublin again.  Send it elsewhere&rdquo;. Every Deputy wants to see decentralisation but it must be done according to the pattern laid down which is designed to ensure that this city is not denuded of its industries. We must face the fact that, whether we like it or not, the drift to the city will continue.  That is the pattern all over Europe and in the United States. It would be wrong to tackle this problem from the negative point of view, to feel that by starving Dublin of industry people will be driven out of it to other places.  This will not happen.  Since the Industrial Revolution people have headed for the big cities and made them even bigger still.  People may have a less satisfying life in a city, but they still persist in living there.  We do not live according to a mathematical formula.  We are all human beings and we do things which are not logical.  To live in a rural area near an industrialised town where one could have employment would be the ideal thing, but it is hard to reach the ideal state.</P>
      <P>Dublin has certain natural advantages for industry.  It is the finest port on the east coast and the east coast is the one nearest to Britain and to Europe.  All the time there are manufacturers and industrialists wanting to come to Dublin because from here they have a short sea route to Britain and to Europe.  The Government's policy of having growth centres is a good one and we all support it, but we must support it in the belief that the growth centres are viable and will become part of the local scene.  We do not want to have ghost towns because we forced manufacturers to go to certain places which were not suitable as industrial centres.  I am not suggesting the Government have done this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> We are delighted that the growth centres in Waterford, Galway and Shannon are progressing and expanding. However, we must face the fact that there are three-quarters of a million people living in the greater Dublin area and employment must be found for the working population there.  This will get bigger all the time and I cannot see the movement to Dublin changing in the lifetime of any Member of this House unless there is heavy emigration, and, thank God, that is unlikely.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for small industries.  I feel that Dublin has a place in this small industries policy, too.  Deputy Donegan spoke about the Verolme dockyard in Cork.  This is a fine undertaking.  We wish it well and hope that it will benefit the economy of Cork to a much greater extent as it progress.  However, in Dublin we have a much older shipyard than the Verolme dockyard and over the years it has turned out many fine vessels.  Although I am sure it benefits from some State grants, it is purely a private company.  I think it is in the Minister's own constituency and I know that his attitude to it has been one of friendly helpfulness.  I feel that the Dublin dockyard could turn out coastal vessels and indeed fishery protection vessels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to transgress the Rules of the House but when the Minister is considering grants for industry he might consider that the Dublin dockyard is capable of building the hulls and the superstructure of corvettes.  They could be fitted with their armaments elsewhere.  We must give Dublin its niche in the shipbuilding industry.  Knowing the Minister's deep concern with small industries I hope he will do everything possible to help the Dublin dockyard.  With increasing affluence many people have turned to yachting and there is a great future for yards all over the country <Col N="1095" /> as well as in Dublin in the building of yachts and other small sports boats.</P>
      <P>If I mention Ballyfermot it is incidental and has no political connotation.</P>

      <P>Whether one is a Dubliner or not, if one goes to Ballyfermot and sees industries such as Semperit and Fiat one must say that here we have done something worthwhile. We have built a housing estate and provided employment for people on their doorsteps.  This is the Dublin and the Ireland we want to see, where our people can live in proper conditions and work in proper conditions for proper wages.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister not just on this Estimate but on his showing over the year and on his drive and dedication to furthering industrial expansion.  I appeal to him to dispel any suggestion or feeling that somebody somewhere has said: &ldquo;No more industry for Dublin.&rdquo;  We still have unemployed people in Dublin and to carry out a policy of expansion we must create more jobs.  I feel that task is in the right hands.  I want to refute the suggestion that Dublin is over-industrialised. We still have unemployed people and we are concerned that the youth of the city leaving post-primary schools will find employment in their own city.</P>

      <P>As we have been reminded, this Supplementary Estimate is required mainly as a grant-in-aid to Foras Tionscal.  All of us in the House are extremely anxious that everything possible will be done to encourage the establishment of new industries and the expansion of existing industries.  It is for this purpose that the Minister is seeking approximately £3 million extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amazing, regardless of the way the Chair has restricted the debate on this Estimate, how the Deputy opposite was able to bring in the south west of Dublin, Ballyfermot and the other areas of that constituency which I had the honour to represent for many years and in which I was very pleased to be able to encourage the establishment of some industry.  Even though I am on the <Col N="1096" /> fringe of it now.  I am concerned about the amount and the nature of the employment that should be provided there.</P>
    <P>There are many matters which restrict the development of industry in that area, into which I am sure the Minister will look, particularly in relation to inadequate services.  I hope he will have regard to this when he is deciding about grants.  He may decide that some of the money provided here will be used for ancillary purposes which would enable industries to be established in an area where there is considerable unemployment.</P>
    <P>When we publicise and advertise certain inducements for the setting up of new industries or the expansion of existing ones, I submit there should not be the immense amount of niggling about them afterwards which I am afraid there is.  This debate is in respect of grants by Foras Tionscal.  I thought we got rid of Foras Tionscal last December.  Perhaps the Minister will refer to this when replying.  I thought Foras Tionscal went with the passing of the IDA Bill.  However, that is only beside the point I am trying to make. In the IDA Bill we provided for grants for areas outside the scheduled areas, if that is what they call them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Growth centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Anyway, it means the underdeveloped areas get one size of grant and what are regarded as the developed areas get another size of grant.  In the case of a developed area such as Dublin, first of all there is a 25 per cent grant and then, under section 34, there is an additional possible grant of 30 per cent under certain conditions.  I had quite an extraordinary experience since the passing of that Act in regard to an Industry which fulfilled practically all the conditions set out in section 34.  In a discussion prior to the application going to the grants board I was told: &ldquo;You cannot hope for anything more than 25 per cent.&rdquo;  I asked why and pointed out that this was an industry whose business would be 100 per cent export, would use only Irish material, and would provide practically 100 per cent male employment.  I asked what the yardstick was and I was told: &ldquo;You know there have been big changes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> I asked what the big changes were and I was told: &ldquo;The period for the tax relief on exports has been extended. This is an additional relief that must be taken into account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were not told that when discussing the IDA Bill here.  As I have said, it is wrong to have propaganda which deceived people coming in here. If we are to induce people to come in to establish new industry or to expand existing industry, we must mean what we say and what we set on paper.  If there is a possibility of a grant of 45 per cent in certain areas if certain conditions are fulfilled, I do not think there should be any great argument about it.  If there is, it is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing like it.  It is surprising that this should be the attitude. I want to make it clear this is what is said prior to the consideration of grant applications: applicants are being asked not to anticipate the possibility of the higher grants; they are discouraged.  I should like the Minister to look into this because it is vitally important that our propaganda should be believed.  It should be fairly well spelled out what industrialists are entitled to.  There is no mention of the additional asset of the extension of the income tax relief period when we were passing the legislation to which I have referred and I should hate to have it brought in now as an obstruction, if you like, to industrialists who measure up to all the qualifications required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan mentioned the EEC and the effects of EEC membership and he related this quite rightly to the suggestion of whether grants should be given in future to industries that perhaps have no hope of surviving in EEC conditions.  This is important.  I do not know whether a full assessment has been made by the Minister or the Department as to which industries are likely to succeed in EEC conditions when we get in, and it looks as if we will get in.  There are other aspects of <Col N="1098" /> this matter on which I should like the Minister to comment.  For instance, if we get into the EEC will we be allowed any longer to give the type of grants we give at present or will we be allowed to continue present grants?  Perhaps that may not have been fully taken up but it is important that we should know whether we will be allowed to go through with contractual arrangements already made.  Because we may not be allowed to continue grant assistance, is there not a great urgency now to do the maximum amount of this sort of thing while we can still do it?  After all, we have still 65,000 unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 67,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The number fluctuates. It is in the 60 thousands most of the time.  Of course some of these people are unemployable but there is still a large number unemployed and emigrating. It is important that the maximum employment opportunities be provided. We know these opportunities must be provided in industry.  We know what has happened in EEC countries in the last ten years.  In France, the working population on the land has been reduced by 50 per cent.  They have had to be re-employed in industry.  We have to be concerned that the same trend will be allowed here&mdash;fewer and fewer people employed on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the location of industry and I hope certain industries will be directed to various parts of the country.  There are inducements to attract industries to various parts of the country and that is quite right.  I have my own feelings about growth centres and about giving special grants and facilities to industries in these growth centres.  At the most, there or four growth centres in the whole country may be essential to provide the basic services required by industry here.  This is a small country and the distances they would have to travel for these services are quite small.  Therefore, I would be in favour of a limitation on inducements for industry in growth centres.  In the original Estimate there was a provision for half a million pounds for the establishment of industrial estates.  In itself, that is an extra grant towards the setting-up of industries in an industrial estate.  Why should <Col N="1099" /> any firm get a greater amount of State aid solely because it sets up in an industrial centre?  Surely an industry set up in a rural part of Ireland, where employment is needed and whereby the whole economy would be improved by its location in that area, should be entitled to a greater grant?</P>
    <P>With regard to technical assistance and advertising for industry outside the country, has the Minister ever thought of trying to get some of this work done on an agency basis?  We are setting out to do this by ourselves as a State Department.  The Minister might look into the suggestion of paying some agency or some individuals to bring industry to this country.  I have in mind the operations of one very successful Deputy of this House who went out and acted as an agency in bringing industry to quite remote parts of this country.  I am sure he will make a contribution to this debate.  This type of person should be compensated and rewarded for his effort in the same way as we have to pay for this service through the people we employ in IDA. I do not know how difficult it would be to decide who was responsible for getting what in this way.  I do not consider that the only agency capable of bringing industry to this country is IDA or that it is necessarily even the best agency.  Their efforts could and should be supplemented.  All of us hope that this Supplementary Estimate will assist towards bringing more industry to this country and, indeed, assist firms here who are anxious to expand.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that people who are given grants should have a hard and a long fight to be paid.  We should have the money to pay them promptly when they have the work done.  Furthermore, we should have a good system of examining an industry to ensure it has fulfilled the conditions under which it has got the grant and then we should pay it as soon as the work has been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself substantially in agreement with practically everybody who has spoken in this debate.  Deputy O'Leary said we are very much inclined to lean on outside assistance for the setting-up of industries here and that we are very <Col N="1100" /> generous and lenient towards non-nationals. I agree with what he said in that respect.  A lot of money has been expended through IDA to aid foreigners to set up industry here.</P>
      <P>I know of quite a few cases where they have come here and started an industry and set up, shall we say, a vested interest in a particular district. Beyond providing a certain amount of employment they totally failed to do what they were supposed to do&mdash;to set up an industry here for export purposes. That matter requires the Minister's most urgent consideration.</P>
      <P>There are two definite criteria that should guide the Minister in relation to the disposal of any funds being voted under this Supplementary Estimate. An industry based on raw material should have prior consideration. The siting of an industry in an area where there are not existing industries and where a measure of employment is sorely needed&mdash;this means practically every rural area in Ireland today&mdash;is indeed to be welcomed particularly in view of the syphoning-off of people from employment on the land.  These people make their way to Dublin, for example, where there is already a massive unemployment problem and they may end up on the emigrant ship.  Then, again, our accession to EEC is debatable.  Through the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, we have tied ourselves practically entirely to the British economy. The British have been trying, for a considerable time, to get into the Common Market, and now, when they can go in, everybody says we must do likewise&mdash;but it so happens that Britain does not now seem to want to enter EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to take a very clear view of where we are going, industrially, in this country.  We cannot go wrong if we base our economy on small industries, in rural sectors as far as possible, based on raw material.  I do not know that I accept the Minister's idea of industrial estates.  It may be the beginning of a new phase in Irish industry in an effort to prevent the concentration of industry in one area but, as against that, it gives a priority to one area over another area which is undesirable. <Col N="1101" /> I do not believe it will achieve the object of maintaining the people in the areas where they belong, which is so necessary in industrial life here.  The only way to achieve industrial stability and real prosperity is to employ our people in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned an industry in his constituency.  I want to refer to an industry in my constituency, without naming any names.  It is in a small town, with a population of about 400, where there is no industry and where the people depend on the growing of corn, beet, and so on, and perhaps there is a little railway employment.  A small industry was secured for this town, based on raw material.  The industry is small in the sense that it employs 25 to 30 persons and, in full production, might employ 45 to 50 persons.  The parties concerned were under the impression that they were getting the full grant of 45 per cent, or whatever it is.  Their plans were made, the factory site bought and when they were ready to build the factory they were told that they were entitled only to 21 per cent.  When this happens to a big industrial combine, although it may upset their plans, it does not affect them to the same extent, but the case I mentioned concerns a small industrial undertaking where capital is limited and which is entirely dependent on the resources of the State for help.  This is something the IDA should do.</P>
    <P>That is just one case in my own constituency and I am sure there are many parallel cases throughout the country. I accept that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has given a new breath of life to Irish industry.  He has moved away from the idea of trying to turn Ireland into a country like the United States or an industrial country such as Great Britain or the Federal Republic of Germany.  However, he must keep a careful eye on the situation.  Capital should not be made available to foreign industrialists so long as there are people in this country with initiative, verve and drive to start industries on their own.  When the Minister was introducing the Supplementary Estimate he did not give us any information but, knowing the Minister as I do, I think he would wish to have the thoughts and <Col N="1102" /> ideas of Deputies in relation to industrialisation. That is only right and proper.</P>
    <P>I listened to this debate with great interest.  All who contributed said something of value to which the Minister should give the fullest consideration. I do not know whether my humble contribution is of use but, having said all I want to and not wishing to be out of order, I shall conclude my comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to convey my appreciation and that of the people of County Kerry for the efforts the Minister has made in the direction of industry to our county.  We have a number of very successful industries, mainly German, and we have more coming in.  However, a much more energetic approach has to be made to German industrialists to make them aware of the facilities that are available.  About three weeks ago I was in Germany myself in the heart of the Rühr and I spoke to a number of people in the Darmstadt Junior Chamber of Commerce. I was amazed to find none of them was aware of the facilities available here.  I do not think this is the fault of our agents our there because I know they have tried by every means in their power to get the necessary publicity across but for some reason it is not getting to the essential people.</P>
      <P>As a result of my discussions with them I had two Germans in Killorglin on Saturday last and I think they will establish a small industry in a nearby place, Castlemaine.  Some effort must be made to get to the people who are prepared to come.  I was informed that all of the major industries in Darmstadt, and there are about 600 of them, are faced with a problem in that they have no way of expanding, they cannot get any more ground near their existing factories.  If they get ground in other parts of Germany they are faced with the problem of labour shortage and they are now trying to find ways and means to solve their problem because at the moment they are not able to manufacture even 50 per cent of production necessary to meet the demands of the available markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> When I explained the position in our own country and told them of the number of very successful German industries here they became very interested. I mention this to bring home to the Minister the position that obtains. While our agents abroad are doing their best a more positive effort must be made to inform industrialists of the situation that exists here.  There was a doctor attached as adviser to the Darmstadt Chamber of Commerce and she was not aware of the position here.  I asked her to come across here so that we could show her the successful German industries already here.  I hope that the Minister will extend an invitation to her to come here because I think she would be a great help to us in getting industries here.  There must be many other places throughout Germany in the same position and it is important that we make contact with these people and explain the position as it obtains in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the previous speakers mentioned he was rather opposed to the idea of industrial estates and I am of the same opinion.  One of the very good German industries we have in Killorglin, Liebeg Pfungstadt, was brought to the three industrial estates and they had not the slightest interest in them. From their experience in their own country most German firms do not want to get into an industrial complex again, and we can use this to our advantage in our efforts to get these people out to rural areas.  German industries have no interest in setting up among a group of other industries and the Minister might bear this in mind.  They are interested in getting into our small towns and villages provided the necessary labour is available. They like to get into scenic areas, into areas where there are facilities for bathing, shooting and fishing and these we have in plenty.  We should use this to our advantage and try to get those industries spread into our rural areas.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why we should avoid building up industrial estates and I have explained this many times in this House.  To take the example of my own district of Killorglin, or any part of Kerry, if a person has to <Col N="1104" /> leave his own town or village and go to some other place the natural place for him to go is London because probably his family and relations are there.  None of them is interested in going to Cork, Shannon or Galway for that matter.  This is one of the reasons why we should desist from building up industrial complexes to which our people will not move.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have a look also at the small industries programme. Many outside small industries have been turned down, particularly in the joinery trade, and these industries could contribute to the export position of the country if they were allowed to develop on their own but because we already have an oversupply of this type of industry, they are being excluded. Unfortunately, this contributes to increased costs of houses and other buildings because of having to bring local material to other parts of the country whereas if they were allowed to produce locally, a great advantage would ensure in developing the local area and in keeping at home those people skilled in the trade instead of having them in foreign fields.</P>
    <P>There are many other small industries employing four or five people.  A full examination of the position particularly throughout the west should be made with a view to developing these industries.  While speaking to a very old man in my own town of Killorglin I was amazed when he informed me his father had told him that about 90 years ago there were 165 industries of one type or another in and around the town, some of the smaller ones employing two and three people.  When one thinks of that number and considering that we had nothing there for years before we got the recent industries, it would appear that the position needs to be considered.  These small industries kept the villages and towns along the west cost ticking over many years ago.</P>
    <P>There is room for development.  We have an intelligent population.  Almost every child, particularly along the west coast, receives secondary education. This is a great asset in industry.  Up to 60 per cent of the personnel working in the clothes factory in Killorglin have either the intermediate or leaving certificate.  They continue to work in <Col N="1105" /> the factory where they get very good money.  It may be said that they do not need secondary education for such work but the fact that they have had the education is a great asset and makes for good machinists and production staff.  Also, the fact that they stay at home is a real help.</P>
    <P>There should not be any great problem in getting outside industrialists to set up here if we make that little extra drive within the different organisations to bring in the industries and to develop local ones in as far as is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to deal with the points raised during the debate.  A number of similar points were raised by Deputies.  Deputy Donegan again found it necessary to make his ritual remarks about the policy of Fine Gael but I will not go over that ground again with him except to point out that the amalgamation of CTT with the new IDA would not help in the least to reduce difficulties for applicants for industrial grants because, in the vast majority of cases, CTT have nothing to do with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about ICC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be just an additional appendage which would not help at all.  The ICC are a different matter.  The Deputy mentioned CTT as one that should be brought in.  This is a theory on which Deputy Donegan has been sold but he ought to examine it a little more closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about ICC? Why do you not take that in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, that is a different matter.  Arrangements have been made for close liaison there but I merely want to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point raised by Deputy Donegan as well as by a number of others, including the last speaker, Deputy O'Connor, was in relation to the operation of the small industries scheme.  Deputies are concerned that some types of industry are being excluded from this scheme.  This is true but I should like to make it clear to the House that, originally, manufacturing industries of any kind were not excluded but the stage is being <Col N="1106" /> reached in certain cases where, to admit any further ones, would simply have the effect of building up one Irish firm at the expense of another Irish firm so that there would be no gain to the economy.  Obviously, it would be bad business if the State were to bring about that situation so where there are exclusions this is the sole reason for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tried that with adaptation grants and after three or four years we succeeded in getting him to produce the re-equipment grants which did bring in more people.  The same thing will happen with small industries grants.  The Minister will give in after a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to argue this out with the Deputy but his statement is not factually correct in regard to adaptation and re-equipment. Deputies referred to joinery in particular and I should like to ask the House to consider what would be the position if the small industries division of the IDA were to assist every applicant whose business was joinery.  The result would be that firms all over the country would be assisted in this way with a loan much smaller than the capacity of these firms and this would obviously not be of any benefit to those firms that we were nominally assisting and, of course, the cost to the taxpayer would be substantial with no return.  I do not wish to see any particular line excluded but we must be realistic about this.  Furthermore, in regard to any particular form of industry, it is always possible that the assessment of the IDA is not accurate. I am of course prepared to have this assessment checked because the information available to them may not be as accurate as it should be.  Indeed, the regional development of the IDA will, I hope, help to give more accurate information of this kind particularly in relation to small industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan and other Deputies referred to the consequences of our entry into the EEC.  I do not propose to depart any further from the rules of order than was done by any of the previous speakers, but reference was made to increased costs arising in this <Col N="1107" /> regard and I would just say this much: we have been hearing and reading recently of certain estimates or guesstimates, as I said here before, of what might be the consequences for Britain of entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>I have not seen much reference to an estimate or guesstimate which I also read about but which does not seem to have got a great deal of publicity, to the effect that if Britain had been in the EEC from the beginning the average weekly wage there now would be £5 per week more than it is which, so far as the other estimates are relevant, is also a relevant estimate.  However, talking about relevant estimates I am probably straying a little far from relevance to this Estimate.</P>
    <P>If I may return to the questions that were posed in relation to the Verolme dockyard in Cork, perhaps I should remind the House that approximately two years ago certain moneys were voted for that yard to implement a changed policy in regard to it.  That changed policy envisaged the continued operation of shipbuilding but it also envisaged the expansion of the activities of the yard into general engineering work.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the shipbuilding programme of the yard is quite satisfactory at present, but I am even more pleased to say that the general engineering work of the shipyard is progressing very favourably; indeed, the yard is making strenuous efforts to obtain work on the export market and is having some success.  One of the large limiting factors in the expansion of this aspect of its activities which is regarded as being much more viable in the long term than shipbuilding is the non-availability of certain skilled tradesmen.  The company have advertised extensively in Britain as a result of which quite a number of Irishmen with these skills have come home and are working there but quite a number more could be used in Cork and if they were available they would enable the activities of the company in this regard to be very greatly expanded. The company have an excellent training scheme but this is a much slower process and, as I say, the largest limiting <Col N="1108" /> factor on expansion is the non-availability of skilled workers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Verolme Company in Holland, I should like to make it quite clear that I know of no reason whatever why any of the workers in the yard in Cork should fear for their jobs arising out of the recent developments in Holland.  There was some suggestion, and I should like to confirm it, that the Verolme Company in Holland is now to a great extent subject to the control of the Dutch Government, but I repeat that I know of no reason arising out of these developments why anybody in Cork should fear for the future of his job.  On the contrary, it seems to me from the information available that the prospects are extremely good for the future of the Verolme yard in Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary raised the very important question&mdash;one we have discussed a number of times and in particular when the IDA Bill was going through the House&mdash;of foreign control of Irish industry.  Again I do not intend to go back over all of this ground but I think I should say that, first of all, anybody who has the responsibility which I have as Minister for Industry and Commerce in weighing up the possible lines of approach to the provision of new jobs in industry has got to consider the extent of foreign ownership, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the necessity to create new jobs rapidly.  There is no choice of alternative methods for achieving full employment in the same time.  The choice is that of achieving full employment in the reasonably near future by following the policy which we are following or of following a policy of much greater reliance on our own resources not only financial but technical and marketing.  In that situation the choice the Minister faces is to get full employment as fast as possible or to put off the achievement of full employment for many years and perhaps never achieve it.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I do not think there is any real choice.  We must ensure that we get full employment here as fast as we can.  We are concerned with Irish men and women and enabling them to work in Ireland.  This <Col N="1109" /> does not mean that we simply close our eyes to dangers which may be inherent in foreign dominance of our industries, but this situation can be grossly exaggerated and the risks can be greatly exaggerated.  Obviously as situation in which we were dependent on one or two key industries which were controlled by one foreign country would be a most unhealthy position in which to be, but this is not our position. The bulk of our industry at present is Irish-controlled.  The bulk of new industry is foreign-controlled, but the spread by nationality of control is substantial so that there is no one country which has a dominant position in the establishment of new industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the IDA are providing special services for the development of Irish-controlled industries with the greatest potential for growth in order to encourage and assist in practical ways the earliest possible expansion and growth of those industries.  In addition, State companies are being urged to diversify into different activities of manufacturing industry with some success, as I hope the House will learn in the not too distant future.  It seems to me that the policy we are following in order to deal with the problem with which we are faced is the policy most likely to give the best results as well as being the policy which the people most want us to follow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised the question about the allegations that Dublin has too many industries and that the rest of the country is being denuded of them.  This is a very difficult problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Cork is getting a bad run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people in Cork who think it is.  I should like to make it clear that this is largely a question of balance.  As I said in this House on a previous occasion, if our only problem were to get full employment in the fastest possible time the course we should have followed would have been to develop Dublin and nowhere else.  We could probably have a Dublin twice or three times its present size without giving any great <Col N="1110" /> incentives with all the people working in it but, of course, we would not have Ireland as a country as we know it.  This policy would not, therefore, appeal to any of us.  We must recognise because of the sheer size and facilities available in it Dublin attracts industries without any great effort or incentive being made by the State.</P>
      <P>If we are to have an overall balance in our economy&mdash;I am thinking here in social as well as economic terms&mdash;then something has got to be done to counteract the natural attraction of Dublin. This is being done.  The House is well aware of the additional incentives being given.  Nevertheless, this does not mean that we are preventing industries setting up in Dublin.  Any industry that wishes to do so can go to Dublin, the only control exercised is in regard to the availability of incentives.  Some industries have been set up in Dublin without any assistance from the State. There are certain kinds of industries which will not get assistance in Dublin such as industries largely dependent on female labour&mdash;which is already scarce in Dublin&mdash;and in particular which would not entail any great capital expenditure which would mean that the promoters would be at no great loss if they were to pull out.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that any worthwhile industry coming to this country which for very good and sufficient reasons cannot be located anywhere else except Dublin will, of course, get assistance&mdash;it will not be turned away.  In fact we want to develop certain kinds of industry in Dublin.  We have extended the small industries programme to Dublin on a more limited scale than the rest of the country.  It would not be of any great assistance to Dublin or the rest of the country if the small industries programme were to be applied on its full basis in Dublin.  One of the most obvious limitations is the one I have already mentioned&mdash;the employment of female labour.  I want to make it clear that the object of doing so is to get a reasonable balance of economic and industrial development in the different parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton raised the point about the disappearance of An Foras Tionscal.  The Bill which this House <Col N="1111" /> passed some time ago provided for its amalgamation with the IDA but the actual operation of that depends on ministerial order and it is planned that it will operate as from 1st April next.</P>
    <P>I do not know the details of the case about which Deputy Clinton complained although I suspect what may be the background to it but if the Deputy would care to let me have details of the particular case I shall have it examined and I will let him know what was the reason for the decision which he said was conveyed.</P>
    <P>I should like to confirm that the new industry grants are not given&mdash; certainly in any kind of substantial case&mdash;where there is any doubt about the viability of the industry under EEC conditions.  Deputy Clinton raised the question about whether our industrial incentives will be allowed to continue in the EEC and whether we will be in a position to honour our contractual arrangements in the EEC. I do not believe for one moment that our contractual obligations would, could or should be in any way interfered with.  The question of how long our incentives could continue in the EEC is one which would be the subject of negotiations but there is every reason for these incentives to continue, having regard to the fact that the basic policy of the EEC is directed towards the assistance of less developed regions in the community.  I do not want to go into this in detail at this stage except to say that that aspect of it will be a matter for negotiations but as far as I can see and hope these particular negotiations should not be too difficult.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the unemployment figures and the fact that they fluctuate.  They are, of course, affected by industrial disputes and they also include a number of smallholders. The real test, as far as I am concerned, is when one looks at the number of workers available with a view to the setting up of an industry. In a number of places we have found that even though the figures seem to show there are unemployed people in the area in practice there are not.  We require, for the purpose of industrial development, more realistic statistics <Col N="1112" /> on unemployment.  I do not mean the existing ones are untrue, but they are compiled on a basis which, when applied in practical terms for the provision of labour for a new industry, do not work out.  Efforts are being made in this regard but it is a matter of importance that this should be done.  Any Deputy concerned with the location of a new industry in his own constituency will probably have found that there is a big discrepancy between the numbers on the live register and the numbers actually available for work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the manpower surveys were of value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They were of very considerable value.  Indeed, the Drogheda one highlighted why the figures were not real in relation to the problem I am talking about.  For instance, the numbers of married women who would take only part-time work, who were not available for full-time work, and a number of other factors were highlighted and, as the Deputy knows, other surveys of the same nature have been carried out and it is hoped to extend this considerably in the near future.</P>
      <P>A question was raised by Deputy Clinton about using people on an agency basis to bring in industry from abroad.  He referred to another Deputy &mdash;I know he was referring to a Deputy on this side of the House&mdash;who has been very successful in bringing industries into his own constituency.  The suggestion was that people who did that kind of work ought to be paid for it. I know that the Deputy concerned is doing it at his own expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I examined this possibility quite some time ago and I concluded that it would not be feasible.  One reason for this was touched on by Deputy Clinton when he mentioned the difficulty of determining who, in fact, was responsible for bringing in the industry. There is another aspect of it that is not alone difficult but dangerous and that is that if you had such a system you could well find that an agent of that nature would be paid a commission on the grant that was being given and <Col N="1113" /> would be very tempted to ensure that the grant was at least sufficiently large for the purposes of the promoter with some little addition to it that might cover his commission or add to his commission.  The IDA has never done this kind of thing but one or two experiences they have had have indicated the real dangers that exist in this concept.  It seems to me that it is not a practical proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was also raised by a number of Deputies about industrial estates and some Deputies expressed scepticism as to their value and others, in a subconscious paradox, talked of their being an unfair advantage to the areas in which they were located.  If they are an unfair advantage, then they are an advantage.  The same Deputies said they were not an advantage to anybody.</P>
      <P>In my view, the position is that for certain kinds of industry they are an attraction.  Deputy O'Connor&mdash;and he has personal experience of this&mdash;mentioned certain kinds of industry that would not go near an industrial estate under any circumstances&mdash;I can think of a number of reasons for this&mdash;and some of them are located in his constituency. I am also aware of a number of cases in which firms would not come here except to an industrial estate because, first, the facilities were available in the industrial estate, the services were attractive to them but, secondly, it meant that they were dealing with a possible pool of labour of persons who were used to the industrial tradition and the firms felt that they did not have to break new ground in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a basic difference in approach between one firm and another.  You get both types.  We should serve both types. But, I should like to make it clear that such advantage as there is in having an industrial estate does not lie in the expenditure on it.  A firm coming into an industrial estate and taking a factory there on a rented basis gets the factory at a subsidised rent but the amount of the subsidy is precisely equated to the amount of capital grant they would have got if they bought the <Col N="1114" /> factory.  So that, there is not any real advantage in that way to them.  There are certain advantages to certain types of firms.  As to whether it is unfair to give this advantage to one area and not to another, I suppose if we were all to try to achieve absolute justice, we could do it and in this field alone that I am speaking about at the moment, we would end up with far fewer people employed in the country.  It is a question of living with the problems as they exist and trying to achieve more industrial development and more jobs in any way that we can.  I do not think the provision of industrial estates can be said to reduce the number of jobs in the overall economy.  In fact, quite clearly, it increases them.</P>
    <P>Areas which are fairly adjacent to industrial estates but not sufficiently adjacent to benefit directly are areas where the people worry most and who, in fact, on the face of it, have most reason to worry, but some areas from which complaints come, and which were represented in the debate today, have not really any justifiable complaints at all because they are not being affected by the industrial estates and they are doing all right with the other kind of firms which do not want industrial estates.</P>
    <P>I would suggest again that Deputy Esmonde, as in the previous case I have mentioned, might give me details of the case to which he referred.  I could not identify it from what he said but I will inquire into it and get in touch with him if he does so.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor thought that we should have more intensive advertising in Germany.  It is true that there is a considerable potential there.  Deputy O'Connor may not be aware of all the activities in this regard by the IDA because many of them occur in a very specialised field.  One can understand that in this kind of business advertising in the daily newspapers is probably the least effective way for the IDA to advertise. They are trying to get at a much more limited market.  Therefore, their efforts are concentrated, in so far as advertising is concerned, on business, banking and economics journals, through the banks and through chambers of commerce, industry, and so on. Deputy O'Connor, understandably, <Col N="1115" /> may not be aware of the extent of their activity.  Nevertheless, having said that, I do think that there is a considerable potential there.  In fact, I had intended to go to Germany on the kind of operation that Deputy O'Connor may have had in mind, towards the end of this month, but I have found it impossible to do so for reasons which arose over there as well as over here but the matter will be pursued, if not by me, at least by the chairman of the IDA.  I can assure Deputy O'Connor that Germany will not be neglected in this operation by the IDA.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered, so far as I can, all the points that were raised and I thank the House for a constructive debate on the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last night I was speaking about the financing of local government and the services being provided by the local authorities.  I do not intend to detain the House much longer on this Estimate but I would sum up by saying that the Government should encourage more private building particularly by those people who at times find it hard to make up their minds whether they should build for themselves, or concentrate on getting local authority houses.</P>
      <P>Local societies should be organised to arrange for the collection of contributions or savings from their employees and, indeed, from other persons as well, and these people, in turn, should get tax concessions.  The local authorities should be encouraged also to provide more building sites, more serviced building sites, at low cost to persons who would build for themselves.  The income limit on loans made available by housing authorities should be increased.  All these developments would certainly encourage far more people to build their own homes and, at the same time, considerably lighten the burden on local authorities.</P>
      <P>These policies could be put into effect particularly in the rural areas and in the provincial towns and villages. As this country progresses, as we foster economic development, as the population increases, as the standard of living increases, and as the number in employment increases, there will be a grave housing problem, and that problem will be solved only if there is some serious setback, which we all hope will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Group water schemes should be encouraged in every way and smaller schemes should be encouraged too.  I would strongly urge that more inspectors should be made available to help in the provision of group schemes.  I would suggest that the Minister should consider the possibility of having at least one clerk of works assigned to assist the liaison officer in each county in the putting into operation of these group schemes.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, a good case can be made for a higher grant for country roads even if we have to curtail the grants for the main roads for a while. Most of our country roads are now tarred.  We cannot tar the remainder fast enough.  We all know that 80 per cent of the money spent on untarred roads is wasted.  When a flood comes the surface is washed away.  A tarred finish is the only answer.</P>
    <P>The people who are operating local government planning and development should put a broader interpretation on the draft development plans as prepared by the local authorities.  If a broader look were taken at these plans it would mean far fewer planning appeals and far fewer section 4 resolutions passed by councils.  There would also be more co-operation between the public, the elected members, the planning officers and the county managers.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with certain proposals which would mean that there could be no more single houses on the main roads in the rural parts of the country. There is a far greater traffic hazard in having six or eight cars coming out one entrance than there is in having one car coming out of six or eight entrances within a mile of each other.</P>
    <P>The policy on advertising signs seems to vary from district to district, not to speak of from county to county.  Something should be done fairly quickly to let the public know where they stand with regard to advertising.  We all know that guesthouses must be advertised and that those engaged in the farm holidays scheme must advertise.  These people see no reason why they cannot advertise in the same manner as the hoteliers can advertise.</P>
    <P>I know of several cases in the <Col N="1118" /> Killarney area of people who had booked into small guesthouses or for farm holidays.  They passed these places about six miles out the road. When they got into town they had to inquire and then turn back again, whereas, if the owners of these premises had permission from the planning authority to erect advertising signs, as the owners of hotels can, this problem and this confusion would not have arisen.  It is about time that the Department or Bord Fáilte or the planning authorities came to some decision on advertising signs.  The man engaged in a small business should be as well entitled to advertise as the man engaged in a big business.</P>
    <P>As regards the regionalisation of the local government services, as I said last night, we should be cautious and go slowly.  By regionalising local government we will not save one penny.  It could well happen that in regions certain areas could be neglected.  That danger is always there. I would strongly urge that we should go slow on regionalisation.</P>
    <P>As far as the financing of local government is concerned, while we all know that the contribution in respect of rates has decreased from 52 per cent in 1939 to 33 per cent during the current financial year, and while State grants have increased from 39 per cent during the same period, nevertheless the impact of the rates on the capacity of the ratepayers to pay, having regard to all the services administered by local authorities, is becoming heavier as the years go by.  We should, I think, examine more closely the suggestion that there should be separate rates for business premises, for private houses occupied by those on a fixed wage or salary, who are rearing young families, and also for land and other property.  This suggestion is well worth examining.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary and the officials of his Department on the help and co-operation they have given to the people of South Kerry during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal only with local government problems as they affect Cork.  The extension of <Col N="1119" /> these problems to national level has been and will be dealt with by other speakers.  At the moment it is practically impossible to tell what Cork city will look like in the next 20 years.  The Buchanan Report sets out one possible line of expansion and it is regrettable that no Government decision has yet been taken on the recommendations in that report.  In the absence of a Government decision the task of Cork Corporation from the point of view of planning is made increasingly difficult. Far-reaching decisions on housing, roads, sewers and land acquisition need to be made by the Cork Corporation, for approval by the Minister, if the city is to grow in a well-defined preplanned way.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stressed the importance of housing and has made claims for the success of his so-called programme.  In Cork 1,200 houses are currently under consideration and another 800 are planned.  These will meet only the demands of today.  Where will houses be built for the extra population envisaged in the Buchanan Report? Have we serviced land for further house building in Cork?  Unfortunately, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Recently we had the stultifying experience of hearing builders stating publicly that house building by them in Cork would cease by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister willing to speed up the proposal with regard to main drainage so that large tracts of land may be opened up for housing?  Will the Minister make moneys available to crash-programme these proposals so that we may avoid a slowing down or a complete stop in building activities? The number of privately built houses in and around Cork city is approximately 600 per year.  The development of the Cork County Council satellite towns, such as Ballincollig, Blarney, Carrigaline, is progressing rapidly, but the Minister's limitation of £2,700 local authority loan will retard progress.  This figure is unrealistic in the circumstances of 1970.  House prices have accelerated at a rate hitherto unknown. The income limit of £1,200 is also unrealistic.  It results in the exclusion today of many prospective house <Col N="1120" /> purchasers.  When the figure of £1,200 was introduced in 1966 it covered many categories of workers, workers now denied this facility because of wage increases since that date.  Is it the function of the Minister deliberately to reduce the numbers of those eligible for local authority house financing for the purpose of house purchase?</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note in the Minister's speech his concern for the standard of training in part-time fire brigades.  I must express in the strongest possible terms my concern with the facilities and accommodation available to the full-time fire brigade in Cork city.  In an expanding city, with its chaotic traffic problems aggravated by the closure of Parnell Bridge, it is time there was an end to delay in the erection of the new station suggested by Cork Corporation. Working drawings and outline specifications have been with the Minister for approval since July, 1969, and surely the Minister should be in a position now to give his considered opinion on this proposal.  The desirability of a full-time fire station on the north side of the city has been under consideration for years.  Must we wait for a tragedy before this very essential service is provided?</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should give special consideration to Cork Corporation traffic proposals.  The corporation have agreed to accept in principle the traffic consultant's recommendations for the city of the seventies but, while the debate on the plan continues, the city suffers.  The roads and streets are beginning to look like Biafran airstrips.  Town planning proposals are deferred or refused.  I would ask the Minister to tell us when he proposes to sanction the traffic plan. If he does sanction it, will he guarantee the necessary financial support to implement it?  The Minister's Department is cluttered up with proposals in relation to roads, sewers and so on. The delaying tactics are costing the country money.  They are retarding progress in Cork city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is, I suppose, the best we can afford, but it falls far short of what we need in order to implement our full programme at local authority level.  There should be <Col N="1121" /> an overall examination of the position. Priorities should be clearly designated. It seems, perhaps, a little foolish to spend colossal sums on main roads when we need houses, water schemes and sewerage.  These are of the utmost importance from the point of view of our own people and also from the point of view of the tourist industry. We have, with the help of the Minister and his Department, made great progress in Kerry over the past few years with the building of houses, but we have still to provide 900 houses&mdash; this was the result of a survey carried out last year &mdash; which will cost us over £1½ million.  This scheme will take six years to implement at a cost of £260,000 per year.  Now inside 12 months we have 250 new applications which puts our scheme further back. There is a great demand for housing in our county because of our rapidly expanding tourist industry.  The local authority cannot take this on their shoulders now.  I often wonder if some form of building agency could take on the provision of houses for people who could afford to build their own. If this was done it would relieve the local authority of the heavy burden it has to bear at the moment.  Very often we find people who could supply houses of their own and pay something more in rent than that demanded by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I joined the Kerry County Council almost 25 years ago the only responsibility we had was to erect cottages for farm labourers.  As time went on we were forced to build houses for people outside the urban council.  It should be possible to devise some system whereby a large number of houses could be erected by an agency instead of having the local authority do the job.  Before I went into the county council the only type of house built was that for a labourer.  It was a small type cottage with an acre of land attached to it.  Now, as I said, we find ourselves loaded with a burden for which we have not got the money or the Government cannot find the money to meet our demands.  There must be many people who could find the means of providing their own homes.  Over 40 years ago people had not any means of getting a house <Col N="1122" /> except obtaining money from members of their families.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems in my county at the moment concerns sewerage and water schemes.  We have a great demand for those schemes particularly because of the development of the tourist industry and the farm holiday schemes.  We are under continuing pressure within the council to try to devise schemes and even though we have a large number of group schemes the council have to find the means to develop head works and main lines for those schemes.  I would ask the Minister to get something done to provide more money to enable us to try to go ahead with those schemes.  I even proposed in the Kerry County Council some weeks ago that we be allowed to get the approval of the Minister to look for a temporary loan from our own people much like the corporations do to enable us to complete the water and sewerage schemes in three years, which with our present list would take us about seven years to complete.  I believe if we got the approval of the Minister we would be able to obtain this money.</P>
    <P>The burning question in Kerry at the moment is the very high rates we are facing.  This is something we have to face up to.  Some other method of providing the money for local development other than the rates should be devised.  I made a study of this in my own area and there is no doubt that this system of rating is inequitable.  As many of the Deputies have said, large business firms probably are getting off much lighter than some small shopkeepers. Indeed, I know some of them in my own town with £20 and £25 valuations who because of the present trend of supermarkets and self-service shops are not making much more in the week than what they have to pay in rates.  Those people who have to pay those heavy rates at the moment are very often people who do not shout about it.  They try to pay up because they were important people in the area at one time and they do not wish to have it said that they are not able to keep up with the payment of rates as their fathers did before them. The result is that they pay those exorbitant rates.  Now many of those <Col N="1123" /> shops will be closed down and they will have to sell out.  It is a pity those people are put into this position because they were really the salt of rural Ireland.  They were the people who kept things together in hard times.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity of impressing on the Government that some system should be derived to bring some relief to those people.</P>
    <P>During the year we went through legislation giving relief in the case of hardship to old age pensioners and social welfare recipients.  I had a case in County Kerry of an old age pensioner who 30 years ago bought an old house on a railway station.  This particular house had a high valuation. While the man was not rich he was probably able to meet the rates at the time he bought the house because they were not as high as they are now.  I sent the demand note which he received to the council authority in Tralee asking to have his rates reduced. I got a letter saying that they were examining the position and would write off the rates if necessary.  The man was continuously pressurised by county council officials until he paid his rates in full.  I was informed that this man went without the necessaries of life in order to pay £40 rates.  Someone was responsible for this.  I sent the demand to the county manager but nothing was done until £40 had been taken from the poor man.  This was contrary to the legislation passed here for the purpose of helping such people. The Minister should ask the Kerry county manager and the officials why the regulations were ignored.  It is very hard on old people to be deprived of money like this.  Such people are often of a religious nature and feel an obligation to pay their bills.  The Department should convey to the local authorities that they have an obligation to relieve such people from this kind of pressure.</P>
    <P>The town planning regulations present us with many problems.  In Kerry we do not have many refusals in proportion to the number of applications passed.  It is not always easy to explain to local people why one case is passed while another is refused.  Recently I <Col N="1124" /> was in contact with smallholders on one side of the Killarney lakes.  They lived in a wooded area.  They were refused permission to sell one plot of ground for £500.  The £500 was required by the family concerned and would have helped them to improve their three-roomed house which was badly in need of repair.  These people pointed out to me that on the other side of the lake, on the top of Aghadoe Heights, an hotel and houses had been built.  As a member of the county council I found it difficult to explain why permission had been granted for the building of the hotel and houses while other people were refused permission to build.</P>
    <P>The hotel and houses were necessary but I found myself trying to explain why the smallholders were refused permission to build one house in a well wooded site while others were allowed to erect buildings at a height over the Lakes of Killarney.  The hotel and houses were quite visible.  They are neatly built and are not monstrosities. The smallholders wished to build close to the mountain among the trees and the houses they intended to build would not have been visible from afar. I went to Aghadoe Heights and confirmed that houses built on the small-holder's site could not have been seen from the hotel.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have an overall look at the Planning Act.  There are cases of hardship.  Refusals bring trouble on all of us and particularly on the Minister.  A large number of appeals reach him.  The local planning officials should be instructed by the Minister to consult with the local people, the architects and members of the local authority with a view to reaching agreement.  Permission could often be granted if a site were chosen 50 or 100 feet from a proposed site. The Minister would not then have so many appeals to deal with.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, Bord Fáilte and An Taisce are actively concerned about what we are doing in Kerry.  Looking at the skyscrapers on the Dublin skyline one wonders whether the time of officials in these boards would not be better spent in trying to do something to preserve their beautiful city.  The <Col N="1125" /> planners tell us what we should do in our own county.  We, in Kerry, would not allow the type of disfigurement which would spoil our county.  The local people have a pride in the beauty of Kerry.  Many people gave their lives for our county.  We will not allow it to be spoiled.  Permission is sometimes given for a particular scheme while schemes which are necessary to assist our poorer people are turned down. Poorer people often need the money to educate their families or to carry out necessary repairs to their houses.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the main road and the county road grants.  We spend too much on the main roads in comparison with what we spend on the county roads.  There is leeway to be made up in the development of county roads.  This is because of the great density of traffic at peak tourist periods.  There are many dangerous bends on these roads and money should be allocated to the council to have those bends removed.  The roads are so narrow that two cars can scarcely pass. I ask the Minister to consider that matter and to allow us to develop our backroads more quickly since the tourists are now using those roads continuously and sometimes, particularly on Sundays, we find cars travelling on them almost bumper to bumper.  Perhaps the Department are not fully aware of the problem that exists but it is a real problem and it is necessary to have something done about it.</P>
    <P>I shall quote one case of a road outside Killorglin where CIE have refused to operate a school bus because of two very dangerous bends.  The children who are entitled to the school bus service now find that the bus comes to a point two and a half miles away from them and the children must go two and a half miles in the opposite direction to that in which they go to school in order to get on to the bus.  I cite this case to bear out my point but there are many more.  Although this road is a public road people are being inconvenienced because it is not fit for heavy traffic.</P>
    <P>I should also mention the position about Tralee courthouse.  For years Kerry County Council have refused <Col N="1126" /> to have any further reconstruction or improvement of this courthouse.  About 15 years ago we were instructed to have the courthouse improved.  We got experts to advise on the feasibility of dealing with the roof timbers and we were told that if the whole area were properly &ldquo;protimised&rdquo; the wood rot would be halted and we could expect many further years of life for the courthouse.  I think we spent about £24,000 at the time and subsequently the court officials pressed for the provision of heating equipment and this was installed at extra expenses.  When the heating was introduced the work previously carried out was neutralised and the last position of the courthouse was worse than the first.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Justice, under pressure, no doubt, from the same people who want to retain the facade of this courthouse &mdash; I should like to see it kept if that were possible but, personally, I would not be responsible to the people of Kerry for supporting a proposal to have that building maintained &mdash; said it would be cheaper to have this building renovated rather than build, as we propose, a new office building for our staff and turn over the County Hall in Tralee, which has an imposing frontage, for use as a courthouse.  The Minister said that to knock the existing courthouse would cost £25,000.  This shows the foolishness of the advice given to the Minister because if anybody wanted the courthouse demolished tomorrow there would be plenty takers who would do it free to get the lead and other materials in it.  The same experts advised us 16 or 17 years ago in regard to this building and we lost about £24,000 at that time although they estimated that £12,000 would do the work, if my memory is correct.</P>
    <P>We again have this expert opinion now which means nothing.  I think it would be better to have an outside site.  We have the Ashe Memorial Hall in Tralee which can be converted &mdash; or a good part of it &mdash; to provide the courthouse and offices required and we could build an office block at a cost of £120,000 as far as we can estimate. This would be much more suitable than the Ashe Memorial Hall because that building has many very large <Col N="1127" /> rooms in some of which you have, perhaps, an engineer with, possibly, a secretary and a typist.  In a modern building that amount of accomodation would not be needed.</P>
    <P>I think what I am suggesting would be the best solution for the Kerry ratepayers. We shall certainly lose far more than £120,000 if we reconstruct the existing courthouse and we would be back with the same problem in another 15 years or earlier.  We should consider the whole matter logically from an economic point of view.  Attempting to reconstruct a building hundreds of years old does not seem to be a good proposition.  You would be left with the walls but walls are not very costly to erect since it is the roofing and the internal work that costs money.  In this case the walls are riddled with dry rot which extended far beyond its original bounds when the heating was installed. Heating has this effect where there is dampness and ordinary wood rot.  I think the people of Kerry will not stand for the reconstruction of this courthouse and certainly we should be allowed to do the best for the people of Kerry and develop in the way that is most suitable to us.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to mention the health scheme which I must say is operating quite well in our county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, only generally as it affects the rates.  I am not discussing health.  I think a tightening up of the system is needed and I think this is within the Minister's ambit.  All I want to say is that there is room for saving and in this respect I believe that it is the Minister's Department that can help.  Too often we have the proposition that each Department is only responsible for its own activities but no businessman could develop a business or keep it going if he were to ignore certain matters merely because they were not strictly a part of his responsibility.  I feel that is the Minister's position here.  He should get his experts and economists to examine this with the people from the other <Col N="1128" /> Department and see that the county gets the best value possible for the money we have to pay &mdash; and we have to pay money for it.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and the staff of the Department on their efforts.  I want to ask him again to help us to get the water and sewerage schemes through more quickly than at present.  I would like to see the Minister and his Department allowing us to seek the necessary money needed in County Kerry by way of temporary loan in the county in order to develop those schemes at a fast rate.  If we could do that we could avail of the great upsurge of industrial and tourist development. We know the Department cannot give us the money.  The Minister has too many chickens under his wing and we can only get our share, but we feel we could get the money from the people of Kerry on short-term loan without affecting the economy of the country and we could pay it back with the money we get from the Minister over the next seven years.  Seven years is too long to wait for our water and sewerage schemes.  If we could do it in three years it would enable us to develop our county.</P>
      <P>In spite of this I want to thank the Minister and the Department on behalf of the people of Kerry for the great help they have and are giving us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker could be forgiven for his straying across into the health charges because it is difficult to believe that at one time the Minister for Local Government was also the Minister for Health and tried to combine these two terribly important functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is usually a very prolonged one in which most people take part.  This seems to me to emphasise the extreme importance of the Department of Local Government, an extraordinarily complex Department with its general policy decisions influencing in a very fundamental way the social amenities of the community, the essential amenities such as housing, planning, regional development, certain aesthetic values, the provision <Col N="1129" /> of roads, marginal responsibilities such as the quality of advertising, itinerants and then the very important question of the raising of funds in the form of rates in order to provide most of these services.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister in future consideration of his responsibilities in his Department would bear in mind that at a certain stage in our development it probably was necessary that certain local functions should be taken away from local councils, urban councils, county councils, city councils. That was in the early stages of the development of the State when there was a fair level of, I suppose, political illiteracy, or practically academic illiteracy.  That lead to many abuses. It led to a feeling in the central authority, in all parties, that local authorities were not fit to be trusted with the many responsibilities which they had, through no fault of their own but through historical development, through the lack of an understanding of the complexity of local government.  That then led to the evolution of the managerial system, to the development ultimately of a fairly tight structure of bureaucracy ending up in most of the complaints which the previous speaker referred to and the centralisation of authority in the Custom House.  There are historical and practical reasons for that and I would ask the Minister to start a rethinking about this whole problem because there have been changes.</P>
    <P>There is a much greater understanding in the periphery of the community of responsibilities of one kind or another.  There is a higher level of literacy.  There is a greater understanding and sense of responsibility in regard to local affairs.  There is a developing sense of community, an understanding of the need to collaborate and co-operate in order to try to improve society.  There is a greater awareness of the exciting possibilities that there are for people who tend to weld themselves together, irrespective of their political views, in a community sense in order to try, as the previous speaker said, to preserve the local amenities which they know so well and to develop them and to provide the various services which are <Col N="1130" /> required in a community.  The classical example at the moment &mdash; the one which I have in mind anyway &mdash; is in the city of Kilkenny where so many very important developments have taken place because of this new community awareness of one's responsibilities to the less well-off members of the community.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would reconsider the attitude of his Department to the local authority with a view to attempting to get, instead of this centralisation of power in his Department, which has taken place under all Governments, the creation, in some way, of a devolution of power from the centre to the periphery.  This would be a very healthy development and would lead to a greater interest by responsible people in this whole process of local government.  In a way the taking away of power has been a self-perpetuating process.  Without being disrespectful, the fact that that power is being taken away has led to members of councils to feel among themselves that they are really rubber stamps.  This tends to discourage people who might take an interest in local government from playing a role in the local community and society.  I know well that this is a terribly complicated problem and many socialist and capitalist societies, no matter what you may call them, have all attempted to move towards this concept of true democracy, of democratic structures, in our society.</P>
    <P>Quite what suits us here would be difficult to say with certainty, but I think the Minister should look again at the process that has taken place in recent years and which has ended up by him being the final authority, with too much power in his hands which, I think, he himself must find particularly worrying and difficult.  He is the head of a vast organisation, an enormous bureaucratic machine and nearly all Deputies of all parties said they find themselves being asked to take certain steps but when they take the steps there are delays or there is a reversal of a decision or there is some decision taken at the centre over which they have no power, no control.</P>
    <P>To some extent, the creation of regional groupings or the attempt to <Col N="1131" /> create groupings, is a desirable thing, indeed, and I do not agree with Deputies who were frightened of this.  It is a fair compromise.  The county boundary was an unrealistic thing.  The amalgamation of various regional groups could be very desirable and could lead to the creation of a sense of community within the regional groups.  However, frequently we find even in this kind of proposal, that the regional groupings are invariably subject to the control of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give this whole problem his serious consideration in an endeavour to see how a relatively tiny community such as ours could achieve a devolution of power towards the periphery?  Of course, there will be failings, mistakes will be made, wrong decisions taken and so on, but if it creates a healthy interest in public affairs among a greater number of people than are interested at the present time, it would be well worth the attempt.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows, and most Deputies agree, that there has been a great loss of faith in our parliamentary and local authority institutions.  The general feeling is that very little serious power rests either here or in the local authorities and there is a crisis in the whole idea of parliamentary democracy and local democracy as reflected in the local authorities &mdash; county councils and so on.  Can we carry on with this type of apparatus?  For instance, I find myself here talking to three or four people as a Parliament in session.  It is not just a reflection on myself: it happens to all of us.  Is it representative of democracy in action?  Is it something that is worth preserving if this is what it eventually seems to boil down to? Equally in local authorities, one finds himself all the time subject to the approval of the central authority.  Is that the type of local authority which is worthy of being maintained as representative democracy in any kind of community?</P>
    <P>The Minister has been mainly criticised in regard to his housing record. It has been practically all party criticism, rural and urban.  I am mainly concerned with the city of Dublin in <Col N="1132" /> which I represent a community which is predominantly working class.  I believe the Minister has been mesmerised by his own figures and statistics into believing that his record as Minister and the record of his Government have been successful ones.  I believe they have been total failures in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister represents a party which have a good record in relation to the problem of housing.  In the early thirties, his predecessors, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly and Mr. Seán MacEntee, had good records in relation to slum clearance and I think it can be said that, with the exception of the late Tim Murphy working in the Department of Local Government, a great part of the slum clearance was done by the early Ministers for Local Government in Fianna Fáil Governments but this, as in so many other aspects of Fianna Fáil policy, has slowed down and there is an element of complacency now in the Department of Local Government about the whole housing problem.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister to tell us that he has built so many houses and that he has built more this year than last year.  What we want to hear is the Minister say he has built enough houses, and that is what he has not said.  There are too many people still in the city of Dublin, in many of our large towns and in some parts of rural Ireland, who are living in conditions of which we should all be thoroughly ashamed.  There is gross overcrowding. The Minister has heard this on a number of occasions in his own constituency. If he wishes to look he will find it.  These are conditions in which human beings should not be asked to live.</P>
    <P>There are clearly substandard dwellings, unfit for human habitation on the one hand.  That is the minority of the position, but then we have the condition of large families living in flats for whom they were not designed and in which there is effective overcrowding. Because of that overcrowding there is considerable distress and unhappiness, and emotional disturbances with which we deal in St. Brendan's arise from the fact that <Col N="1133" /> parents are asked and encouraged to have large families and then when they have them they are not provided with housing facilities in which they can rear these large families in the conditions in which they should be brought up.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks and his colleagues tend to talk as if they were the first Fianna Fáil Ministers, as if they were neophytes in their Departments, as if this was a new and novel experience. The Government took office in 1932 and have held office nearly uninterruptedly in the meantime.  After 30 to 35 years in Government, this Fianna Fáil Minister should not come to us now and concede his figure of 8,000. Deputy Dowling spoke last night about proposals to build 19,000 houses; I accept his figure as correct.  I presume there is a good reason for building 19,000 houses.  Either 19,000 people need them badly at once or are in conditions that they will need them badly within the next four or five years.  However, let us take the figure of 8,000.  It is completely unforgivable that in a country which professes to be as well-off as we say we are&mdash;&ldquo;We have never had it so good&rdquo;.  &ldquo;We have never been so prosperous&rdquo;.  &ldquo;We have a booming and expanding economy&rdquo;&mdash; there are still even 8,000 families trying to bring up their children in substandard conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister uses the excuse that I have heard from every Minister over there, the excuse that we must cut our cloth according to our measure, that we can build only according to the capital available.  The Minister for Health would say the same in relation to health.  The Minister for Education would say the same in relation to education.  The Minister for Social Welfare would say the same about the old people.  They would all say that the money is not there in sufficient quantity.</P>
    <P>Most Fianna Fáil Ministers have given their lives to politics.  I am surprised that intelligent men and men who have given their lives to politics continually put forward as an excuse for their failure in their respective Departments to feed the aged or care for them, to educate the illiterate, to <Col N="1134" /> provide basic amenities of one kind or another&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would seem to be following a general argument rather than confining his remarks to the Estimate which is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says we cannot afford to build more houses.  I am sick and tired listening to that excuse from the Fianna Fáil Party because it is not the case: it is simply a way out of discharging their responsibilities to the community.  The Minister states he is limited by the capital available but, on all sides, enormous sums are being spent on the building of other than working-class houses.  My submission is that there is no shortage of capital or that, if there is a shortage of capital, it is because it is being misapplied, misused, and that there is no attempt to direct available capital for the purposes for which it should be used in a modern, advanced, western, civilised democracy, namely, to provide houses for the homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he is unable to provide houses because costs are going up.  He says he will now reduce the size for grant purposes in order to encourage the building of these houses: he will reduce the volume of the houses to so many square feet.  That is a retrograde decision.  It reminds me of the old window taxes which led to the reduction of proper ventilation in houses.  Under this, the man with a large family will find himself in a house which is too small.  This is not the answer.  The answer for the provision of working-class houses is the control of the building industry.  The Minister is the planning authority.  He can lay down the total number of houses. If he has not the power he should take that power.  I am certain this House would give it to him.  He should lay down the minimum number in respect of a particular type of house to be built.  He says he is competing for planning staff and engineering staff with private enterprise.  That statement is its own commentary on the whole concept of private enterprise capitalism in Ireland.  Bad and all as is the record of the Minister for Local Government, if <Col N="1135" /> it were not for the Department of Local Government, virtually no working-class houses would be built by private enterprise capitalism because there is not enough profit in it.</P>
    <P>This lack of sense of responsibility is directly due to the basic belief which the Minister has in the whole concept of private enterprise capitalism in Ireland. They will build offices.  They will build for insurance corporations and for banks.  They will build luxury houses, luxury bungalows, luxury flats but they will not build working-class houses.  This is a product of private enterprise capitalism and it could happen only in this kind of society.  It is just one other of these evils.</P>
    <P>One of the planning mistakes, particularly in the city of Dublin, has been the decision to destroy many of the local communities within the boundary of our city.  Frequently people from a place such as Ringsend, which was a very old fishing village, going back over the centuries, are asked to go out to the periphery of the city but they would sooner live in a hovel in Ringsend than go to what they consider the outskirts of the city, whether it is Coolock or Ballyfermot. There is not only the factor that they grew up and have their roots and associations there, but there is also the fact that living on the periphery of the city and working, say, at the docks or in a glass bottle factory in the city adds enormously to their expenses because of transport costs on a very inefficient public transport service.  I am referring to the CIE public transport service which is notoriously inefficient and costly.  This general policy of developing the periphery of the city rather than developing within the city, at City Quay, Ringsend, Pearse Street and so on, was a major planning blunder.  The city of Dublin and the communities living within it should have been preserved rather than extensively developing the periphery.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also responsible for recreational facilities, particularly swimming pools.  In what I suppose was the usual pre-election euphoria, Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Local Government, at the time, called on all <Col N="1136" /> and sundry to submit plans and schemes for which he would provide the money to build various social amenities, particularly swimming pools.  The progress, as outlined by the Minister, has been very slow and Dublin city still lacks an adequate number of swimming pools.  I do not know if the Minister has never gone along Sandymount Strand on a summer day and seen the unfortunate people walking out what seems like a couple of miles to go for a swim. This happens every time the tide is out. There was once an old swimming pool on the strand.  I wonder if the Minister has any plans in the reasonably near future for the provision of some facilities for the youngsters of Dublin for whom Sandymount Strand offers the only bathing facilities they can get during the summer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also responsible for roads and here I should like to pay him a compliment for the condition of the county roads.  There is no doubt that the roads from Dublin to Cork, Galway and Limerick are excellent and that magnificent work was done by the Department of Local Government and the local authorities in the provision of these roads.  No one could seriously complain about them as they are a pleasure to drive on.  However, the Minister is still left with the problem of the Dublin county roads including, of course, the road with which I am familiar, the Bray Road.  This road must have a very high accident rate and I should be very surprised to find the position otherwise.  A very small part of it is a dual carriageway but outside of that it is much the same road as it has been for the past 100 years.  It is now carrying an enormous volume of traffic, particularly in the summertime, not only because of tourists but also because of the development of Brittas, the great weekend outlet for Dublin people, and it is difficult to credit the density of present-day traffic and its great dangers.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister answering a question recently about the whole business of planning and developing and he gave me the impression that he was in no great hurry to do much <Col N="1137" /> about it.  At the moment the position is that if at Bray one gets behind a sand-lorry going at 15 miles per hour one is likely to be still behind it when one reaches Donnybrook.  There has been an increase in the number of motor cars on the road and the speeds of which they are capable.  We had the appalling, blundering mistake of the &ldquo;Andrewsisation&rdquo; of CIE; the appalling blunder of closing down the Harcourt Street line and the curtailment of the small suburban services between Greystones and Dublin.  The closing down and curtailment of those services threw an enormous amount of traffic on to a road already greatly overburdened, due simply to the various factors I have mentioned already, tourism, the development of Brittas, the increase in ownership of cars and so on.  An apparent economy was made by the closing down of these rail services but this was at the expense of causing the resultant traffic chaos on the Bray Road.  There was a case for curtailment and for closing down but it could only be justified by developing roads of the quality one sees, say, between here and Galway &mdash; good, wide dual carriageways meant to carry fast-moving traffic and slow-moving traffic at the side.  However, no attempt was made to offset the serious consequences which were the result of the curtailment of the rail services.</P>
    <P>The problem is a very serious and urgent one and I would ask the Minister to give it the immediate consideration it requires.  At the moment the Bray Road is a twisted, narrow, dangerous, badly surfaced road and one of the consequences is the dreadfully high accident rate which the Minister has had to concede.  Admittedly, the death and injury rate has gone down but it is still very high.  Quite obviously the big factor in the accident rate is that of trying to drive after the consumption of alcohol.  One can see the extraordinary sight of hundreds of cars parked outside publichouses on Friday night all of which will be driven home by persons in various stages of intoxication.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister brought in the breathalyser tests but this is something that should have been done <Col N="1138" /> years ago.  In 1957, I introduced a Private Member's Motion on that issue and, as far as I can remember, I had one supporter in the entire House.  I am glad, also, that the driving test was introduced.  Other countries have proved the benefit of such tests and also the breathalyser tests.  There are many factors which contribute to the cause of accidents but it is quite obvious that people who go into a publichouse at 5 o'clock in the evening and stay there drinking alcohol until 11 o'clock are incapable of driving home and in particular are incapable of driving on many of our urban roads. With regard to the driving test, the frightening failure figure of 54 per cent as given by the Minister makes one wonder how many of us who obtained driving licences before the test was introduced would pass the test.  It also makes one wonder just how much bad driving there is still and what, if anything, the Minister can do about it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is using the medium of television in attempting to educate the public to be more road conscious in a community in which walking or driving on the roads is becoming a greater danger to life.  It is good that children in schools are also being educated in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister discussed the whole question of regional development and here again I must talk about a general principle.  Mr. Seán Lemass was a person who I believed tried very hard, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to resolve this worry referred to by the Minister when he talked about greater and greater conurbation and the decline in some areas, particularly some rural areas.  Mr. Lemass attempted to do something about this in his Underdeveloped Areas Act but the sad truth is that his attempt failed. We have had this virtually uncontrolled growth of Dublin and this is one of the things which create the Minister's problems.  The Minister is talking about a report that was published in 1964 telling him that he should build 17,000 houses each year but Dublin has changed a lot since then as has the problem but, unfortunately, the Minister <Col N="1139" /> still appears to be working to that blueprint.</P>
    <P>Despite the attempts of the former Taoiseach to try to draw off this very unhealthy growth of Dublin at the expense of rural areas the fact is that there is still this apparently uncontrolled migration of the population from rural Ireland into the cities and, particularly, the city of Dublin.  Again, there is this great conflict between a socialist and a capitalist society where the Minister has not got power to tell an industrialist to establish his industry in such a place and nowhere else because the industrialist has a right to say that he will not establish it in such a place because he could not make a profit there.  The social content of the functions of the industrialist does not enter into his consideration.  The Minister can encourage industrialists but he cannot make them build in a certain place in a rural area if they decide they cannot make a profit there and it is profit and not the social need that is the determining factor.  We must all be concerned with the social need of trying to preserve some sort of viable population in rural Ireland.  People will not sit there looking at the scenery for the rest of their lives.  They must have jobs and amenities but these jobs are not being provided by private enterprise, with a few exceptions.</P>
    <P>Again, that brings us back to whether it is a question of the Minister looking for money for houses or looking for a curb on the development of the greater conurbation.  He is faced with the same fundamental problem all the time.  He can encourage, he can entice, he can blackmail or provide incentives but he has not the power to direct.  If, say, the Minister had wished to preserve the town written about by Mr. John Healy, he would have had no power to do so and that is true all the time of the small towns in rural Ireland.  This brings the Minister and all of us up against this basic problem as to what extent one should have the authority to direct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister shares my views in regard to preserving the Gaeltacht, providing employment for the people there and looking on the Gaeltacht as a sort of national park where the unfortunate natives live and the tourists come and see them. The Gaeltacht is a place where the people must have the same quality of life, the same amenities, recreation and standard of living that we have in the rest of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is facing a problem in this regard and I would give Carraroe as a classic example, where there has been a considerable expansion in job opportunities because of the establishment <Col N="1141" /> of a number of factories.  It is the one town in the Connemara Gaeltacht in which there has been an expansion in the population of young people, in the size of the school and so on.  However, the sad sequel is one that probably concerns the Minister as much as it concerns me, in that Carraroe is becoming an English-speaking town. How does he reconcile his attempt to preserve the language in this area with the effort to expand job opportunities? I have been going there for 20 or 25 years and, although I may be wrong, I got the impression that less and less Irish is spoken in Carraroe but that it is a much more prosperous little town than it was before.  That is one of the problems that face us all in our attempt to bring prosperity to these areas in which some of us are probably a little bit more interested than in others.</P>
    <P>In relation to the preservation of Georgian Dublin, the Minister called these houses our priceless national assets, and he is quite right.  I must confess to a certain ambivalance in regard to the question of Georgian houses and in this I am being reasonably consistent, because I remember some time ago when the late Seán Dunne had a motion on the question of the preservation of Georgian houses in Fitzwilliam Square, although I supported him in the end, I was not quite sure about the situation. I thought that to preserve Georgian Dublin in the way that, say, Gardiner Street, was preserved would be a fiasco. The people living in Gardiner Street are probably very much more uncomfortable and less well off than the people in Macken Street flats or even Ballymun flats.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I thought in relation to the Georgian houses occupied by the ESB that the policy was wrong for the reason that they lacked any life.  They were simply offices, most uncomfortable offices, for anyone trying to work in them, and probably from a time and motion point of view, uneconomic. They were also aesthetically wrong.  I remember they took the knockers off the doors and did not bother to paint the doors.  The whole of the street, compared with Fitzwilliam Square where people are living and where they care for the houses and paint them, seemed to be very run down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> Even though I did not think the approach to Gardiner Street or the approach of the ESB to their possession was the answer, I believe that a place like Merrion Square or Fitzwilliam Square should be preserved. They are very beautiful and their demolition would be a retrograde decision on the part of the community. The other day the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Noel Lemass, became angry and said it would cost £40,000 to preserve the Hume Street house that had been the subject of discussion. That £40,000 is not a great deal of money, in a city which is going to go on for 200 or 300 years, for a possession as lovely as some of these houses are.  The equation should not be £40,000 for the preservation of this house as against the building of a few working class houses.  The Minister said in his own speech that these are priceless possessions.  It seems to me a little bit like as if I were to go into the Museum, take all the Georgian silver, melt it down and sell it to anybody who would but it.  If the Minister must sell these houses he should sell them with the provison that whoever buys them reconstructs and redecorates them.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister not consider keeping these houses and developing them as a property like No. 10 Downing Street for a Taoiseach's residence or something like that, putting in some of the treasures we have, the products of Irish craftsmen over the centuries; or would he consider making a Georgian museum out of one of them and putting these treasures into it so that people visiting Ireland would see them? In that way it might even pay its way, if that is a particularly important consideration from the Minister's point of view.  As I say, I had a certain ambivalence about this, but I came down on the side that I would hate to see Merrion Square or Fitzwilliam Square interfered with.</P>
    <P>At the same time I always feel that to some extent it is a criticism of a generation that it cannot in its own time, from its own artistry and skilled professionalism, create something which is very beautiful for its own time.  This clinging on to old things <Col N="1143" /> simply because they are old is just not good enough.  If we had a quality of architecture and craftsmanship on a level which would create something which people would look back on and say that in the seventies there was a renaissance in Irish artistry of one kind or another, just as we now look back on the Georgian period, then I could see a case for replacing some of these Georgian houses.  But when one looks around the city at the type and quality of the buildings being erected &mdash; with the exception of about five which seem to me, at any rate, to have artistic merit, and in that five I include the Carroll's building and the Goulding's building &mdash; I do not think we have the quality or the professional knowledge which justifies the replacement at present of many of the Georgian buildings.  I was interested in the comment made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance on the £40,000 pittance because of my recollection of how the people of Warsaw, after the terrible destruction of their lovely city, recreated it, taking every piece of rubble they could find and putting it back together again.  I think we should have some pride in preserving what beauty we have in Dublin.</P>
    <P>All Deputies have dealt with the traffic problem in Dublin.  I do not suppose anyone has produced an answer for the Minister, and I do not pretend I can do so.  It has been suggested that Grafton Street be made into a covered arcade which would result in the elimination of traffic.  This would mean that most of us would have to do more walking than we do at present.  A number of European cities have refused to allow traffic into the city centres.  I am sure the Minister knows very much more about this than I do but I am surprised he has not taken steps to deal with the gradual slowing-down to a halt of the traffic in the city of Dublin particularly during the peak periods when it is almost impossible to make any progress at all.</P>
    <P>Nearly every Deputy has spoken about the rating system.  The whole idea that the poor counties such as Leitrim should have to attempt to <Col N="1144" /> provide the same quality of service as counties like Meath and Kildare is anomalous, unfair and inefficient.  The Minister must deal with the high level of rates as a matter of urgency.  I do not know if it was in another period of pre-election euphoria, to which we have grown so accustomed, but something was to be done urgently about the rating system.  I remember the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley talking about his idea of a rating system in relation to health charges.  I would remind the Minister of an excellent provision in the 1947 Health Act whereby the Central Fund took over the responsibility for rates by a certain date.  The resultant expansion in services was absolutely dramatic because, of course, the Central Fund was paying for the services.  There are precedents for the taking over by a central authority of the paying of rates and I think this is something which has become very urgent indeed.  Every Deputy is concerned about the absurdly high incidence of rates in some areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is doing something about the itinerants.  It is many years ago since I first started working with a young man named Grattan Puxom &mdash; he has since left the country in disgust &mdash; with the itinerants. At that time to concern oneself with the problem of itinerants was one of the reasons for being described as a communist.  I am glad to know it has now become a respectable thing.  I think the Minister is genuinely concerned about itinerants and I hope he will be successful in his attempts to get something done for them.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the temporary site proposals do not lead to the development of a ghetto-type situation because the youngster who grows up in a kind of ghetto is not like the rest of the children in the area.  I think it tends to isolate them from the rest of the community. The Minister has said that something like 400 itinerants have been absorbed into the community in ordinary houses.  I know that these temporary sites are infinitely better than the conditions under which many of the itinerants have lived on the side of the road, but does the Minister believe <Col N="1145" /> they must go through this phase before they move into an ordinary house?  I think they should be absorbed, if possible, straight into the community without having to live in this sort of ghetto-type settlement in the intervening period, although I think conditions there are far better than those in which the people have lived and reared their children.  It must be remembered that infant mortality rate amongst itinerants is appallingly high.  Very often, when I visited itinerants on the sites, I was ankle-deep in mud before I got near the caravans and tents.</P>
    <P>The hostility towards itinerants by local residents is an extraordinary manifestation in a Christian community. It reminds me of the argument put to me way back in connection with the provision of working-class houses &mdash; I am sure the Minister has heard this &mdash; that if you give them baths they will put coal into them.  It sounds a silly argument now but it was put forward seriously to me.  It is equally absurd to suggest that if you put itinerants into houses they will not know how to use them.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that itinerants are ordinary citizens and that most of us were only a very short time ago, for various historical reasons, in just as poor circumstances as they are.  They are not different citizens in any way but they appreciate the comfort and the amenities of living in a properly furnished, properly decorated house, like the rest of us do.</P>

      <P>The first thing that I should like to talk about is the delay that is experienced by many people in the payment of grants by the Department of Local Government. Some time ago I dealt with a case where the inspector called last October, told the applicant the job was well done, passed it, signed the form, the applicant signed the form, and the form was sent to the Department.  I was told in January that this did not necessarily mean that the house had been passed.  I replied that the form which had been signed by the inspector and the applicant, had been sent to the Department and that the applicant, who had not been told of any difficulties, <Col N="1146" /> had not received the money.  Now, in the middle of February the applicant is being told that payment will be made.</P>
      <P>The Minister, who is a hardworking man, should take note of such cases.  Such delay is very unfair.  I passed one of the applicant's letters on to the Minister in the case that I have mentioned.  I cite only one instance but there are many.  A hardworking farmer in County Sligo or County Leitrim should not have to wait from 5th October until 1st March to receive the grant while the builders' suppliers are asking for payment of the account. This delay is a cause of annoyance to persons who have made a great effort to reconstruct their houses.  The Minister should keep a check on this matter and see that delay does not occur in the payment of the grant.  The grant should be paid within three weeks of the receipt of the form duly signed by the applicant and the inspector.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to have inspections carried out more expeditiously. When planning permission is lodged with the local authority and the application is forwarded to the Department, inspection should take place as soon as possible so that the work can proceed.  Every Deputy has the experience of being asked to have inspection carried out where the contractor is ready to carry out the work. The inspectors are hardworking young men who have a very wide field to cover but even at the expense of increasing the inspectorate, inspection should be carried out promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last few months there has been a serious situation in Sligo town due to a water shortage.  Great progress has been made there in house building.  Many schemes have been completed.  However, when the houses were built, there was no water supply for them.  If a farmer, businessman or anybody else living in a remote area builds a house, he will not get a grant unless there is a water supply.  In Sligo town, where hundreds of houses have been completed, compulsory powers have to be used to have the regional water scheme carried out.  Lough Gill is only a stone's throw from Sligo <Col N="1147" /> and it should not have been necessary to wait until 1970 to have the water supply scheme put into operation.  Sites for reservoirs are being compulsorily acquired.  A small amount of compensation is offered for three acres. Negotiation with the landholder will cause further delay.  The Minister should take the necessary steps to remedy the matter.  Sligo town, which has suffered so much from a shortage of houses, now has houses that have no water supply.  It has been represented to me that families of 12 and 14 are living in houses with no water supply.  In some cases the supply of water is so limited that toilets can be flushed only once a day.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Minister's predecessor told us in this House that every house would have water and sewerage.  I can tell the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, who is in the House now, that but for the group water schemes there would have been very little progress made in the west of Ireland in the matter of water supply.  Water has been laid on in hundreds of houses as a result of group schemes.  I would ask the Minister to speed up the provision of regional water supply schemes.</P>
    <P>The Seafield Hotel in County Sligo is only about 650 yards from a water supply scheme but for some reason or other the local authority will not give permission to the proprietor to have water supplied to his hotel.  That gentleman is very disappointed.  The hotel is in a tourist area.  He has said that he has made several approaches in regard to this matter but so far has failed to secure a water supply.  These are the things that cause discontent.  I am not blaming the Minister for this.  There should have been forward planning so that people would not find themselves sadly disappointed.  The hotel proprietor to whom I have referred bought a hotel and thought that he would have no trouble in securing a water supply in view of all the talk about a water supply being available.</P>
    <P>Despite the number of houses erected recently in Sligo there is still a housing shortage.  There is also a shortage of water supply.  I hope that after another <Col N="1148" /> few years we will see an end to that. Reasonably good progress is being made there and I hope there will be no slowing down.  For the past ten years the hardships endured by some people could hardly be described.  When they got married they had to live with their in-laws in one room, or in some uninhabitable place which was not safe for the parents or the children.  Whatever about building hotels for tourists, let us put houses for those people first.</P>
    <P>In that town we have plans on paper for the erection of a 14-storey Great Southern Hotel.  The Government may mean well, but the money which would go into the erection of a 14-storey modern hotel in Sligo town would solve the housing problem for the very hard hit families there.  We are not that badly off for hotels.  We have a fine Great Southern hotel there to serve the needs of the tourists for another few years at least.  This project is being left over for the moment and I hope the Minister will leave it over until other more needy problems are dealt with.  We like to cater for our tourists and for the tourist trade, but these families are suffering under these conditions for 12 months of the year, year in year out.  We should put them first and think of the tourists afterwards.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are told that money is scarce.  I do not think money is scarce.  I do not think it could possibly be scarce when you consider the amount of money the Government are taking in, and when you consider how the country is taxed.  There is the turnover tax and there is all the money that is subscribed to the local authorities. There is all the money that goes into the Central Fund and there is also the cost of transport.  What a colossal amount of money all these bring in. Even the lowest paid employee in the country today has to pay income tax. Every businessman in the country is a tax collector for the Government. Whether he is big or small the cheque goes in at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>More of this money should be channelled into housing and into roads. There are many complaints in my constituency about the many roads that are not yet rolled or tarred.  We <Col N="1149" /> have about 700 miles of roads that need to be black topped.  These are the roads which will either force people to leave the country or encourage them to stay.  It will encourage any small farmer to stay in a rural area if he has a tarred road coming up to his home.  He feels terribly neglected if he discovers that no effort is being made, despite the big spending, to provide this type of road for him.  The money for black topping these roads should come from the Road Fund or from a central fund.  This would relieve the ratepayers who are overtaxed at the moment.</P>
    <P>When the local authority or the Department require a plot of land for any purpose, such as a reservoir or for road making, they should go to the person who owns the land and try to reach agreement.  If agreement cannot be reached then they are free to take it over.  It is hardly fair to decide suddenly to use their compulsory powers and take land from anybody without due notice.  I have a case in mind which I hope will be settled amicably.  I hope that progress in the establishment of this reservoir will not be held up.</P>
    <P>Some progress is being made in providing county council houses for small farmers but it is slow due to the fact that the local authorities are not giving a proper price to the contractors. When a contractor is asked to tender he is inclined to tender at a very low price so that his tender will be lower than others.  The result is that he cuts it very fine.  He should be paid what it usually takes to erect a five-roomed bungalow, that would be in the region of £2,500.  I do not think any of them are getting £2,500 for a county council house built on an acre of land acquired from a farmer.  The Minister should see that the contractors are given a substantial figure for the erection of these houses and then contractors would tender more freely than they are doing at the moment.</P>
    <P>In Sligo town, which has become a growth centre of late, we have a traffic problem.  The chief superintendent and his staff are doing their utmost to solve it but, during peak periods, it certainly is a problem and I am afraid <Col N="1150" /> will be a problem for some time to come.  Many changes have been made recently which have resulted in a smoother traffic flow throughout the town.  However, once the tourist season commences, Sligo will be in trouble all over again.  The problem is a very difficult one.</P>
    <P>Very often when a serious accident takes place one or two cars may be wrecked.  Those cars are left on the side of the road until the case is decided. Very often we read that such cars are a complete write-off.  Immediately the case is disposed of the cars are disposed of for perhaps £5 or £20, subsequently repaired, sold for a considerably higher figure and put on the road again.  There should be some check on this and there should be some law to prevent such cars going back on to the road.  They constitute a hazard to other road users.  This matter was brought to my notice recently. I should like the Minister to check on it and to introduce the necessary legislation to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we have a great number of bridges.  Most of them are pretty old.  Some of them become undermined and collapse.  The cost of replacement is pretty heavy.  It may cost anything up to £5,000.  This is money which could be well spent in other more worthwhile directions. These bridges should be inspected regularly and repairs carried out in time to prevent complete collapse.  In that way money could be saved, money which could be devoted to other local government purposes.</P>
    <P>Rates are a very big problem in my constituency.  In Leitrim the rate is £4 10s in the £.  I think that the day is coming when the people will make a stand and say they cannot afford to meet any more increases in rates.  In wealthy counties, be they agricultural or industrial, the people can afford to meet the rates.  If the policy is to keep these people in these underdeveloped areas then the Minister will have to provide some method of enabling the people to meet the burden of rates.  I remember a Minister for Local Government who issued a circular saying Leitrim would have to provide road material at the same cost as other <Col N="1151" /> counties.  Big modern machinery was moved into two or three quarries.  The smaller quarries were closed.  Now these small quarries were the same as a factory to the working people in the county.  That was about ten years ago. Never since has there been any steady employment and, because of that, hundreds of them have gone away to England.  If they had this three, four or five months work in a local quarry they would certainly have remained. There is no comparison between Leitrim and other counties, but the Minister failed to take that into consideration. Leitrim, and counties like it, should get special consideration. They cannot be compared with counties which are highly industrialised or very viable from the point of view of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I have a strong objection to prefabs. There are prefabs now all over the country.  They serve as extensions to schools, to colleges and to county council offices.  It would be better economy in the long run to erect proper permanent extensions.  As time goes on these prefabs will constitute a problem. They are quite costly initially.  They should not be encouraged.  I am a farmer and I certainly would not like to spend from nine to five o'clock every day in these prefab offices, crammed with old records, with barely enough space to move around.  The policy should be to get a permanent job done and provide proper classrooms and offices.  If one wants a good return one must provide good living and working accommodation.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be an increase in the road grants in order to keep the roads up to their present standard.  The roads will not be able to stand up to present standards if a greater amount of work is not done.  Naturally enough there must be less work done because wages have been increased and the grants have not been increased.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the men and women who are called for driving tests.  We know those inspectors are very conscientious men but in many cases some of the applicants for driving licences might be much better than those who have been driving for 20 <Col N="1152" /> years.  It nearly always happens that you do not get the licence on the first test and you have to be called back for the second test.  I would like to know the amount of money which is collected from people who undergo driving tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are few Departments which mean so much to public representatives, especially local representatives, as the Department we are discussing just now.  I am sure we all react to this as it affects our own area and our own community.  I suppose a most important aspect for those of us who live in cities is the eradication of the slum problem and the progress made in housing.  In this regard there are two view points.  One is where you focus all the attention on the very bad cases which unfortunately still exist in our midst and pinpoint those as if they were in the same condition now as they were five, ten or 20 years ago. The other viewpoint, of course, is to take the position as it was ten or 20 years ago and see the progress that has been made since.  Speaking for my own area, there is not the slightest doubt that tremendous progress has been made.  Maybe it has not been as rapid as we would like.  The ideal situation would be one in which everybody in need of a house would be able to have one, but unfortunately that is not the position.</P>
      <P>In Cork city there is one very enlightening thing happening at present. We have a waiting list of nearly 1,500 people and when houses become available the person at the head of the list is notified that a house has been designated for him.  However, the extraordinary position now is that the house is refused for one reason or another by as many as five applicants. Those are people who are all eligible for housing.  This was completely unheard of a few years ago when people would take boxes if they were more suitable than what they were living in up to then.  This goes to prove that people are more choosy nowadays. They are not in the same desperate need as they were.  That is something on which we should congratulate ourselves and be thankful for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister and <Col N="1153" /> his Department for letting us avail of the NBA scheme.  It has changed the whole viewpoint regarding housing in Cork.  We are at present getting more houses at the end of certain months than we were able to build ourselves in 12 calendar months in the last seven, eight or ten years.  They have met with criticism but that is natural enough because people who are anxious to see things done in a hurry are not too anxious to see the difficulties.  Actually the terrain in Cork is rather difficult because of the many hills around it and a great deal of earth has to be removed before you can start servicing sites for housing.  The NBA guaranteed us 1,800 houses within the next two years and even if the start was slow they are now catching up on their target and if they maintain their present rate of progress they will be able to fulfil their promise.</P>
    <P>I should say that this is completely independent of the building sources we had engaged in the local authority up to the advent of the NBA.  I would like the Minister to consider if there is any way of avoiding the frustration local authorities experience in having to send every scheme for houses up to Dublin to have it approved and sanctioned, sometimes altered very slightly and returned and again after a considerable period sent back to Dublin for another examination.  I am speaking on behalf of the citizens of Cork county and Cork city.  Surely we have architects and engineers who are highly paid and highly efficient in their profession, and having built something like 8,000 houses in various schemes in Cork in the last 30 years, they should be able by now to produce a type of house which will be satisfactory both to the people who will be living in it and to the Department who are responsible for paying some of the money for it.</P>
    <P>Surely in the case of a city like Cork, with a population of 23,000 people, the Department might expedite matters by sending one of their officials to Cork to consult with the city architects and engineers and right whatever may be wrong in the Cork City Hall in the course of a few days.  Instead of that, as we know too well, <Col N="1154" /> the plans go up to Dublin, something is altered, they are returned to be rectified and then they come back again and I need not tell you the people in Dublin are not waiting with idle hands for those requests to come back and forth.  They have other work on hands and when those plans come back from Cork and elsewhere they have to take their place in the queue and sometimes are not reached for many months.  Therefore, I feel it would expedite matters considerably for the Department and the local authority if my suggestion was followed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the encouragement in the Minister's speech to the local authorities to aim at a more modest type house.  In Cork we have felt for years that the terrace-type house is much more preferable to certain sections of our community than flats, high rise or otherwise.  As a matter of fact in Cork we find that people do not take to high rise flats.  They much prefer a house of their own as long as it has sufficient accommodation and the amenity of a bathroom.  The terrace-type house with an enclosed area in which children can play is preferable in many instances to the high rise flats.  I am therefore glad to see that the Minister is going to encourage the building of more modern type houses.  When I say that I do not want to be taken by anybody as advocating an inferior type house for the local authority tenants because that is not so.</P>
    <P>When I first entered Cork Corporation many years ago three bedroom houses were built at a cost of £800.  A similar house now costs approximately £4,200.  I doubt whether these new houses will last as long as the older ones.  Cork Corporation keep a record of all those who apply for houses. They have had up to 3,000 applicants on their files at times.  Cork County Council do not keep records in that way.  When they feel houses are needed in a district they make a survery and invite eligible people to apply for houses.  The officials inform the county council that, having made a survey, they find 15 families are eligible and in need of houses.  The county council put in motion the machinery <Col N="1155" /> to build 15 houses.  It is often four years at least, and sometimes eight years, before the 15 houses are ready for occupation.  Sanction must be obtained from the Department.  The site must be acquired and serviced.  Documents are sent up to Dublin several times to various Departments before permission is granted to tender for the houses.  By the time the houses are completed some of the original applicants have died or gone away.  People who are considered more in need of housing have moved into the district and sometimes get the houses.  The unfortunate people who applied in the first instance often do not get houses at all.  I am criticising the machinery we have inherited for dealing with housing applications.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to deal as sympathetically as he can with applications for water and sewerage. People will not stay in rural areas unless they have the ordinary amenities, such as water, which are now regarded as essential in a civilised community.  There are many people in County Cork who are still without water.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has such a sympathetic approach to the difficulties of the religious Orders and others who are housing elderly people.  The housing of our elderly people is a great problem at the present time.  People are living longer.  There is not much use in keeping people alive if we have not proper accommodation for them when they are old.  I was inclined to blame the younger generation for not looking after their parents but I realise that it is not always easy.  In many instances the old person, especially if bedridden, is not good company for a young, growing family living in cramped conditions.  Sometimes it is imperative that institutional care should be provided.  In Cork city there are a few such homes which are second to none.  I am glad to hear the Minister saying he is prepared to help such homes in every possible way. If the religious Orders did not house the old people the costs to the Exchequer and to the local authorities would be very much greater.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> I have spoken already about local authority housing in Cork city.  There has been a phenomenal change in the housing situation in Cork over the last ten years.  In 1956-60 the number of houses built in the private sector was 27, 18, 15 and eight houses.  In the last four years the corresponding number of houses built was 187, 426, 397, and 554.  The last figure of 554 represents the number of houses built last year when 150 houses more than ever before were built in the private sector.  I find this very encouraging. I have always advocated the desirability of people owning their own houses.  It makes them better citizens because they feel they have a stake in the country.  They have a sense of security.  We all welcome the development in Cork.  This development is due to the availability of grants and other encouragements from the Department. Speaking of grants, I sometimes wonder if a grant is the best possible way of helping a person.  My experience is that the grant is sometimes swallowed up by extra features, which were not part of the original estimate, being added to the house.</P>
    <P>The owner-tenant often does not benefit from the grant.  Perhaps, the Minister would examine, as an alternative, a system under which a loan could be given at a cheaper rate of interest.  Seven or eight years ago Cork Corporation adopted this suggestion and decided on a grading scale for people getting loans to buy their houses.  The scale went from 3½ per cent to 7 per cent.  The corporation had many applications for such loans. This scheme cost money but the money was well spent.  Reducing the rate of interest over 30 years would result in considerable saving to the house-builder and tenant.  Such a scheme is worth examining as an alternative to paying a grant of £250 or £500.  On a £4,000 house the price rises to £4,500 once the grant is given.</P>
    <P>Rates are a sore point with everybody. We all welcome the new regulations whereby the local authorities are allowed to remit rates for people who find them a heavy financial burden.  Many people in my area have been relieved of rates.  Some of the <Col N="1157" /> people never got assistance from a public authority or charitable organisation in their lives.  They would not know how to go about seeking help. Some of them were too proud to do so.  They belong to a generation who were self-reliant.  Such people found it hard to make ends meet.  Many of them are, without doubt, among the worst-off sections of our community. These people often owned the houses they were living in but did not have enough to eat.  Paying rates in these cases was an intolerable burden.  I am glad that the new regulation makes it possible for us to relieve people in such cases and this is very welcome.</P>
    <P>We have heard about differential rents.  I think Cork Corporation was first in the country to use differential rents experimentally.  We have always found this a desirable system in letting local authority houses.  It meant that the man with the small income paid a small rent and the man with a greater income paid more.  Recently we revised the scheme and incurred a certain amount of criticism because we have four bedroomed centrally heated houses where the maximum rent goes up to £8 a week.  That evoked great criticism but what is not said is that the tenant must have at least £60 a week income before he will be charged £8 a week.</P>
    <P>A £60 a week income is possible for a man who might have one or two sons as tradesmen and who might be a tradesman himself with, perhaps, a daughter working.  When the children marry and the tenant and his wife are left as old age pensioners the rent of the same house can be as low as 7/6 a week, if the income justifies it.  There is a built-in insurance policy in the differential rent that gives security that a man will not have in any other house and certainly not as tenant of any private landlord.  We have every reason to be justifiably proud of the way the differential rents have worked in Cork. At present we have between 6,000 and 7,000 houses on differential rents.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious that every encouragement should be given to local authority tenants to purchase their own houses.  They should be encouraged just as much as the man who can <Col N="1158" /> afford to build his own house.  This makes for a better citizen who feels his home is his castle and can be handed down to whoever he likes.  I trust the Minister and the Department will exhort local authorities to make the terms for tenants as easy as possible.</P>
    <P>There was mention of itinerants and here, again, I can say that, acting on the Minister's advice, Cork Corporation planned six sites around the city perimeter.  They prepared and equipped one of them in the Ballinure area of Blackrock.  Having done so, our experience is that providing a site is not the answer but the solution depends on where the site is situated.  The itinerants in Cork will go to sites near their usual camping grounds but will not move to another part of the suburbs, desirable though it may be in its proximity to the city centre, as some would think.  They have their own reasons but they prefer to stay out of the encampment and live on the traditional site.  We are learning by our mistake and the next camp we equip will be nearer the traditional site.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the only solution to this problem is to integrate the itinerants into the community.  We have done that in Cork over the years and generally we find they have made excellent tenants.  We took them from among those camping on the outskirts of the city for a considerable time.  We judiciously selected those who had been there a long time and gave them houses which were not located in any particular area.  They were housed as houses became vacant and, by and large, we are told they are acceptable and desirable tenants.  Of course, there have been exceptions but there are also exceptions among those who are not itinerants.</P>
    <P>In passing, I want to mention swimming pools, playing fields and parks. If you want a healthy community you must aim at having healthy minds in healthy bodies.  We hear a good deal about malicious damage and drug taking and about the weaknesses and temptations of the age in which we live but I believe provision of swimming pools, parks and playing fields would help to provide healthy minds and healthy bodies.  Like other <Col N="1159" /> speakers, I am disappointed at the slow progress in the provision of swimming pools.  We do not want Olympic style swimming pools all over the country but we must make up our minds on what we do want.  I suggest it is only a waste of money to provide outdoor swimming pools.  That might be wrong if I were speaking of inland places far from the coast or from waterways.  Perhaps, such places would need an outdoor pool but most places, including Cork and Dublin, need indoor, heated swimming pools.</P>
    <P>I was amazed some years ago to hear a very prominent Dublin public representative say that they did not need swimming pools in Dublin because the sea was so near.  You can only use the sea for a couple of months of the year and you cannot take schoolchildren in classes and teach them swimming and lifesaving at that time. The schools are on holidays at the time when you can swim in the sea. Also, it is desirable that teachers should be able to take children to indoor baths during the nine or ten months they are at school and teach them how to swim properly and save life.</P>
    <P>The Minister has encouraged local authorities to provide open spaces and I hope he will see that they do. Pollution, especially in relation to the proposed smelter in Cork, was mentioned.  The people of Cork generally felt quite sure that the county manager, who is the planning authority and who is a very careful and strict man, would not allow any industry to be set up that could cause undue pollution and that he would take cognisance of every proposal made by the smelter company.  I attended the press conference given by the smelter company and they had experts from Britain and the continent present.  After the managing director had spoken for half an hour and explained that local fears were entirely false since the smelter would not be oil-burning, coke-or coal-burning, as anticipated, but would be electrically worked, not a single question was asked of the experts.  Nobody denies or wants to deny the interest and the concern of those who wanted to be certain that <Col N="1160" /> nothing of an objectionable nature would be allowed to come into that beautiful part of Cork harbour.  I think they are now satisfied that such will not be the case.</P>
    <P>There is something which is near to my heart and I wonder if the Minister would be brave enough to tackle it.  I am a member of Cork County Council as well as of Cork Corporation.  There is a great need for amalgamation of the two bodies or certainly for more co-operation between them than there has been in the past. There is a tremendous duplication of services&mdash;planning, engineering, land reclamation, serviced land for building and industry.  For all these things there are two sets of engineers and two planning authorities.</P>
    <P>There is an engineer in Cork city in charge of a water works which can dispense eight million gallons of water a day to the city.  Incidentally, he uses eight and a half million gallons.  Of course, the water comes from the county.  Yet the county cannot get water for places in proximity to the city.  Any sane person to whom I have spoken says that there should be one authority for supplying water to the city and to the county from the Lee valley.  If it is impossible to have one manager surely there could be more co-operation? The engineers in both places work for different employers. There is tremendous overlapping of work and a great deal more expense than is necessary.</P>
    <P>I know many public representatives will feel that this is an effort to deprive them of their voice in local affairs. Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is a problem and it will be solved some day and we should recognise it now for what it is.  There must be some way in which the bodies would be allowed the same number of public representatives as they have now and allowed the same authority. I am more concerned at present with the welding together of the officials of the two bodies and putting them in one building and in one department. We have in the county a county manager and three assistant county managers. The three assistant county managers have a tremendous amount <Col N="1161" /> of local autonomy.  They work for west Cork, north Cork and south Cork. Why can there not be one for Cork city under a county manager or a city manager?  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter.  I do not think he will find it easy to convert my colleagues on either side to the suggestion but if he thinks it is the right thing he should pursue it and see if something can be done.</P>

I want to congratulate him on what has been done and I would ask those who feel that nothing has been done to look back and see how things were five or ten years ago.  I have been coming to this House for 13 years.  Anybody who travelled from Cork to Dublin 13 years ago would not recognise the road now.  Perhaps, it is slow progress but it is progress.  The previous speaker did not want a hotel built for tourists because the money would build so many houses for poor people but we must have the £100 million the tourists bring into the country and we must get the industries built to get the workers working so that they can pay their rates and rents and so on. Under the system we have&mdash;and I cannot see a better one at the moment&mdash; it will seem slow progress but as long as it is progress we should be satisfied.</P>

      <P>Anybody who had the patience to listen to this debate since it began or who read the Official Report could hardly be blamed for thinking that the two sides of the House were talking about two different countries.  The country which Fianna Fáil and the Minister seem to see is not the country which we see. I can scarcely blame them for putting <Col N="1162" /> the position as best they can.  I certainly will not blame the Minister for not being able to solve all the problems overnight.  However, it is difficult to swallow the story that the best possible effort is being made.  Deputy Healy, who was honest in his comments on most things, was close to the mark when he said that things were different five or ten years ago.  The big fault in the present administration is that while the country has been attempting to move forward to the 1970s many of the present Ministers do not seem to realise that they should move forward with it.  I do not think anybody will suggest that the standard of housing or the standard of roads which was acceptable 25 years ago is acceptable now.  This is where our paths divide.  One thing I cannot take from the present Government and particularly from the Minister&mdash;though I will admit that he must be the hardest working man in this House and he must have the toughest job in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He has many problems on his plate.  However, the Minister and his supporters seem to believe that, if a little is being done, it is enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest problem we meet, as public representatives, is housing.  Far be it for me to suggest that the Government could solve the housing problem overnight.  However, it is not good enough to say, because the Government have succeeded, either through encouraging individuals or through local authorities, in having a certain number of houses built say in Dublin, when there are five or six times as many people still on the waiting list and likely to be on it for many years to come, that this is solving the housing problem.  There is a housing emergency and that is not accepted by the Minister or by the Government.  There <Col N="1163" /> is a housing emergency in Cork&mdash; before Deputy Healy leaves&mdash;as well as in Dublin.  He knows that, even though the NBA have been helping out and while certain things have been done, the number of houses being provided is not even meeting current needs, not to mention the backlog which has been there for years.  We have this problem in big towns, small towns and in country districts.  County councils find themselves in the unenviable position of having on their lists hundreds of people, many of whom have been on them for many years, whether because of the fact that they had not got a site at the time the house could be built or because the site they got was not the right one.  Or it may be because there was no place for a septic tank, or because there was no water supply available, or because the Government had not the money for all these things.  This just does not make sense to a family waiting a long time for a house, particularly as they may feel that others who were able to come in at the right point of time were able to get their houses.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Healy mention the terrible problem of sending for permission to the Department for the acceptance of tenders.  I had begun to believe this happened only to Opposition Deputies but it seems everybody suffers from it.  First of all, of course, the plan for the type of house has to be sent up for approval. It is usual for that plan to be sent back to the local authority, as Deputy Healy said, for the slightest alteration.  That might not be too bad, but when the alteration has been effected and the revised plan has gone back to the Department, back it comes again for another slight alteration.</P>
    <P>I can instance how a plan was sent back by the Department because the ceiling in one of the rooms was thought to be too high and it was pointed out that an economy might be effected if the ceiling were lower.  The revised plan went back to the Department, but they were not satisfied.  They sent it back again suggesting that the back door should not be at the back of the house but at the end of the house.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> The alteration was effected and the plan went back to the Department. Back it came with a comment on the shed at the back which is usually necessary for the storing of fuel, potatoes, tools and so on.  It was suggested that the removal of the shed from the plan would effect an economy.</P>
    <P>While all this was happening, the people waiting for those houses were living in substandard conditions. Finally, when the Department decided the plan was to their satisfaction, it was discovered there was no money with which to build houses. That situation existed for several months.  Eventually permission was given to send the houses for tender. The resulting documents went to the Department for approval and they remained there for several months. Eventually, word came to the local authority that the tender price was too high.  In the meantime, of course, the cost of house building went up generally.  Therefore, the end cost of these houses, with the paring and the so-called economies effected by the Department, was much higher than if the original plans had been approved.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that I am blaming the Minister personally.  I am not.  The point I am making is that the system which allows this sort of thing to come about should be improved in some way.  When plans are sent up and tenders accepted and when it appears that the green light will be given, the Minister now says he will shortly give permission to local authorities to borrow from the Local Loans Fund.  I know what he means by &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  When I asked him what it means he said &ldquo;soon&rdquo;, and when I asked him what &ldquo;soon&rdquo; meant he said &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  This is all very funny, but the people waiting for houses do not think it is one bit funny.  The Minister's sense of humour could do with a little brushing up.</P>
    <P>At this time of year when money seems always to be scarce, would it not be better if the Minister came in and said: &ldquo;It is the end of the financial year.  It will not be possible to proceed with schemes A, B and C&rdquo;? If it is not a matter of finance, would it not be better if the Minister came <Col N="1165" /> in and said: &ldquo;I will sanction the borrowing from the Local Loans Fund of the money necessary to build those houses&rdquo;?  This suggestion is reasonable and I hope it will be accepted by the Minister.  Another point made in the Minister's lengthy speech is that the longer the delays in getting started on the building of houses the more the houses cost.  Of course that is so. Houses that were proposed two years ago and which will not be built until another two years have passed will cost twice as much&mdash;two houses will cost the price of four built at the right time. The Minister may ask me when was the right time.  My reply would be when the houses were needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to prototype houses designed specifically for extension at a later date.  He said they were built at Ashbourne in County Meath. Of course he should have said Dunboyne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  The Minister was there himself but he did not invite anybody.</P>

      <P>The Minister had a lot to say about what would be happening in a very short time.  That was not today or yesterday, but none of the things the Minister then spoke about has materialised.  However, to get back to the prototype houses, the suggestion that this is a good idea should be examined very closely.  The general idea is that the second storey of these two-floor houses should be left undeveloped, left bare, and that the householder could later develop that floor, dividing it into rooms to make the house into a four-room or five-room structure.  If a young man with, say, two in family, goes into one of these houses, by the time his family increases in the normal way he will be up to his eyes in debt&mdash;if he is not, he will not be as others are&mdash; and it is therefore foolish to suggest that he will be in a position to develop the remaining portion of the house. I ask the Minister to have another <Col N="1166" /> look at this.  Even if such a man found it financially within his means to enlarge his house or to develop an undeveloped portion of it, he would find it would cost him twice or three times as much as if it had been done when the house was built.  According to the Department this is good economics but I do not agree.  I do not think it will work.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have dealt with housing in the city here that I do not propose to spend much time on it.  We will be hearing a lot more about it during the Dublin south-west by-election campaign.  I am sure the people there will have all the propaganda.  On the question of private house building, the Minister said he proposes to reduce the ground space for grant purposes and, indeed, for the purpose of rates remission.  He also proposes to put a ceiling of £6,000 on the cost of houses to qualify.  The Minister has only to draw his breath for a couple of months and it will be difficult to get any house built for less than £5,000 or £6,000.  One must realise that sites even a long way from Dublin have increased in price to between £750 and £1,000 per site.  If you add that to the cost of erecting a house you will soon reach the £6,000. Although it may be a good idea to exclude the luxury type house from grants, we hope it will not lead us to the spectacle of little boxes all over the place.  There is a grave danger something like that will happen.</P>
      <P>A number of people are at present building fairly sizeable housing schemes.  I am quite sure the Minister will take the people who have got permission into consideration.  One man who has got permission for a 200 houses scheme has the first 60 of them under way.  The cost of these houses is over £6,000.  If this man is not able to get the rates remission or if the grant is cut because of the cost of the house, he stands to lose a substantial amount. He is not in a big way and it would be a pity that this should happen to him.  The area in which he is carrying out the development is one that could do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the suggestion that houses to be built in future should be limited in floor space to 1,249 square feet for certain purposes.  I agree that the idea <Col N="1167" /> of removing the walls for the purpose of having the floors measured is good. While many people who have been building relatively small houses had the floor space higher than the minimum laid down, because the floor space to qualify had to be within the rooms themselves and the kitchen, the bathroom or scullery was not counted as a room, at the same time, there is a danger here that it will have the exact opposite effect.  The Minister must realise that he is having a two-way bang at the grants.  First, he reduces the maximum floor space to 1,249 square feet.  If that was confined to the rooms alone, it would still leave fairly sizeable rooms but, because he is including the rooms it is very much more of a reduction than would at first appear.  I hope that is not too complicated. I am sure the Minister or his experts will work that one out fairly quickly.  The other matter is the date on which it will be operative.  Quite a number of people have paid architect's fees and some have got permission to build a house.  Some have the plans ready. If a date is fixed and if these people are ruled out for grant purposes and rates remission, the effect will be very serious.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Healy that a number of contractors have been collaring the Government part of the grant themselves by adding it on to the purchase price.  Some of them have the audacity to quote, say, £3,500 for a house and then, when the house is halfway up, they blandly point out that, in addition, they are entitled to, and intend to take, the Government part of the grant.  Any steps the Minister can take to prevent this should be encouraged.  At the same time, I do not know whether or not simply wiping it out in certain circumstances is the answer.  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>In Finland some years ago there was a system of no grants but subsidised loans and 100 per cent of the cost of the house could be borrowed.  The money normally paid as a grant is used to subsidise the loan interest.  The people there considered it a much better idea than the kind of system we have here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> The Minister must face up to the situation where costs have gone so high now that the grants, even with the adjustment he suggests, are not realistic. He must take a hard look at this.  The amount of the grant has not progressed with the increase in the price of houses.  While he quotes figures of the increase in the number of private houses being built he should remember that, because of the extra cost, the money being made available will build far fewer houses.  He refers to that point, in passing, in his brief.</P>
    <P>We must continue to build new houses to meet the needs of those who, over the past number of years, needed a new house and also meet the needs of people who will, because of their desire for an improvement in their standard of living, require a new house.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy mentioned high-rise flats and I agree with his comments. It may be a cheaper way to provide accommodation to build these flats but while many of these people are glad to have a roof over their heads, they are not happy in high-rise flats&mdash;not because they are afraid of a gas explosion which might bring down the flats but because they feel shut off. On many occasions lifts have gone out of order and completely shut off people in the upper flats.  One of the terrible things in modern days is that we have youths who feel it is fun to discommode other people.  Because people live in a flat they cannot always allow their children to go out to play.  This raises a serious social problem.  It does not matter how nice the playground may be if the children cannot go down on their own and if the parents cannot go down with them.  While we still have a substantial amount of open country, we should attempt to build at a reasonable height.  High-rise flats might be all right in New York, for example, but they do not appear to be all right in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Reconstruction grants are a very good idea.  However, some inspectors have the idea that they are not doing their job if they examine an extra room which is being built or plastering, or new floors or windows, unless they examine the whole house.  One man thought he would qualify for a <Col N="1169" /> grant of £140&mdash;and so he would, if he was prepared to spend £3,500 doing up the house.  At that time he could have built a fairly good house for that.  It was ridiculous for an inspector to make such a suggestion.  Most inspectors, who look at a house and decide what, in reason, should be done, are very sensible men.  A directive should be issued either by the Minister or his senior officers to these people who feel they should insist on the whole place being turned into tip-top order before a grant can be given.  This means that people anxious to repair their dwelling finish up by living in a place which gradually becomes a hovel because they have not the necessary money.  It is only reasonable that the Minister should do something about that.</P>
    <P>There has been a recent epidemic of flu in this country and its impact has been felt in the Department as in other places.  However, it does not explain the terribly long delays in this country in the payment of grants or in inspection for grant purposes.  I find the inspectors and the staff in the housing section of the Minister's Department very reasonable and courteous people but courtesy, no matter how welcome, is no answer to the man whose supplier is looking for money from him.  The job is done and the money cannot be paid.  There seems to be no reason why the inspector should not go out and look at the job. If money is not going to be made available, a warning should be given by the Department before the situation I referred to is created.  They should say &ldquo;We are not likely to have money before X date and, therefore, you should not proceed with the job until then&rdquo;.  It is unreasonable to have people pledging their credit, spending whatever money they have themselves to do a job and then finding they are being met by the contractor and the supplier for months on end with a request for the money due, when the only reason for non-payment of the account is that the grant was not paid to them.  Sometimes we are told that the inspector has the file out, that he has not returned it, or has mislaid it, but a little more effort on the part of those people would probably solve the <Col N="1170" /> problem.  Most of the people with whom I have had dealings in the Department are very courteous but they cannot pay grants until the reports are received.</P>
    <P>Sometimes an inspector appears to be most unreasonable.  I knew a case of a man who applied for a grant to build a bathroom.  The house was not an ordinary stone or concrete block house; it was one that had been built with timber and it was sheeted with galvanize.  Since timber structures now qualify for a grant I could not see anything wrong with it.  The house was occupied by the man and his family and had been kept in good order. There was an outside dry toilet and he felt that, since there did not appear to be any chance of getting another house, he would build a bathroom.  An inspector called and said a grant could not be given.  However, I asked two qualified engineers to look at the house and both expressed the opinion that there was no reason for withholding the grant.  The decision of the Department not to give this man a grant of £80 or £100 means that he cannot build a decent bathroom for his family.  This is the sort of stupid approach that makes people say the Department of Local Government are not doing their job properly.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which the Minister might perhaps clarify for me. If somebody gets a grant for the reconstruction of a house he is not entitled to a second grant, other than in exceptional circumstances, for a period of 15 years.  Suppose a person gets a grant of £70 instead of the normal £140, can the Minister tell me why he cannot qualify for the balance of the £140 if he subsequently decides to do some work within the 15 years that he had not originally thought he could do?  The Department have on a number of occasions refused a second grant on the grounds that the person got a previous grant and that the 15 years had not expired.  I know this is a matter of detail but possibly the Minister may not have heard of it before and he may be able to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Healy make an impassioned appeal for people who want to vest their houses, stating that <Col N="1171" /> everyone should be encouraged to do this.  I think he said this with tongue in cheek because he is a most intelligent Deputy and knows the facts as well as I do.  Does anyone seriously suggest that under the new renting system in respect of local authority houses tenants will rush to purchase their houses?  Is it not a fact that, while under the old scheme the position was that tenants could vest their houses for less than two-thirds of the rent, the new scheme which the Minister's predecessor introduced insists that the subsidy must not be taken into consideration when vesting takes place? Therefore, a man who has a house for £1 per week finds that vesting will cost him between £2 and £3 per week and there are very few people who will be prepared to accept those terms, particularly people who are not in a very good financial position.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Healy talking about a man in Cork who might have to pay up to £8 per week and he added &ldquo;Of course, there is £60 a week going into that house and it is only right that the sons and daughters who are working should pay their share of the rent.&rdquo; I do not know if the Deputy has a grown-up family, but I think anyone here who has a grown-up family will agree with me that, far from paying a share of the rent, the young people are more likely to ask for a loan on Monday night.  Young people nowadays are not going to take into consideration the question of rent and whether they should pay a fixed share of it so that the local authority can get £8 per week.  To think otherwise is just not facing facts.</P>
    <P>The question of the availability of building land was mentioned by the Minister and also by practically everyone who spoke here.  This whole matter is tied up with planning.  Town planning varies from one local authority area to the next.  I find it most annoying that most local authorities try to ensure that there will not be any new houses on main or arterial roads and, having successfully moved people off these roads, they do their best to prevent them from building on county roads.  The Minister must take a firm <Col N="1172" /> stand on this matter.  I am aware of the fact that he has got before him dozens of applications from various counties from people who have been refused planning permission mainly on the ground that there are two or three houses with septic tanks in the area and that, therefore, no further houses will be allowed.  It may not have got through to the people who make these decisions that the refusal of planning permission on one site immediately increases the value of another site and has resulted in some extraordinary situations.  There are cases where, after half a dozen sites in an area had been refused planning permission, plots for which permission was obtained and which should have been sold for about £400 or £500 suddenly went up in value to £1,000, £1,200 or £1,500.</P>
    <P>This is a matter on which the Minister can and should take a firm stand. The whole trouble is that people buying sites tend to get as much road frontage as possible.  They then buy a rather short site and the result is that the septic tank is the minimum distance from the house.  If they bought a narrower frontage and ran the site back a distance, as can be done in most cases, and put the septic tank well back, well spaced out from one site to the next so that they are not parallel, there would not be any difficulty. This is a matter with which only the Minister can deal because the local authority planners seem to have got themselves tied up about it and they cannot agree on the exact position.</P>
    <P>The Minister says&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that the availability of sites is important but the only way to make plenty of sites available is to ensure that the sites put up for sale have planning permission.  Against that we have a situation where the Minister has granted permission to a number of people on the Golf Links Road at Bettystown who had been refused permission by the Meath County Council. The reverse was the case there.  Meath County Council refused permission because the ground was very wet and the septic tanks attached to the houses already built had been clogging up.</P>
    <P>On one Christmas Eve, the local fire brigade had to go and pump out some <Col N="1173" /> of them in order to prevent a nuisance. Therefore, Meath County Council refused permission pending the erection of a new sewerage scheme in the area and everybody who applied to the Department for permission have been granted permission.  I might add that most of them were not people who just wanted houses in which to live.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of sewerage and water schemes.  We, in County Meath, submitted schemes to the Minister's Department on separate lists but they were sent back saying that both sewerage and water schemes should be on the one list.  We did this and we are now wondering what will happen and when we will get some indication to go ahead.  It is all very well to look at the plans on a map. This may give local people the idea that they are getting something but it is very difficult to plan an area unless the dates for the start and finish of sewerage schemes are known beforehand.</P>
    <P>In one particular case in Navan, where a water scheme was to go into operation and from which there were two extensions, the Minister's advisers told him that the two additional schemes should not be commenced until the main scheme was finished. The Meath county engineer had advised that the two additional schemes should start at the same time and, when the question was raised by me here, the Minister did look into the matter and sanctioned the carrying out of the three schemes at the one time and this saved several months delay. I thank the Minister for having done that because, if we are to be critical, we must also be fair about these matters.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of group water schemes.  I am not satisfied with the carrying out of these schemes.  I suggested here, and Meath County Council agreed, that they should take over the schemes in Meath and complete them.  If that were done the schemes would be up to the required standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but unfortunately the position is that the Department decided not to accept that.  The result is that there are now up to 40 or 50 schemes that have been applied for from this constituency but only a few of them have been proceeded with.  What can be done when the necessary pressure is put on was proved in the case of a scheme that was started in an area near where I live.  I was on the committee and that scheme was carried out in record time.  I leave the House to make their own judgment on that. While this has happened there are others that have taken years to prepare and about which all sorts of excuses seem to be given.</P>
      <P>Most of the Department officials, like most civil servants, are very courteous people but there are one or two who have a reputation for being very impertinent. Let me say that any official who is impertinent to anybody on a committee of a scheme in which I am interested will, in the future, have his name and the complaint sent to the Minister.  If some people attempt to get a scheme going and go to all the trouble in the world in connection with it, it is not good enough for some official to say that he will meet them on, say, Monday next at 2 o'clock and that he cannot be going out at night. Those people who would wish to see the official would be working all day and if they had to stay home from work they would lose their wages for that day.  No one likes to have to work at night but it is only fair that in cases like these the facilities should be made available.  Furthermore, if I am asked to advise or make inquiries in connection with any scheme which may start in my constituency, I reserve the right to do so even if the official concerned says it is no damn business of mine. This has happened and it is the sort of thing that leaves a bad impression with those who attempt to help themselves with the aid of a Government grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group water schemes are not being run properly.  People in the office will give all the advice that it is possible for them to give but that is no good if the schemes are not being carried out as they should.  I do not think it is right that an inspector is not <Col N="1175" /> available when required and, when his advice is asked for, impertinence is given instead.  I do not propose to stand for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A few of them have tried it.  I am glad Deputy Foley is here to hear my next comments, which concern roads.  Yesterday or the day before there was a question from Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan asking what was happening with the Clonee Road. A good job has been done on the roads by Meath County Council but that part of the Clonee Road for which Dublin County Council are responsible is in a terrible condition.  The Minister said he had received no plans from Dublin County Council and, therefore, he could not do anything about it.  Deputy Clinton asked if the Minister did not know that the plans were at an advanced stage, to which the Minister replied that he did not.  I would have been surprised if he had known because even at the advanced stage, that road is placed about fourth on the priority list after the Bray road and two others.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, no efforts have been made to acquire land and, in any case, it appears that Dublin County Council cannot be blamed. With regard to Dublin County Council, may I again repeat what I have said on a number of occassions before, but which does not appear to have got through to the Minister, who insists on referring to Dublin County Council as the coalition-dominated council.  Let me tell the Minister once again that Dublin County Council has a majority of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members and they have alternated chairs for some years.  As far as this party are concerned, we have only four members there, and if that is a coalition I agree with the Minister.  Deputy Burke, who is a great friend of mine &mdash; he may also be a great friend of the Minister's, but that is beside the point &mdash; is the present chairman of Dublin County Council.</P>

    <P>One of the reasons why Dublin County Council have not been able to <Col N="1176" /> do the work that they would like to do on the roads, apart from the lack of money, is that they cannot get senior staff.  I am told that the reason for this is that, when the proposal was made to upgrade the rates for engineers, the arbitration was not accepted by the Government, the attitude being, apparently, that if it was in their favour it was all right but if it was not in their favour it was all wrong.  At any rate, the result is that within Dublin County Council's road section there is one existing post for a senior engineer and there is one new post for which sanction is awaited. There are three existing posts for chief assistants and there are three posts for which sanction is awaited.</P>

      <P>That is not the information I have.  Even so the fact is they have not got the staff.  The only thing I do not know is how long these vacancies have existed, but there is a whole list here of senior people missing because apparently the rates are too low.  New posts have been created but the Minister has not sufficient time to make the appointments. He cannot have it both ways.  If the Minister wants to come in here and talk about the local authority not producing plans and he is responsible for holding up the plans, it is fair to place it back in his lap.  He has the last word. He will be replying to this debate and if anything I say is incorrect I am quite <Col N="1177" /> sure it will not be too hard on him to talk for six hours and 55 minutes as he did last year in the Seanad. There is a proposal to have main and arterial roads taken over by the central body and if my information is correct it is not expected to have the legislation introduced before next November, so I assume from 1st April, 1971, the responsibility for the arterial roads and main roads will rest on the central authority.  This will get over what Deputy Foley was referring to a few minutes ago and on which I am inclined to agree with him.  There were five plans for portion of the T1 sent into the Department and the Department in each case said: &ldquo;No, that is not what we want.&rdquo;  It is ridiculous that senior officials of the Department of Local Government should try to make the county councils guess what they want.  The proper thing now is for them to take over the arterial and main roads, let them plan them from one end to the other and there should be no difficulty.</P>
      <P>However, I am interested to know how the staffing problem will be attended to, who will be responsible for the supervision and for the carrying out of work on these roads.  What I am getting at is this: employed by each local authority are a number of people who are covered by the blanket words &ldquo;road workers&rdquo;.  These people are pensionable servants of the local authority.  Is there any danger that the Department, having taken over these roads, would suddenly decide to do them by contract and in doing that would put out of a job the people who spent their lives in the employment of the local authorities?</P>

It is good to hear somebody on the Front Benches of Fianna Fáil saying what their policy is.  Deputy Geoghegan is the first man <Col N="1178" /> who is able to say definitely what Fianna Fáil stand for.</P>
      <P>I heard a Deputy talking about the fact that the county roads were not black-topped.  We have an extraordinary situation in County Meath where the roads were black-topped before any other county.  We had a county engineer who beleived that you should have a good surface on the roads and that the bends could be taken out later on.  What happened was that as soon as they were black-topped &mdash; even though this was only a small part of making the road safe &mdash; our grant of £98,000 was cut so we lost £98,000 because our engineer advised that first there should be a good surface on the roads and that the other work needing just as much attention could be done later.  May be the regulations were there and nothing could be done about it, but even so the Department of Local Government should have changed them.  Even at this late stage perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would whisper in the Minister's ear that it would be a good idea to do something about this.  It is stupid to have a fast-surface road with bad bends on it.  That is how accidents occur.</P>

      <P>Again somebody referred in passing to the question of grants for road maintenance and for road making.  I think it is fair comment that a lot of money is being spent on making good roads better while no money is being made available for the really bad type of road. A few years ago a hill near Kells, which I hardly noticed when cycling over it every day to school, was removed at a cost of £11,000.  Driving over it today I do not see much difference in it but some of the side roads are still in a very bad condition.  As <Col N="1179" /> far as the county roads are concerned there was to be a re-classification made.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, was Minister for Local Government at the time and he was always doing it &ldquo;in about two months&rdquo;.  It must be five years since this re-classification was originally talked about and we still have not got it.  Of course, immediately a road was re-classified from a county road to a main road it was eligible for a grant which would cost the Government money and possibly half-way through some bright boy in the Department tumbled to this and said: &ldquo;Let us forget all about it and see if everybody else will do the same.&rdquo; Would the Minister make a comment about re-classification because we are all interested to know what class of road we live on?</P>
      <P>The question of the speed limit has been referred to.  It was suggested here a few years ago that speed limit signs on some roads should be altered and somebody thought it would not be right if they were not all altered at the same time.  If a speed limit sign should be 150 yards from a village and it is in front of somebody's window or in a gateway or in some dangerous position, surely it is no harm to change it ten or 20 yards, and put it where it should be. In addition, signs are moved backwards and forwards.  One drives along on one occasion and the sign says &ldquo;30&rdquo; and the next time one drives along the sign has been changed to &ldquo;40&rdquo;.  In one place the sign says &ldquo;30&rdquo; as one enters the town and there is another sign saying &ldquo;30&rdquo; a little bit further on but there is no sign telling one when the restriction ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the side which is towards me.  There is no sign at the other end, maybe someone broke it. The maximum speed limit of 60 miles an hour has been in operation for some time.  I have always felt that it was not the boy or the girl who drives fast who causes the accidents but the person who drives slowly in the middle of the road or who takes chances, and I think this <Col N="1180" /> should be taken into consideration when the limit is being set.</P>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion made by another Deputy that there should be an intermediate stage between the provisional licence holder and the qualified driver who has been driving for over 12 months, indicating to other people that the driver has not fully acquired a knowledge of the road.  If this were to be done possibly other motorists might be a bit more considerate when they come across these newly qualified drivers.  I would like to deal now with driving tests.

      <P>I heard a report that the number of provisional licences which may be held is being increased from seven to 14.  The situation is that if the person does not pass the driving test after the third provisional licence he has a terrible job getting another provisional licence.  It is not possible for him to get another provisional licence without a certificate to say that he is going to take a driving test and it is not possible to get a driving test unless he has a provisional licence.  Every time a provisional licence is taken out it costs a pound and every time a test is taken it costs another pound.  I would like to know if there is any reason why we should not extend the number of licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the driving test itself some things need to be changed.  Most <Col N="1181" /> of the examiners are good and they know how to deal with people but there are one or two who should not be examiners because they do not have any manners.  Nothing puts a person off more &mdash; especially a woman or a girl &mdash; if the examiner snaps her head off and tells her that she has failed the test before she has even started because of something he saw her do as she came down the road.  The examiner expects a hand signal to be given.  I have raised this matter a dozen times in the House because as everyone knows hand signals went out with the donkey and cart and no one, not even the Minister or his official driver, uses a hand signal.  A person driving a mini would need his head examined if he were to attempt to give a hand signal because he would have to lever the window back before he could get the tips of his fingers out in order to give a hand signal.  This stipulation has persisted despite my repeated efforts to have the regulation changed.  I do not see the sense in making people give a hand signal.  I think the examinee should drive under normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>A rather amusing aspect about this regulation is that the mechanical signals must be in working order otherwise the driver will fail, even though he must give hand signals.  I think this is absurd.  I have been driving for quite a long time and I do not think I have given a hand signal in all my life.  I have a driving licence now and nobody can touch me.  I know of dozens of people who took out driving licences just before testing came in, some of whom have never driven, and they succeed in keeping their driving licences in order.  They can do anything they like, and for that reason I ask the Minister to have another look at this to see if some change can be made in the regulation.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many examiners there are.  I am sure it is very difficult for them to get around to all the tests they have to do in the country.  It is a little bit ridiculous bringing people into strange towns and expecting them to drive through them.  A lot of people who have been driving for years fail their driving tests.  There would be a <Col N="1182" /> big reduction in the numbers of cars and motorists if only those who had passed the test were allowed to drive. I think it is wrong that people have technically to break the law in order to keep their job because the driving test is too strict.  It is wrong for a person who can drive a car or any other vehicle to fail his test because he is unable to answer a question about the highway code, probably because he is a little bit flustered.  If the examiner were not an examiner he might not know the answer himself.  Most of us know from just looking at the sign what it means but someone might say the wrong thing at the right time.</P>
    <P>Most workers who have to travel a distance to work buy themselves an old car of one kind or another.  They know if they are caught they will be in trouble so they take out tax and insurance and they do their best to pay the tax and insurance&mdash;insurance is a costly business at present.  I do not think it is good enough that very many wealthy people omit to tax their vehicles.  One only has to walk around any car park and glance at the expensive cars &mdash; not at the little cheap cars &mdash;to see cars with no road tax.  In addition to that a game has developed in that people who have haulage lorries and hired buses do not seem to think it is their responsibility to tax them. I would be interested to hear &mdash; and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can have some inquiries made &mdash; how many of the CIE buses which were burnt down in Shannon had the road tax paid.  This is one of the examples where people felt they were above the law but the law should not be flouted in this way.  The poor people pay their road taxes and that being so those who have money should be made to pay too; there should be no exemption for people like that.</P>
    <P>County councils should be consulted before new arrangements come into operation on the roads.  If a Bill comes before the House in October it will be seven months before it becomes law, but even so I think there should be discussion not alone with the county councils and their staff but also with the trade unions to find out what is likely to happen to the staff as a result <Col N="1183" /> of the transfer of arterial and main roads to the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>During Question Time today, I asked the Minister for Finance if and when it is proposed to carry out an extension to the pier at Burtonport, County Donegal, as in the interests of the fishing industry such an extension was essential.  The Parliamentary Secretary replied as follows:</P>
      <P>Work on the clearance of the approach channel and dredging of berths was completed in December. The desirability of further works will be considered in the light of fishing activities at the harbour.</P>
      <P>That appears to be a very reasonable reply until I tell the Parliamentary Secretary that over the past 40 years the approach channel and the berths were dredged and on each occasion after and before dredging we were informed that the extension of the pier would be considered in the light of fishing activities at the harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Burtonport harbour is one of the premier harbours on the north-west coast of Donegal.  It was so important even in the year 1798 that of all the inlets and harbours on the north-west coast it was the one selected by Napper Tandy to land, and in the middle of the 17th century &mdash; and this is going back some distance &mdash; Lord Rutland changed the name of one of the islands in the approach channel from Inishmacadora to Rutland Island and established there salt pans for the purpose of curing fish; and at the end of the last century the Donegal Fishing Company was formed and, as there was no harbour at Burtonport, the islands at the entrance to the harbour were utilised as ports at which fish were cured, salted and shipped to the various cross-Channel ports.  Those islands in the approach channel to Burtonport were hives of industry at the turn of the century and then, in or about the year 1900, the railway was extended from Londonderry, as it was then known, to Burtonport <Col N="1184" /> and the seat of operations for the fishing industry changed from the islands to Burtonport harbour itself.</P>
    <P>After a few years' experience of the use of the harbour and the pier there, it was felt, in 1911, that a survey should be carried out and, if necessary, extensions decided on to the pier at Burtonport.  Before World War I certain extensions were agreed upon but the opening of hostilities in 1914 delayed the commencement of these extensions and it was only in 1919 that it was decided and definite plans were drawn up for the extension of Burtonport pier.  Instead of beginning at the pier itself, it was decided to begin at the perimeter of the new extended pier or causeway.  There a pier-head was built that later became known as a monument and the people, being charitable, never said to whom it was a monument but I could name him. Thousands of pounds were expended on that &ldquo;monument&rdquo; and then, with the Treaty and the establishment of the Irish Free State, extensions to Burtonport harbour ceased and down through the years since 1922, in this House and elsewhere, fishermen and those engaged in the fishing industry have made application to and have besought various Ministers for Fisheries and for Finance to extend the pier as originally planned by the old Congested Districts Board and supported by the Commissioners of Public Works prior to 1919.  It is true, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, that the approaches to the channel have been drained but nothing has been done to extend the pier.</P>
    <P>One would want to see this harbour at low water.  The tide strips the berths there where ships are berthed and if fishing vessels are driven into the inner harbour during a storm or inclement weather they have to remain there on ground until such time as they get a spring tide to enable them to go out to the fishing ground.</P>
    <P>The fishermen of Burtonport pay harbour dues and the fishing industry there consists of herring, white fish, salmon, and lobsters.  To show how earnest the fishermen are and to show how interested they are in their industry and to ensure that salmon stocks <Col N="1185" /> will be sufficient to enable them to carry on their livelihood as drift net fishermen, they contribute £223 each year to the Letterkenny No. 14 Fishery Board of Conservators for the purpose of restocking the rivers.  They are the only net fishermen in Ireland who make such a contribution to a board of conservators.  I say this, merely to show their <i>bona fides</i> and their earnestness in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 240 fishermen in Burtonport and on the mainland. When I say &ldquo;Burtonport&rdquo; I mean Burtonport island &mdash; the locality which uses the harbour at Burtonport &mdash; and there are approximately 100 people employed on the shore there in the fishing industry.  Within the past two years three factories have been established at Burtonport and it is now a 12-month industry.</P>
    <P>Up until last year eight seine net fishing boats were engaged in the fishing industry at Burtonport.  During the coming year we will have 16 seine net fishing boats and 36 half-deckers.  That is a considerable fleet but when one considers that only five boats can berth at the harbour at one time one appreciates the delay in discharging fish and in getting back to the fishing ground and the inconvenience caused to these fishermen.</P>
    <P>Last year, the takings at Burtonport were £132,000.  That is not counting white fish or flat fish.  This year the takings have been £200,000 plus £50,000 worth of white fish.  This means £¼ million worth of fish has been landed at the pier at Burtonport during the past 12 months.  This fleet could be doubled or trebled, larger boats could be employed but unfortunately they cannot berth at the pier owing to the shortage of berthing space.</P>
    <P>Many of the Burtonport fishermen who are now using the larger trawler of 70 and 75 feet are compelled to fish out of Killybegs and at least four of our native skippers from the Burtonport area can no longer berth in their own port harbour on account of the lack of berthing facilities.</P>
    <P>These fishermen are making a genuine case for the extension of the <Col N="1186" /> harbour there.  I know that large sums of money have been spent on harbours throughout the State, harbours which are mere dry land harbours, from which fishing fleets no longer go to sea. Burtonport is improving and it is one of the fishing ports which are improving and giving steady employment.</P>
    <P>In order to show their <i>bona fides,</i> the fishermen there are willing to contribute a sum of £1,000 towards the cost of extending the pier.  They have made known to the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; they have told him personally &mdash; that they are willing to contribute a sum of £1,000 towards the cost of the extension.  All that is holding us up at the moment is money. The reply given to me today by the Parliamentary Secretary is not the reply he himself would give.  He said: &ldquo;The desirability of further works will be considered in the light of fishing activities at the harbour.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary has had an opportunity to see those activities.  I have given him the figures for the landings there.  He is in a position to verify those figures.  I can assure him that what I have said is correct.</P>
    <P>During the years, one of the reasons why this scheme was held up was that there was a controversy in the Office of Public Works as to the type of extension that should be made to the harbour.  The Parliamentary Secretary kindly came down there.  He met the fishermen himself.  They pointed out to him the type of extension they required and I must say that, speaking as a layman &mdash; and he qualified it by saying he was speaking as a layman &mdash; he agreed with what they said, subject to what his engineers would say about his consent to this extension.</P>
    <P>I further understand that this engineers have now come around to the point of view of the fishermen and all those engaged in the fishing industry, namely, that the pier should be extended from the pier-head as it now exists to the famous or infamous monument 100 yards off the pier-head.  It may be that money is the cause of this evil but it is a crying shame that, after so many years of self-government, work on this harbour is still held up and <Col N="1187" /> that it is landlocked through lack of funds.</P>
    <P>I will not mention other harbours in Donegal on which large sums have been spent.  Let me say that I agree with every penny that has been spent on Killybegs.  It is one of the premier ports in the county but there are other harbours in Donegal where the fishing fleets are dwindling, where sea net fishing boats are actually up for sale, on which money has been and is being spent.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to clear whatever blowline may be choked between his section and the Department of Finance.  If he requires any statistics to convince the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that this case which I am making tonight is a genuine one, those statistics are available.</P>
    <P>Within the past 18 months the fishermen have formed a co-operative society at Burtonport.  It consists of the skippers of the fishing boats and the members of the crews.  They have procured an overdraft of somewhere in the neighbourhood of £20,000 from the bank to build or renovate a co-operative store.  They are now in the process of installing an ice plant.  They have already installed a cold storage plant.  Ninety per cent of the fish caught at Burtonport is exported to the Continent. Out of the remaining 10 per cent, at least 7 per cent is exported to Britain.  Here we have one of the ideal sources of exports in the country. Of the fish caught there I would say that only 1 per cent is used for fish meal.  Huge grants have been given by the Department for the establishment of fish meal plants throughout the country.  There is one at Mornington where they cannot get enough fish to supply it.  The fish caught at Burtonport are prime edible fish and suitable for exporting.</P>
    <P>I know I am pushing an open door so far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned.  If anything I have said sounded like criticism of him that is not my intention.  I certainly do not want to criticise him.  He listened patiently to the story of the fishermen. He has got the corroboration he sought. I want him to pass it on to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and <Col N="1188" /> to the Minister for Finance.  If conduit pipes or the pipelines are clogged they should be cleared as soon as possible so that Burtonport can get the OK for an extension to its pier which has been sought since 1911.</P>

    <P>Following an inquiry by the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works advised in September, 1967, that the removal of the rock bar and the dredging of the berths &mdash; Nos. 1 and 4 of the items I have read out &mdash; would cost £12,000 if carried out independently of the other proposed works.  In March, 1968, the Minister for Finance <Col N="1189" /> agreed to make available a State grant of £9,375, in other words, 75 per cent of the cost of the removal of the rock bar and the dredging of the berths, and this work was completed in December, 1969.  The Minister deferred consideration of the construction of the new jetty and the breakwater.  He felt it would be unreasonable to enter into that financial commitment until such time as we saw how the harbour and fishing developed as a result of the clearance of the rock bar.  Naturally he was concerned about what return he would get for the capital investment involved.</P>
    <P>When I was in Burtonport in September, 1969, I met the members of the co-operative and the local fishermen. We had a very long discussion and it was agreed that the best approach was to build a new jetty up to the monument instead of extending the existing jetty.  This would be about 280 feet.  Some dredging work was also to be done.  This was in substitution of the original proposals.  I understand the cost of the original proposal was estimated to be £84,000.  This was later revised to a figure of £116,500.  In to-day's money values the cost is estimated to be £130,000.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by my engineers that the proposal put to me by the local fishermen would, in the long term, be the more economic.  The Deputy is, of course, aware that as Parliamentary Secretary I am, in this particular instance, the agent on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I should like the Deputy to know that it is not my fault and neither is it the fault of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we have not progressed as fast as the Department would wish.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, at his request, had a report on the costings no later than this morning and, as a result of this, I expect him to ask for a complete report for submission to the Minister for Finance with a view to the inclusion of this project in the Estimate for the <Col N="1190" /> coming financial year.  While both the Minister and I are of the opinion that this is one of the harbour development schemes which should be implemented. I must make it clear that this is but one of many similar schemes and it is, therefore, in competition with several other schemes up and down the country.</P>
      <P>It is quite proper of the Deputy to raise the matter here and I appreciate his anxiety to have it discussed on the Adjournment.  Naturally, every Department is trying to lay claim to the biggest share of the coming capital Budget.  The capital Budget must, of course, be related to the general economic situation and the inflationary situation with which we are confronted at the moment.</P>
      <P>I, personally, would recommend that Burtonport be included in the Estimate for the coming financial year.  That may be because I met the local people concerned and was impressed by them. According to the statistics available for 1968 landings were £149,103.  I understand landings now are within the region of £250,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It demonstrates their confidence in themselves.  I am familiar with somewhat similar fishery harbours and I know the difficulty boats have in tying up, with fish having to be passed from boat to boat before it can be landed on the pier.  However, even in my own office there are eight or nine divisions, each division demanding more <Col N="1191" /> money.  I am sure that each of the 12 members of the Cabinet is looking for more money for the various projects he considers both desirable and essential. I shall be very disappointed if Burtonport is not included in next year's Estimate.  I know the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will make very strong representations to the Minister for Finance for the necessary finances in the capital Budget to carry out this desirable work at Burtonport. Naturally, the final decision will rest with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that the Estimate I introduced here last autumn should have been introduced before the summer recess&mdash;&mdash;</P>
