      <P>A section has been set up in the Department of Education under a Parliamentary Secretary to deal with youth and sport activities throughout the country.  The question of establishing a National Sports Council is under consideration in that Department.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements thus made to cater for sport are adequate and that the setting up of a separate Ministry would not be warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting they are adequate but I suggest a good start has been made.  A sum of £100,000 was provided last year and allocated among various sporting organisations, especially among those who are financially weaker.  Similar provision has been made this year and the establishment of a National Sports Council to which I have referred is under consideration.  We are proceeding on sound lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £100,000 is <Col N="1226" /> less than 2s per head of the youth of the country.  We have had recent tragedies here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he intends to introduce vaccination against rubella for all schoolgoing girls in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 11th February, 1970, to a question by Deputy Richie Ryan regarding immunisation against rubella.</P>
      <P>Since that date the vaccine against rubella has come on the market in this country and it is a matter for individual doctors to use the vaccine at their discretion.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the reply referred to, consideration is being given to the introduction of a general scheme of vaccination against the disease.  I am not yet in a position to recommend such a scheme to health authorities but the matter is being kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated the reason already in a previous reply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the matter is urgent because gamma-globulin can be given to a pregnant woman who comes in contact with this disease and she can be satisfactorily protected against the effects of the disease.  Medical practitioners should inform any woman who comes in contact with the disease that she can be given gamma-globulin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that gamma-globulin costs £15 for a single dose, that it is not without its own danger to the patient and can cause death.  A live vaccine against rubella would be far more effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health (1) the number of qualified doctors who emigrated from Ireland during each of the years 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969, and how many of these were of Irish birth; and (2) the number of registered appointments in Irish hospitals which are held by doctors from outside the 26 Counties in Dublin hospitals and in hospitals outside of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the question the information required is not available in my Department and it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the question, information of this nature is not currently available or normally sought by my Department.  I propose, however, as portion of a more general survey of the junior hospital doctor position, to seek information from all hospital authorities as to the situation on 1st August next when the position will have stabilised after the mid-year changes in personnel, and will inform the Deputy of the result of my inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is much unrest among newly qualified Irish doctors who find it difficult to obtain appointments in hospitals against competition from non-nationals?  Is the Minister aware that, as a result, there is a high rate of emigration among junior Irish doctors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will consider setting up a commission on the lines suggested in the Plaut report &ldquo;Alcohol problem, a report to the nation&rdquo; whereby the Departments of Health, Education, Social Welfare and Justice would participate with the breweries, distillers and temperance groups, and that the commission draw up a common policy for the whole Irish community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the American report referred to by the Deputy. On the problem of alcoholism I have already had the benefit of the advice given by the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness which reported in 1966. The matter is one which is also receiving the attention of the Medico Social Research Board.  We also have an Irish National Council on Alcoholism which is widely representative of medical, legal, business, administrative, educational and social interests and in the short time that it has been established has made considerable progress towards the creation of an enlightened public opinion in regard to this problem. In consultation with my Department the council has recently decided to expand its activities and I look forward to considerable improvements in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that I am fully aware of the problem of alcoholism and I intend to give it a considerable amount of attention but I am not satisfied that any useful purpose would be served, at this stage, by setting up a commission on the lines suggested in the report to which he refers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has seen a report recommending education of the public on the grave dangers of drug taking; <Col N="1229" /> and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the question relates to press reports of 11th June, 1970 which I have seen. As I indicated in reply to a question by Deputy Bruton on the 28th April, 1970, the general question of education in relation to the abuse of drugs is under active consideration by the working party on drug abuse, and I hope to receive their recommendations in the near future.</P>
      <P>It would be premature for me to make a statement on the matter, until I have received and considered these recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that he indicated on a previous occasion that he was not in favour of doctors giving these lectures?  Has the Minister changed his mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Deputy may have misunderstood me or, perhaps, I was not speaking strictly accurately.  What I said was that neither I nor the working party on drug abuse have made up our minds as to the character of education: whether it should be confined to schools where drug addicts were known to exist.  We have had evidence from abroad that one can, unfortunately, excite an interest in drugs among school children.  The committee on drug abuse will be-meeting some time before the end of this month to consider again this very difficult problem and I hope to be able to make a decision after that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the recent medical research carried out in Norway, Great Britain and Switzerland regarding the effect of central heating on medical health, he will request the Dublin chief <Col N="1230" /> medical officer to investigate the present situation pertaining to the Ballymun satellite town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the House on 16th December, 1969&mdash; Official Report, Vol. 243, Cols. 1414 and 1415&mdash;I am not aware that there is any proven seriously harmful effect on health associated with central heating. I have seen a report of a survey of office conditions in Zurich conducted under the auspices of the University there.  Such conditions of course would not be comparable to Ballymun. This is the only Swiss report I have seen.  The Deputy may wish to identify for me the reports of the recent research to which he refers, in which case I would be glad to consider them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider instructing the chief medical officer to carry out an investigation into the incidence of ill-health in the Ballymun satellite town in relation to the central heating there?  There are indications of an increased incidence in the case of certain illnesses in Ballymun, which are associated with central heating, and that association has been substantiated by medical research done in Norway, Switzerland and Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Deputy to furnish me with the research because I have no knowledge of it.  At the moment I have complete trust in Dr. O'Regan, the chief medical officer of Dublin Health Authority, who assures me that he is not aware of any health conditions of an unusual kind which relate to the temperature or humidity conditions in Ballymun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that I am not referring to conditions of a serious or unusual nature but to the common ailments which have increased in incidence.  I am not referring to unusual or freak diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated there is no evidence, but specific evidence in respect of some medical cases has been submitted to the CMO in respect of the tenants of these flats, who have incurred the illnesses since going to Ballymun and who never had such illnesses prior to being housed in the <Col N="1231" /> flats in Ballymun.  In view of these specific cases would the Minister not consider having a survey done of the incidence of these illnesses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>The person referred to in the question was in receipt of disability benefit up to 24th September, 1968. Following his examination on 25th September, 1968, by a medical referee of the Department, who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work, it was decided by a deciding officer that he was not entitled to disability benefit from that date.  An appeal against this decision was received from his solicitors on 1st October, 1968.  On 18th October, 1968, the solicitors were asked to submit a statement of the facts and contentions on which they relied but, despite a reminder on 25th November, 1968, this was not received. A second examination was carried out on 21st November, 1968, by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that the insured person was capable of work.  The appeal was referred to an appeals officer on 5th December, 1968.  The appeals officer decided to take oral evidence on the appeal and arrangements were made <Col N="1232" /> for the hearing to take place on 12th February, 1969.  At the request of the solicitors the hearing was adjourned until 27th March, 1969, as the insured person was unable to attend.  After hearing the evidence the appeals officer requested an examination and report on the insured person by an orthopaedic surgeon.  Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining an appointment for the insured person and after a number of postponements the examination took place on 24th June, 1969. The insured person was certified by his own doctor as fit to resume work on 14th July, 1969.</P>
      <P>The orthopaedic surgeon's report was received on 24th July, 1969, and, having considered all the evidence, the appeals officer decided on 29th July, 1969, that the insured person was not incapable of work and not entitled to disability benefit in respect of the period from 25th September, 1968, to 8th July, 1969.  This decision was communicated to the insured person and to his solicitors on 7th August, 1969.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware.  I am also aware of the reason for it.  It is tied in with the changeover to decimal currency.  It would not be possible for the British to do this without a 20 per cent increase in stamp duty and, as the policy is not to associate increases in charges with the changeover to decimal <Col N="1234" /> currency, it was decided to drop the duty.  In our case, however, we are reducing the duty by 20 per cent on decimal day.</P>

      <P>Last year 53,715 candidates sat for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.  This year there were 62,387 applicants.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the very substantial increase in the number of applicants for examination, I do not anticipate that results can be made available before the normal dates of issue.</P>

Does he accept that we have reached the crisis stage as regards having intermediate <Col N="1243" /> and leaving certificate papers gone through more expeditiously?  Does the Minister not realise that parents, children and educators generally go through the whole of the summer practically in fear and trembling in relation to results which may come out later in the year?

I am aware that there is a dispute in relation to this matter at the moment.  I would hope that the ASTI would reconsider their instruction to their members and that the marking of the papers could continue in the ordinary way.  However, if this is not possible, I can assure the Deputy that arrangements will be made to have the examining of the papers carried out by properly and fully qualified persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): On a point of order, when Deputy Dr. Byrne was dealing with Question No. 22 he was specifically invited by the Parliamentary Secretary to await this question on which he would be given full information.  In those circumstances I respectfully suggest that he is quite in order.</P>

      <P>Question No. 22 related to building the handball alley in University College, Dublin, and in a supplementary the Deputy sought information about my attitude to handball in general.  I am prepared to tell the Deputy, arising out of this question if he wishes, although he has not specifically so asked, that the grant of £5,000 made available last year did include provision for the building of a new <Col N="1250" /> handball alley for the world handball championship in Croke Park and that these sums, taken in the light of the total sum available to my Department for the provision of sport facilities, £8,000, are a fair indication of the interest which my Department have in the promotion of this particular sport.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware that I did not ask about handball in general in my supplementary question but about the provision of a handball alley in University College, Dublin, and he has not answered that &mdash;whether he is prepared to provide a handball alley there.  Secondly, he did not answer my supplementary question to Question No. 27.  He sat down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>) asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (a) if he is aware that recent increases in pig feeding rations without compensatory increase in the price of pork have created a crisis in the pig industry; (b) if he will initiate an immediate inquiry into the recent increases in pig feed prices; (c) if he will examine the other increases in cost of pig production, and (d) if he will take steps to ensure a reasonable profit in pig production so that the income of farmers engaged in pig production will keep in line with the income of other sections of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The guaranteed minimum prices for pigs have, in fact, been increased on two occasions since last autumn.  (b) and (c) I do not consider that an inquiry as suggested is warranted.  (d) The continuing high level of deliveries of pigs to bacon factories shows that pig prices generally are satisfactory and yield a reasonable profit to efficient producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Surely the Minister is aware that the price of pig meal has increased by 80s per cwt since last September and that that involves an increase of 30s in the production of a pig and that the farmers have not been compensated to any extent for that?  Does the Minister not realise that this stock-in-trade reply about deliveries to factories, if it is true, is accounted for by the fact that producers are committed to a programme and have committed themselves to a heavy expenditure of capital in producing pigs and have no alternative but to stay in the business even at a loss temporarily in the hope that prices will increase?  Surely the Minister will do something about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, because of the increased price for barley paid to barley producers and because the workers in the provender industry have also got some increases, the cost of pig feeding has increased as the Deputy said but, as I said already in my reply, since 20th October, 1969 the price of grade A special has gone up from 282s per cwt, first to 288s per cwt deadweight and then to 298s and also most bacon factories pay a delivery bonus of about 15s per pig and that the increase in the price of pig meal is more than compensated for by the increases in the price of pigs that I have just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Will the Minister concede that since September, 1969 the cost of producing a pig for bacon has gone up by 30s and that the increase in the price which the farmer is paid for that pig has gone up by only 10s?  Surely that is unfair and calculated to drive people out of pig production?  Surely it is something about which the Minister should undertake to do something immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in regard to the 10s increase to which he referred as the minimum price for grade A pigs recently, such pigs were making 12s above that price when that increase was introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Creed that the price being paid for pigs <Col N="1252" /> to producers at present is very satisfactory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

The basis of my reply is that because of an increase paid to barley producers for their product there has been an increase in the price of pig meal.  This is more than counterbalanced by two increases recently in the price of pig meat augmented also by an unofficial delivery bonus usually paid by the bacon factories to the producers.

      <P>As I said in my reply and, as has been announced recently in the Press, on the radio and elsewhere, the warble fly eradication scheme is being reintroduced.  As to what we ought to do, Deputy O'Sullivan and every other Deputy should do everything he can to see that this warble fly eradication scheme will be a success, particularly by emphasising the absolute necessity of dressing all the animals in the herd irrespective of whether they are in-calf or not.  This is one of the places where the eradication scheme fell down the last time.  I would further say that the benefits that will accrue to farmers, apart from the eradication of the warble fly itself, in the elimination of vermin in cattle generally, should more than compensate the participating farmer for his effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The counties in the brucellosis eradication scheme in the years in question were Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan.  These counties have now been cleared and form an attested area.  Full-scale eradication measures will be brought into operation over the next few months in counties Mayo, Louth, Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath and Meath.  The percentage of reactors we expect to identify in those counties in 1970-71 is 3.5.</P>
      <P>There has been no general round of blood testing in the remaining 15 counties. There is, therefore, no precise information on the percentage of brucellosis reactors in those counties. In any event, there must still be in herds in the south many cows which would react to a blood as test not because of disease but because of Strain 19 injections in the past.  This would make any guessing as to the real disease position in the south of even more doubtful value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was concluding last night I was referring to our national monuments.  The speaker before me, Deputy Flanagan, complained rather bitterly about the state of Clonmacnoise.  As we all know Clonmacnoise is one of our more important national monuments and it is one that gets a considerable amount of attention from the Office of Public Works. It is not in such a sad state as indeed a lot of our other national monuments are.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his board should make a greater effort to preserve a number of our old abbeys and really historic landmarks.  A certain <Col N="1308" /> amount of money is spent on all sorts of landmarks some of which could hardly be called historic or national monuments and a number of the national monuments are unfortunately falling into disrepair.  When we talk about national monuments and so on, it is only fair that we should pay some tribute to the members of An Taisce. Like a lot of other things in this country when the State is not able to provide the money or to do the work in regard to various things voluntary bodies step in and do the job.  An Taisce have done a tremendous amount of good work and for that reason it was hardly gracious for the now ex-Minister for Local Government to refer to An Taisce as he did and to have &ldquo;a go&rdquo; at what he called the belted earls.  As far as I know all their members are very ordinary people but listening to Deputy Boland one would imagine that unless you were a belted earl&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of An Taisce have done good work in conjunction with the Office of Public Works and they should get a word of thanks.  I was glad to note from the Parliamentary Secretary's opening speech that beginnings are at last being made on the provision of a concert hall for Dublin.  We pride ourselves that we are quite a musical people and quite a cultured people but yet we have a capital without a proper concert hall.  Recently somebody rightly said that possibly if Members of the Dáil and the Seanad had more time to spend going to concert halls and so on they would be more anxious to allocate money for these purposes. I suppose, however, the public must pay some of the price because they in turn keep us too busy to go to concerts. Dublin does lack a good concert hall and tourists are always a little startled that for a nation which considers itself rather musical we do not spend a lot on concert halls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night, my principal interest in this Estimate is in drainage west of the Shannon and I suppose, <Col N="1309" /> like all women, I said a lot more than I should have and I included a lot of other things in my remarks.  I would like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that I asked him to put a date on the commencement of work on the Dunkellin drainage scheme.  This river was surveyed a few years ago and markers were put into position but now in my area these markers have rotted away and I suppose it will mean starting all over again.  If he could give me a date I could allay the fears of my constituents who feel that drainage work on this river will never be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was enticed to speak on this Estimate because of Deputy Flanagan's remarks last night. Deputy Flanagan talked about Clonmacnoise. I do not do much touring around looking at national monuments but I suppose the best kept national monument which we have is Clonmacnoise. Deputy Oliver Flanagan should go over the 12th or 13th century church at Boyle which has one of the nicest pieces of stone carving in the country.  One has to walk through nettles and thistles which are six feet high and the only path is a track made by the people.  This is, indeed, disgraceful.</P>
      <P>I have also asked the Parliamentary Secretary a question about the graveyard at Mungret.  Deputy Flanagan was quite right when he said there is no point in the Office of Public Works erecting notices threatening people with dire consequences if they deface the property when, at the same time, the property is allowed to fall into decay. Apparently the Office of Public Works erect a notice and then forget about the property.</P>
      <P>In view of the huge increase in the Book of Estimates this year a few thousand pounds spent on national monuments would be well worthwhile. If I might make a comparison, I notice that after incurring expenditure of £500,000 in the past 25 years on Aras an Uachtaráin, this year in the Estimates there is reference to expenditure of some £29,200 for that building.  It is a pity that this sum could not be transferred for the care and maintenance of monuments throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> I was wrong when I suggested that Clonmacnoise was the best preserved national monument.  Obviously, the old vice-regal lodge must be far and away the best preserved monument in the country.  I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what is being done with this £29,200 in addition to the enormous amount already expended on Aras an Uachtaráin.  I know there were years when sums as high as £75,000 and £100,000 were needed and nobody had any objection to this but to continue expenditure at this rate is wasteful. I am not as fond of money as some other people but I have respect for it and deplore waste of any kind.  This annual expenditure on one building&mdash; built in the middle of the 18th century &mdash;is grossly excessive.</P>
    <P>In tourist brochures one sees reference to a &ldquo;nice old church&rdquo; in Boyle and yet when visitors go there they must be appalled at the sight of all the weeds and nettles growing there. Money could be better spent in maintaining places such as this.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan when he praises the Guinness Company for floodlighting the Rock of Cashel although I did not think his remark of &ldquo;More power to them&rdquo; was the most appropriate in the circumstances.  Perhaps if he had said &ldquo;Stout fellows&rdquo; he would have been more on the ball. There are many so-called national monuments in the country and the best thing that could be done would have been to apply the provisions of the Derelict Sites Act to them.  Many of the old castles are far from being an addition to the country and in some cases there is only a single wall remaining. Since much of the work carried out by the Celts was executed in timber we have very few Celtic remains although the remnants of castles of the Norman era do little to enhance the landscape.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the bulk of the expenditure in this Estimate save for one item.  Subhead F.3 deals with rents, rates, <i>et cetera</i>, and it is increased by £200,000.  There were many speculative builders who, having exhausted their chances of making money in the larger English cities, descended on Dublin some years ago. <Col N="1311" /> They would not have prospered here to such a tremendous extent had it not been for the activities of the Government who took over complete buildings and this is quite evident if one walks through the city from O'Connell Bridge House, to Ansley House, right out to Ballsbridge.  The result is that rents are up by £200,000 in one year. This is the kind of waste by the Government in relation to its expenditure to which I object.  The net result is that the integrity of our country is being continually eroded.</P>
    <P>There are various items in the Estimates of which I approve.  There is an increase in respect of coast protection from £5,000 to £50,000.  This is desirable as the work being carried out in this area must be done but, unfortunately, there are many items in the Estimates to which one cannot give approval.</P>
    <P>In regard to arterial drainage, I take it that the Office of Public Works have now got ample machinery and that this is expenditure on the actual work. There is general agreement that some rivers require drainage but there is a difference of opinion as to whether it is desirable to overdo the arterial drainage scheme, in the sense of running the water off the land at certain periods of the year.  This has been the subject of some controversy but, on the whole, there was justification for carrying out some arterial drainage in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to this Estimate, one can approve of many of the provisions but one cannot condone wasteful spending and I want to register the strongest objections to such expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary in presenting this Estimate which is of such significance to the whole structure of our country and our society from the point of view of the provision of schools and so on.  Up to a few years ago the Office of Public Works proceeded on traditional lines and the Parliamentary Secretary has taken on a big responsibility in promoting these new activities and defending the decisions made by him and his staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I support the pleas made by other speakers in regard to the development of office buildings in our city.  It has been argued that by entrusting that task to commercial firms vital capital has been made available in other sectors of our economy.  I think developing public opinion is now against the idea of developers coming in and acquiring large tracts of rundown properties and then presenting to the Government or to the local authority what appears to be an attractive proposition on the face of it but has certain undesirable characteristics.</P>
    <P>I support, too, the arguments put forward about developing the north side of our city.  The north side has been starved of any facilities.  Thousands of employees in the Government service live on the north side and have to undertake daily the hazardous journey to their places of employment on the south side.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should seriously consider the provision of offices on the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made a very important announcement this month in relation to the employment of staff.  There are 300 building trade workers engaged in the maintenance of State buildings and other activities of that kind.  Up to now these workers were recruited through commercial firms.  As from August next these workers will be directly employed by the Office of Public Works.  I believe this step will strengthen the good relations that exist between the commissioners and the workers.  This is one of the most far-reaching decisions taken by the Parliamentary Secretary since he assumed office and it will be of immense benefit to the workers concerned because they will be assured of continuous employment with reasonable conditions and other fringe benefits.</P>
    <P>The Phoenix Park is one of the most vital lungs we have.  I know from experience the limitations it has as a public recreational centre.  I suggest that grazing cattle should be phased out.  It is on record that cattle in the Phoenix Park have contributed to some serious accidents there.  Acres of ground could usefully be devoted to expanding recreational facilities for our <Col N="1313" /> citizens.  There is urgent need for proper car parking facilities for the thousands who visit the Park and the Zoological Gardens.  The car parking facilities at the moment are quite inadequate. Facilities should be made available in the vicinity of the gardens themselves and also in other areas of the Phoenix Park.  It is a common sight to see hundreds of cars parked on the grass.  The Office of Public Works could usefully consider more facilities in the way of cafés and amusement arcades. Everything should be done to make the Park more popular.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement in relation to the John F. Kennedy Concert Hall.  I hope positive steps will be taken to ensure that this building will be constructed without undue delay. If the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are not fully committed to the present site&mdash;I understand some of the houses have been let to Dublin Corporation for the purpose of accommodating temporarily families in need of housing&mdash;I suggest consideration should be given to siting this concert hall on the north side of the city.  Some 400 acres of land there are being developed by the corporation, with the generous assistance of the Government, and, if there are any second thoughts about the site, I suggest St. Anne's would merit consideration.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the portraits in this House.  Week after-week, hundreds of boys and girls with their teachers from schools and colleges throughout the country as well as visitors from home and abroad visit this House.  With the passage of time, the names of some of the personages whose portraits hang in our corridors seem to fade.  I suggest there should be some method of identifying these portraits.  I have been in the corridors from time to time while people were being guided around this House.  When they asked the names of the personages I have, on occasion, witnessed confusion as to the identity of men who made their contribution to the freedom of this country.  I suggest that the names of the personages should be put under the portraits.</P>
    <P>It only remains for me to congratulate <Col N="1314" /> the Parliamentary Secretary again on the introduction of the Estimate for this Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am correct in saying that OPW is far and away the largest State body.  By reason of the few dealings I have had with that office from time to time, I have always felt that there is an old-fashioned integrity and respectability attached to it&mdash;a touch of &ldquo;ould dacency&rdquo;, as they say.  That office is a repository of vast knowledge relating to this country. Apart from the actual records in it, there is an accumulation of skill of immense value and significance there. For these reasons, I should be very slow to accept the changes proposed by the Devlin Report in relation to that office because of its peculiar position in the public life of this country.</P>
      <P>Having regard to its history and traditions and having regard to the skills within that office&mdash;architects, engineers, people of very high professional standards&mdash;I feel that office is in a unique position to give a better service than it has been giving in many ways.  At times, it can surprise us very pleasantly with the quality of the job it performs.  At other times, it can disappoint us by permitting and carrying out a very ordinary, banal type of work.</P>
      <P>The OPW has a unique opportunity to set standards in all types of public work throughout the country, most of which it carries out itself.  By setting a lead, it can ensure that what is carried out by local authorities and by the private sector will have a high standard to compare with and to evaluate.</P>
      <P>Aesthetic standards have fallen. There is a willingness to put up with the second-rate.  There is a willingness to accept second-best.  There is a willingness to shrug the shoulders and to say: &ldquo;It could be worse&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an example, I was driving the other day to Mountjoy Prison.  On my way from O'Connell Street I came to a traffic sign at the top of Parnell Square directing traffic towards Doyle's Corner.  This is not the responsibility of the OPW but I want to mention the quality of the sign.  It was badly painted and set on what appeared to be <Col N="1315" /> two scaffolding posts of uneven length which were supported in rusty tar barrels. This is an important road traffic sign at an important junction in Dublin city.  I object to that quality.  The OPW could give a lead which would help to eliminate that type of thing.</P>
    <P>Another manifestation of that type of standard is the way road schemes are left unfinished possibly for years after the actual surfacing has been completed.  Margins are left in an unkempt fashion.  There are boulders strewn around the place&mdash;even tar barrels sometimes.  Grass seed is unsown. These are not matters for which the OPW is responsible but they indicate standards which the OPW, by giving a lead, could correct.</P>
    <P>Here is an example which affects the OPW directly: the condition of the Seanad Chamber in this building.  I was in it for the first time some couple of weeks ago.  It has many beautiful features but I was appalled to note that the paint on the walls, the surrounds of the fireplaces and the skirtings is in most urgent need of restoration. This chamber must be a showpiece in the national Parliament.  I was disappointed to see its present condition. The windows were dirty.  The blue type of velvet curtain we see in this chamber was in the Seanad Chamber also but was not properly draped and there were not proper pelmets over the windows. We had the incongruous contrast of a most beautiful ceiling, gorgeous fireplaces and doors with grubby windows, untidy curtains and inadequate pelmets.  That this is allowed to exist in the Parliament building is an indication of standards that are not being set by the OPW.  That office has a heavy responsibility to ensure that that sort of thing comes to an end: it should never have happened.  I should like to see evidence of a very conscious acceptance of that responsibility.</P>
    <P>One particular way in which the OPW can give that lead and thereby improve the quality of design in this country concerns our rural national schools.  We have the type built within the past ten years and we have the old type of national school which is gradually being demolished.  The national <Col N="1316" /> schools being built at present are the same all over the country.  Larger urban schools, designed by private architects, can be very attractive and exciting for both children and parents and indicate the standard I am referring to.  By and large, however, the urban schools are built to the same plan and this plan is not attractive.  I cannot imagine that financial considerations are the reasons for sticking to this plan because, so far as I know, every school is tendered for individually. It is not a question that the system of building relating to this design cannot be implemented because the design is found all over the country with different builders erecting it.</P>
    <P>In my journeys from time to time through the Six Counties I have had occasion to notice the urban primary schools.  They are outstandingly modern in their design.  It must be good for the children to receive their early education in a well-designed, up-to-date, bright environment.  I should like to see a change made by the Office of Public Works in the type of design provided for urban schools.  That is something that could be looked into and it would show to the other authorities I mentioned earlier, the private sector and the local authorities, that a high standard can be achieved without any extra cost, and without any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>There is another point which does not relate to the question of physical standards.  I do not know how to categorise what I want to say.  It is an item that drew my attention when I was reading through the estimated expenditure under subhead E, New Works.  It is a contrast between Items 30 and 31.  The provision for 1970-71 in Item 30, Daingean Reformatory, is £4,000 and the provision in Item 31, Accommodation for the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, is £60,000.  I suggest this is crazy.  The one reformatory we have, in Daingean, is so obviously and urgently in need of funds that I cannot understand the mentality of the State Department that would decide that that institution should get £4,000 and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, a haven for academic academics, should <Col N="1317" /> get £60,000.  This again shows a lack of awareness of what this country needs.  Because of its position of being involved in so many operations throughout the length and breadth of the country, the Office of Public Works should give a lead.  Another way it could give a lead is in regard to arterial drainage.  It could give a lead on the question of standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that, and that my interpretation on that point was wrong.  I was referring to arterial drainage and how the board could show consideration for the countryside.  I do not know if any preliminary or concurrent ecological survey is ever carried out with arterial drainage schemes.  If not, as a matter of urgency it should be done in every case, because these drainage schemes are of such a magnitude that they must have a traumatic effect on the Irish countryside.  It is essential to ensure that the consequences of that trauma are fully anticipated so that in the carrying out of the scheme any bad consequences might adequately and competently be abated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These schemes, of course, necessarily scar the countryside.  They involve the deposit of large quantities of river spoil from the beds of the rivers and they are necessarily ugly.  I often wonder if this ugliness could be softened or diminished in some way by endeavouring to level these heaps of spoil at an early stage and perhaps covering them with a slight coating of soil so that they would take grass seed early on.  At the moment it is left to <Col N="1318" /> nature to heal these scars on the countryside.  The natural process is a slow process because nature must work slowly when the heaps which it has to disguise over the years are composed mainly of gravel and adobe clay unsuitable for growing grass.  In time vegetation and grass of a type would grow on these heaps of soil and disguise their ugliness.  That process could be hastened without making the schemes unduly expensive.  The Boyne River is now to be drained and thinking of the beauty of the Boyne Valley and the effect that this drainage must necessarily have on it, one must strongly urge on the Office of Public Works to try to devise some way of softening this blow to the beauty of the Boyne Valley.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt with the responsibility of his Office for the River Shannon and said that the comissioners have a special interest in the River Shannon basin as a recreational waterway which could offer an extensive and wide range of recreational, archaeological and scenic attractions.  He also mentioned the immense potential of the Shannon as a recreational centre and said that potential could not be overestimated.  He said that the commissioners are co-operating fully with Bord Fáilte and the local authorities in the development and promotion of the Shannon basin as a recreational waterway and that his office was responsible for the maintenance and management of the River Shannon navigation.</P>
    <P>He went on to mention that private investment was of the order of £1¾ million, which is a huge investment by our standards, and that the annual income generated by the boat hire industry is about £400,000.  Of course, investment is continuing and, as investment continues to increase, so will income continue to increase, provided the Shannon is properly managed.  I regret to say that at the moment this is not happening.  At the moment navigation north of Athlone to Lanesboro' and, in fact, to Tarmonbarry is hazardous and, for certain types of craft, it is not possible because last Friday week ten sluice gates at Athlone were lifted.  Although representations <Col N="1319" /> were made as speedily as possible&mdash; and they were nearly all closed&mdash; nevertheless, between the opening of the sluices and the taking effect of the representations, the level of Lough Ree was reduced.  The Shannon at Athlone has fallen below the weir wall.</P>
    <P>Since the 1934 Act the ESB have power to reduce the level of Lough Ree to a level two feet below the weir wall at Athlone.  If they do this they make navigation north of Athlone impossible. There is no point in the Parliamentary Secretary stating in his speech that the commissioners are co-operating fully with Bord Fáilte and the local authorities in the promotion of the Shannon as a recreational waterway. The waters of the Shannon are not now available as a recreational waterway for boats wishing to use it. Last year the same thing happened.</P>
    <P>A meeting was held in Athlone between interested parties using the Shannon, representatives of the Office of Public Works and the ESB, to discuss this matter.  I understand from people who were present that while the ESB made sympathetic noises they indicated that if at any time they felt it necessary or desirable they would open the sluices at Athlone and lower the level even if it would make navigation impossible.  They did that last year.  The summer level in Lough Derg was above what might normally be expected.  The jetty at Mountshannon was covered.  If the ESB say that this must be the position in relation to Ardnacrusha it is very difficult to contradict them.  In 1934, when Ardnacrusha was possibly the only generating plant in the country and when the Shannon was not a recreational waterway this was understandable but in this day and age when the output from Ardnacrusha is, I understand, only a very small percentage of the total electricity output of the ESB I think the Office of Public Works will have to say to the ESB: &ldquo;You can no longer have control of the level of Lough Ree.&rdquo;  It has come to that stage.</P>
    <P>Again, it seems peculiar that in the summer the ESB should be so anxious about keeping Lough Derg at panic level to suit Ardnacrusha because the <Col N="1320" /> loading the ESB might normally expect from the necessity to provide heat is absent in summer and the demand on its output is consequently less.  I am puzzled as to why the ESB needs Lough Derg kept at the level it insists on maintaining there.  I think the ESB would certainly have to satisfy the Office of Public Works beyond all doubt that it needs this level as a matter of urgency.  Even if it does, the Office of Public Works would have to decide which will now take precedence, the value to the economy of the Shannon as a holiday waterway or the value to the economy of the electricity produced by Ardnacrusha, bearing in mind that, as the Parliamentary Secretary has told us, private investment in the Shannon at present is £1.75 million. I know it is rising.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is a compromise between the two situations.  It may be suggested that dredging would be a compromise.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the commissioners were about to undertake improvement works in the navigation channel between Lanesboro' and Tarmonbarry. I understand this, in effect, will be dredging and that one reason that may be offered for allowing the water to come from Lough Ree at this time of year is that the level on this stretch will be lowered and thereby make dredging easier.  This is ridiculous because if the dredger is going to be affected by a drop of three or four feet there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>Again, Lough Ree cannot be dredged.  Possibly, the navigation channel could be dredged but it would deprive Lough Ree of its attractions as a tourist waterway if boats were to be confined to the navigation channel only and it became patently unsafe for them to leave it.  When the water is at what I call normal level, above its present level, it is possible for a careful yachtsman using the charts of the late Colonel Rice's Shell Guide to explore Lough Ree and its islands but at the moment, because of the abnormally low level of the water, this would be highly hazardous.  It has even been said to me by a fisherman who was born and reared on an island in Lough Ree and thought he knew every rock in it <Col N="1321" /> that he never realised the dangers he was sailing over until this summer and last summer when the low water exposed rocks that he did not dream existed.  If the rocks are exposed they are not so dangerous; they are visible to the navigator but if they are not exposed and lie some five or six inches underwater they are a real danger.  These rocks would be no danger at times of normal level because the draught of the normal pleasuse cruiser would be quite shallow.</P>
    <P>The firm of Guinness have recently invested in a fleet of cruisers and some of them are ten-berth cruisers, rather big boats, requiring a considerable amount of water for safe navigation. I understand the Guinness boats are allowed to cross Lough Ree only in convoy.  It makes nonsense of our efforts to project the Shannon as a leading place in Europe for waterway holidays if boats have to travel in convoys across one of the features of the Shannon, Lough Ree.</P>
    <P>CIE who, perhaps, led the way in making at least the Irish public conscious of the Shannon, by putting its boats there, cannot operate north of Athlone at present.  Last year they had to suspend cruising for most of the season north of the town.  Irish River Floatels, who now have four floatels plying on the Shannon, and who have advertised extensively and necessarily expensively here and on the Continent, cannot operate north of Athlone.  This completely detracts from their programme because they offer a two-week holiday, one week in the lower Shannon and one week in the upper Shannon. If people come to this country and find that what has been advertised is not available to them, a bad advertisement leaves the country and in the tourist business bad advertising can be cumulative in its effects.</P>
    <P>The quays at Athlone require urgent attention from the Office of Public Works in connection with their programme for the Shannon.  At the moment because of the low level of the water, dirt and refuse of all types along the quays of both east and west banks are clearly visible.  It would be a simple matter for the Board of Works to arrange during the winter, when the <Col N="1322" /> level is often low and the flow is not excessively strong, to clean the quays. In addition, navigation between the weir and the road bridge and between the road bridge and the railway bridge in Athlone is difficult and dangerous. There are old mooring stones in the middle of the river which are a navigational hazard because of the low level of the water.  This will have to be cleared so that boats coming out of the lock to tie up at the quay can cross any part of the river between the lock and the town bridge in absolute safety.</P>
    <P>Again, as I mentioned earlier today in connection with a question to the Parliamentary Secretary, weeds are a navigational hazard.  The Athlone Urban Council for a number of years past, regularly each year, have drawn the attention of the Office of Public Works to the presence of these unsightly weeds.  It is bad enough that they are ugly and that nobody bothers about them&mdash;this comes back to what I said when I started my speech&mdash;but the Office of Public Works are in breach of a statutory duty to maintain navigation on the Shannon by their failure to cut these weeds, because it must be acknowledged that weeds can stop a boat.  One further result of the lowering of Lough Ree is the fact that because the water is not crossing the weir wall at Athlone, in the corner of the weir and the Leinster Quay there is in effect a cesspool.  It is an area of dead water and into that corner flows refuse and raw sewage from cabin cruisers tied up at the quay at Athlone. If the level remains below the weir wall all summer, and unless there is an extraordinary amount of rainfall now it will have to, due to the fact that the sluices were opened a couple of weeks ago, there will be a positive nuisance in the middle of the town.</P>
    <P>This is another effect which does not worry the ESB when they arbitrarily, as we imagine, decide to open the sluices and denude the upper Shannon of its water.  Instead of having an even, gradual flow from Lough Ree through the weir at Athlone down the river, the water was let go suddenly and the flow was stopped suddenly. This has had the effect of reducing the level below the weir in Athlone for <Col N="1323" /> quite some distance downstream, and for any sizeable boats navigation in that direction is also hazardous.</P>
    <P>It is now critical that the Office of Public Works would come to terms with the ESB and say to them in no uncertain manner: &ldquo;Navigation on the Shannon must now take precedence&rdquo;, and ensure that this waterway will be available during the summer for all types of boats that are at present using it.  There is little point in the Parliamentary Secretary talking about the immense potential of the Shannon as a recreational centre if it cannot be used as a recreational centre.  I do not imagine that dredging will provide a compromise between the needs of the Shannon as a recreational centre and the requirements of the ESB&mdash;if the ESB can still justify this requirement as valid&mdash;because all that can be dredged in Lough Ree is a navigational channel.  The rest of the lake will remain inaccessible and dangerous, and, if it is, a great deal of the benefit of the Shannon as a recreational centre is removed.  Much of the dredging could have been done below Athlone and from Lanesboro' to Tarmonbarry, which would have eased the position without solving it.  I understand there has been a dredger at Killalce lying idle for upwards of ten years.  If that is the case it is something that requires an explanation.  Again I would urge that, if dredging of the Shannon is to be carried out on any significant scale, it should be done with the very best and latest equipment and that the banks of the Shannon, where dredging is on the river portion of it, be kept free from spoil by using hoppers which can deposit the spoil in parts of Lough Ree and parts of Lough Derg.  Depths of up to 100 feet are available in both of these lakes over considerable areas, and these depths can take all the spoil that will be removed in normal dredging operations.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary deal with these points when he is replying and I should like to hear him say what his views are on the Shannon in relation to its position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the ESB.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Office of Public Works would try to arrange through the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1324" /> and Fisheries some form of liaison with land reclamation contractors with the object of ensuring that ring forts or raths would not be bulldozed in the course of reclamation works.  Ring forts are common throughout Ireland and they are so common that the farmers on whose lands they are situated are not inclined to regard them as having any historic or archaeological significance.  I understand that in the few ring forts which have been excavated some things of value have been found in a good many of them.  I would recall to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Ardagh chalice, perhaps our most precious relic, was found in a ring fort and that it is very important that indiscriminate and large-scale destruction of ring forts would not take place without some prior excavation to ensure they do not contain objects of value.</P>
    <P>One can sympathise with the land reclamation contractor.  He is worried about his profit and he wants to get in and get out again as quickly as he can. One can sympathise with the farmer because the fort which has always been on his land is in the way of improving the land.  Between the two of them the fort can get short shrift.  It would be a scandal should this happen.  The only way to prevent it happening is to establish liaison between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Office of Public Works so that when an application for land reclamation goes to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries the ground will be checked to see if there is a ring fort on it.  This will not be found on a map because by and large ring forts are not shown on maps and it requires a visual inspection.  No doubt the farmers and the contractors can be educated to report the existence of these, and be educated in regard to their potential importance, but until that is done and a visual inspection carried out a lot of archaeological damage and vandalism can unwittingly take place.  When we remember that the Ardagh chalice was found in one of these it is serious to think that a structure which could hide such a relic might unwittingly be destroyed.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary dealt with this in his speech.  He referred to the archaeological survey which started in 1965 and to the maintenance of national monuments.  There may be overlapping between the two Departments but I do not think I am out of order in discussing responsibility to ensure that items of a unique archaeological value are not unwittingly destroyed.</P>

      <P>I was going to refer to the archaeological survey which started in 1965 and which has recorded monuments up to A.D. 1200 in Counties Louth, Monaghan and Meath.  I would suggest that this work needs to be expanded urgently because if it is to continue at that rate a lot of monuments in the counties still to be reached will have fallen into ruin by the time the survey reaches them and the survey then will have no point. In addition to this survey all of the monuments within the care of the Office of Public Works require to be surveyed and their present condition ascertained because unfortunately many of them are in a state of neglect. I might mention Abbeyshrule which is a very substantial remains.  Part of it would appear to be a belfry which seems to be in a state of falling.  On Inishbofin there are unique grave slabs and a complaint was made last September that this monument required urgent attention but no action has been taken.  I might also mention Clontusker.  Beams were erected in 1912 to assist in the maintenance of Clontusker but the walls collapsed in 1968.  That should not have happened. Clontusker was the headquarters of the O'Kellys of Hy Maine and it is a very important monument.  If it was seen in 1912 that it required beams it is an appalling story of neglect that this monument collapsed in 1968.  It shows a complete lack of inspection and a complete lack of knowledge because if that knowledge had been available the <Col N="1326" /> collapse would not have been allowed. A system needs to be devised urgently so that knowledge can be available to the Office of Public Works and no doubt when they have the knowledge the necessary action will be taken and national monuments will not be allowed to collapse.</P>
      <P>Possibly it may be argued that if a monument collapses it can be rebuilt but then you have an ersatz national monument and it is the essential antiquity of a monument that makes it interesting to us and to tourists. Again, tourists want to see more on our monuments than a warning plaque saying that those who interfere with the monument will be prosecuted. Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Hogan O'Higgins referred to the fact that the only plaques on our national monuments were warnings of this sort.  It should not be beyond the wit of the Office of Public Works to provide a concise explanatory plaque for each national monument.</P>
      <P>That is all I wish to say on the Estimate.  As I said at the outset the Office of Public Works are in a unique position to set standards of work for other public bodies and for the private sector.  They have within their staff the skills and the long tradition to provide them with the necessary desire to ensure that all their work should be of a high standard.  The situation in regard to the Shannon is now critical.  A lot of money invested in the Shannon will be wasted unless there is enough water to maintain the upper Shannon for safe and comfortable navigation at all times of the year.  I should like to see the archaeological survey speeded up so that anything of interest will be noted before it falls.  I would also like to see some arrangement made to ensure that ring forts will not be bulldozed in the course of land reclamation until an investigation is carried out to ensure they do not contain anything of importance. The Office of Public Works can be of immense importance in the life of the country; they can set high standards in all their operations and give a lead to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary interest is in regard to the arterial drainage of the River Suir.  In my constituency the <Col N="1327" /> problem of flooding is of such importance and urgency that I would be failing in my duty as a Deputy if I failed to speak of the matter now.  The Office of Public Works and the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor are well aware of the growing anxiety about flooding in the area.  The people of South Tipperary have been looking forward for a number of years past to the commencement of the arterial drainage of the Suir and its tributaries. We have had many assurances and we were given reason to believe in recent years that the commencement of the work was imminent.  So close were we to commencement of the scheme that local authorities for the past few years have been unable or unwilling to carry out any minor drainage on the Suir proper or on its tributaries.  As a result, there has been a complete clogging up of the Suir.</P>
      <P>This has aggravated the problem of flooding and there have been many instances of hardship and misery during the past two winters.  Thousands of acres of rich arable land in the Golden Vale of Tipperary have been inundated for long periods, villages and communities have been isolated and cut off from church, schools and shopping centres. We brought this matter to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, Deputy J. Gibbons, and we have shown in graphic detail the many flood points in the constituency: Ardfinnan, Newcastle, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Cahir and many other parts.  We showed photographs of the incidence of flooding and we were able to inform the Office of Public Works regarding the recurrence of such flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a period of very dry weather as we have at the moment there is great concern in many parts of my constituency that heavy rains will come, shores will be blocked up and once again we will have severe flooding, bringing with it hardship and privation for farmers, cottiers, householders and shopkeepers.  My purpose in speaking here is to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have regard to the urgent need for the arterial drainage of the Suir. There must not be any equivocation <Col N="1328" /> on this occasion.  There must be no doubt or ambiguity about the commencement date.  We have been promised that this extensive scheme will commence in 1971 and there must be no deferment.  We have waited too long for this scheme and there has been far too much suffering and hardship in the meantime.  This vast tract of rich arable land must be reclaimed so that we can guarantee large communities in my constituency some security against the losses incurred by flooding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has always been most helpful and courteous to me and I have no hesitation in paying tribute to him for the excellent manner in which he is performing his duties as the person in charge of the Office of Public Works for the past two years. Too often we are critical and carping of each other but when praise is justified it should be given in an unstinted way.  So far as I am concerned, Deputy Lemass is worthy of that praise and I thank him.  I would be grateful if he would indicate the stage now reached in regard to drainage of the Suir and its tributaries, the kind of work envisaged, confirmation of the commencement date of the work, the form it will take and when it is likely to be completed.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has very great responsibility but, equally, he has an opportunity to perform some worthwhile work for the country.  The Office of Public Works deals with the preservation of all that is good and noble. They are concerned with the preservation of things historical and what we value as part of our national heritage. For what they do in this preservation work they deserve the support and commendation of us all.  Whether it be castle, tower, moat or monument, it is right that these things be preserved and maintained for posterity.  We all deplore acts of vandalism on monuments so preserved by the Office of Public Works and if it is possible to bring in more stern measures against these vandals who desecrate such places I do not hesitate to suggest that such legislation be enforced.</P>
    <P>I have observed the good work being done in respect of the erection and repair of our schools, especially the <Col N="1329" /> primary schools.  I was glad to learn that managers may now carry out certain repairs and provide sanitary facilities in schools.  The old schools&mdash;cold, dark, dilapidated and lacking in sanitary facilities and running water&mdash;have long been a bone of contention.  I trust that handing over responsibility to school managers now will result in some modernisation of these schools and in the provision of the essential amenities.  I should like to think, however, the Parliamentary Secretary will have overriding responsibility to ensure that these things are done.  Last week here I raised a question about a school in my constituency which has as yet no running water and no proper sanitary facilities.  It is true that a comprehensive school will be erected in the area, but its erection will take a considerable time.  In the meantime the children should not have to undergo the hardship of being deprived of running water and proper sanitary facilities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that worthwhile progress has been made in the erection of three schools for the mentally handicapped.  I have one grievance. It may not be relevant to the Office of Public Works.  I should prefer to see schools erected for the severely handicapped. I appreciate I am now impinging on Health.  The main difficulty is providing proper institutional treatment for the severely mentally or physically handicapped.  There are large numbers of unfortunate boys and girls who have been waiting for a long number of years for bed accommodation. No such accommodation is forthcoming. If the Office of Public Works would use its influence in this regard it would be a great act of charity.  Positive steps should be taken to reduce the numbers of severely handicapped awaiting accommodation.  Many of them are confined in mental hospitals. These children should not be domiciled with adults in mental institutions just because there is no proper accommodation for them.  I would urge the Office of Public Works to bend their energies to the provision of accommodation for the severely handicaped. It is high time we tried to reduce the numbers awaiting proper treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> I am glad to see that the improvements in Clonmel post office will take place this year.  There is overcrowding and a lack of modern amenities.  We have no automatic telephone exchange. I trust the plans envisage the automatic telephone exchange.</P>
    <P>With regard to Garda barracks, many of us are saddened to see barracks closed and gardaí transferred, with resultant anxiety to local inhabitants. Barracks should be maintained in good condition.  Proper facilities should be provided.</P>
    <P>I trust the Office of Public Works will continue the good work of maintaining our national monuments.  There should be close liaison between the Office of Public Works and local authorities in the maintenance and surveillance of our historic monuments. We did have local national monument committees.  In my local authority area I notice there has been no meeting of the local national monuments committee for quite some time.  Is this due to inactivity on the part of the council or to inactivity on the part of the Office of Public Works?  I was a member of this body for a few years and I was very conscious of the dedication of the members.  They had an amazing knowledge of local historical matters and they were prepared to make personal sacrifices in order to preserve what was historically worthy of preservation. Too much that was worthy of preservation has been swept away by the bulldozers.  It is time to cry &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;.  Places of historical importance have been destroyed.  There is no recognition of great men of the past. I am sorry to say that, in my home town of Clonmel apart from the great men of Irish origin who came from that town, great literary men in the English-speaking world such as Anthony Trollope and George Borrow had close association with that town, lived there for many years and garnered many an idea there which in their genius they put to good literary use afterwards.  There is no indication, no sign or token, to show that either of these two literary men had any association with the houses or the town in question.  This is to be deplored.  It is important that tourists, especially <Col N="1331" /> English-speaking tourists the world over who have a flair for English literature, should know that men such as Anthony Trollope, George Borrow, and the like, had an association with an Irish town.  Perhaps I could best sum up the intrinsic value of the Office of Public Works in matters appertaining to things historical by quoting the words of Thomas Davis:</P>
    <P>This land of ours is no mere sand bank thrown up by some recent caprice of earth but is an ancient land honoured in the archives of quity by its piety, its valour and its civilisation and transcending anti-suffering.</P>
    <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary well and thank him for his personal courtesy and kindness to me.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to join with other speakers in congratulating Deputy Lemass on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Office of Public Works.  I am satisfied that, during his stay there, he will continue to extend the courtesy to us that we have been accustomed to expect.  It is very desirable in Parliamentary life that we should have members of the Government&mdash;whether they be senior Ministers or junior Ministers&mdash;who are prepared to discuss matters with members of the Opposition, whether in their offices or across the floor of this House, in a friendly and constructive manner.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the office which he administers are charged with responsibility for arterial drainage. Arterial drainage deals with a great national problem.  While it is a very serious national problem, it is also what I might describe as a regional problem.  It can be more acute in one region of the country than in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, arterial drainage, in so far as it affects a country or a constituency of small agricultural holders such as we have in my constituency of Cavan, presents a much more serious problem than it does in the more wealthy counties, the counties of larger holdings.  In assessing the problem and in deciding on priorities, the Government <Col N="1332" /> and the Parliamentary Secretary should keep that clearly before them and should direct their attention to relieving flooding and reclaiming land in areas where the holdings are small and where land is accordingly proportionately more valuable.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Cavan is very badly affected by flooding.  Much land needs to be reclaimed and relieved of flooding.  I am afraid that, in assessing priorities, the Government do not always keep that before them.  As an example of that, I might point out that, when the Boyne scheme was first drafted&mdash;indeed, I think, when it was approved or at least when it was exhibited&mdash;certain tributaries of the Boyne in County Cavan, east Cavan, were excluded entirely from it.  Representations were then made by Cavan County Council and the matter was raised by me in this House.  I think I am correct in saying that, as a result of those representations, the portion of Cavan which should originally have been included in the scheme was included. I know the Parliamentary Secretary will confirm that fact but by far the greater part of County Cavan which is affected by flooding can be relieved only by the drainage of the river Erne&mdash;and this is something that seems to have been put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Every time that we public representatives bring up with the county council or with the OPW the question of drainage in Cavan we are told that it must await the drainage of the Erne.  I raised the matter with the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in 1967 when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, with special reference to the Woodford canal in Ballyconnell.  The then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy James Gibbons, told me that a special survey had been carried out, including a survey of the lakes; that that took over a year but was then completed in 1967. He also told me that the preparation of the scheme was proceeding and promised that the question of the examination of the Woodford river would be taken up.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me the present position <Col N="1333" /> regarding the River Erne because it affects a vast acreage all over County Cavan and because nothing worthwhile can be done with drainage in Cavan until the Erne is tackled.  We are a county of small farmers.  When a man with 15, 20, 25 or 30 acres of land finds that a substantial portion of his small holding is subject to flooding, it is a very serious matter for him, and it is a very serious matter for the economy of the county.  I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence with the Government to get work on the River Erne commenced so that land all over the county which is affected by the Erne may be attended to.</P>
    <P>I raise the matter of Woodford canal because not only is it causing flooding to the land of farmers in the Ballyconnell area but it is also depriving that area of a valuable tourist attraction.  If the river were drained and the locks removed, it could serve as a waterway which would attract many tourists and would eventually connect the Erne and the Shannon.  That is all I want to say about that aspect of drainage.  I cannot emphasise too strongly how important this matter of the Erne is in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Inny at the extreme end of the county was drained.  The Inny was used for as long as anyone can remember for boating between Lough Sheelin and Lough Kineal in the Finea district.  Two or three years ago, for some unknown reason, after the drainage was completed, the Office of Public Works erected a huge dam in the river at the Bridge of Finea, completely obstructing the river and making it impossible for boats to pass under the bridge from one lake to the other.  Before the drainage was carried out there was a lesser obstruction some distance on one side of the bridge, but this obstruction was so constructed that it did not prevent boating on the river, and boats could pass freely from one side to the other.</P>
    <P>There is grave objection in the Finea area to this obstruction.  I think it was a completely illegal act and the Office of Public Works may have to defend their action elsewhere.  If I can persuade them, by the few words I have to say here today, to undo this wrong <Col N="1334" /> and restore the river to its former state as far as navigation between the two lakes I mentioned is concerned, the Office of Public Works will avoid having to defend an action in the courts and save many people a lot of trouble.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is some reason connected with levels of lakes or something like that, but it is an unjustifiable reason.  The dam there is unsightly. I think it is unnecessary.  If the Office of Public Works insist that some dam or obstruction of the water is necessary, it should not be beyond their powers or the ingenuity of their advisers to do it in such a way that would still permit the movement of boats up and down the river with the minimum trouble, inconvenience or annoyance. This is a huge, ignorant-looking dam that any unskilled labourer could design and put there.  The people in the district are very upset and very worried, and they resent it very much.</P>
    <P>I have made written representations about this before.  I do not think I got any final decision one way or the other and I take that to mean that the Office of Public Works have realised that they have a difficult problem on their hands and they are now soft-peddling. I should like them now to consider it seriously and I wish them to know that the matter will not be allowed to rest where it is.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works act as building agents for various Departments in matters like the building of schools, Garda barracks and so on. I think I am correct in saying that they also act as purchasing agents where, instead of erecting a new building they decide to buy an existing building and convert it into a Garda barracks or offices for some Departments.  I believe the Office of Public Works are operating under an antiquated system in this respect.  If they are to continue to act as purchasing agents at a time when there is a big demand for buildings, they will have to revise their approach and cut red tape.  If their approach was revised and if the red tape was cut, they would not only be better equipped to purchase these buildings, but they would also eventually save the State a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> I know of two instances at least where properties came on the market and the Office of Public Works should have known that these properties were required for State purposes, or at least the Departments for whom they were acting as agents should have known. Neither of them knew and the properties changed hands and then, within a comparatively short time, the Board of Works had to step in and buy them at a very considerable profit in each case. That is bad business and it is probably due to the fact that the various officials are tied up in red tape.  The file must be in order.  These things have to be inspected and approved by somebody else.  They have to go to the Department of Finance and receive approval there.  In the meantime, the bird has flown.</P>
    <P>If I can point to two instances of that we can be sure it is happening all over the country.  This purchasing agency would require to be modernised, geared to deal with modern conditions and geared to deal with the situation in which properties change hands quickly.  There is keen competition, and property that is available this week may have changed hands next week.  In the two instances I mentioned, the Office of Public Works eventually obtained the premises but they might not have been available.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains the provisions required to give effect to Budget proposals as well as provisions on a number of other matters to which I shall draw attention in the course of the review I propose to give of the contents of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Part 1 of the Bill is concerned with income tax and corporation profits tax. Section 1 reimposes income tax and sur-tax for the year 1970-71 at the same rates as for the previous year.  However, as announced in the Budget, the first £100 of taxable income will be charged to tax at a reduced rate of two-thirds of the standard rate and a new minimum earned income relief is being introduced. The purpose of these innovations, which are provided for in sections 2 and 6 of the Bill, is to reduce the tax burden for persons at the lower income level by removing some 50,000 taxpayers from the tax net and making entry into the net somewhat less painful. Under sections 7 and 8 the &ldquo;age relief&rdquo; and &ldquo;small incomes relief&rdquo; are improved in line with the new minimum earned income relief.</P>
    <P>Section 5 enables the Revenue Commissioners to obtain the necessary information from employers to administer the minimum earned income relief and to deal with cases where employees' earnings during a year were not expected to, but did in fact, exceed £2,000, the point at which the maximum earned income relief begins to operate.</P>
    <P>In recent years, industrial and other concerns have been finding it increasingly difficult to attract female labour. As a contribution to easing the problem, it was announced in the Budget that the earned income allowance for married women was being increased from £45 to £74.  Effect is given to this increase in section 9.</P>
    <P>Last year, as a step towards introducing a measure of selectivity in the scheme of children's allowances, some of the increase then given in the allowances was recovered by reducing the income tax deductions for children.  A similar provision in relation to this year's increase in the allowances is contained in section 10.</P>
    <P>The income limit for the purpose of the dependent relative allowance is raised by section 11 to £222 which is the annual equivalent of the non-contributory old age pension as increased in the Budget.</P>
    <P>I now come to the provisions in Part <Col N="1337" /> I of the Bill dealing with matters which were not announced in the Budget. Sections 3 and 4 involve minor technical changes arising from the introduction of decimal currency and the adoption of the term &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; for &ldquo;undeveloped area&rdquo;.  The purpose of section 12 is to relieve friendly societies, such as credit unions, of the trouble and expense of making returns of the smaller amounts of interest paid by them to members without deduction of tax.  Under section 13 the limit for tax relief for certain retirement annuity premiums is being raised to take account of the change in money values since the limit was introduced in 1958.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of section 14 is to amend the provisions governing the making of wear and tear allowances in respect of machinery or plant so as to enable the amount of the wear and tear allowance for a given year to be arrived at on the basis of the true written-down value of the machinery or plant at the commencement of the year.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 introduce a degree of flexibility in the date of operation of the relief in respect of dividends and interest paid on stocks, shares and securities of Irish companies. Another provision relating to industrial firms is contained in section 19 which enables a person who purchases a &ldquo;ready-made&rdquo; building to claim the industrial building allowance. There is a growing tendency for industrialists to purchase such premises rather than build their own and the provision is being introduced to take account of this development.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is an anti-avoidance measure designed to deal with another recent development, namely, the system of sub-contracting in the construction industry, or &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; as it is commonly known.  These sub-contractors have, for the most part, been escaping tax because of the difficulty of identifying them.  The measure now being introduced will require tax to be deducted at the standard rate from payments made to these sub-contractors unless the Revenue Commissioners authorise otherwise.  The Revenue Commissioners may make regulations for the operation of this provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> Section 18 provides for the tax exemptions in respect of the new instalment savings scheme which I shall be dealing with later on when I come to section 51.</P>
    <P>A separate chapter in Part I of the Bill contains a group of sections which bring into charge on tax certain receipts, not previously taxable, which come in after a trade or profession is discontinued or after there has been a change in the basis on which accounts have been drawn up.  These are complicated provisions and I should like to give some background information on them.</P>
    <P>In computing the profits of a trade or profession two alternative methods are generally used, namely, the &ldquo;earnings basis&rdquo; or the &ldquo;cash basis&rdquo;.  Under the earnings basis, the income of the trade or profession is computed by reference to the value of services rendered during the accounting period and, accordingly, accounts outstanding at the end of the period are included as part of the income.  Where the cash basis is applied, the income is taken as the cash actually received during the accounting period and debts outstanding at the end of that period are ignored.  In some cases, a variation on these methods known as the &ldquo;fees furnished basis&rdquo; is applied.  In these cases, income is computed by reference to the bills actually furnished to clients, whether paid or not during the period in question.</P>
    <P>It makes little or no difference over a period of years, from the tax point of view, which basis is adopted so long as the business continues to be carried on.  It is only when the business is discontinued and payments continue to be received in respect of services rendered before the discontinuance that a practical distinction arises as between the different methods of assessment.  In the case of persons who were on the earnings basis, these post-cessation receipts will already have been brought into charge.  Persons on the cash basis, however, are not liable to tax on their post-cessation receipts and persons on the fees furnished are not liable in respect of the post-cessation receipts arising from billings made after the discontinuance.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the provisions <Col N="1339" /> contained in chapter II of Part I of the Bill is to rectify these anomalous situations by ensuring that all receipts are brought into charge.  It will be noted that, in the case of cessations, the charge will apply only to sums received after the date of passing of the Bill and the charge arising by reason of a change of basis of accounting will apply only to changes taking place after that date.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should inform the House that I have a personal interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>This chapter also contains provisions dealing with the valuation of work in progress at the discontinuance of a business and the case where a trading debt already allowed as a deduction in computing profits is subsequently released by the creditor.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with customs and excise matters.  This year, there has been no increase in the main duties. The sections in this Part of the Bill are, therefore, confined to giving concessions of advantage to trade interests and to tidying up details in the law which have become rather restrictive in some respects for modern conditions. These provisions were not announced in the Budget.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation specifies the sizes of bottles and the quantities in which wines and spirits may be bottled and packed in warehouse and cleared for the home market.  To ensure greater flexibility in this sphere, I am providing in section 27 of the Bill for exercise of discretion by the Revenue Commissioners in deciding on variations in bottling and packing.</P>
    <P>It has been put to me that distillers should be allowed to defer payment of duty for a period on clearance from warehouse.  I am satisfied that this is necessary and I propose that an arrangement similar to that allowed for the tobacco manufacturers should be made.  Section 28 of the Bill gives effect to this intention.  To recoup the Exchequer for part of the cost of making this concession, I am increasing the rate of excise duty on spirits by 8d per proof gallon of spirits benefiting from the concession.  Of course, no increase in the price of spirits will result <Col N="1340" /> from this arrangement.  At present, white spirit is technically within the charge to duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oil but, as it is used for industrial processes rather than in road vehicles, it is relieved from duty by the issue of licences.  For reasons of administrative simplification I am excluding white spirit from the scope of the definition of mineral hydrocarbon light oil by way of section 29 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 30 enables the Revenue Commissioners to extend the period in which claims for repayment of part of the duty on fuel used in buses may be submitted.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Bill is being included, in response to representations made to me, in order to help the small tobacco manufacturers whose annual leaf intake does not exceed 50,000 lbs of tobacco.  The firms in question handle less than 1 per cent of the tobacco used in the State and the increased rebate will help them to continue in production.</P>
    <P>Section 32 confirms two orders made under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957.  One order related to the reduction from 5 years to 3 years in the limit for liability to the duty on immature spirits and the other order effected a change in the motor tax on self-propelled processing machines, such as concrete mixers.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with death duties.  The provisions were not announced in the Budget.  Section 34 is designed to prevent avoidance of duty by the device of forming a private company to take over such property as lands, houses, stock exchange securities or a business.  Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1965, introduced certain provisions to deal with the matter but it has been found that the provisions could be avoided where the company was not, at the time of the disposition of the property to it, a company controlled by the deceased and only afterwards became such a company.  Section 34 also contains provisions designed to prevent avoidance of duty through the under-valuation of certain private company shares.</P>
    <P>A further anti-avoidance measure is contained in section 38.  Government securities, securities of semi-State <Col N="1341" /> bodies and of some municipal corporations are usually issued with the condition that they should be exempt from death duties while in the beneficial ownership of persons resident and domiciled outside the State.  It has come to notice that this condition can be brought about artificially by the use of a foreign based private company or other means and section 38 is designed to counter this.</P>
    <P>Section 33 contains provisions in regard to estate duty consequent on the amendments being made in the income tax legislation by sections 15 and 16 of the Bill to which I have already referred.  Sections 35 and 36 widen the definition of a dependent child for estate duty purposes so as to bring it into line with the definition in force for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation provides certain reliefs from estate duty in respect of gifts to the State.  Where, however, the donor interposes a life interest before the State's right to possession, the relief operates only in respect of the death of the life tenant and not on the death of the donor.  It has been represented to me that this is inequitable where the life interest is held by the spouse of the donor.  I propose to remedy this situation by providing, in section 37, that in the case of a gift vested indefeasibly in the State no estate duty will be payable on the death of either the donor or the spouse.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Part IV of the Bill, which relate to stamp duties and which were not announced in the Budget, are concerned mainly with introducing a measure of rationalisation of the stamp duty code and, at the same time, making the necessary changes in preparation for the changeover to decimal currency.  Section 39 provides for a new first schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891. A number of obsolete and unproductive heads in the existing schedule are being abolished.  Where the heads of charge are being retained, the rating structure is in a number of cases being simplified and, where necessary, the rates are being expressed in amounts which will have exact equivalents in the new decimal currency.</P>
    <P>In making these changes in rates, care has been taken to ensure that as <Col N="1342" /> far as possible there will be no additional burden of duty.  There is, however, one exception to which I wish to draw attention.  At present, on the sale of a business premises, the transfer of assets, such as goodwill, attaching to the premises attracts duty at a lower rate than the transfer of the premises.  This has given rise to avoidance of duty by the placing of an inordinate value on the goodwill, etc., thereby reducing the consideration for the transfer of the premises.  In the new first schedule this means of avoidance is blocked by bringing the rate of duty for such assets into line with that which attaches to the premises.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that with effect from decimal day the rate of duty on bills of exchange, including cheques, and promissory notes drawn in the State will be one new penny instead of the existing rate of 3d.  It was represented to me that, following the British example, this duty should be abolished from decimal day.  In view, however, of the not insignificant yield from this duty&mdash;over £½ million&mdash;I was unable to accept this proposal.  There will, of course, be a loss of some £100,000 in the adoption of the rate of one new penny in place of the existing rate of 3d.</P>
    <P>Sections 41, 42, 45 and 46 contain other provisions arising out of the introduction of the new first schedule or from the changeover to decimal currency.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 43, which abolishes stamp duty on the transfer of securities guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, is to facilitate the development of a market in the securities of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Last year, a new stamp duty charge of 10 per cent was imposed on contracts for the building of office blocks. This charge was intended to discourage or slow down the building of offices on a speculative basis so that available resources might be diverted to more essential purposes.  I have received representations that this charge imposes an unfair burden on firms who find it necessary to build office accommodation for the use of their own staffs.  I have decided to accede to these representations and in section <Col N="1343" /> 44 I am abolishing the duty on such office blocks, subject to the condition that there is no change of occupancy for five years.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides for the Budget increase from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent in the rate of the tax.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to me to raise the limit of £750 per month at which certain classes of traders are required to register for the turnover tax. I am convinced of the merits of the case for an upward adjustment and have provided in section 48 for raising the limit in question to £1,000 per month.  Registered traders affected who wish to avail of this concession should aply to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 49 enables an accountable person to pass on the increase in turnover tax in cases where taxable receipts accuring after 1st May arise under contracts entered into before that date.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to Part VI of the Bill.  Section 50, which is an annual provision, fixes the annuity for the redemption of the debt incurred on voted capital services in 1969-70 and 1970-71.</P>
    <P>Section 51 contains the necessary provisions for putting into operation the new instalment savings scheme announced in the Budget.  The purpose of this scheme is to encourage people to save by regular monthly instalments for a specified period.  If they retain their savings on deposit for a further period they will be repaid the amount deposited together with a bonus or interest which, in accordance with the provisions of section 18, will be tax free.  The new scheme will be launched in the autumn and I have every hope that it will prove a valuable medium for increasing the level of savings.</P>
    <P>Section 52 removes a technical restriction in the existing borrowing powers of the Minister for Finance. Section 53 provides against a situation where, because of a continuation of the bank closure, it would not be possible to redeem certain Government stocks on the due date of 15th July, 1970.  The section gives the Minister for Finance power, in such circumstances, to postpone <Col N="1344" /> the redemption date and to pay interest in respect of the period of postponement.</P>
    <P>Credit is given by section 54 against Irish tax in respect of tax spared under tax incentive schemes operated by countries with which we have double taxation arrangements providing for similar treatment for our own tax incentive reliefs.  Section 55 extends to the investment abroad of profits earned in Shannon Airport the measure of unilateral double taxation relief provided in the Finance Act, 1968 in relation to profits which enjoy exports tax relief. Section 56 enables any securities guaranteed by the State to be accorded the same tax treatment and privileges as are at present applicable to securities issued by certain semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.  I appreciate that a number of its provisions are of a complicated and technical nature and I shall be glad to deal with any points on which Deputies may require further clarification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill is intended to give legislative effect to the Budget proposals of April.  This year the Finance Bill has the unusual distinction that the Deputy who might have been expected to introduce it is no longer a member of the Government and this Bill is introduced by a new Minister for Finance and was introduced at a time of great and grave national uneasiness.  Indeed, listening to the Minister detailing the different provisions of the Bill one wondered at the absence of a sense of reality.  The country is in a ferment at the moment.  The credibility of the Government is dubious in every part of the country.  It is an uneasiness which is affecting all branches of national life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose you cannot legislate against that feeling but we should legislate with some air of reality about our problems.  The national uneasiness which exists&mdash;we will not go into the causes of it&mdash;is symtomatic of something very strange, something very malevolent which has been happening in our affairs.  This malaise was best described by the attitude of one Fianna Fáil Deputy who recently regarded <Col N="1345" /> national affairs and national problems as being so exclusively the concern of the Fianna Fáil Party that he demanded a special Ard Fheis to deal with them.  As long as that kind of mentality affects the Government party then this feeling of uneasiness is going to continue.</P>
    <P>Apparently some people in the Government still seem to think that unless you are a member of Fianna Fáil, and an active member at that, you are not entitled to be concerned about what is happening to Ireland and not entitled to express opinion on national affairs.  It is the concern of my colleagues on these benches to demonstrate that that is not so and that this country and its affairs are not the special problem of the Government party but very much the concern of every Deputy in this House.  The uneasiness which exists today is well founded.  The Finance Bill, of 1970 is introduced at a time of general industrial unrest, an unrest which, in relation to one serious strike, a cement strike, has caused widespread unemployment. The people look to Oireachtas Éireann, to this Government, to see where in Government policy is any positive action being taken to bring sanity to our industrial affairs.  They look and they look and they look in vain.</P>
    <P>We have a bank strike.  Again, apparently the concern and interests of the ordinary people and the commercial public are being ignored while two sides dig themselves into holes and do not provide for any flexibility or mobility.  The Minister for Finance and other Ministers apparently carry on as if these problems were no concern of theirs.  Grave public uneasiness exists because of industrial strife and industrial difficulty and there is also the fact that everyone in the country at the moment is upset and concerned by the problem of soaring prices.  During the past 12 months or so in particular, the pinch of rising prices has become sorely felt by every wage earner and everybody endeavouring to meet ordinary household bills.</P>
    <P>The Bill with which we are concerned here provides for the doubling of turnover tax with which I shall deal in a few moments.  Since that provision <Col N="1346" /> went into operation at the beginning of last month, it has caused a very serious acceleration in the upward trend in prices.  I say with due deliberation that I have never before experienced such widespread concern as exists at the moment in relation to rising prices. One can see the effect from day to day but there does not appear to be any Government concern in this matter. Apparently the situation is to be allowed to drift but to drift towards what?  One day it is food; the next day it is services; another day it is transport and CIE charges but each day brings another addition to the cost of living and another upward surge in prices.</P>
    <P>Maybe this is just one side of a problem because the fact is that we are existing in a very serious inflationary situation, a situation which has been apparent to everyone for a considerable time back.  It was apparent last year.  It was apparent in the spring of last year when the then Minister for Finance alerted the nation in his famous television speech.  He referred to the situation as being critical and announced a crisis and directed everyone's attention to inflation.  It was apparent this time last year when the Government, instead of dealing with the problem and for spurious electoral purposes, brought in an unsatisfactory Budget before they went to the country. It was apparent in the autumn of 1969 and it was particularly apparent last April when the Budget of which this is the legislative side was introduced. I want to know from the Minister at the conclusion of this debate on what grounds or for what reasons or motives his predecessor and the Government failed to take steps last April to deal with inflation.</P>
    <P>The Budget of this year was introduced and proposed as if no such problem existed.  It was obviously intended to be a soporific in some direction for some people.  It was intended to win praise and credit for some people but for what purpose?  It did not deal with the problem of the ordinary wage earner and the wage earner's wife who had to continue endeavouring to provide for a family with wages that were melting like a lump of ice against the impact of rising prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> There was something very wrong about the Budget of a few months ago. Granted, it was not the Budget of the present Minister but collective responsibility applies.  He was a member of the Government that approved of the Budget but he now knows the score and from the information he has available to him he must know the truth.  I should like to know from the Minister in the interests of everyone concerned with being able to work and earn a living in this country and to whom he has a responsibility to tell us what steps are to be taken to save this country from economic ruin.  If nothing is to be done about the problem there can be nothing but ruin facing us.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is one that can be discussed and will be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage but there are certain parts of it to which I should like to refer now.  Part V deals with turnover tax and as I read section 47, there is a new and, in so far as I know, unannounced imposition.</P>
    <P>Initially, when turnover tax was introduced the charge in respect of the first £100 was 5s in the case of a person who was registered.  Now, with the doubling of turnover tax, the first £100 in the case of a registered person is now subject to an imposition of £2 15s.  That appears to be a very heavy imposition and I query the justification for it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in relation to the impact of the turnover tax I ask the Minister to watch very carefully what is happening. Many people believe and with what justification I am not certain and do not know that the new 2½ per cent in taxation has, in effect, worked out so that there is imposed 2½ per cent on the original price plus 2½ per cent and that the second 2½ per cent has been added to previous composite prices which already included 2½ per cent.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister and the appropriate Department watch very carefully what has been happening.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides new provisions in respect of death duties. It is fair to describe those provisions as sections designed to strengthen the application of death duties and to safeguard <Col N="1348" /> the revenue in respect of possible loopholes in relation to the application of those duties.  May I direct the attention of Deputies and the Minister to the fact that in this Bill we are providing for the continuance of a system of taxation which has won many critics over the years, a system of taxation which has been described as socially unjust.</P>
    <P>In relation to death duties an imposition falls on the deceased's assets. Whether he was a single man without dependants and without having to provide for anyone, or a married man with dependants, the impact is the same.  It is one of the means of raising revenue which we have accepted and taken over from the British, the same as their rating system which each year we continue to use, each year we strengthen and each year by so doing we continue something which can be socially unjust.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister suddenly to do something to abolish death duties but I should like to remind him and the House that in this Bill we are strengthening the code, we are continuing the system and we are doing something in relation to death duties that other countries are moving away from.  It may not be appreciated that at the moment our rates of death duty in many respects are significantly higher than in the North of Ireland and Great Britain.  At the moment, in respect of all estates from £10,000 to £50,000, rates are higher in this part of Ireland than in the North and than in the other parts of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In relation to agricultural assets and business assets you would have to leave £¾ million assets before you would pay a lower rate of duty here than you would in the United Kingdom.  In other words, on all scales up to £¾ million our rates here are higher than in the United Kingdom.  This has been pointed out from time to time in Finance Bill debates.  Calls have been made for some adjustment, if not for a change in the system certainly for reduction downwards of the impact of duty.  Despite that, all we find in this Bill is a provision to strengthen the armoury of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> I should like to give one example of what is involved.  The application of the rigid code of death duties which applies with varying percentage increases can work with very considerable injustice.  In 1930 on an estate of £10,000 the rate of duty was 5 per cent and £500 was paid in duties.  In 1930 £10,000 represented something of comparable value.  If one were to get the value of that in terms of our money today, on the basis of a cost of living index averaging in 1930 100 as against 369 to-day, an estate of £10,000 today would have a nominal value of £36,850 and the rate of duty would be 21 per cent.  Therefore, today a person who merely had £10,000 in 1930 terms instead of paying £500 duty would pay £7,738.  Obviously, any system of taxation which works in that way works cruelly to the disadvantage of the dependants and the relatives and very obviously to the advantage of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one other thing in relation to death duties: that is the old problem of the evaluation of stocks and shares left by a deceased person.  I have been informed of a case where a person died apparently worth £200,000 with investments which were entirely British.  The duty attracted at the higher British rate of 60 per cent reduced the net estate after payment of tax to £80,000.  The situation was that the securities, which were widely spread over the market, dropped in value by 40 per cent and in this case of a man who apparently left £200,000, in fact by reason of the evaluation made at the time of his death&mdash;a valuation which proved to be false&mdash; nothing at all was in fact left.  It seems to me the Minister might consider&mdash; the example I have given can be multiplied at a time when the stock markets all over the world are varying up and down&mdash;providing an option in those cases to the personal representatives to choose as an alternative to the value at date of death valuing their securities over some period of two or three years prior to death so that a fair average value might be obtained.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the provision of relief for a wife going to work. This is contained in section 9.  Section <Col N="1350" /> 9 proposes the substitution of £74 for £45.  The £45 is the figure in the Income Tax Act of 1967 which I think would be merely a carry-over and was a constant figure for many years.  That figure is to be increased to £74.  There is an unanswerable case for having the wife's earned income relief increased. Section 9, as it now stands, appears to make the position such that a wife who continues to work or goes back to work does not lose the benefit she would have had had she not married. In England the position is that a working wife gets the individual allowance and her husband gets the full marriage allowance.  The Minister has rightly said that there is a considerable demand for industrial female help at the moment and particularly attractive to many firms and small industries would be the responsible married woman.  I suggest that, having recognised the need to give some relief, section 9 does not go far enough.  It does not accord, so far as I know, with the approach they have in England to this precise problem.  I suggest to the Minister that he might reconsider the matter. I will suggest that in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to sections 15 and 16.  These sections are designed to strengthen a relief.  It is not usual to spurn a concession but I feel like doing so in relation to sections 15 and 16, because, in my opinion, these sections extend a relief which secures no benefit to the economy here.  I suggest to the Minister that the decision to go public, which these reliefs were intended to encourage, never is decided on by reason of this kind of relief.  I propose by parliamentary question to ask the Minister what has been the amount involved.  If it is significant I will suggest that this money should be used for other relief purposes under our taxation code.  I do not believe that the abolition of this relief would have the slightest effect on industrial promotion.</P>
    <P>In section 17 the Minister deals with what he terms &ldquo;lumping&rdquo;.  None of us can prevent the Revenue Commissioners going after what they regard as an evasion of tax liability.  I can understand and I agree that it has been the <Col N="1351" /> experience that pseudo-sub-contractors instead of wages have compounded for lump-sum payments.  Be that as it may, this section as it stands is unfair. In relation to those who are &ldquo;lumping&rdquo;, as I read it, it provides for a tax liability but does not enable them to have the benefits of PAYE.  I suggest that, in the interests of these people who necessarily must be, and will be, people of limited means, at least they should have the same rights as they would have had were they receiving a wage genuinely and paying in accordance with PAYE.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the section is sufficiently wide to be very damaging to genuine sub-contractors.  Sub-contractors may be short of capital.  It seems to me they are caught in this section because of the width of its terms.  It would be grossly unfair that a genuine sub-contractor, who necessarily must be a small man of limited means, should be treated differently from a contractor who is in a bigger way of business.  If a genuine sub-contractor is forced to pay money to the Revenue Commissioners to meet this tax liability while the bigger contractor can use such money as capital for financing his operations, that appears to me to be an unfair distinction. I hope to be able to assist the Minister by amendment proposals but I would suggest that this problem, which I understand and for which I can see the sense, may unwittingly cause an injustice in relation to genuine sub-contractors who have always been there and who are operating on limited money.  If they are to be treated as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; it would be unjust.  I cannot at the moment suggest how the distinction line should be drawn but I am certain it can be drawn.</P>
    <P>Section 18, which is associated with another section, deals with the instalment savings scheme.  I would like the Minister, if possible, when concluding on this Stage to give us some idea of what he has in mind, what the regulations are likely to be and what sort of scheme he envisages as coming in under these sections.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is a copy of an English section.  Will we ever stop doing as the <Col N="1352" /> English do?  This provision was introduced into an English Finance Act to deal with the case of a particular actor whose copyright was found to be free from tax so the English legislated about it and now obviously somebody here has said: &ldquo;We will put that in the Finance Bill, 1970.&rdquo;  Why?  Is there any such abuse here?  Is there any reason for it? It has been introduced, I suggest, for no reason at all but as it stands it can cause considerable damage and harm to people.  It provides for the valuation of work in progress.  The provision in it relating to the valuation of work in progress could give rise to a situation in which on the death of a self-employed person working in a partnership, for example, with others, the estate would suffer both surtax and estate duty at the same time.  That is obviously not intended.  At least if it were intended a case would have to be made for it here in the Dáil.  That is what can happen merely because we borrow a section from an English Act and put it into our legislation.  I would strongly suggest to the Minister that this should be taken out and I hope that between now and Committee Stage he will think about it.  If there is a justification for section 23, then a case should be made and made strongly here and it having been made, care should be taken that it does not have the kind of result I indicated.</P>
    <P>Section 34 amends section 20 of the Finance Act, 1965.  Again, this is a matter that can be dealt with on Committee Stage but it seems that some provision should be introduced providing for double taxation.  The existing provision in the Finance Act, 1894, does not aid certain situations which can arise under sections 20 and 21 of the Finance Act, 1965.  On Committee Stage I shall make certain suggestions which will have reference to section 34.</P>
    <P>There are certain other provisions in the Bill to which I should like to refer but I do not want to turn the Second Reading discussion into a detailed committee debate.  However, I should like to indicate that we shall avail of the Committee Stage to suggest various amendments to this very highly technical piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I am very far from being an expert <Col N="1353" /> on these matters but I should like to make one suggestion in relation to the income tax code which, of course, is dealt with annually in this Bill and the provisions of which are annually changed or reinforced and so on.  There are, I understand from those who are experts in this field and who practise professionally under the tax code, many occasions on which the apparent injustice of our existing tax code is tempered and changed by a sort of discretion which is exercised by the Revenue Commissioners.  I am glad to say that nobody questions how they get this discretion but they exercise it and exercise it very benevolently at times in the interests of the taxpayer.  These concessions are known as &ldquo;extra statutory concessions&rdquo;.  They are known to the inspector of taxes.  They are known to the commissioners and they are known to the few who specialise in this field of taxation.  That, in effect, means that they are known to the two, three or four large firms here in the city of Dublin.  They know these extra statutory concessions and they are able to avail of them on behalf of their clients.  In that sense they are able achieve a measure of justice and satisfaction for the people for whom they appear.  I merely direct the attention of the Minister and the House to the practice. I am not against it, far from it, but I do suggest that these extra statutory concessions should be published and that everybody should know of them.  That is done in the United Kingdom. All the extra statutory concessions in relation to tax matters are published in a booklet there so that the most humble person in the most remote part of England, whether he is a taxpayer himself or a professional person appearing on behalf of a taxpayer, is armed with the same knowledge and the same information as those who specialise and consistently practise and who are nearer the source.  There seems to be no reason why that practice should not be adopted here and why a booklet or a list of these concessions should not be advertised or published.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that this Bill, the legislative part of the Budget, comes in at a very difficult stage, I am certain, for the Government, certainly <Col N="1354" /> for this House and for the country itself.  We do not know what the next day will bring nor do the Government nor anybody else.  Strange things have happened and strange things are happening. I would only wish that we could get into office a Government that is clearly representative of the people.  It would be a good day for the country and it would bring back reality to our discussions here in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We have a duty up there to reduce the Minister's voting surplus on the next time out when his party choose to go out.  I feel that is a supreme duty for all of us at this time so I shall not waste too much time with the few remarks I have to make on this Bill.  This Bill can be described as an attempt to tidy up affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have repeatedly emphasised that the whole taxation system should be the subject of more comprehensive legislation.  The present system gives little evidence of treating all citizens equally.  We have suggested that a capital gains tax be introduced but it has been said that the amount of tax which would be collected from such a source is hardly worth bothering about.  It is a sensitive register of the social conscience of the Government who refuse to bring in any form of taxation to deal with labour free gains and profits.  Many of the capital gains profits are made on the basis of knowing what is coming up, what land will be free for development, what property is due for demolition and what office blocks are to be built.  We are living in a period of crisis of belief in institutional government.  I do not think I exaggerate that crisis by describing it as such.  I can see no reason why the profits and gains of those people who neither sow nor reap but gain profits <Col N="1355" /> because of a prior knowledge of events should not be subject to the same taxation laws as the humble citizens of the land.  Their gains are secret and their profits are free from tax.</P>
    <P>It is not too fanciful to suggest that a great number of the private fortunes which have been made here in recent years have been made on the speculative property market.  It is not a matter of political propaganda to suggest that many of those who have made whirlwind large fortunes, which are outside the taxation net, are close supporters of the Government.  Added to this crisis of belief in the Government is the knowledge that a body known up to quite recently as Taca supports the Government financially, many of whose chief members gained their private fortunes in property deals which were not subject to tax.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that the staff of the Revenue Commissioners are doing anything improper&mdash; they are all hardworking people&mdash;but the political decision which exempts capital gains from the taxation net is the wrong one.  This decision must contribute to the public's general scepticism about the honour of our public institutions.  A situation where, because of one's political allegiance it is possible for doors to be opened into areas of secret knowledge which can result in large sums of money being made, must bring politics into disrepute.  It does not make any difference to say that the amount which would be collected by spreading the tax net into this area would not be such as to settle any national problem.  That may be so, but the fact is that there are people outside the general tax net who should be included in it.  I have heard no good reason why such people are not so included. One is free to speculate as to whether it is their political connection with the present Government which prevents the Minister for Finance from extending the tax net to include those people or what exactly is the secret influence of these people who, in recent years especially, have made such large fortunes on the basis of prior knowledge.</P>
    <P>There is a strange reluctance on the <Col N="1356" /> part of the Government to introduce capital gains into their general taxation system.  In the absence of any good reason why it is not so introduced one is free to speculate why it is not included.  This strange reluctance on the part of the Government is in total contrast to the way in which social welfare benefits are doled out where we query each portion of the income going to widows and old age pensioners. We have inspectors to investigate this payment or that payment to insure that no State money is being given out which is not strictly in accordance with our legislation.  It is a peculiar anomaly that at the millionaire end of the spectrum we are so careless about people's incomes in the matter of taxation.  We may speculate as to who their friends are and what powerful protectors they have in court which prevent them from being subject to taxation.</P>
    <P>It was extraordinary to hear the new Minister for Finance &mdash; who was appointed to that Ministry in strange circumstances &mdash; in his concluding speech wholeheartedly agree with the Budget measures introduced by his predecessor which he could not, in fairness, be considered to have sponsored even though he would come under the general term of collective Cabinet responsibility.  We cannot accuse him of devising all the Budget measures himself.  He said he embraced the last Budget and was confident about the economic future of the country over the next year.  We all know that statement will prove to be less and less accurate as the months go by.  Already, as the previous speaker has said, price increases are raging as a result of the Budget measures which were introduced earlier in the year.  The May figures which would give us an impartial assessment of what has taken place are not ready but if one is to believe the complaints one hears the prices of foodstuffs have shot up.  One can only try to imagine the plight of our old age pensioners who, while having to pay increased prices, have to wait until later in the year for an increase in their pension.</P>
    <P>The NIEC predicted our balance of payments deficit will rise to £90 million in the current year and they visualised <Col N="1357" /> prices increasing by another 7 per cent. It is fair to conclude that the Government in their taxation policies have been responsible for at least 3 per cent of this amount.  Therefore, our economic position in the next year will be highly precarious.</P>
    <P>In Britain tomorrow there will be a general election and they will probably return Harold Wilson to office.  This means that the new Labour Government will take a look at any inflationary tendencies that exist in the British economy.  Exactly where that is going to leave our economy is anybody's guess.  However, without ascribing any blame, it is fair to suggest that inflationary forces are gripping our economy at the present time and that in all sections of the community the policy seems to be the greater one's strength the more one should seek. Having regard to the budgetary policy of the Government, in particular the massive increase in turnover tax, it is obvious that the Government participate in and encourage the national philosophy of &ldquo;take whatever you can get&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This being the situation, with a Government in Britain who will certainly take resolute control over the direction of their economy and a Government on this side of the Irish Sea who have no desire to take control of anything, even their own members, the future of our economy is highly problematical. How the cost of our goods will compare with British products is an interesting question.  Many theories have been discussed and many commentators suggest that we may lose important markets in Britain later this year as a result of rising costs here.</P>
    <P>The increase in turnover tax must be seen as an instalment of the admission price of our entry into the EEC, which community the Ministers opposite are so anxious to join.  As the debate on EEC membership will take place next week I shall not discuss it now.  Certainly the turnover tax increase and the further tax increases that may be necessary later this year or next year, if the present Government remain in office, must be seen as further increases in the admission price to that exclusive club.  The cost of entry <Col N="1358" /> into the EEC is very high.  The British Government have spoken out honestly regarding the price that must be paid for membership.  Looking at the tax levels of the Common Market countries it must mean there will be further progressive increases in our general taxation in the next year or two.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker that to discuss &ldquo;tidying up&rdquo; legislation at a time when we are faced with such a serious situation is slightly unreal. There is total scepticism invading every section of society when people talk about politics, Parliament and public representatives.  I do not know about Yeats's 60-year-old public man smiling coming into a school room; I think it would be somebody else in the school room who would be smiling.  It is obvious that a serious question mark hangs over democracy in this country. The unreal nature of the Bill, discussing these small &ldquo;tidying up&rdquo; measures at a time when the banks in the country are closed and show little sign of reopening, when our Minister for Labour continues uninterruptedly his slumbers &mdash;which seems to be the activity he most favours and considers most appropriate for a Minister for Labour &mdash;adds to the unreality of the discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <P>The fundamental criticism of the way we tax people at present is that it has no redistributive function whatever. We may pay lip service to the idea but we do not take seriously the need to help the weaker sections by taking from the privileged and those who can look after themselves.  One does not have to have a particular political philosophy to do this.  All capitalist economies today do this as a matter of course and it is one of the accepted norms of 20th century politics that one does something on those lines.  However, our taxation policy does not show this kind of motivation.  It bears most heavily in its reliance on indirect taxation and falls most severely on working people.</P>
    <P>By &ldquo;working people&rdquo; I refer to the majority of the population&mdash;those who spend the greater proportion of their income on food, household expenses, and who have little left over to indulge in the kinds of speculation in which the gentry participate.  That is the section <Col N="1359" /> which must spend practically every penny earned each week in order to maintain decent standards.  These people spend most of their incomes on the goods taxed by this Government under the turnover tax.  The greater part of their incomes is taken from them by the Government in taxation. It is the less well-off who pay the biggest proportion of their incomes towards the upkeep of the State.</P>
    <P>Up to last year's Budget the Government were most understanding, most considerate and most indulgent in the allowances made each year in respect of surtax payers.  Somebody propagated the myth that we could not get proper people in management unless we had these people in the surtax bracket.  I do not know a great deal about that theory.  The Minister regarded it as having some reality.  I do not know. The more I think of it the more I think of the strange proceedings at the last meeting of the Irish Management Institure in Killarney.  A man was brought over from the United States and he told them that the most important characteristics were aggression, sex, profit&mdash;I forget what the fourth one was&mdash;but we paid for this gentleman to come over here and announce this new religion in Killarney.  The myth was that this particular type of animal was needed to increase GNP.  Apparently, in order to get this increase in GNP, we must in Budget after Budget show our goodwill towards the unfortunate people, ulcerated as they are, who pay surtax.  We have done that.  Year after year we have given them extra allowances.  At the other end of the scale there is surveillance over every shilling paid to widows and to old age pensioners. There is no question of anybody at that end of the scale escaping his or her due to the State.  Caesar is very vigilant when it comes to looking for cash from these people but Caesar&mdash;or, perhaps, I should say Homer&mdash;nods when it comes to those in the surtax bracket. So worried are we about them and their attitude towards the State that they are cosseted in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for falling for this.  Numbers of intelligent people have fallen for it.  He, as <Col N="1360" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce, and his predecessor in Finance, both fell for it.  Indirect taxation means the bulk of the ordinary people pay for the services of the State and they cannot evade paying even one halfpenny, whereas at the other end of the scale those who make the mysterious fortunes escape scotfree.</P>
    <P>The cost of living is going up and the increase will not be restricted to the 2½ per cent.  We must allow for entrepreneurial zeal which will send the 2½ per cent on its merry way with another percentage addition.  The halfpenny has, of course, been withdrawn from circulation.  The increase will be a fine round figure.  With decimalisation next January the Government in their taxation policy will find mulcting the ordinary people a very smooth operation indeed.</P>
    <P>Looking at the economic position how can anyone seriously ask for restraint on the part of the majority of the population?  How can any Minister in the present administration address trade unionists from the podium of a chamber of commerce dinner and tell them to moderate their demands? These are the people who refused to bring in a capital gains tax, the people who irresponsibly increased the cost of living.  When we complain about increases in the cost of living the Minister for Industry and Commerce says he has no evidence of such increases. His inspectors have not found any evidence of increases.  Put down another question next week!  Put another nickel in!  How can such an administration in conscience call for moderation on the part of any section of the population when its own taxation follows no moderate pattern but goes on looking for more revenue without worring about the effect of that revenue on the economy. Apparently the Government have a vested interest in inflation.  They confuse raging inflation with buoyancy of revenue.</P>
    <P>This administration cannot call for a just incomes policy.  They must banish the word.  Yet all of us accept that any administration looking for a planned approach must have respect for its policies.  There is no longer any respect for this administration and the Government must remain silent, however <Col N="1361" /> long it continues in office.  There are certain matters about which this administration can no longer speak. There are areas affecting the security of the economic wellbeing of the country on which this Government can no longer speak.</P>

      <P>True, but I have been arguing that in several respects the taxation measures do not operate satisfactorily.  Shortly, we will be in the added difficulty of having across the water a Labour Government which will energetically go about the problems of the British people.  Britain is our main customer.  On this side of the Irish Sea we have this discredited administration. This must spell trouble.  Incomes are intimately tied in with taxation.  I make the point that this Government at this point of time will not be listened to and cannot act.  This is a very serious situation because some decision on incomes for all sections of the community is overdue.  This administration cannot tackle this serious question, is incapable of doing so.  By its own actions it has robbed itself of any possibility of saying anything on this serious matter.  This is a problem to which I can see no solution while this administration continues in office.</P>
      <P>The Government presides over a situation of economic anarchy.  They have no solution to this anarchy.  Their only attitude can be to let it continue so long as they remain in office.  There are no suggestions.  There is no policy. The construction industry has come to a virtual standstill because of the cement strike.  It is no secret that that strike has been aided and abetted by the Government because of its deflationary effect.  That has been said and nothing has been said by the Government to convince anyone to the contrary. We were puzzled about the Budget because we realised it could lead to nothing but inflation.</P>

      <P>The standing of the Government is such that, when a large industrial dispute breaks out, it can be assumed that the Government &mdash;who, in their Budget measures, have apparently given the red light to inflation&mdash;will regard a serious and large strike such as the present cement strike as a deflationary device and therefore, as a strike, will not wish to terminate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, there will be further cuts in tariffs later this summer which will add further to the problems of Irish industry by making more difficult the retention of the home market for our products.  This results in certain firms closing down.  There is a terrible optimism about some of the Government's Ministers.  I recall a recent statement by the Minister for Finance on his return from a chat with, I think, the President of the commission that some factories would close down but that others would open up and that there is no need for undue pessimism.  I find such talk quite alarming.  There may be trouble in this respect.  As yet, we have very little information from the Government about industries due to close and others due to open.  Some poor devil down the country in a grant-aided <Col N="1363" /> factory will consider his future extremely insecure in the light of remarks made in the distinguished visitors' lounge in Dublin Airport and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The allowances given to married women are not sufficient.  If they were made worthwhile, the married woman who is free to do so would go back to work to earn some needed cash.  Several of our reports suggest that industry is looking for more female help.  Our taxation laws do not yet sufficiently attract the married woman back to work.  The number of them returning to work is too low and is an indication that the tax alleviation is not sufficient. Many of them are well-trained and skilled and are a great loss to our labour force.  The days of one partner earning in Irish family life are over. From now on, in order to keep their heads above the cost of living, both partners in Irish family life must work &mdash;either one part-time and the other full-time.  The days when the man is the sole breadwinner are over in this country.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the children's allowances and in how exactly that section will work out.  I suppose we may reserve these comments for Committee Stage.  The office conditions for the hard-working employees in the PAYE office in Dublin are deplorable. The Minister should do everything possible to remedy this serious position. The unions involved have been fighting for decent working conditions for them for years.  The Minister for Finance may not be in office long enough to remedy the situation though I trust he will make every effort immediately to do so.  If he succeeds, it will, indeed, be a monument to his memory as Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Since I first came into this House in 1965 I have been hearing the Opposition attack Fianna Fáil and urging the Government to go to the country.  Yet, when we went to the country the people showed that they <Col N="1365" /> certainly did not want Deputy O'Leary and the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention some of the things we have done, some of the things contained in this Finance Bill. We made sure to increase the old age pension in such a way that the recipients will be far better off than they were, in spite of any increases in prices caused by the increased turnover tax. Social welfare recipients have also benefited.  This will allow them to have a better standard of living.  We have increased the married women's allowance. There was a time when there was no work here for married women.  Now the previous speaker finds fault with the fact that women, as he puts it, have to go out and find work in order to maintain their standard of living.  They go out and find work because thereby they can have a better standard of living. The fact is that the jobs are there to enable them to improve their standard of living.</P>
      <P>When it was originally proposed to raise the turnover tax by 2½ per cent, it struck me very forcibly that a total turnover tax of 5 per cent would raise approximately £40 million.  As I said once before, in order to raise £40 million in taxes there must be an overall expenditure of something like £800 million, allowing for tourism and invisible exports.  To my mind this is indicative of the fact that the people have a fantastic amount of money to spend.  I have seen how well-stocked our supermarkets are and the number of people who have money to spend. Anyone who says that the standard of living of the people in this country is lower than it was is merely whistling in the wind.  This is just not so.  We must try to get the people to see that by making unnecessarily large claims for increases they may put themselves in an uncompetitive position in relation to other countries and eventually we may put ourselves out of business.  It is Government policy to see that we do not price ourselves out of the market.  There is a very responsible job here for people in the trade unions. They must improve their methods of negotiation.  There is also a tremendous responsibility on management to meet them.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into an undignified squabble but we have heard it all before.  One of the big problems we have to face is that, when our economy is expanding and when our standard of living is improving, an inevitable result is that the gap between the haves and the have-nots increases.  This is one of the most difficult tasks any Minister for Finance has to face.  He must ensure that a proper percentage goes to the lower paid sections of the community.  It might surprise some people to learn that in the Iron Curtain countries, of all countries, the gap between the haves and the have-nots is far greater than it is in this country.  This is a sobering thought. Anyone who wishes to study that should do so and he will find that this is true.  I wish the Minister good luck in his new office and I hope he will always bear in mind the lowest paid members of our community when he is preparing his Budgets.</P>

He said he had to leave to go to a meeting in his constituency.  He is quite right to do so and I should like to do the same but my constituency is too far away.  We have before us today a Finance Bill which, in ordinary circumstances, would provoke a comprehensive analysis and criticism of the Government's budgetary policy.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that this Finance Bill has not provoked the interest it should.  Members of the Government cannot discuss the economic problems in depth.  Indeed, the Minister's speech is an example of what I am saying.  He introduced the Second Reading of this Bill today and his speech was more or less a short analysis of the Bill section by section.  This short analysis is available to all Deputies in the form of the Explanatory Memorandum.  A Second Reading speech calls for an analysis in depth of the Bill and this has not been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pointing to the reasons for this.  The country faces a grave economic crisis in regard to our balance of payments and rapidly increasing consumer prices directly as a result of Government policy to which I shall advert later on.  The Government have completely mismanaged the economy and may now be facing drastic action which possibly could have been avoided if the economy had been properly managed in the past five years.  The poor people will suffer most. Business people will suffer.  There will be unemployment; the small firms may have to close.  Nobody wants these things to happen.  But they are the result of a Government far more interested in retaining power than in managing the country's affairs.  Too often they have subordinated economic and social problems to political expediency. I came to this House to fight honestly for economic and social reforms which would help the poorer sections to help to create an atmosphere in which industry would thrive and exports could be increased, prices could be controlled and poor people could get houses and better social welfare services. I find my constituents not so much interested now in the social welfare reforms, in the new policies to reform our industries to face the Common Market.  They do not even discuss these matters at political meetings. <Col N="1369" /> They are interested in the current political crisis and nothing else.  That is a shame.</P>
    <P>I have many things to say about this Finance Bill but these would be more appropriate to Committee Stage.  It is a very technical Bill.  It amends a number of Acts and especially the Income Tax Act of 1967 which is itself a very comprehensive measure.  There are, however, a few points I should like to discuss briefly this evening.  As a general principle, any Minister for Finance should be aiming at a simplification of the income tax code.  That is not so in the Budget or Finance Bill.  In fact, I find the opposite is the case.  The benefits announced are welcome, the increase in earned income relief, the reduced rate of taxation on the first £100, the age relief for persons over 65, the small incomes relief and the increase in the wife's earned income allowance.  My party welcomes all these but it is a pity that in giving reliefs one must complicate, rather than simplify, the income tax code. This could lead to administrative problems.  I believe it will make it more difficult for the employer to administer the PAYE system.  This will only become evident when the Act is in operation.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the employer is again being forced to act as tax-gatherer to burdensome extent.  I shall elaborate on this on Committee Stage.  The employer is not paid for this; perhaps he should be.  Perhaps employers should have some allowance for acting as tax-gatherers. I hasten to say that such an allowance would merely recompense them for the increased clerical work involved in the operation of PAYE. This is something the Minister might consider.</P>
    <P>I think section 17 is a very harsh section and a concept new to the Irish tax code.  It relates to the deductions by a contractor of income tax at the rate of 7/- in the pound on his payments to sub-contractors and in this context the definition of sub-contractor is very wide and would certainly, I think, catch practically every sub-contractor. Why should 7/- in the £ be deducted in all payments to a sub-contractor? Nobody can say a sub-contractor <Col N="1370" /> will be liable to pay 7/- in the £ on every £ he gets from the contractor. No attempt has been made in this Bill to allow for the expenses a sub-contractor will obviously have to bear in carrying out his contract.  The section is quite wrong in the way it is phrased, especially subsection (2) (b). I shall go into this in greater detail on Committee Stage.  It is wrong because the sub-contractor may not be liable to this extent and it is wrong because the time elapsing between the date he is paid by the contractor and the date the income tax inspector will allow the refund may be quite long, a year or, perhaps, two.  This is something that will have to be considered in the course of the Bill's progress through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 10 which deals with allowances for children again complicates the position in regard to a person's taxable liability.  Liability is, in fact, reduced where the person is claiming allowances for children but, again, this is more a matter for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the details of the proposed instalment saving scheme.  Personally, I think it is a very good idea and I welcome it.  I wonder what type of scheme the Minister has in mind.  Will it be one in which a worker gives his employer a certain amount weekly which the employer puts into a bank or savings bank or will it be left to the worker to stipulate whatever amount he wishes to save?  Will it be a compulsory scheme? I certainly hope not.  If it is compulsory it is odious.  The Minister owes it to the House to explain what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>There is certainly scope for such a scheme, although perhaps a better scheme would be one in which an employee could have a voluntary scheme of life insurance or endowment insurance which would become payable at a certain age.  The savings scheme as envisaged by the Minister is only a scheme to increase revenue for the Government, whereas what should be evolved is a scheme in which a worker or his spouse would benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> Section 52 is of interest to me in so far as it allows the Minister &ldquo;to create and issue securities bearing interest at such rates as he thinks fit&rdquo;. A new departure is envisaged here and perhaps it is bound up with the issuing of short and medium-term securities to promote the establishment of a money market in Ireland.  This might be more appropriate to the Central Bank Bill which will be coming up in the near future.  I should like the Minister to explain what he has in mind here.  Is it a more flexible issuing of securities?  What types of securities, what type of redemption?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I merely mention these points in passing in order to give the Minister time to consider them.  Perhaps he would be good enough to reply to them during the Committee Stage or at whatever Stage he wishes.</P>
      <P>Section 54 deals with double taxation. I do not wish to go into this except to recommend to the Minister that, if possible, he should enter into double taxation arrangements with other countries in order to encourage Irish people to come back to Ireland in their later life with the knowledge that they will not be crucified by taxation, particularly double taxation on their investments abroad.  Their investments, which came from their savings while they were abroad, are to be welcomed and certainly they have not an adverse effect on the Irish economy.  Older people would be encouraged to return home if they knew that in coming home they would not be subject to severe taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech on the Budget he mentioned a new type of relief for exporters in the matter of finance.  Again I was expecting to see this new scheme in the Bill but it has not appeared.  I should like to know from the Minister when it is intended to produce this scheme, which is a good one.  We must encourage exporters, I do not know how we shall be fixed under EEC regulations if we <Col N="1372" /> enter the EEC, but the sooner the scheme is produced the better.</P>
    <P>Profits on exports should not be taxed heavily.  They should certainly be taxed at a reduced rate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the profits of companies selling on the home market.  This would be a good way to encourage old firms especially who are at present subject to taxation on exports.  I would therefore ask the Minister to announce as soon as possible this new finance scheme for exporters and to consider reducing taxation on the profits of companies, and indeed not only companies but partnerships and private individuals, who are in the export trade.  With the slump in the tourist trade this year something will have to be done to encourage exports.</P>
    <P>The time is now ripe for raising the lower level for liability to death duties. Instead of death duties being payable at the present figure, the level should be increased to £7,000 to £8,000.</P>
    <P>The question relating to revenue after business or trade has discontinued is a delicate one.  The provision is apparently required to ensure that all the revenue which should accrue to the Revenue Commissioners is actually paid.  I believe the Minister is complicating things too much in this connection.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax caused far higher increases in prices than its implementation warranted.  This year the country is faced with a severe bout of inflation and the increased turnover tax will certainly contribute to it.  It has also justified to a certain extent the big wage increases demanded by the trade unions.  The Government must find it very difficult to justify their plea to the trade unionists to ask for only moderate increases, in the region of 7 per cent, when it is common knowledge that the consumer price index will rise this year by, I should imagine, 10 per cent, and I base my figure of 10 per cent on official figures plus the 2½ per cent increase in the turnover tax.  Prices in the past two months have increased far in excess of 2½ per cent.  The price of the pint, the price of the bottle of Guinness, the price of drink in general and the price of food in particular have increased at a staggering <Col N="1373" /> rate.  In my contribution to the Budget debate I criticised the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce for their absolute lack of organisation and surveillance, and I do so again here tonight.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance, who was previously Minister for Industry and Commerce, would implement a better and more efficient scheme for supervising price increases.  The increase in the turnover tax has led to a wide range of increases to the consumer's detriment. That is all I have to say now but I will have much more to say on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in turnover tax is the greatest burden falling on the lower income group.  We have this fraudulent tax and the Government do not care how it is collected or how it is applied as long as they get their money's worth.  They put the onus on the small shopkeepers and the small traders to collect it.  They say &ldquo;it is not a sales tax, not a normal tax, we want an extra 2½ per cent turnover tax&rdquo;.  What is wrong is that the Government have not endeavoured to make clear to the public that this is not a 5 per cent tax: they are interested in getting 5 per cent of the turnover, which is a completely different thing from 5 per cent tax on the sale of goods.  In fact if it were applied very rigidly it would work out at 6 per cent, or 7 per cent or 8 per cent tax.  I wrote to the Minister two weeks ago on this point on behalf of many people who are concerned with this and I asked if some means could be devised whereby it could be announced there would be 5 per cent tax and it could be broken down for 10s, 5s and 2s 6d but the Minister's reply was that it does not apply like that at all.  They are only interested in a 5 per cent tax on the turnover of a shopkeeper or merchant.  The shopkeeper, and especially the small trader, has no alternative but to apply the extra tax so that he will be able to supply the tax requested by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In America they had a sales tax and people knew exactly what they were paying but here they do not know simply because the Government <Col N="1374" /> are only concerned with getting 5 per cent of the turnover.  The tax is applied to foodstuffs, the very basic essentials which all poor people require, and this is shoving up the cost of food.  It is also applied to drugs.  There was nothing more ridiculous than to apply turnover tax to drugs.  No attempt is being made to remove it.  Animal medicines are exempt.  By no stretch of the imagination could I see logic in exempting animal medicines and applying the tax to drugs and medicines required by humans.  They could not put forward a reason for this.</P>
    <P>Again, poor people who are involved in hire purchase transactions have found that the turnover tax is applied to their transactions.  They were informed that their instalments would be increased because of this.  The Minister for Finance was not concerned about this.  He was concerned that any transaction, anything due after the imposition of this new tax, must have the tax applied.  These are poor people who cannot afford to pay the turnover tax.  They are forced to pay the extra tax on hire purchase commitments which had been entered into a year or two prior to this increase.  The Minister would make no provision for these people.</P>
    <P>We have the wholesale tax which originally was to be applied to luxury goods but ordinary household soap is subject to wholesale tax.  We have soap with 16 per cent tax on it.  I cannot understand why soap which is used for cleansing purposes, for ordinary hygiene, should be subjected to a tax of 16 per cent.  The very people who can ill afford to pay this increased taxation find they are burdened and crippled by it.  The small shopkeepers are being blamed but the Government have a horde of unpaid tax collectors working for them and they do not care who takes the blame as long as they collect.</P>
    <P>There was nothing imaginative in the Budget.  They knew that here was a ready source of revenue and by doubling it&mdash;we do not know what it will be next year&mdash;they could bring in £20 million.  The Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach stated that income tax in Ireland was the highest in Europe. The ordinary working person here is <Col N="1375" /> paying more tax, comparatively, than anyone in any country in Europe at present.  The introduction of PAYE brought all these poor people into the tax net, people who could ill afford to pay tax.  Still we have those who are making vast profits and not paying 1d in a capital gains tax.  We had a Minister making £200,000 profit from a transaction and he was not obliged to pay 1d tax.  I worked it out for some people and I told them that if they were to save £20 a week it would take 200 years to make that amount of money.  It is very hard to explain this to people who find that if they do one hour's overtime the Government step in and take some of their money.  It is very difficult to say to these people &ldquo;You must work overtime, you must do this, that or the other for your country&rdquo; when they see leaders of the country making such vast profits and not paying 1d tax. It is no great inspiration or inducement to any person to work hard for his country when he sees people in high office involved in transactions such as that.</P>
    <P>Time and again we have heard Ministers say that no purpose would be served by the introduction of a capital gains tax, that it would not be worth collecting.  We have seen land developers making vast sums of money and there is no net to catch these people.  If we had a capital gains tax &mdash;Britain realised that a capital gains tax was necessary&mdash;it would ensure that people who make vast profits would pay tax.  I do not mind people making profits but there should be such a tax paid by them.  I would ask the Minister for Finance seriously to consider this as a source of revenue.</P>
    <P>There is a great apathy in the country at present and it is a very depressing and gloomy picture to see so many strikes and our economy literally tottering.  We have a bank strike and no effort is being made to try to resolve the problem.  The Minister for Labour looks idly by and is not concerned about the strike which is affecting our economy and upsetting every single business.  It has been suggested to the Minister by Deputy Dr. <Col N="1376" /> O'Donovan that the bank closure was illegal.</P>

While on this question, I should like to see a little more probing into the profits of our banks so that, perhaps, a little more tax might be charged on their vast profits.  Maybe the present Minister for Finance will use a little more imagination with a view to seeking some other sources of revenue rather than by taxing the working man all the time.  The Government should ensure that employers respect their workers and not adopted such attitudes as are at present being adopted by the directors of Cement Limited.  That is an area in which the Government could do some useful work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the statement by the Minister for Finance to the effect that in recent years industrial and other concerns have been finding it increasingly difficult to attract female labour and he went on to say that the earned income allowance in respect of married women was being increased from £45 to £74.  I ask the Minister if he seriously believes that this miserable increase is a sufficient incentive to married women to return to work.  We all know about the shortage of female labour and if we are to improve our economy and get women back to work it will be necessary to grant them a bigger allowance on their earnings.  The present allowance is entirely unrealistic.  The Minister should seriously consider increasing this amount to £2 per week if we are to attract female labour.  Perhaps the Minister might introduce a means test with regard to children's allowances. These allowances were meant for those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>They were intended to help those in the lower income groups who had large families but it is grossly unfair that people earning £4,000 or £5,000 a year should be entitled to draw children's allowances. I suggest seriously to the Minister that he should introduce a means test in this regard although I am opposed to means tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A valuable source of revenue could be provided by way of bearer bonds. As I have mentioned before, there are many people who would gladly invest in such bonds.  People in this country who have money but who are loath to invest in post office or banks would be prepared to invest in bearer bonds. I know of many cases in which money is leaving the country and bearer bonds might be the answer to this. Perhaps it could be arranged that the rate of interest would be a little more than the normal rate for post office savings.  There is need to encourage saving by every means if we are to <Col N="1379" /> improve our economy and provide the money for essential purposes such as housing and bearer bonds might be the answer.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that the Minister would have brought in more details about the added value tax.  We are now at the stage where we must investigate the taxes that apply in the Common Market countries.  The Minister should have investigated these and should have come up with something better than what was introduced. Surely there were other sources of revenue.  I should hope that this time next year the turnover tax is not increased to 7½ or 10 per cent but at the rate things are going it seems obvious that there is no imagination on the part of the Minister for Finance and that he is content merely to double the turnover tax to ensure revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long on this Bill but there are one or two remarks which I should like to make.  Generally, I favour indirect taxation as being an equitable form of taxation and also because it has not the same restrictive effect as has direct taxation.</P>
      <P>There is now being introduced in section 17 of this Bill a completely new provision.  This is the section which deals in a very broad and comprehensive way with tax deductions from payments to sub-contractors in the construction industry.  This is a broadening of the net to bring in, presumably, these people who are not paying income tax and who are getting away with it.  Generally, it can be said that <i>bona fide</i> sub-contractors are paying their income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who would escape would be the ordinary small jobbers who would take on work for private individuals. I believe this has been exaggerated and the adoption of this section will certainly lead to a tremendous amount of disruption.  As I read the section it simply means the Revenue Commissioners will have it both ways. If a small builder decides to work for another person in erecting a house it is in the Bill that it is incumbent on the employer to find out whether the person he employs has cleared his income tax <Col N="1380" /> or not or whether he is on the list of the Revenue Commissioners or not for the payment of income tax.  If he is he apparently can carry on as a contractor without any deductions but should for any reason his position change the main contractor is immediately expected to deduct tax at 7s in the £.</P>
    <P>This expands to a very wide category of people including as far as I know cleaners, whether office or window cleaners or other people who carry out ordinary jobs for an hour in the morning or a couple of hours each week.  Those people are being netted into some kind of tax snare.  I can see in this, although the words &ldquo;construction industry&rdquo; are used what &ldquo;construction&rdquo; means.  &ldquo;Construction&rdquo; is very wide here.  I do not want to deal with it now as it will be gone into throughly on the Committee Stage but it is an undesirable approach and one which to my mind is not workable. I can visualise also in the definition here of &ldquo;the principal&rdquo; the case of a farmer employing a small gobán to do masonry work on his house, or a handyman to put on a roof, the position this small farmer will be in if the revenue people come to him wanting to know whether this man is paying tax or not.  When one gets down to it one can see tremendous difficulties in its application.  I should like to hear from the Minister how many are escaping under this term &ldquo;sub-contractor&rdquo; which is often misapplied.</P>
    <P>There are many very large firms of contractors who spend their whole career rightly and properly working for another contractor, so they are sub-contractors in the ordinary way, but they employ many hundreds of people and spend their lives on this work. Heating contractors work for main contractors.  Electrical contractors. supply labour and materials but are sub-contractors to main contractors. Glazing, plumbing and heating contractors are others in this category. All these people are in the category of sub-contractors yet in some peculiar way it is hoped to make the principal or main contractor responsible for the manner in which those people run their affairs, keep their accounts, and for investigating as to whether in fact all <Col N="1381" /> of their employees and sub-employees pay their income tax.</P>
    <P>This clause will cause tremendous difficulty in the trade.  This certainly is a complicated clause to bring into a Bill in order to catch the few who might be escaping.  Nobody likes paying tax but we all realise that income tax must be paid providing the level of taxation does not exceed certain limits; the limit I would prescribe for the ordinary person is that which does not represent an intolerable burden on the taxpayer, a limit at which taxation will not become a disincentive. It is very difficult to measure this but we know from daily contact with salary earners and workers in every category that in some cases overtime earnings and bonus and incentive schemes are not attractive to employees for the simple reason that it is on this extra earnings that they pay the most income tax.</P>
    <P>Something should be done to ensure that the ordinary taxpayer is given the opportunity to spend his own money in his own way and at his own time. If he wants to be foolish with it, good luck to him, let him spend it foolishly. If he wants to be thrifty, his thrift should be encouraged.  There is a case for examination of the whole tax code. A greater emphasis on indirect taxation will have in the long term the best effect.  Direct taxation always has been and will be penal.  It is a penal tax at any level and is just as penal on the small wage earner as on the larger wage earner.  It is a disincentive in that the more a man earns the more he pays and why he will ask should he try to increase his earnings when he will be taxed more heavily for so doing.</P>
    <P>Indirect taxation is a better form of taxation.  Under this system, it can be argued, the person can spend his money in his own way, be it on luxuries, dress, a motor car or anything you like to think of or he can save his money.  He can pile it up and one day of course death duties will collect anything he has stored over the years.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax, being a form of indirect taxation is an equitable system. <Col N="1382" /> So long as provisions are made in each Budget for the strengthening of social services there ought to be an extension of indirect taxation along those lines. In this way you will have a happier and more contented people.  I would not recommend that this should be the only system of taxation because people in the higher income bracket and the larger companies and larger shareholders must face their responsibilities and must always bear a heavier share of the taxation burden not to penalise them but simply and solely because they can afford it.  I do not have a tremendous amount of sympathy for them in that respect.  If I express sympathy at all for them it is because of the fear that heavy taxation would be a disincentive.</P>
    <P>There is no great point in saying that to bring about equality would create incentives.  We would not.  Without pace setters we would have a kind of apathetic society without any great growth.  We must always maintain the idea that people will be able to acquire the comforts and luxuries of life in so far as they wish to do so.  This will always be the Mecca that men will seek.  In my life over the past 40 years I have seen rabid socialist, having bought new homes, change their outlook completely.  Men who in a sense were communists changed rapidly when they acquired some property and began seeking to provide themselves and their families with comforts and luxuries comparable to those of their neighbours around them.  If they complained at all, they complained that the standard was ever rising.  This acted like a whip to them.  They had to keep going.  This chasing of higher living standards of itself provides the targets that improve our society and our way of life.  With these incentives men create greater wealth.  Those who create wealth must be prepared to contribute to the less fortunate people in our society.</P>
    <P>I will be watching this Bill as it goes through the Committee Stage, particularly the new clause, to find out from the Minister just what is involved. At this stage I see a danger. I understand that this provision was not introduced by the British Chancellor. Apparently, he did not think it <Col N="1383" /> worthwhile to bring in such a provision at this time.  It is strange to see it brought in here without any reference to it in the Budget speech of the Minister.  No reference is made to it nor is any attempt made to explain it. Before this Bill becomes law I hope we will hear more about how much the sub-contractors and other people in that category, who appeared not to be paying their fair share, were getting away with.  Was it hundreds of pounds or millions of pounds?  From my own experience, I do not believe it runs into millions of pounds.  I am aware that the main contractors have been supplying to the Revenue Commissioners lists of sub-contractors employed to do certain operations.  The opinion is held in our society that there has been evasion of tax.  The so-called earnings reported for piece work and so on have been out of all proportion. Over 12 months I believe it would be found that the total earnings of these people would not be much greater than the total earnings of the steady, regular, weekly-paid operator.</P>
    <P>I will watch this Bill very carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much to say about this type of Bill at this stage. One could regard it as a Bill under which there are three legs.  There is the old traditional type of taxation on alcohol, petrol and tobacco, the three steady war-horses of every Finance Minister.  Another leg to the Bill is the Deputy Charles Haughey 5 per cent turnover tax.  Then for good measure we have a third leg thrown in, not by any Minister but by the Revenue Commissioners in which there is great dotting of I's and crossing of T's, in archaic revenue law phraseology, with sections and subsections all lumped together, with little bits added on and little concessions given.  That is the basis of the Bill.  It must be a delight to the parliamentary draftsman and to the Revenue Commissioners who look at life through a small focus lens. They are concerned there is a loophole somewhere and that another drafting must be made to get at those people.  They spend hours and hours trying to draw up a new section and <Col N="1384" /> we have to spend our time dissecting what they mean.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They spend much time on some little thing that never cured or killed anybody.  That is basically what this Bill consists of.  The 5 per cent turnover tax is the main item. All these other pieces consist of little things added in here and there.  It seems to me that there is a great waste of time about it.</P>
      <P>I want to mention a couple of things in the Bill.  I am not happy&mdash;and in this I am in agreement with the previous speaker&mdash;about the question of the sub-contractor.  They may be very well-off people but often they are not. Often they are quite small people, whether they are heating, electrical or plumbing contractors.</P>
      <P>An innovation seems to be in the pipeline.  I do not know why the Revenue people cannot deal directly with the sub-contractors as they have done heretofore.  It seems that some onus is being placed on the contractor to act as watchdog over the sub-contractor. Apart from this peculiarity of the situation&mdash;and it seems peculiar to me &mdash;there is no evidence that there has been wholesale evasion by the sub-contractors. I do not see how they could evade.  Some notion has got into the minds of the Revenue people and they have introduced this clause which will cause administrative difficulties.  Most business people have trouble enough trying to keep their books right for ordinary PAYE without getting into more complications and asking contractors to play a watchdog role in relation to sub-contractors.  There will be many difficulties and the final result will be an increase in the cost of building. These sub-contractors are in the position, as most traders are, of being able to pass back their expenses to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are before this House at present two Bills which I shall just mention in passing&mdash;one is the Housing Bill on Fifth Stage and the other one, which we will be dealing with tomorrow, is the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) <Col N="1385" /> Bill, 1970.  Both of these will have the effect of increasing the cost of building to the private builder because many people will not qualify for a grant. They will, therefore, lose their stamp duty and also the reduction in valuation which was two-thirds for a period of seven years.  These three things together, according to the Minister for Finance, will mean a loss to a person of £1,000, on average.</P>
    <P>Now we have this other exercise by which the subcontractors will be brought under increasing revenue pressure.  The effect of this, to my mind, will be that if they are able to extract X pounds out of them that X pounds will be passed to the man who is buying the house.  That will inevitably be the situation.  I doubt if this is a worthwhile measure, certainly without some statement from the Minister that there has been wholesale evasion in this area. He has merely implied that.  He has not stated definitely that there is.  He has not stated what degree of evasion there is.  He has not told us what extra money he hopes to get by introducing this measure.  We all know it will cause annoyance and administrative difficulties but he does not mention what it will amount to in cash.  I feel it is a very doubtful exercise particularly at this time and taken in conjunction with the other measures which are going through this House and which will, in effect, raise the cost of a house to the non-grant aided person by about £1,000.</P>
    <P>One naturally has less sympathy with the builders of office blocks because they are usually in very wealthy circumstances.  Here we have the peculiar position that last year there was a ten per cent duty on office blocks imposed for the first time and this year it is taken off.  There does not seem to me to be much rational thinking behind all this.  What extraordinary changes have taken place since last year?  It may be that it is not a global removal but it is not clear from what the Minister read out there whether this is being applied to all office blocks or merely to those which are occupied by a private staff.</P>

      <P>I have received representations that this charge imposes an unfair burden on firms who find it necessary to build office accommodation for the use of their own staffs.  I have decided to accede to these representations and in section 44 I am abolishing the duty on such office blocks, subject to the condition that there is no change of occupancy for five years.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says this concession will be given to people who build offices for their own staff.  If they sublet a part of the office what will happen?  Will the concession be fragmented?  How will it be worked out?  I find it hard to reconcile this with other Government measures that have been introduced up to the present time.  The man who built his office last year paid his 10 per cent but he was allowed a two-thirds rates abatement for seven years.  This year the rates abatement is taken off him.  There does not seem to be any logical thinking behind all this.  It seems to be just little ideas that have emanated from the revenue people.  They discovered that something was going on here and with their detective mentality they rushed to the Minister and said: &ldquo;These boys are <Col N="1387" /> getting away with something.  We must get after them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Children's allowances amount to a lot of money.  Speaking from memory, I think they amounted last year to something like £10 million.  This is one of the few social welfare handouts administered without a means test.  I have often wondered why that is so. I fail to see the logic of handing out children's allowances to a person in the surtax bracket and then taking it back from him in taxation.  It has always seemed to me that it would be more logical to have children's allowances based on some form of means test. There never has been a means test despite what Dr. O'Donovan said.</P>

      <P>I know that at one stage children's allowances were worked in such a fashion that people in a certain income bracket, paying income tax, got children's allowances, then a deduction was made on their income tax and the result was that they were worse off than if they never got the children's allowance.  They could not opt out of it.  They got no concession even if they did.  They were compelled to take it.  That, again, seems to have been an illogical position.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states that section 10 &ldquo;provides in effect that, in respect of children qualifying for social welfare children's allowances, the income tax deductions will be reduced, where there are two such children, by £15 for the second child and, where there are more than two such children, by £15 for the second child and, by £19 (£23 for years subsequent to 1970-71) for the third or subsequent child.&rdquo; This is an attempt at a more equitable distribution of wealth.  It does not seem to me to be a very satisfactory way to do it but that is a matter for argument and discussion.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> Section 5 empowers the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations under PAYE requiring an employer to furnish particulars of certain employees whose emoluments in a year are not likely to exceed a specified amount and to notify the Revenue Commissioners when the emoluments of certain employees have exceeded a specified amount.  I have received complaints, and I am sure other Deputies have, from people ordinarily exempted from tax because they are married and have a number of children but who after doing some extra work in the evening have found that the remuneration they received for that work is added to their ordinary pay and this brings them above the level of exemption and they are taxed on the bulk sum.  I also received complaints from people who are taxed on their holiday pay because it brings them above the level of exemption.</P>
    <P>These are probably only administrative irritants but they are becoming increasingly common.  Because of the fall in the value of money more people are coming within the PAYE bracket. I am sure this is a simple matter to rectify&mdash;it is only a matter of commonsense&mdash;but people get agitated if they do not understand the position because they think they are being unfairly treated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said he would like to see the income tax code simplified. There is little hope in that.  The Revenue Commissioners rejoice in making it more complicated.  Not only is there exhaustive legislation, some of which is incomprehensible despite the fact that it was consolidated in the 1967 Act, but there is an enormous amount of extra statutory decisions on income tax which are not readily available to the public or the accounting profession.  I understand extra statutory concessions and rulings are published in Britain but they are not published here. I suggest the Minister consider adopting that practice here.  If such information were available it would be of considerable assistance to those dealing with income tax.</P>
    <P>The general thinking behind this Finance Bill is unsound.  There is nothing in it to improve our economic <Col N="1389" /> situation.  When the turnover tax was introduced a few years ago we were informed that the expected income would amount to £12 million but we now obtain £20 million from this source.  In the interim period a wholesale tax was introduced and this brings in another £20 million.  In the space of a few years a new system of tax has been introduced here which nets £40 million.  We also net £40 million from the rates.  That figure has also increased rapidly over the past few years.</P>
    <P>We are negotiating entry to the Common Market.  One of the terms of entry is that, apart from the free movement of men, money and material, we will have a common fiscal structure and a common taxation structure.  The added value tax is used in the Common Market.  I do not know how readily adaptable turnover tax is to added value tax.  When turnover tax was introduced we were told that one of the attractions of it was that it could be adjusted to the added value tax system without too much difficulty.  We all expected reference to be made to this in the Budget speech, in the Bill or in the Minister's speech, but all that has been said is that a book on the added value tax as it operates in Europe has been issued.  No mention has been made about the necessary adaptation which this country would need to undergo to operate that tax.  Indeed, the whole question of our economic position has been completely by-passed. It has not been mentioned either in the Financial Statement or in the nine page document which the Minister presented here tonight.  It is a purely technical Bill with many minor sections, on which there will be lengthy discussion, much of it pointless and fruitless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some general observations regarding the financial situation of this country.  We have a very heavy burden of taxation which is most inequitably distributed.  We have a large farming community and an agricultural industry and, so far as I understand it, the system of taxation is not applied to the profits of that industry.  No Government in this country dares to tax the farmers on their profits out of <Col N="1390" /> farming and we follow a system which was introduced by Britain, one of the greatest manufacturing countries in the world.  The system suited Britain in the past and still suits her because she is a great manufacturing country but that is not the business of this House or this nation.  In the 50 years of self-government we have not altered the system of taxation to any great extent with the result that the present system lays a great burden on the city dweller and on industry.</P>
      <P>It was one of the achievements of the inter-Party Government that they introduced alleviation of taxation in order to encourage exports.  That had an outstanding effect on our export trade and was one of the chief reasons for our increased exports.  It showed what could be done in the way of using taxation as an instrument for helping industry in this country.  Unfortunately, the same wise policy was not followed in relation to internal industry which is important from the point of view of employment.</P>
      <P>Consequently, we have a system which is not entirely suited to our economy.  We have never faced squarely up to the situation that if we could do something to alleviate the burden of taxation which is laid on industry we could achieve the same outstanding results we achieved in relation to exports.  I am not advocating that farmers should pay more but I am suggesting the matter should be investigated.  There are certain farmers who are paying very high rates but, as against that, the broad principle which is followed in manufacturing and other industry is not followed in agriculture.</P>
      <P>I know that other speakers will criticise that statement but it has always seemed to me rather strange that a country such as ours which prides itself on its freedom, is interested in its language and in retaining its way of life as far as possible, should slavishly follow taxation and finance policies that were introduced by another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This system places an undue burden on the city dweller and on what was formerly called the &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; worker and it acts as a disincentive, <Col N="1391" /> not only to the businessman but to the workers.  I have personal experience of men saying to me: &ldquo;I do not want to work overtime; they take too much from me in tax&rdquo;.  That leads to many kinds of abuse.  It means that men sometimes are not inclined to work overtime and there are occasions, which the trade unions recognise, when it is in the national interest that overtime should be worked.  This disinclination means that the way is open for a man to work after hours privately and in this work money will be earned which is, in fact, as often as not untaxed. That hits those whose income tax has to be paid as regularly as is money across the post office counter for a stamp.  Every penny that is earned by many of us is taxed right up to the hilt.  Others get away with various forms of evasion and semi-evasion. That is unfair to those of us who are taxed up to the hilt.</P>
    <P>The way in which a Government can raise money in the form of taxation is limited; there are three ways by which it can get revenue&mdash;by direct taxation, by indirect taxation and by excise duty.  Although we had a commission on taxation I do not think the Government have taken the advice of that commission.  Nobody in this country has really gone into the question of how we, now separated from a big manufacturing country, should base our taxation.  We are still following a method laid down by Britain as part of her great manufacturing empire.  I would ask the Government, and others not in Government, to apply themselves to this problem.  To me, and I have been a very long time in this House, it is something crying out for attention by an Irish Government and those interested in Irish government in the best interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Death duties are mentioned.  There is no great change.  I do not advocate the abolition of death duties, but I think it would benefit us if we cut down our rate of taxation here and attracted certain wealthy people in here as a result of that.  We would benefit by the inflow of capital.  Serious thinkers have put forward the theory that death duties should be abolished. <Col N="1392" /> I do not go so far as that but they should be made as attractive as possible so that we may benefit from the money of those who would come to live here.  We could well do with their capital.</P>
    <P>We have at the moment a very serious financial position arising out of the situation in connection with the banks.  I do not know exactly what the Government could do, but I think they could certainly bring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I merely mention the fact that it is having all sorts of effects on our taxation.  It will mean that revenue in the current year will be affected by the situation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but financial difficulties arise therefrom.  In deference to the Chair I will not pursue the matter but, wherever stocks are mentioned, I would say that the present difficulties in which we find ourselves can have nothing but an adverse effect on any stocks mentioned in this Bill or elsewhere.  I can only see it having an adverse effect.</P>
      <P>It is high time we realised as a country exactly where we can place the burden of taxation.  As a businessman, I do not like to see any increase in the turnover tax but I do not think it is&mdash; I speak for myself here&mdash;an inequitable form of taxation in the circumstances in which we find ourselves because the income tax payer, whether he is a businessman or anything else, carries almost the whole burden.  The ordinary worker who up to a few years ago did not pay any income tax has now to pay income tax.  He does not always understand the extent to which he is paying income tax but he is paying it, and he is paying it directly, whilst other people who may be earning a great deal more in other sections are not paying.  Therefore, the whole question of taxation will increasingly come in front of every Irish Government. The very fact that there are sections of the community who have now moved in, as income tax payers, and will increasingly come in&mdash;due to inflation, wage increases, and so on&mdash; means that they will inevitably demand a more just sharing of the burden of taxation than has been the case in this country in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the present Government have <Col N="1394" /> not now, and never have, gone into that question properly nor faced up to the realities of the situation.  They have not given industry and those who work in it&mdash;and that is the vital part of it&mdash;a fair share of taxation; they have given them a very unfair share. The whole question of taxation should be gone into and, increasingly, we should consider whether or not we can afford to do this or that or the other thing.</P>
    <P>As one who has been in this House for a long time, it is quite some years since I have heard anybody on the other side put forward the plea &ldquo;I do not think we can afford that.&rdquo; It seems to be popular to consider that the public purse is inexhaustible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that has not been realised, one of the things that is perhaps overshadowed by other events, is the serious financial situation of this country.  This Bill embodies the details of the Budget, the details of how we will implement what is in the Budget speech and, indeed, many things left out of the Budget speech perhaps because they were not generally appreciated Budget expressions but which nonetheless, are just as important or perhaps more important than some of the things which hit the headlines on 22nd April.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to gauge unemployment today because of the effects of strikes.  It is also impossible to gauge today the money situation in the country. It is impossible to estimate our real balance of payments deficit over the past few months.  It is in that context that we are now dealing with the Finance Bill which, in its main aspect &mdash;the imposition of double turnover tax&mdash;acts like a bludgeon on all when, in fact, the necessity probably was for the individual and very careful action of a surgeon's knife, not that I am advocating a Budget or a Finance Bill full of strictures.  I assert that the global attack on everybody's income&mdash;irrespective of who they are, what they were, what they bought or what they found it necessary to buy in the form of double turnover tax, was the wrong sort of Budget and the wrong sort of Finance Bill for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we compare this Finance Bill with the added value tax which we shall be dealing with when we enter EEC, we shall see the selective approach towards taxation on one hand and on the other the global bludeoning effect of the crude and general <Col N="1396" /> approach to something that should have been the object of sympathy in one direction and perhaps discouragement in another direction because of taxation at a higher level. These are things we can criticise in this Bill.  It has been possible since Budget day to see some of the effects of this global and crude approach to indirect taxation in the section dealing with turnover tax.  I would remind the House that it has not been possible to see all the effects because the bad results of people being very short of money&mdash;and a lot of us are self-employed people in this country&mdash;the bad results of overdrafts mounting, the bad results of a balance of payments situation which cannot be assessed at the moment&mdash;I propose to say why&mdash;are not entirely visible to us.</P>
    <P>We do not know how bad they would be if the economic situation here were normal.  It is bad.  The result of the turnover tax as a method of taxation has been that, because of its non-selectivity, the unfortunate man with nine or ten children who, perforce, must spend all his wages each week and has not the opportunity to save at all is left in the position that he is paying more tax, whereas the rich man who eats the same lunch every day&mdash;he may be eating something which the poor man cannot afford but he has still got only one mouth and one stomach and eats one lunch every day and perhaps he has not got the same number of dependants as the poor man&mdash;does not need to spend so much because he has not got those dependants.  This man is paying far less in indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>Surely there should be a graded indirect taxation system?  The man who goes to buy bread or boots for his children should pay less in indirect taxation than the man who goes to buy a luxury article or something which is quite obviously not a family necessity.  In this way the Government have failed the country.  The bad results of this turnover tax Budget, now typified in the section of the Finance Bill with which I am dealing, will be to further increase the wage demands that are besetting the industrial structure and placing all our hopes for an increase in employment <Col N="1397" /> in peril.  This is a major error and it must be adverted to in this House. The disincentives which have resulted and the interference in the lives of unfortunate people who must spend all their money each week on necessities have been minimised to a great degree by the present strike situation within the country to which I refer in passing only.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the attraction of wealthy persons to this country by adopting the approach to death duties which some other countries have adopted.  The revenue from death duties here is quite small because we are not a nation of rich people.  As I have often said, one has only to go to the south of England in July or August to see the wealth which has been gathered together over two, three or four generations, or perhaps two or three centuries, and to see the necessity for death duties for the redistribution of these vast sums.</P>
    <P>Very few of us have departed from the ordinary life and ordinary incomes that our mothers and fathers enjoyed. There may be individual people who have &ldquo;struck it rich&rdquo;.  There may be individual people who had wealthy families behind them who succeeded in passing on their wealth without having it taken from them in one way or another.  As a general rule, Irish people are not the very rich and the very poor. Some of them are self-employed.  Very few in relation to England or the Continent are employed in manufacturing industry as yet.  I think the figure is 18 per cent of the work force as compared with 38 per cent in Britain. Very few of them are extremely wealthy.</P>
    <P>In this situation we could attract wealthy people here by not being so tough about death duties.  It might have some sort of a social connotation in that many people would object to this because they could not see why the unfortunate man about whom I have just been speaking should have to suffer the dreadful effects of the turnover tax without any selectivity and why the very rich man should be attracted here by not having to pay death duties just because there might be something in it for the community as a whole.  In this regard we must be <Col N="1398" /> pragmatists.  The few million pounds we collect in death duties seem very small in relation to the many millions we collect in beer and excise duties, turnover tax and various other forms of indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>Over the past year we saw the ex-Minister for Finance going abroad and borrowing money in Germany and other places.  The terrible thing we must remember is that, if we borrow at home, the income tax is paid on the dividends here to the Irish nation and the Irish Minister for Finance and this reduces the real figure paid out in dividends on national loans to perhaps two-thirds of the figure quoted, but when we borrow abroad in Germany or these places the income is then subject to taxation by the German Government or the Governments of those other places, so that you must pay the lot and if your figure is 9 per cent at 98, or whatever the last one was, that is precisely what the customer gets.</P>
    <P>If we were to attract people to live here they would pay their taxes to our Government.  Wealthy men who come to places like this want to develop their interests, naturally enough, since they are living here.  They are attracted by the nature of the country, and anybody who would not be attracted by the nature of Ireland would be a very great dullard indeed.  In many cases these men have employed our people. They have paid very high taxes here on incomes and they have enhanced our country.  Nobody wants to sell out our country to foreigners, but there are men who have graced this country with their presence, paid very high taxes and left something to be remembered behind them.  I would mention the name of Sir Alfred Chester Beatty who was well known to us all and whose work in this country will be lauded by every Irishman.  We would welcome the arrival of another such as he.  I mention just one man.  There are many others who could come here and perhaps set up industries.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the Budget last year and the Budget this year, on which this Finance Bill and the previous Finance Bill were based, that we cannot sustain of our own volition <Col N="1399" /> from profits&mdash;and that is all we have because we have not got great wealth from those who went before us&mdash;the degree of capital expenditure that we desire and the degree of capital expenditure demanded by our people whether it be to build houses, to give incentives for factories, to give incentives to agriculture, or to build schools. Whatever they are, these are capital sums that are required and they have to be paid for over the next 35 years or 20 years or whatever the borrowing figure is.</P>
    <P>Capital sums are required and must be acquired.  We must get them from somewhere.  In relation to death duties, a very real contribution could be specific proposals or legislative measures within this Finance Bill which would encourage people to come here on the basis that investment would be to their advantage just as proper investment would be to the advantage of all of us.  I welcome the Minister to his new office.  I have not spoken across the House to him since he took up his new office.  I am sure he would agree with me that we cannot have the degree of capital expenditure that is required from our own resources.  Our own savings and our own profits are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Before I move from this question of death duties I want to say that anybody who ever examined a profit and loss account, a trading account, or a balance sheet, and looked at the profits in relation to the buildings involved and in relation to the capital expenditure found the reason why so many companies public and private have had to raise new capital even though they were doing extremely well.  The reason is that profits of themselves are not sufficient unless they are excessive, which no one would tolerate I am sure. Unless they are excessive no profits could supply in modern industry or modern development sufficient moneys to produce the capital expenditures that have become so necessary.</P>
    <P>The day has gone when men worked without machines.  This is the reason why we have to borrow so much abroad.  The death duty section of this Bill is a mistake and so is the turnover <Col N="1400" /> tax section of the Bill.  It is a lazy man's Finance Bill as it was a lazy man's Budget.  Invitations could have been extended and encouragement given to bring not only money but men here.  I should prefer to see a foreign industrialist coming here with a large amount of money and residing among us and becoming, perhaps, more Irish than the Irish themselves, than to see the Minister for Finance going to the German money market and purchasing there again.  The salient point here is that when you borrow on the German money market it is the German Government that will get the tax on the dividends.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section in which the Minister indicates a personal interest in a certain matter of legislation.  This is a most welcome departure in this House.  In my period of 16 years here and in the other House, I know of no other occasion when a Minister came here and declared an interest.  It is no harm, in friendship across the House, in discussing this Bill to give the views of the late Deputy Sweetman on the question of involvement of Ministers. When that matter was being discussed by our front bench, the late Deputy Sweetman&mdash;he was dead before it could be considered as policy&mdash;said that the right approach to this matter after his experience as Minister and so on, and I say this in no derogatory sense, was that every Minister should declare to the Taoiseach his every interest in any property, profits or business.  That being so, the secretary of the Taoiseach's Department, having the file, would indicate to the Taoiseach when any legislation came up which might involve a Minister who had a personal interest.  At that stage the Taoiseach could decide whether the Minister should go to the House and declare his interest or whether the Taoiseach would prefer instead to indicate to the House that because of a personal interest he was asking another Minister to take the legislation.</P>
    <P>This could be a very real step forward in Parliamentary and public life. Without any derogatory suggestion, the idea that Ministers should resign from boards of public companies is not of <Col N="1401" /> any consequence.  The Minister present knows as well as I do, and I am not a legal man and he is a solicitor by profession, that it is quite easy to get over that provision.  I am not suggesting that it was ever done: I am praising the Minister for his attitude in this matter and I am intimating the views of somebody who has left us which views were in parallel with what the Minister said here tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the Finance Bill great &ldquo;mileage&rdquo; was produced in the Budget debate on the various concessions being given.  Giving concessions in the nature of tax-free allowances is highly expensive.  The figure of £6 5s tax-free for a man or woman going out to earn a living is just a joke.  One might as well tax every £ and have a different tax rate.  In the first instance the idea of this tax-free allowance or the dependent relative allowance or any other allowances mentioned in the early part of the Minister's speech was to have a reasonable living standard before tax would be deducted.  Over the past decade or more that has gone.  I have quoted £6 5s; it may have been changed slightly.  That sum, for years past, would not sustain anybody.  What happened was that the Fianna Fáil Government allowed this figure to become out of date.  Various elections had come up and various things were changed and the whole idea was: keep the rate of tax down; do not tell the people the truth.  The figure should have been corrected each year so that <Col N="1402" /> the allowance figure would be what it was originally meant to be, a normal subsistence figure for a man at the level of the ordinary working man.  The allowance for a wife or a dependant was meant to have the same significance. The great complaint of the worker and the worker's wife is that the tax rate is applied at a figure that is far too low.</P>
      <P>The slight change of charging the first £100 of taxable income at two-thirds of the standard rate does not alter the situation.  It will not bring the allowance up to a figure at which a single man can sustain himself.  So long as that is the case, it is wrong. Excluding 50,000 taxpayers from the tax net is rather like what was done by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in introducing his Finance Bill.  He excluded the same 400,000 or 500,000 people but, when questions were asked afterwards in the House of Commons, it was made clear that these were marginal people and that the amount of tax being paid by them was so small that this concession was merely an election advertisement. Whether the 50,000 taxpayers mentioned in this Bill constitute an election advertisement remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>I find the Minister's reference to the difficulty of attracting female labour rather ludicrous.  He says:</P>
      <P>As a contribution to easing the problem it was announced in the Budget that the earned income allowance for married women was being increased from £45 to £74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is this worth?  Will this attract any married women to go to work? Without going into mathematical calculations if you work out the tax on the extra allowance you will find that if the married woman had to pay a bus fare&mdash;that is a relevant reference tonight&mdash;she would be back where she started or a little worse.  Boastful paragraphs about that allowance for married women being increased are not valid.  In fact, they merely substantiate the main theme of my argument on the first part of this Bill that the allowances were allowed by Fianna Fáil to become completely out of date.  They are not now what they were intended to be, the amount required to sustain <Col N="1403" /> a person at a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>The income limit for the dependent relative allowance is now brought into line with that for the non-contributory old age pension, £222.  I always think of a lady called Kitty the Hare in <i>Our Boys</i>, and one of her great sayings was: &ldquo;May you nor yours never know the coldness of charity.&rdquo; When I think of us paying ourselves and that some of us could spend the whole lot of it before we go home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am afraid so. However, I do not want to be facetious about such a serious matter.  A man who keeps a dependent relative, who out of his charity, which I hope would not be cold on his part, gives that relative from his lot the necessities of life and what comforts he can afford, is allowed, if his tax rate is 7s, a difference of about £70 or £80.  These marvellous figures here do not relate to actual money but to the pounds on which the tax is charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could have been a much more detailed Budget if the Minister for Finance had not been busy with particular matters over the months.  There could have been a move towards an added value tax, which must happen as we enter the Common Market.  Instead of that there is the approach of the lazy man with a bludgeon.  The net result is dissatisfaction.  This country needs in relation to its tax structure for the ordinary people&mdash;and those are the people I am thinking of in Part 1 of this Bill, because it is they who will be affected most&mdash;a period of five to ten years for the laying down of policy towards a fair rate of taxation. The vicissitudes of Fianna Fáil legislation over the last ten years will not allow any other administration or themselves, if they do, by some miraculous deed, stay in office, to change what is so wrong to what is right in one year.  Undoubtedly we must pay taxation and anyone who says anything else is telling an untruth, but instead of the approach to which I have <Col N="1404" /> referred we have this Finance Bill which does nothing for anyone.</P>
    <P>What is very important, whether it is 100 per cent successful or not&mdash;and I have said this in different debates here and I shall say it again next week in the Common Market debate&mdash;is a detailed approach to a prices and incomes policy.  In one of the volumes with which we were circulated in relation to the Budget there was a small reference of a page and a half to a prices policy but no reference to an incomes policy.  What could be more a prices policy without an incomes policy than turnover tax doubled and nothing else, because that was the Budget?  Where was the resilience of mind?  Where was the attention to the unfortunate people who have to work and pay their PAYE?  There is no question of avoidance or of expense accounts for them, no question of company cars.  These people get no relief except the automatic adjustment of these pitifully small initial allowances which have left their context to such an extent over the last decade.</P>
    <P>The matters which were not announced in the Budget and which relate to the designated and undeveloped areas for industrial purposes do not require much comment from me. The Minister has moved from the portfolio which dealt with them to the Finance portfolio, and I think he and I know all that is happening there.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand the wear and tear allowances in section 14.  I should be obliged if the Minister would let us know exactly how it will operate. I do not make any excuse for not understanding this, because in Finance Bills passing through here over the years there has been a great deal of matter which many people do not understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a particularly complicated section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall enjoy the Minister's explanation.  As I understand the wear and tear allowance for industrial machinery, it is that the Revenue Commissioners allow a certain percentage for wear and tear based on the probable life of a machine. In one case in which I am involved <Col N="1405" /> the figure is 10 per cent.  If you buy a machine for £1,000 you are allowed to charge £100 in the first year against your profit and loss account; then the second year the figure is one-tenth of £900, being £90.  This wear and tear allowance represented a self-depreciating figure over about ten years.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why there is need for this in section 14, if after, say, five years of this machine's life&mdash;it having cost £1,000 and been depreciated by 10 per cent per year&mdash;the machine is not now worth £500-odd but £700 or, in favour of the person involved, £400.  I should be obliged if the Minister would explain this because I freely admit I do not understand it, even though I was helped by the explanatory memorandum.</P>
      <P>Section 19 enables a person who purchases a readymade building to claim the initial allowance.  That seems to me to be fair and proper.  In fact, I would have thought this was already in legislation.  I do not know whether or not the Potez situation or the purchase of certain factories which did not live up to their first promise has prompted the insertion of this provision in the Finance Bill.  It appears to be a situation in which coverage was unnecessary until such time as there were these spectacular failures.  It would be unfair if a purchaser of a factory building which was never used and on which the initial allowance was never claimed, because there were no taxes, could not claim the initial allowance if he went into industrial production.  Is he not in the same position as if he built the factory?  Therefore, I welcome section 19, and I am surprised that this provision was not already in legislation. However, if the reason is the accession of people into ownership of certain spectacular failures then I do not criticise the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the initial allowance on a building is 20 per cent for the first year and the 2 per cent for the following 40 years.  It is a long time.  I do not quibble with the initial allowance of 20 per cent in respect of industrial buildings for the first year but I do quibble with the figure of 2 per cent for the following years.  I can give an instance of a beautiful red brick building, <Col N="1406" /> one of the finest buildings in a particular town, a malthouse which was built in 1906.  It is in showroom condition, in as good a condition as it was when it was built.  That building is completely obsolete.  The advent of new machine malting has resulted in the entire production of malt being restricted to five buildings not one of which, apart from some outside machinery, is as big as the building to which I refer.  Therefore businessmen will be in the position that they have to look on their risk situation and their risk situation cannot in modern times be related to 40 years.</P>
    <P>There was the day when this could be done, or when it was thought that this could be done, but unfortunately this is not true today.  A businessman who goes into manufacturing processes very often, in prudence, has to decide that he must get his principal out in perhaps 15 years and if he is not going to get it out in 15 years then there is not the incentive to go on.  If he has to face up to this and the fact that new processes may put him out of business, or new processes may necessitate the expenditure of capital moneys greater perhaps than in his first venture, then surely it would appear as if the Revenue Commissioners' allowance on buildings for industrial purposes should be more generous than 20 per cent, with which I do not quibble, for the first year, and 2 per cent for the following 40 years.  The 20 per cent should hold and the allowance for the next period of years should be far greater than 2 per cent.  In modern business a figure of 4 per cent which would give a 20 year depreciation, or something approximating to that, perhaps a little more than 20, as we depreciate this slice by slice, would not in fact be too generous.  Things change rapidly nowadays and the amount of the continuing allowance should be corrected.</P>
    <P>The question of sub-contracting in the construction industry is something which has been activating people's minds over the last decade to some degrees&mdash;&ldquo;living on the grip&rdquo; as they call it&mdash;and it has brought pretty good profits to sub-contractors.  If there is a situation whereby these sub-contractors <Col N="1407" /> are not paying tax it is right that legislation should be changed to see that they do.  It is better that the load should be spread over a greater number of people and then a lesser percentage of tax would have to be paid by all of us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby distillers will be allowed to defer payment of duty on clearance from warehouses. Some might say that this was extending a preference to a certain group or industry but we in the distilling industry are making efforts to export and to extend our business and if you take the amount of excise duty coming forward on spirit in relation to the cost of the spirit you find that the major portion of the cost at wholesale level is the excise duty.  As this is so money can be scarce and it does seem rather unfair that the tobacco manufacturers can have a delayed production of this money if they remove tobacco from bond while the distillers of either whiskey, gin or vodka should have to pay on the nail, even though there is a period when they have to circulate the spirit to their wholesalers, agencies and retail outlets.  I welcome this provision and I hope it will make things fairer and encourage our distillers to expand their business.</P>
    <P>I observe that the new stamp duty of 10 per cent on contracts for the building of office blocks is being removed in regard to existing companies building their own new office blocks. This works two ways.  I cannot quite make up my mind on the right approach to it.  If the company have been paying their taxes, paying employees well and giving them good conditions of employment and then find that they need a new office block because the existing offices do not come up to the proper standards&mdash;laid down, may I say, by the Factories Act and insisted upon by departmental inspectors&mdash;that they should then, when they have to build a new office block, have to pay a 10 per cent charge on the contracts, it seems harsh.  Having examined the problem and having been very much in favour of the provision last year whereby the disincentive was introduced in regard to the building of large blocks <Col N="1408" /> of offices within this city and other cities while there was a need for money for housing, I think that this is probably a wise provision.</P>
    <P>I should now like to pass to some other sections of the Bill, notably section 12 which relieves industrial and provident societies of the obligation to return to inspectors of taxes particulars of interest paid without deduction of tax where the amount of interest is less than £70.  The existing limit is £5.  As I understand it, right through the other provision relating to companies that borrow money and State agencies that borrow money, for example the Agricultural Credit Corporation, there was no need to transmit to the Revenue Commissioners details of an account until the account had a deposit of £1,000.  This figure of £70 interest seems to indicate that we are bringing the industrial and provident societies into line on this.</P>
    <P>I welcome this because small savings should not be submitted to investigation or all this bookwork because the profits to the State from the application of this tax are minimal indeed.  A lady who works for me and who has very small savings is frightened out of her life to invest the money in anything. She has no more than £1,000 but she thinks that if she does anything with the money she will have to pay twice as much PAYE.  It is impossible to convince this kindly sort of person what we are paid to understand, that this will not happen.  I welcome this provision because when a person has savings of £1,000 or less you could not call them savings at all.  They are only something put by for a rainy day.  If such a person were to have a serious illness and did not come under the provisions of the middle-income group, he would need a sum far in excess of £1,000 to cover illness and convalescence and to maintain the standard of living to which he was accustomed.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate: Pig Feed Prices.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Today I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that <Col N="1409" /> recent increases in pig feeding rations without a compensatory increase in the price of pork have created a crisis in the pig industry; if he will initiate an immediate inquiry into the recent increases in pig feed prices; if he will examine the other increases in the cost of pig production and if he will take steps to ensure a reasonable profit in pig production so that the income of farmers engaged in pig production will keep in line with the income of other sections of the community.  The Minister replied that the guaranteed price for pigs had been increased on two occasions since last autumn; that he did not consider any inquiry such as suggested to be warranted and that the continuing high level of deliveries to pig factories shows that pig prices generally are satisfactory and earned a reasonable profit for existing producers.</P>
      <P>In other words, the Minister told me that everything was rosy in the pig industry, that pig producers had nothing to complain about and that they were making a reasonable profit. I cannot agree with the Minister on that assertion and, as this is a matter which concerns the country as a whole but which concerns in particular, my constituency and the adjoining constituencies, I deem it my duty to raise the matter on the Adjournment this evening and to give the Minister an opportunity of justifying the stand he took today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt today in particular with the period from September, 1969, to the present time but I would like to make passing reference to some time prior to that and to say that during the past four or five years the profit of the pig producer has been decreasing and that his position has been worsening.  I assert that between 1st January, 1965, and May of this year, the position of pig producers has worsened to the extent of £1 per pig.  On the 1st January, 1965, the price per cwt. of grade A specials was 260s.  That was the guaranteed price.  In May of this year, the price had increased to 298s per cwt.&mdash; the guaranteed minimum price.  In the same period, that is between 1st January, 1965, and the present time, the increase in meal prices amounted to £9 per ton or, according to my information, <Col N="1410" /> 67s 6d per pig.  The increase in the guaranteed price in the same period amounted to 38s per cwt. or 47s 6d per pig.  Therefore, the position of the pig producer has worsened, as I have said, to the tune of £1 per pig.</P>
    <P>During the period to which I referred specifically in my question&mdash; between September, 1969, and the present time&mdash;the cost of producing pork has increased dramatically without any significant increase in the price of pork.  Between 22nd September, 1969, and the 21st April, 1970, the price of pig fattening nuts has increased by £4 per ton.  There was an increase of 25s per ton on the 22nd September, 1969, an increase of 15s per ton on the 5th January, 1970, and an increase of 40s per ton on the 21st April, 1970, making a total increase of 80s per ton.  There has been a corresponding increase in other types of pig rations.  I understand from the Minister's reply to supplementary questions today that he concedes that this increase of 80s per ton has taken place during the period referred to.  The Minister could not honestly contradict that assertion.  Any of the reputable established suppliers in my area will bear this out.</P>
    <P>Scientific research and the best information available shows that it takes about 7½ cwt. of feed to bring a pig from birth to pig weight if the feeding requirements of the sow are taken into account.  Therefore, on feed costs alone, it costs 30s more to produce a pig now than it cost six months ago. In addition to the cost of feeding stuffs, we know that other charges such as transport, electricity, wages and the other costs involved in pig production have also gone up.  Indeed, during the past four years feed prices in Cavan and Monaghan appear to have increased by £9 per ton or 27 per cent whereas in the same period the price of a pork pig has increased by only £2 10s or 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the price of grade A specials had gone up from 282s per cwt. on the 20th October last to 298s per cwt. at the present time. In other words, an increase of 16s per cwt.  I suggest that the Minister was simply taking selected figures and basing his case on them.  The average <Col N="1411" /> price paid for Grade A Specials in the year 1969 as advertised was 293s per cwt. and the average price over the number of weeks that have elapsed in this year is 303s 6d per cwt. or an increase of 10s 6d.  I want to put on the record of this House that what I am saying is correct.</P>
    <P>In 1969 the highest prices advertised were as follows: One week to 4th January, 286s per cwt; 11 weeks to 22nd March, 290s per cwt; five weeks to 26th April, 286s per cwt; one week to 3rd May, 290s per cwt; two weeks to 17th May, 295s per cwt; four weeks to 14th June, 300s per cwt; two weeks to 28th June, 295s per cwt; one week to 5th July, 290s per cwt; three weeks to 26th July, 295s per cwt; six weeks to 6th September, 29s per cwt; five weeks to 11th October, 285s per cwt; one week to 18th October, 290s per cwt; three weeks to 10th November, 300s per cwt; seven weeks to 27th December, 305s per cwt.  The Minister will find that is an average price over the year of 293s.</P>
    <P>This year the highest prices advertised for Grade A Specials were: one week to 3rd January, 300s per cwt; six weeks to 14th February, 302s per cwt; ten weeks to 25th April, 300s per cwt; two weeks to 9th May, 305s per cwt; four weeks to 6th June, 315s per cwt, giving an average price of 303s 6d per cwt.</P>
    <P>I would also like to tell the Minister that one reputable factory on 31st May, 1969, advertised 300s per cwt for A Specials and exactly 12 months later, 30th May, 1970, the same factory advertised for the same grade, 305s.  Those prices I have quoted, admittedly, are exclusive of bonuses which vary from factory to factory, from time to time and even from customer to customer within the same factory.  I would point out that the factory I have just referred to increased its bonus in the same period by 10s per pig.  All that meant was that there was an increase of about 11s 6d in the period.  The Minister should note that if this year is to follow the same pattern as last year we are now entering a period when the prices will fall because they appear to have fallen last year between the 14th June and October.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> It is clear from those figures that the profit of pig producers has fallen dramatically within the period I have mentioned.  The cost of producing a pig in that period has gone up by about £1 10s and the price has gone up by something marginally more than 10s or 11s.  The position has worsened considerably.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to two increases which took place in the last six months.  He referred to one increase of 10s which took place in September, in the guaranteed price.  I am told that that guaranteed price applies to only about 64 per cent of the pigs produced. It is also very significant in regard to the last guaranteed price increase of 10s, which the Minister referred to and which came into operation on 14th May, 1970, that no increased price has been paid by the Pigs and Bacon Commission to curers as a result of that increase.  I am told that is contrary to previous practice.</P>
    <P>Most of the figures I have given to the Minister are not news to him.  They are certainly not news to his Department because they have already been furnished to his Department by some of my constituents who are interested in this industry.  It is a very important industry in Cavan and I know this information has been given to the Minister. He cannot seriously contradict it. He came out with selective prices and talked about a bonus which may be paid to some and is not paid to others and which varies from factory to factory.</P>
    <P>The Minister based a great deal of his argument today on the fact that the farmers must be fairly well satisfied with the prices they are getting because the level of deliveries at factories appears to be pretty high.  He also made some vague reference to the <i>Farmers' Journal.</i>  I am glad to see he as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has more respect for that journal than his predecessor had when he withdrew advertisements from it.</P>
    <P>On this topic of deliveries of pigs to factories I should like to tell the Minister that two things at the present time are operating to keep up the level. First of all, there is considerable smuggling of pigs into this country as I am sure the Minister has been told <Col N="1413" /> by the Revenue Commissioners and officers charged with discouraging that activity.  Secondly, the pig producers have not much option at the present time.  Government policy over the past few years encouraged them to get into pig production in a fairly big way.  They were encouraged by grants to build pig houses and they were encouraged to put their money into the industry.  Most of them find themselves in an industry now which is either not profitable at all or barely profitable. They will certainly not get out of it overnight without calling on the assistance of their Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to make the fight that should be made with the Government. Perhaps some of the £14 million, which the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Blaney, called for before the Budget for the farming industry, was meant to be channelled into an increased subsidy for pigs.  We know that Deputy Blaney did not get the £14 million but got only £6 million.  I conclude by appealing to the Minister to come to the assistance of the farmers who have put their money into this industry and to help them make it a profitable one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has tried to make the case that there has been an effective drop in the profitability of pig production, certainly in his own area of Cavan, in the last nine months or so.  To this purpose the Deputy has produced quite an extraordinary array of selected figures.  The most remarkable and interesting of those figures is the £4 which the Deputy quotes as the increase per ton in the price of pig fattening meal.  The Deputy suggests that this increase is a general one and that the price of all pig meal has increased by this amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that, like many other commodities, the price of this commodity varies from place to place and from firm to firm.  It behoves a person engaged in the pig fattening business to go to where he can get the best possible value for his money.  My information is contrary to what Deputy Fitzpatrick has been saying.  My information is that the average increase in the period he was talking about was about 50s per ton and not £4.  Another slightly distorted <Col N="1414" /> statistic given by the Deputy is that it requires 7½ cwts. of this very expensive pig meal of which he speaks to produce a finished pig.  The Deputy should have another look at fattening pigs with this meal.  This expensive pig meal should not be required in such quantities, if properly balanced and prepared, to produce a finished pig.</P>
    <P>I put the increase at 50s per ton.  I do not know whether this is of importance to Deputy Fitzpatrick or not but it is of importance to the farming community generally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but this increase consists mainly of the increased price paid to barley producers for their products.  I do not know whether the Deputy is calling for a reduction in the price of feeding barley or not, but it seems so.  If the Deputy is not doing that he should have said so when speaking.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The remainder of the increase of 50s per ton consists of increases paid to workers in the compounding industry.  Deputy Fitzpatrick neglected to say whether he and his party are against this increase in wages to the workers in the provender industry. Possibly the Deputy forgot to say so, but he definitely did not say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy attempted to demonstrate that these extraordinary high costs have resulted in a drop in the profitability of pigs.  If one starts off on the premise that he is going to buy extraordinary high-priced meal and that he is going to use an extraordinary amount of it to produce one pig the chances are that he will show a drop <Col N="1415" /> in his profits.  I do not think this is the method adopted by farmers generally. I have examined the position carefully and I discovered that the admitted increase in feeding compounds caused by the better prices paid to farmers for their barley, and the better wages paid to workers for their work, have been more than compensated for by an increase in the minimum prices which have been paid in the intervening time as well as the real prices paid to producers.  The real price, which is based on the minimum price guaranteed by the Government, varies from place to place.  Again, it behoves the person selling his pigs to find the best possible market for them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to a reply which I gave to one of his supplementary questions today, where I quoted something from the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.</i> I have another reference from the same paper on the 6th June.  I wish to give a quotation from the leading article for Deputy Fitzpatrick's benefit. It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Considering the present high price for bonhams, this is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>This refers to the hold-back in sows. The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>Done reasonably well, there is a margin of up to £75 on a sow.  On 20 sows, this is £1,500.  Twenty sows too is about two hours of a man's working day.</P>
    <P>Today, more and more people want to fatten; fattening piggeries are going up all round the country by the newtime.  Again, considering the astronomically high prices for bonhams, this, too, is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>This quotation is from a very recent issue of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> and does not portray the lack of confidence <Col N="1416" /> in the industry which Deputy Fitzpatrick seeks to represent.  The contrary is the case.  Deputy Fitzpatrick&mdash;inadvertently, I think&mdash;referred to the many forms of Government assistance which are given to the farmers by way of grants for piggeries and the maintenance of an acceptable price, as well as to the creation of stability in the industry.  All this has added up, and this is acknowledged in the leading article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.</i>  It demonstrates better than any words of mine could what the position is.  This journal circulates among the farming community and is fearlessly on the side of the farmers.  It is unlikely to make such a statement if it were not true. For the past 20 minutes Deputy Fitzpatrick has been seeking by the use of the most extraordinary selected figures to demonstrate that the contrary is the case.  That is just not true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's figures, whatever their source, were very highly selected.  If one looks at them without considering any other figures one gets a very distorted and false picture of the position in the pig industry in the country today.  The pig industry is in a very satisfactory condition, as any working farmer in this business knows well.  It is the business of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and of the Government generally to see that this satisfactory condition continues.  The Government have taken the requisite steps in the recent Budget to see that this continues, and it is continuing.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18th June, 1970.</P>

There were also 74 occupational accidents, one of which was in agriculture, in respect of which disablement benefit not preceded by injury benefit was allowed or a declaration under section 29 of the Act was made.</P>
