      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has any observations to make on the fact that the unemployment rate in Ireland is 6.4 per cent whereas in Belgium it is 3.7 per cent, in Germany 0.8 per cent, Italy 3.4 per cent, Netherlands 1.3 per cent, Norway 1.3 per cent and the United Kingdom 2.4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures quoted by the Deputy are taken from the Bulletin of Labour Statistics published by the International Labour Office.  The coverage and basis of collection of the data given therein vary from country to country so that direct comparisons between the figures for the different countries are hazardous.  It is considered that the reliability of international comparisons is improved somewhat by defining for each country the percentage unemployed in relation to the total labour force as is done in the OECD publication Labour Force Statistics 1957-1968.  The figures for 1968, the latest year available, given in that publication are:</P>
      <P>Ireland, 5.4 per cent; Belgium, 2.9 per cent; Germany, 1.2 per cent; Italy, 3.5 per cent; Netherlands, 1.8 per cent; Norway, 1.0 per cent; United Kingdom, 2.1 per cent.  The corresponding figure for Ireland for 1969 is 5.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even with this adjustment the figures <Col N="3" /> are only broadly comparable, since the systems under which unemployment statistics are compiled and the definitions involved show wide variations from country to country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the health hazard caused in the Bannow Road area, Dublin, by acute water shortage; and what action it is proposed to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Under the duties of his office, the chief medical officer of a health authority is required to inform himself of all influences affecting or threatening to affect injuriously the public health in the health authority area.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the chief medical officer, Dublin, does not consider that there is a health hazard in the Bannow Road area arising out of water shortage.</P>
      <P>The provision of water supplies is primarily a matter for the sanitary authority concerned and, as the Minister for Local Government stated in his reply to the Deputy's question on 24th June, 1970, work is at present in progress on the laying of a water-main at Bannow Road, Cabra, which should improve the supply position in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it wise, when an area of the city suffers from drought, as this area has done, for his Department to circularise information to the tenants of the area as to the necessary precautions which should be taken in order to prevent illness occurring and in order to safeguard the health of those in the area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept the sincere assurance of all the Deputies for the area that even against the background of generalised low water pressure in Dublin there is a specific health hazard in this area? Will the Minister please look at this again, and urge his colleague the Minister for Local Government to expedite the laying of the main pipeline to which he refers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is primarily one for Dublin Corporation. The Minister for Local Government has done what is necessary in that regard. I have complete confidence in the decision of the Dublin Health Authority health officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state the number of dispensary districts in Ireland which are without a permanent dispensary doctor; the length such posts have been vacant; and what action he intends to take to fill them and when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of dispensary districts served by district medical officers on a temporary basis is now 232.  There are still 441 permanent district medical officers.  This situation results from the decision taken in 1965 to suspend further permanent appointments of district medical officers to facilitate the introduction of the proposed new general medical service with maximum possible choice of doctor.</P>
      <P>The original decision was modified in respect of a limited number of districts. The outcome of competitions conducted by the Local Appointments Commission in respect of 33 of these posts is still awaited.  Apart from this limited number of posts, district medical officer posts now filled on a temporary basis will continue on this basis until the new service with choice of doctor is in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of dispensary appointments, temporary or permanent, which are unfilled in (a) Ireland and (b) the western counties of Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal; and the total number of dispensaries in these counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 23rd June to a similar question by Deputy Desmond.</P>
      <P>There are 195 dispensaries in the counties named in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply on the 23rd June was not specific as regards temporary appointments nor did he give any statistics relating to this. I would ask the Minister, therefore, the number of dispensary vacancies in those western counties named in the question which are unfilled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to ask a separate question about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already asked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to state whether he refers to the dispensary districts served by non-resident doctors, whether he refers to permanent appointments or temporary appointments, whether they are districts served by a permanent district medical officer of an adjoining district.  I could not possibly give all this information in the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question here asks specifically which counties have vacant dispensaries.  The counties are named and all I want to know is the number of dispensary vacancies in each county which are unfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the question as best I can.  The Deputy knows very well the system is changing <Col N="6" /> in any event to choice of doctor.  There is no point in going into all this because the change is taking place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total number of patients in mental hospital institutions in the 26 Counties at 31st December, 1969; what percentage of the Irish population this represents; how this percentage compares with the British figures; and what plans he has to tackle this problem at a national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of patients on the registers of our psychiatric hospitals on 31st December, 1969, was 16,802.  This represents 0.57 per cent of the estimated population.  In England and Wales the estimated percentage of the population in mental illness beds was 0.23 and in Scotland it was 0.36 for the year 1969.  Figures between different countries may not be directly comparable, but I am still satisfied that the number of patients in our psychiatric hospitals is unduly high.  I have already drawn attention to this matter in my statement to the House when introducing the Estimate for my Department on 8th April this year and I gave on that occasion an indication of the principal developments which are taking place in our endeavours to cope with this and other problems in relation to the mental health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, last month a conference of managers and resident medical <Col N="7" /> superintendents of mental hospital authorities was organised by my Department at which the question of reducing the number of patients in our psychiatric hospitals was among the matters discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement a few days ago at the conference on mental illness, would he not agree that the figure he has given is artificially low due to the fact that so many of the severely- and moderately-mentally handicapped are not in institutions, as stated by the Minister at this conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to mentally ill persons, not mentally handicapped persons.  There is a distinction between the two of which the Deputy should be aware.</P>

      <P>I intend, however, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations under the new Health Act whereby children of any income group with long-term mental handicap would be entitled to in-patient treatment, out-patient specialist services, drugs, medicines and appliances, free of charge.</P>

      <P>I understand, however, that health authorities periodically adjust their standards of eligibility to allow for factors such as wage rounds and price changes.  Under section 45 of the Health Act, 1970, the classes of persons eligible for cards can be specified in regulations which would be reviewed from time to time.  I hope to lay before the House draft regulations, under this section, later in the year.</P>

      <P>I intend, however, to give priority in the next few years to the pre-school and national school services on the grounds that the greatest improvement in the health of our children will come from concentrating resources on the younger age groups and particularly the pre-school children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>For the 1970 summer season permission has been granted to a foreign airline to operate 11 student charter flights to the USA.  These flights were organised by the Irish Student Employment and Travel Association&mdash;ISETA. The national airline had not the necessary capacity available to operate the flights on the dates required.</P>
      <P>Within Europe student charter flights are organised by student bodies and operated by non IATA airlines on a basis which does not meet the rules governing charter flights adopted by IATA.  IATA companies, therefore, including Aer Lingus, do not participate in this business.  Permission has been freely granted for such flights to foreign airlines and no objections have been received.</P>
      <P>No representations have been received from the Union of Students in Ireland regarding the operation of student charter flights from this country by foreign airlines.  Representations in this matter were, however, received from the Irish Student Travel Service &mdash;USIT&mdash;and were duly considered.</P>

      <P>Dublin County Council in co-operation with my Department propose to provide replacement houses for the occupants of the Collinstown Lane cottages on a site at Santry Avenue.  Consultations with the occupants in the matter by a representative of Aer Rianta will take place at a very early date.  At present I am unable to say when the replacement houses will be built but there will be no avoidable delay in their provision.  The provision of the houses has not been delayed because of financial considerations.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that four years ago, as a matter of urgency, Dublin County Council, his Department and the Department of Local Government visited these people, telling them that within three weeks they would be removed from these houses and placed elsewhere?  During that period the people in Collinstown Lane have been for breakfast, dinner and tea suffering the fumes of the jets which are blowing in their windows. The people have requested that something be done as a matter of urgency about this but the Department of Transport and Power have failed, as far as I am concerned, to co-operate with the people because they have never visited them regarding what type of houses they want or what kind of conditions they want in regard to these houses.</P>

      <P>To put the Deputy into perspective in the matter, Dublin County Council was given notice of <Col N="16" /> my predecessor's intention in regard to these houses in May 1963.  From May, 1963 until 15th April, 1970 the matter lay entirely between the Dublin County Council and the Department of Local Government, more with the Dublin County Council than with the Department of Local Government.  The lay-out plans finally prepared by the Dublin County Council arrived in my Department on 15th April of this year, and immediately action was taken by representatives of my Department and Aer Rianta who held meetings with the Department of Local Government and the Dublin County Council between 15th April and 4th May and since then have been in touch with the people concerned.

      <P>The prevention of oil pollution of the sea is governed by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil.

No specific consultations with the British Government are, therefore, necessary in this regard.</P>

      <Col N="18" /> There have been informal consultations with the British authorities on the question of co-operation in dealing with oil spillages at sea.  The establishment of formal liaison arrangements cannot, however, be undertaken until such time as a decision is reached on the type of organisation to be set up in this country to deal with the clearing up of oil spillages.  As I indicated in reply to a previous question on 16th June, this is dependent on the review at present in progress in the light of an inquiry by an inter-departmental committee.</P>

      <P>In our situation a devaluation has nothing to commend it.

This does not, of course, mean that inflationary pressures have eased or that it may not be necessary to take some further measures in that regard. The Government have made it quite clear all along that, if it should be necessary to take action to remedy this, it will be taken.  The House will be aware of the steps which are being taken at present in regard to the recommendations of the NIEC and their implementation.  I think all of us would hope that these would be effective, but what I want to make absolutely clear is that, if they are not effective and if it is necessary for the Government to take further action, that action will be taken, but whatever action we take will under no circumstances include devaluation, which would be of no help to us in our present circumstances.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The subsidy was withdrawn with effect from the 1st May, 1970.  The school transport schemes being operated under the aegis of my Department ensure that children who have to travel excessive distances to the nearest school are provided with free transport.  These schemes relieve those most in need of any burden associated with school fares.  The transport services will cost over £3 million in the current financial year.  Any further State contribution towards school transport costs must in present circumstances be out of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that what he has done is to transfer money from the pockets of some hard pressed people?  Is he aware pockets of other people?  Is he aware that the effect of the withdrawal of the subsidy given by his Department is to impose on many working-class families additional bus fares of up to 10s a week in respect of school-going children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the purpose of the scheme when it was first introduced and even now is to cater for those who qualify as regards age and distance.  While we hope to extend this scheme as far as possible it has not been found feasible in the present circumstances to continue the subsidy in Dublin where distance hardship, as it is called, does not apply to the same extent as it does in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think it a somewhat incongruous procedure that for certain children free transport is being provided whereas other children are having the cost of transport directly increased?  Children in places like Dún Laoghaire have to travel considerable distances&mdash;maybe not as far as in rural <Col N="32" /> areas &mdash; to school because of overcrowding. Will the Parliamentary Secretary at least consider allowing a concession to those children where other children are allowed free transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything incongruous about this. The regulations are being applied on the same basis throughout the country. I do not think the Deputy needs me to remind him what the basis of the concessions are.  Special concessions were introduced in Dublin as a result of the Government's decision to subsidise this aspect of CIE's operations in 1968.  It has not been found possible to continue those concessions.  I want to make it clear that as far as the Department is concerned no hardship as such is being imposed on Dublin children.  The same criteria of distance and age qualifications apply in Dublin as apply throughout the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in some cases the concessions amounted to one-third of the adult fare but that has been changed now and the concession is only half of the adult fare so that there is a considerable worsening of the situation from the point of view of the children?  Could the Parliamentary Secretary say how much was involved in the subsidy in respect of children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsidy for this operation prior to the increase in CIE fares was in the order of £136,000. It would be significantly more now that the fares have been increased.  The Department could not in the circumstances recommend that this concession be continued.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that at discussions which have recently taken place between soft fruit growers and the jam manufacturers final agreement was not reached as to what quantity of fruit will be taken up or on the question of price.  My information is that the main difficulty relates to gooseberries and to a less extent to blackcurrants.  I understand that both sides are meeting again this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the jam manufacturers have informed the growers that they will take a limited quantity of strawberries but will not fix a price until later on; that they will take their gooseberries at £50 as against £90 last year and that they will not take blackcurrants or raspberries or any other soft fruit even if they got them for nothing?  Would the Minister say if any effort is to be made to try to fix prices, as was done by his Department in previous years, or is it true that jam, rather than fruit pulp, is being imported and sold openly without any tariff being imposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that efforts will be made.  A meeting between the growers and the jam manufacturers is to take place this week and thereafter the growers will be coming to the Department to discuss their problems with us.  If the Department can give any assistance we shall be very glad to do so.  We are aware that, particularly in the case of gooseberries, it is very difficult to place soft fruit.  There is an oversupply of gooseberries, even from last year, and jam manufacturers simply do not require them.  This is the situation as I understand it.  These matters are now about to be discussed between the jam manufacturers and the <Col N="34" /> growers as represented by the National Farmers' Association and thereafter the growers are coming to talk to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries about their difficulties.  We shall have a far better clarification after these talks as to the exact nature of the problems of the fruit growers and we hope to be able to assist them then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that the only group of representatives to be met is the National Farmers' Association?  Is he aware that in previous years the fruit growers' associations for the various areas met and appointed representatives to discuss the matter with his Department?  Is he now saying that these people are not to but in on the discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not suggest any such thing but the conversations that are now under way, I understand, are between the Irish Jam Manufacturers' Association and the fruit growers' committee of the NFA.  This ought not and will not preclude other interested growers from bringing their problems to the Department.  We shall be glad to hear from them because we want to assess the precise position in regard to the supply of various kinds of fruit.  Certain types of fruit are in oversupply and gooseberries are among them.  I think there are only 30 acres of gooseberries in the country but even at that jam manufacturers do not require them because they have enough since last year.  In the past two years there have been bumper crops of blackcurrants and the jam manufacturers' requirements are consequently a great deal less than they would otherwise be. Prior to that, freelance growers were able to get prices per ton far in excess of the contract price, up to £250 per ton.  Because of the bumper crops of the last couple of years these freelance prices have collapsed to a pretty disastrous level.  The whole question of the regulation of the supply of soft fruit for jam manufacture needs to be examined closely.  Conferences are now taking place between jam manufacturers and the growers and after that the Department hope to talk to the growers themselves.  I hope that some more <Col N="35" /> rational system of supply and acceptance will be evolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to ask another question.  The Minister has not answered my question as to whether jam was being imported here&mdash;not pulp or fruit but jam&mdash;and that it is flooding the market.  Is the Minister not aware that jam manufacturers will not under any circumstances take any fruit except strawberries for which they will not offer a price but say they will fix a price later on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that in regard to freelances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, to the contract growers.  For gooseberries they are offering slightly more than half what they paid last year.  Does the Minister not realise that at this stage much of the fruit is coming on the market and will be destroyed unless sold, some of it within the next week or so?  Does he realise that this means absolutely wiping out the fruit growers unless something is done about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the conversations between the growers and the Department which are about to take place is precisely to prevent any such wiping out of fruit growers.  I accept that the soft fruit supply situation is fraught with a great many difficulties. I think the Deputy is aware of the position in regard to blackcurrants and gooseberries.  The Department can only assist in the matter of quantitative quota restrictions on the import of fruit pulp and are doing that.  If there are other means by which the Department can assist the soft fruit growers in the maintenance of their market we shall be glad to avail of them.</P>

      <P>Might I put it to the Minister that apart from minor information like the total number of applications received or agreed by the Minister, there is no information available as to the criteria he operates in the granting or refusing of applications for increases?  We do not know what profits <Col N="38" /> he allows, what costs he allows, apart from the 7 per cent, and generally we do not know whether he accepts the prices and incomes recommendations of the NIEC in relation to price control and price surveillance.</P>

The last matter to which he referred, the NIEC recommendations, is quite apart from the margin of profit allowed or such items as he mentioned previously.  It refers to the structure by which surveillance is kept on prices. That is a very different matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will make a statement on recent contacts between his Government and the British Government on the Northern situation and whether he will make a comprehensive statement on the Government's response to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach having regard to the deep concern of our people about the tragic events in Northern Ireland since last Friday, if he will state the steps being taken by the Government to allay public anxiety, to contribute towards the restoration of peace and harmony in that area, to provide relief for any person who may have suffered and to make representations to the British Government and the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take together the two private notice questions addressed to me.  The situation in the north is one of extreme gravity.  As I explained in statements on Saturday and Sunday, the Government are keeping in touch with the <Col N="53" /> situation and will continue to deal with it in such a manner as will best serve the interests of all the Irish people.  In particular, the Government have been in touch with the British Government.</P>
      <P>I think that all Members of the Dáil will agree&mdash;especially, as the views of the Government and the Opposition Parties are well known&mdash;that it would be unwise for me to make a comprehensive statement or for Members to debate this matter when there would be even the slightest risk of anything being said that would exacerbate the situation in the north.  In present circumstances, I consider that by reserving comment in this House&mdash;at least, for the time being&mdash;on the issues involved, all Members of the Dáil would best promote the restoration of peace and harmony in the north.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I remind the Taoiseach of a suggestion that came from this side of the House during the debate last October that there would be a consultative committee of the Dáil appointed in order to keep in touch with the situation in the Six Counties? The Taoiseach will also remember that on that occasion he did not turn down the proposal but promised to consider it.  I should like therefore to ask him if he would consider the establishment of a consultative committee of the Dáil for this purpose.  May I further ask the Taoiseach, in view of the information available to all of us in regard to the highly dangerous situation in the north and the probability&mdash;and I stress &ldquo;probability&rdquo;&mdash;of a reaction to these events in the Twenty-Six Counties, a reaction which poses a direct threat to our democratic institutions, is the Taoiseach able to assure the Dáil that he is in a position to safeguard these institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that a consultative committee of this House be set up, I have in fact given this matter some further consideration and I do not think it would be appropriate in the present circumstances.  However, I would be prepared to maintain close contact with the Leaders of the two Opposition Parties.  I would be prepared to meet <Col N="54" /> them together on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, to keep them fully informed and to receive their views as they feel free to give them to me and that these <i>ad hoc</i> meetings should be as frequent as the situation would require.  With regard to the probable reaction in the Twenty-Six Counties, as the Deputy suggested there might be, I am not in any way apprehensive about the probable reaction here, but I am satisfied that if there were such there would be no danger to our institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach therefore satisfied that the events in the north will have no repercussions here in the Twenty-Six Counties?  May I say further I would still press for the establishment of a consultative committee of the Dáil?  I certainly do not reject out of hand the Taoiseach's proposal that there should be consultations.  If this is the only method by which we can get information I am sure it will be acceptable, but may I again ask the Taoiseach whether or not he is satisfied that the events in the north will not have repercussions down here?  I think there is evidence of repercussions now.  How small or great they will be we do not know.  That is one of the reasons why I believe there should be this consultative committee of the Dáil representative of the three parties in order, as we stressed in October, to ensure that there would be a Parliament united in a policy of peace as far as the Six Counties is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any question of there being any disunity in this Dáil as regards peace in the Six Counties.  I cannot say definitely that incidents that might take place on one side or the other of the Border will not have repercussions, but I have no apprehension whatever that repercussions of the nature suggested by the Deputy as would prejudice our institutions are likely to occur. I still would be prepared to meet on a regular basis the Leaders of the two Opposition Parties to give them as much information as I can, to discuss the situation with them as it develops, to discuss any unexpected happenings at short notice.  I think that is a reasonable suggestion in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach at this stage reconsider the suggestions which have come from this side of the House and which now appear to be endorsed by all sides of the Opposition, that an all-party committee should be established, that it is a more satisfactory method of dealing with the situation than <i>ad hoc</i> meetings between the Taoiseach, Deputy Corish and myself? While not pressing at the moment for a debate, I take it that if circumstances warrant it, time will be provided for a discussion on the situation up there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not satisfied that an all-party committee would be appropriate.  I believe the suggestion I have made would be the best one to meet the situation.  As far as a debate is concerned, I do not think a debate would be appropriate at this time.  If at a later time I consider it appropriate, I shall be prepared to consider giving time for it, but I doubt if it will arise in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not considered such a meeting but, as I have indicated to the House, we have been in close contact with the British Government to ensure that our views are fully made known to them and that any action we feel ought to be taken should be at least considered by the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that part of the Taoiseach's reply which dealt with a debate, would the Taoiseach not agree that when this matter was debated in the Dáil the overwhelming majority of the statements made in the Dáil on this subject were statements which had a great degree of responsibility and which, on the whole, moved towards calming public opinion, and that the statements which had a tendency to exacerbate the situation have been made outside this <Col N="56" /> House as well as in it by people who cannot be prevented from making statements in any case; that therefore there is no serious reason to prevent the Dáil from debating this issue, and to suggest the Dáil is incapable of discussing this issue in a responsible way and that it cannot discuss an emergency before this nation is to tend to bring the Dáil into contempt before the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that in the slightest degree.  I will accept that the debate we had some months ago was an objective one and one that, perhaps, contributed much to calm the situation and certainly clear the air among people on both sides of the Border as to what the general attitude here was.  With regard to statements being made outside, nobody can stop these statements being made but I would suggest that if similar statements were made within the House, and they could well be made in the course of the debate, that they could induce similar kinds of statements from the other side of the House, other than the side on which the statements were originally made.  As well, the debate we had on the last occasion took place at a time of relative calm in the Six Counties.  I do not think anybody could suggest that such relative calm now prevails and there is a further consideration that the British Home Secretary is at present in Belfast investigating on the spot the position himself. I think it would be inappropriate that we should discuss the matter at the same time as, or reasonably near to his visit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week we were discussing the question of our application to the EEC in conjunction with the applications made by the other countries who are also anxious to join the Community.  I was comparing the remarkable similarity between the approach of the main Fine Gael speakers and the main Fianna Fáil speakers.  However, perhaps, it was not so remarkable.  At present the application has been formally made and the opening speeches have been made by our Minister as well as by the other Ministers.  That being so, this debate takes on a different complexion entirely because now we are talking about something which is in the course of operation.</P>
      <P>From the very start we in the Labour Party were of the opinion that it was a mistake that this Government should give the impression that they were terribly anxious to become members of the EEC.  We had statements such as &ldquo;If Britain does not go in, we will go it alone&rdquo; and this was followed up by other people who said that if Britain go in we will have to go in, and various views in between were expressed.  If Ireland is to become a member of the EEC the people of this country should be made aware of what is likely to happen.  They should be made aware of the things that will favour them and of those which will be very much against their interests.  It is only fair to ask the Government about these points.  The Government have given the impression that if Ireland enters the EEC the people of the country will benefit enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A former leader of the Labour Party, the late Deputy William Norton, used an expression which could not be improved upon as a description of what is likely to happen.  The late Deputy said: &ldquo;It would be an excruciating experience for the Irish nation.&rdquo;  That is exactly what the position is today.  I was listening at 1.30 p.m. to the news bulletin and to the statement made by Deputy Dr. Hillery, Minister for External Affairs.  The Minister has gone back to saying that we are prepared to go in and we have no qualms about it.  Perhaps it is a good thing to put on a bold face.  Some members of <Col N="62" /> the present Government have become expert at putting on bold faces under very severe circumstances.  It is not fair to tell the people that everything will be fine and that all our worries will be over once we go into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>A number of people have spoken at length during this debate.  I do not wish to drag out the discussion too long. The late Deputy Seán Dunne said that if a person had something to say he should say it in a quarter of an hour or else he should go out into the middle of a field and say it to himself. The late Deputy said that after he had made one of his long speeches.  I will try to make my remarks as brief as possible.  The position as we see it is that if Ireland enters the EEC we will be guaranteed the same prices for our products as those guaranteed to countries already in the EEC.  Irish farmers and industrialists are being told things like this which are so much in their favour.  They are not told that the agricultural advisers in the EEC are trying desperately to find some way of cutting down on certain products which are being overproduced.</P>
    <P>I spoke before about butter and milk products.  On 31st March last there was overproduction of one million tons of butter in the EEC.  We have overproduction of butter here and have been attempting to get rid of it by almost giving it away to various countries and by subsidising it heavily to our best customer, Britain.  In fact, the EEC countries seem to be in the position where they cannot give it away.  This may seem odd in a world in which there is so much hunger. Milk and milk products are already overproduced and they represent our main products in agriculture.  The solution to this problem of overproduction in the Common Market is being considered.  The Mansholt solution is to pay a subsidy for the slaughter of milch cows.  I do not know how the Irish dairy farmer would react to that suggestion.  At one stage the Fianna Fáil Party were responsible for the slaughter of calves but apparently the slaughter of cows is now being considered.</P>
    <P>Beet and wheat are both main crops <Col N="63" /> in this country.  They are not required in the Common Market because there is overproduction of these crops. France in particular has tremendous overproduction of wheat and the only way they can get rid of it is to use the European Agricultural Fund to send it outside the Common Market. General de Gaulle negotiated a deal with Red China a few years ago.  A large amount of wheat is being given to them at the expense of the other countries in the EEC.  There is a shortage of beef in certain parts of Italy.  It is said that the Italians do not eat the type of beef we produce. There could be a change in the type of beef produced.  That might be a relatively simple matter.  The farmers of this country cannot live on beef production alone.  The sale of beef to the EEC will not keep many people on Irish farms.</P>
    <P>The Irish type of farming does not appear to be acceptable to the EEC because of the size of the farms.  Some people believe that an economic farm should consist of at least 200 acres. Mr. Lemass, when Taoiseach, said he thought that was a good idea, but nobody ever explained to the small Irish farmer how the small farms could be converted to large 200 acre farms. That could only be done by getting rid of many small farms.  People have been leaving agriculture at the rate of 12,000 per year over the last few years.  Apparently, in the EEC the numbers will be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald interrupted me the other evening when I was talking about how difficult it would be to increase the farms and said I did not approve of group farming.  I pointed out that I had not heard anybody in the Fine Gael Party saying he was anxious about the introduction of group farming but I admit that Deputy Tom O'Donnell mentioned it on a number of occasions.  I did not hear anybody in the Fianna Fáil Party talking about group farming.  Recently, if anyone started talking about group farming somebody, particularly in Fianna Fáil, would come out and brand whoever made such a suggestion as being some type of communist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Under the terms on which we are going into the EEC, we must increase substantially the size of the farms and get rid of the people working on the farms.  I was in agreement with the Minister for Lands when he said that the solution to the small farm would be to have part-time farmers with part-time jobs elsewhere.  This is completely contrary to what is suggested under the terms of the EEC membership. Deputy Seán Flanagan and myself will find ourselves out on a limb if the people go headlong for the idea of the 200-acre farm and have no regard for those who must get out of the small farms.  There are many large farms in my area.  Some of them have been broken up.  Very few people have been left with 200 acres.  The man who got 150 acres was supposed to have given away a lot of land in the west of Ireland.  Perhaps he did.</P>
    <P>Most of our farmers have between 20 and 50 acres of land.  In congested areas there are many such farms and it is difficult to make a decent living on them.  The suggestion that it would be possible to implement the EEC proposals even in County Meath does not appear to me to be feasible.  Yet we say we are prepared to accept everything the Common Market countries demand and the treaties of Rome and Paris without further consideration.</P>
    <P>What will be substituted for the dairy industry and for the wheat and beet industries?  Probably the beef industry will be able to look after itself but the number of persons required on farms will be greatly reduced.  We must ask the question whether this means there will have to be a big upsurge in industry.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned in the House that a number of Deputies had a discussion with a group of French industrialists who were interested in starting industries here.  While the industrialists were prepared to agree that up to now the Government here had been offering certain facilities to industrialists by way of grants, tax remissions and a plentiful supply of labour, they pointed out that if we enter the EEC we will not be able to continue those concessions and, therefore, <Col N="65" /> there is no point in industrialists coming here with a view to gaining them.</P>
    <P>The industrialists I mention were not prepared to accept the assurances some members of our party tried to give them that that was not the case and that the concessions could continue for some time.  Some of them were honest enough to suggest that the Common Market idea now, contrary to what was some years ago, was not to improve regions where there was much unemployment by setting up industries. They found this was not working out and that the only solution was to take the unemployed to areas where work was available &mdash; to the cities in Germany, France and Belgium.  They did not seem to think there was any hope whatever of improving regions such as the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of our members asked if there was not a possibility that special provisions would be made for certain areas and suggested the subsidisation of transport to areas far from the centre.  The industrialists' reaction was that it would not be profitable to bring raw material into remote areas, manufacture the goods and transport them back to the centre.  They stated that if we claimed entitlement to subsidisation of transport to remote areas, Central European countries would be entitled to subsidisation for sending products to Ireland.  Some people apparently have convinced themselves that the EEC is Utopia and that if we rush headlong into the Community we will not have any further worries. However, our party have gone into this matter very fully and we are convinced that it will be, as Bill Norton said, &ldquo;an excruciating exercise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The question of whether our industries will stand up to free trade competition is another matter which must be considered.  If the people who are leaving agriculture and those who are unemployed could be given jobs in industry there would be something to be said in favour of entry.  However, it appears industry is having a difficult time with the operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and if we cannot stand up to this agreement how can we deal with complete <Col N="66" /> free trade with such industrial giants as Germany and France?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there is no unemployment in the EEC.  I was interested to read in the <i>European Newsletter</i> of 19th June, 1970, an article entitled &ldquo;Activities of the Community in 1969&rdquo;.  In this article there was a statement made by a M. Girardin who expressed concern at the increase in unemployment, particularly among the younger age group.  He urged the setting up of adequate vocational guidance centres and he deplored the lack of co-ordination between vocational guidance and occupational training. The article might have been written about Ireland, in fact, it was about the EEC, where everything is supposed to be perfect and where it is suggested there is no unemployment.</P>
    <P>I was in Brussels last year and was surprised to find men who I thought would be employed in industry working at what in this country would be termed menial tasks.  They told me that there was no other work available for them.  This also gives the lie to the suggestion that there is no unemployment in the EEC.  Therefore, we should be very careful from the point of view of agriculture and industry before joining the Community.  This morning the Minister for External Affairs stated that we were prepared to accept everything.  To me, his words meant that we were all square with any of the countries either in the Common Market or now applying for membership. I only wish he was right.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk here and elsewhere about the negotiations or what must happen with regard to Ireland's entry into the Common Market. Let me again refer to the <i>European Newsletter</i> of 26th June, 1970, where reference is made to the opening of negotiations.  It states:</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the opening of negotiations with Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway are now completed. The opening session will take place at the Kirchberg, the European Centre in Luxembourg on Tuesday, 30th June.</P>
    <P>Firstly, M. Harmel, President of the Council and Foreign Minister of <Col N="67" /> Belgium will speak and then M. Rey, President of the Commission. Mr. Barber for Britain, Dr. Hillery for Ireland and the Danish and Norwegian Foreign Ministers will reply.  It is expected that the other Foreign Ministers of the EEC Member States will then make statements. It should be underlined, however, that the negotiations proper will be conducted from a common standpoint with a single spokesman for the Six.  The first working session with the British will take place on July 21st and with Ireland on September 21st, both in Brussels.</P>
    <P>So much for the reply that was given here today by the Taoiseach, to the effect that it did not matter whether the two discussions took place together &mdash;that the negotiations in both cases would take place at the one time.</P>
    <P>The arrangements made for the negotiations and for the entry of Ireland into the Common Market have been kept from the people.  I consider this a mistake, particularly because of the fact that before we can sign any agreement we must have a referendum to decide whether the Irish people are prepared to accept the terms of reference with regard to our Constitution. Are we prepared to make at least seven different changes in the Constitution? Some people have said that the constitutional changes suggested were not of great importance.  Let me refer to one of the changes.  In Article 5 of the Constitution it is stated that we are a free democratic republic.  This must be changed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The other countries have their own problems and will meet them in their own way.  They have their own constitutions.  Some of them have written constitutions and others unwritten constitutions but we have something written into our Constitution and it is definite that, before we go in, the people of this country must vote in favour of changing at least some of the Articles of our Constitution.  These are Articles 5, 6.2, 15.2, 34.1, 34.4.6º, <Col N="68" /> 29.5.2º, and 29.6.  There are quite a number of others that may also have to be changed.  Let us remember that this country would not join NATO because we argued that as long as the British Army occupy six of our counties, we could not enter into a military alliance with them.  Things have not changed and like the Oath long ago which was something nobody could accept and which eventually became an empty formula, this is apparently being swallowed hook, line and sinker by the republicans of this country who, apparently, are prepared to change their colours from day to day.</P>
      <P>My objection to it all is that it appears to me&mdash;some people may like this &mdash; that we are to march into Europe under the Union Jack and be proud of doing so.  It seems to me that from being a free, sovereign and democratic nation, we are becoming a province of the British Empire.</P>

      <P>I suppose Deputy Burke's question was fair enough but it is one that a number of other countries will also have to answer, for instance, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and, if you like, Spain and Portugal, the latter two not counting very much according to my book.  We believe that there should have been another approach.  Some people said that association would be of no use because we would not have a vote but even if we have a vote what difference will our tiny voice make against the giants? If we had association instead of full membership it would be very much better for all of us.</P>
      <P>Mr. Barber said today that Britain would not be prepared to join if the price was too high.  As I see it, that is the only thing that might save us but apparently the price does not matter where we are concerned.</P>
      <P>Again, I should like to refer to a matter I mentioned last week and on which the Taoiseach took me to task. I asked the Taoiseach why on earth he, on behalf of Ireland, had done something which no other country had done or had been asked to do and that was to guarantee to take part in the defence of that portion of Europe that is in the EEC.  The Taoiseach said, not to a statesman but to a French Journalist, that we were prepared to accept all commitments, including defence.  Certainly, he got more publicity than if he had made the statement behind closed doors.  However, I asked him why and his reply as reported at column 2089 of the Dáil Debates of Thursday, 25th June, 1970, is very interesting.  I quote:</P>
      <P>My statement was made in the context that we would be part of a Community the defence of which Community would be in our interest.</P>
      <P>I then asked the Taoiseach this question:</P>
      <P>On reflection, would the Taoiseach not agree that it was rather foolish to guarantee to participate in a military <i>bloc</i> when, in fact, he was not asked that question and there was no necessity to give such a guarantee before applying for membership?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> I have said that many times since then.</P>
    <P>Obviously, he realised the error of his statement.  Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien has been criticised by some people who claim to know everything.  These people say it is all cod that we might be sacrificed in the event of nuclear war.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald suggests that it is necessary to build a third force in the world.  Obviously, the third force to which he was referring was the EEC.  Of course, if we talk about a third force we are talking about a military force.  If he was talking, as I think he was, about America on the one side with the Russian bloc on the other side and Europe in between, we would be helping to make up this third force. I cannot understand why we should be interested, after being neutral for so long, in taking part in whatever holocaust is likely to come but, according to the Taoiseach's statement, it is quite clear that we would be prepared to provide soldiers if necessary in the defence of Europe.  In passing, I should mention that, although our Army recruiting campaign has been in operation for about 12 months, we have a smaller Army at the end of those 12 months than we had at the beginning because, I understand, while more than 1,000 have joined, more than 1,500 have left.  Therefore, the only way in which we could help in so far as policing is concerned would be by conscription and we all know what the Irish people think of conscription.</P>
    <P>We were very glad when we succeeded in getting rid of the British from our ports.  Are we now to supply nuclear submarine bases for the defence of Europe?  Nobody is keen to bring this aspect to the attention of the public but it is only right that this matter should be aired in this House.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear two or three speakers suggesting that by joining the EEC we would in some peculiar way get our own back on England and that by rejoining France and the other allies in Europe, we would be doing away with the Border.  That is a proposition that I could not work out.  Therefore, I should like to hear that point being developed.  It is true that if both we and the United Kingdom of Great Britain <Col N="71" /> and Northern Ireland join the EEC, the customs border between the Six Counties and the Republic will disappear, but that will not mean the ending of Partition.</P>
    <P>According to my interpretation of the Treaty of Rome one of the terms upon which new members are accepted is that existing barriers remain.  What we are saying is, in effect, that if we go into the Common Market, as things stand, we will no longer have any interest in removing the Border; our interest will be confined to the Twenty Six Counties; the other Six belong to Britain and they can stay there.  I regard this as a crime and I believe this is an attitude the Irish people will not be prepared to accept.  I also believe that something should be done to straighten this out before it is too late.</P>
    <P>Again and again, the people running the Community have insisted they are not prepared to change the Treaty of Rome.  One either goes in under their terms or one stays out. They are perfectly entitled to uphold their own Treaty.  I think it is more than foolish for a new applicant to try to give the impression that conditions can be changed and that, by going in, one can get them changed in some peculiar fashion.  I honestly believe that had an effort been made by applicants as a group before making application to have certain things changed there might have been some hope, but going in as, apparently, we are doing, crawling in after Britain, takes the ground completely from under our feet and I cannot see how we can hope to negotiate on certain matters at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In view of what has happened it is rather a pity, I think, that the Government did not decide, before pushing application the whole way, to have a discussion here between all-party representatives. This is a matter upon which there should have been a full Committee of the House, a Committee to examine all aspects thoroughly before application was finalised.  This is something on which no one party has all the wisdom.  However, the Government decided to got it alone.  The Government <Col N="72" /> can have two views on the same thing.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions Government speakers have made the case that certain things were being done because we were preparing for EEC membership. Then we come up against something, which may not appear important to the Government but is very important in the connotation of the EEC. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value has been accepted.  There is no discrimination against the sexes. Yet, in this country, not alone have we not adopted that principle but we have, in fact, thrown overboard something upon which Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Finance, insisted last year; he insisted that the same increase should be given to men and women alike.  That was going some way towards achieving what the EEC want. What happened this year?  We have a situation in which talks have almost broken down because the County Managers Association refuses to agree to equal increases for men and women. Is this not making a joke of the suggestion that we are preparing for EEC membership?  I am satisfied the Minister for Health must know that this change is taking place.  This demonstrates clearly that we want to have it both ways.  There are some who may regard this as a relatively unimportant matter but, if we go into the EEC, we must be prepared to accept the terms laid down and this is one of them.</P>
    <P>We have in this House &mdash; I do not want to embarrass anybody &mdash; a situation in which those who take notes of what we say here are discriminated against on a sex basis: if you are a woman you get £7 a week less than a man.  If that is not discrimination against the sexes, you tell me what is. This discrimination will have to be done away with.  This is work of equal value.  If the Government are really serious they should straighten this out. Deputy Haughey started on the way, but he did not continue.  For one reason or another he did not, apparently, give instructions to have this carried right through.</P>
    <P>Before we go any further, before this matter is finalised, as, I believe, it will be finalised, next September or <Col N="73" /> October, before a referendum is put to the people, the onus is fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government &mdash; let it be this Government, or any other Government &mdash; to explain fully to the people the effect on them of entry into the EEC.  Mr. Barber yesterday evening said there was no hurry to finalise the application as he believed negotiations would take some years.  Whether that is right or wrong, the people should be told what will be in their favour and what will be against them and what changes in the Constitution will mean.  It would be very foolish to put a referendum to the people without giving the people the full knowledge to which they are entitled.  It would serve the Government right if they were defeated on such a referendum, after finalising the negotiations, if they are not honest enough to come out into the open and say that there are snags as well as advantages and tell the people what the snags are.</P>

Those are matters which I should like to see debated in every parish in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking about the Common Market for a great number <Col N="75" /> of years.  I believe our manufacturers, especially those efficiently organised, who have visited factories within the Common Market countries, should be able to say what products we can compete with and what products we cannot compete with.  The Government can only do certain things.  I know we have advisers in our missions abroad and we also have advisers in the various Departments here who can brief us on the implications of joining the Common Market.  However, I should like our industrial leaders to visit the Common Market countries and find out if their specific products will be able to compete with the same products in the Common Market countries.  I should also like our farm organisations to visit those countries with a view to telling the farmers of Ireland the benefits they can derive from certain aspects of their industry. All those are matters which concern us vitally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully a few moments ago said we were going to sell our birthright, that we would be just another part of a federated Europe, that we would only be a small unit.  On the other hand, he said that under the Treaty of Rome the territories of all countries were protected.  He cannot have it both ways.  I cannot see anything happening to the Common Market countries from the political point of view.  Germany is Germany; Italy is Italy and all the other countries enjoy their own particular brand of freedom.  They have their own individuality. I do not see anything about them all adopting the Italian language or the German language.  As far as I can see, in meeting representatives of the Common Market countries, nothing like selling their birthright is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this matter concerns the impact on the economic life of this nation.  What will be the effect of entry?  How will our economy be affected if Britain go into the Common Market and we do not?  I should like our people to discuss those problems.  I could extend the terms of reference but I am confining my remarks to two points.  It is easy enough to be glib but this is a very <Col N="76" /> serious step so far as our country and our people are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain whether there will be unemployment if we go into the Common Market.  I should like trade unions and other similar organisations to visit the Common Market countries for the purpose of having discussions with their fellow workers and deciding for themselves the benefits that can accrue by membership of the EEC.  Some Deputies seem to think that they can cure all ills by a speech but such, unfortunately, is not the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully made the point that unemployment in certain parts of France was bad and that the workers were transferred to Germany.  That may or may not be the case.  I consider that as a matter for further negotiation.  I have no information about France, Germany of Italy doing anything to injure their respective economies.  If I had evidence that they were doing that, it would be another matter.  However we have no evidence at all.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the 200-acre farm.  The group farming system went on in Ireland in the days of my grandfather, and long before that.  I was born on the land myself.  The neighbours always helped each other with the hay, the oats, and so on.  Such co-operative farming could be developed and extended by goodwill. The present Minister for Lands, Deputy Seán Flanagan, made a very sensible remark when he said that Irish small farmers were not able to carry on unless subsidised in some other way.  They received help from their kith and kin working abroad or working in some industry in the local twon or working on the roads, the bog or some other place.  Co-operative farming is an aspect of Christian neighbourliness.  Farm machinery is very expensive and it lies idle for quite a lot of the time.  Under the co-operative system, that expensive farm machinery could be used on five or six farms to the satisfactory benefit of all concerned.  Those are the points I was concerned with.</P>

      <P>Lamb is 16s a pound in France: we should be glad if the French would purchase much more lamb from us.  This nation has survived the turbulence and the trials of many centuries.  I have faith in our people and in their ability to compete successfully within the enlarged Common Market.  Thank God, we have got rid of the ignorant, denigrating approach to the general standing of the person we know.  We belittle our own and make much of the stranger whom we do not know and of whose ability and character we have no knowledge.  Our people are distinguishing themselves all over the world.  On another debate, I mentioned that our manufacturers are selling successfully in various foreign markets. They are the great heroes of our times. In the 1840s, 1850s and 1860s the Irish people showed their ingenuity to survive under shocking circumstances. Just consider the journey to Australia in sailing ships which took seven or eight months to reach their destination. We were a wonderful race to survive the many miseries of our past.</P>
      <P>Membership of the Common Market will be a challenge to us.  I trust our Government and the Irish people will take up that challenge.  I do not wish to see our people misled or left under any misapprehension in regard to what lies ahead.  I wish for a cool, calm and deliberate debate on what is the most important step any Irish Government has taken since the foundation of this State.  I shall not go into details because I feel that these are matters which concern those involved in our various industries, whether they are trade unionists, manufacturers, farmers or fishermen.  I believe these details would be better followed up by these people.  On the broad principle we are concerned about going in, what it means to us and if we do not go in what it will mean to us.</P>

      <P>Our options in so far as entry to the EEC is concerned are next to non-existent, once Britain decides to enter.  However, there are many steps the Government could take to overcome the adverse effects, particularly in the industrial sphere. This debate, in so far as the Government are concerned anyway, should centre around the things to which they can point over the last nine years as an indication of their ability to protect our industrial sector from the adverse effects that entry into the Common Market will have for them.  To my mind, the past nine years have not shown the type of action that is necessary.</P>
      <P>One finds it difficult to understand the thinking behind the suggestion that we should seek some form of association with the EEC countries.  This seems to arise from the belief that the type of competition that exists within it is something from which we should shy away.  It would be far better for us to have a vote and a voice in the Community than trying to make arrangements with it from without and depending upon some people, whose interests might even run contrary to ours, to assist us in those negotiations. The White Paper on membership of the EEC is a most depressing document. Our preparations for entry in the industrial sector have obviously been directed by people who are not completely aware of the techniques of modern industrial management, and these techniques are the tools that have made the United States and the European Economic Community the advanced and prosperous communities they are.</P>
      <P>The Community we seek to enter now is a far more sophisticated one than the Community of 1961 and it will be an enormous task to prepare the industry of this country for entry into EEC by 1975.  The feeble attempts at preparation indicate that successive Governments do not understand the factors involved in the EEC industrial environment and, therefore, their priorities are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two principal areas where we have fallen down are planning and labour relations.  In so far as planning <Col N="80" /> is concerned, opportunities for EEC membership can only be exploited by means of long-term and short-term planning coupled with Common Market research.  The planning can be carried out successfully only by fully qualified, experienced personnel using all the modern techniques of operational research and investment analysis. All these things have been available and for years have been used by the very people with whom we will be in competition in the near future. These techniques have been used by all these successful industries in the United States and in the EEC with the exception of very small backyard workshops.  If our state of preparation is an indication of the number of people in responsible positions who believe that this type of planning is necessary and vital for the success of our industry in the years ahead then very big changes will have to take place in a short time.</P>
    <P>Basically, two levels of planning are necessary&mdash;company level and Government level.  Every company employing more than 30 people will be affected by entry into the EEC.  Each company should make a detailed analysis of the following factors&mdash;the effect of tariff abolition within the EEC and of the imposition of common tariffs on imports from non EEC countries; the possibility of exploiting a greatly increased market.  Plans should be made to procure the necessary resources to enable them to exploit the opportunities that EEC membership provides. These plans should, of course, be reviewed and up-dated at monthly intervals and the efficiency of these plans should be determined by comparison with actual results.  The Government should ensure that all companies undertake a professional approach to planning and development and, having regard to the fact that they are providing tax concessions and incentives for that work, the Government are in a position to ensure that that situation is brought about.  The alternative to it is to allow incompetent management to jeopardise the livelihood of thousands of workers and to squander taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>It is felt that this type of planning is <Col N="81" /> best carried out by company personnel as they are most familiar with the factors involved.  Any company that has not got personnel capable of this type of work is dying.  The factors involved in this type of planning very from day to day and it is important that plans should be updated when any significant changes occur.  This can be done easily and cheaply by means of computer. Smaller companies should be encouraged to become computer minded by availing of the facilities offered by computer bureaux in this country.</P>
    <P>So far as the Government are concerned, they have a serious obligation at this critical stage to see that effective planning is carried out by all companies and that the opportunities afforded by the EEC are exploited to the full.  They have an obligation also to see that everything possible is done, if we are to enter the EEC, to protect the jobs of all our people.</P>
    <P>The Government's role should be the supervision and co-ordination of the preparation and planning carried out by individual companies, broad planning for each industry and the implementation of training and retraining programmes based on estimates obtained by professionals, detailed physical planning, the implementation of programmes designed to provide houses and services in the growth areas. The standard of Government planning must be equally as high as that required for individual companies.</P>
    <P>The present state of Government planning can only be described as inept because their plans are not comprehensive. They do not cover all sectors of industry and they are not supplemented by the plans and programmes of individual companies.  There should be blueprints for development.  They should set out in detail the targets to be achieved each year by each industry, and they should be updated at monthly intervals if necessary.</P>
    <P>Government aid should be given only to the firms that are likely to achieve attainable targets by virtue of their efficiency.  It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of a high standard of professional management in every sector of our industry if we <Col N="82" /> are to enter the EEC.  The standard of planning is the basic criterion of good management.  The standard of management of many of our industries is not up to EEC standards.  It is not reasonable to expect that it could be.  Our industries were developed generally on a protectionist basis as very small units in an essentially rural environment. They have been assisted from time to time by State grants.</P>
    <P>The industries in the EEC, on the other hand, have had highly skilled managements for a long time.  They have successfully completed post-war reconstruction.  The economic departments of the Governments of these countries, in close co-operation with the industries, had by the end of the 1950s not only ensured post-war reconstruction but had also made the EEC such a success that even the sceptical and insular British were prepared to jettison the remainder of their Commonwealth and Empire and become a member of the Community.</P>
    <P>At this stage, the Community must be regarded as one of the most sophisticated, successful and progressive economic communities in the world.  The essential point is that the main industries in the EEC have been adapting themselves to reach their present position over the past 20 years, starting with the Steel and Coal Community. In spite of their long tradition of highly skilled management and good labour relations, in spite of their vast resources of trained technicians and skilled labour, in spite of the able assistance of the various Governments in providing first-class services, many of these companies received serious jolts as a result of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>This is the type of Community into which our industries will be pitch-forked. They will be expected to reach the same standards of efficiency within five years.  This is more than a real challenge.  Entry into the EEC constitutes a national emergency.  The outcome will be successful in the industrial sector only when there is perfect co-operation between management and workers.  Indeed, in the years ahead they cannot be treated as separate entities in any industrial enterprise.  The unions now have considerable power <Col N="83" /> and they must share the responsibility. Management must keep the workers informed of the company's economic position and the decisions taken, and they should be able to justify the decisions to their workers.  This should not present a great problem to any management worthy of the name.</P>
    <P>In West Germany, where they have outstanding labour relations, it is no coincidence that the rights of workers' representatives to take part in decision making is guaranteed by law.  This legislation should be examined by the Government here.  Unfortunately there is a tendency to copy what happens across the water.  The Minister for Labour, whoever he may be, should look around in other quarters and see what we can copy with benefit in these areas.</P>
    <P>The greatest task facing Irish industry at the moment is the solution of the problem of bad faith between management and workers.  This can only be solved by participation by workers in managerial functions.  We have had a Minister for Labour for several years but we are getting further away from a solution every day.  An investor invests his life savings in a company and, quite rightly, has a say in the direction of that company.  Surely a worker who invests his life's work in a company should at least have an equal influence on the direction of the company?  This is the type of philosophy that is necessary if we are to progress in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We realise that entry to the Common Market is the most important step in the history of the nation since the foundation of the State.  The EEC can bring a great increase in the standard of ilving of our people and an enrichment of their lives by closer contact with the cultures of Germany, Italy, France and the Low Countries, superimposed on our own culture.  These opportunities can be availed of only by a competent, dedicated and just Government. Down through the ages Irishmen have left their mark on the culture of Europe.  Surely we will not be found wanting in this or in future generations?</P>
    <P>Entry into the EEC will provide increased <Col N="84" /> outlets and increased prices for agricultural products.  Beef, mutton, lamb and bacon should all increase substantially in price.  I should like to hear what the opponents of the Common Market have to offer to the Irish farmer as an alternative to our entry. For years people in industrial employment have been paid and rewarded at a higher rate, a rate far in excess of what the farmer could hope for.  In the Common Market the pendulum will swing in favour of the farmer and give him an income more in keeping with that of urban dwellers.  We can hardly deny these opportunities to him.</P>
    <P>Initially the Irish farmer will benefit by increased prices.  Costs may rise over the years without a corresponding increase in prices which would eventually upset the intial gains.  This is something which the Government and the farming organisations will have to keep a close eye on.</P>
    <P>Entry to the EEC offers good prospects for expansion in the sheep industry because initially mutton and lamb supplies will be insufficient to meet the demands of an enlarged Community, assuming New Zealand is kept out.  The immediate consequences of entry for this country could be disastrous on account of falling sheep numbers.  Some years ago we had 5,000,000 sheep.  The target for 1969, as set out in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, was close on 7,000,000 but in actual fact the number of sheep in the country last year was less than 4,000,000.  We shall have to get away from this type of planning and programming if we are to survive in the EEC.  Here is a situation where, in 1964, certain targets were set but no detailed examination took place in the intervening years to ensure that the target figures were achieved.  It is essential that whatever plans are made in any sector they should be checked at regular intervals and if the targets do not look like being reached corrective measures should be taken.</P>
    <P>The authors of the Treaty of Rome consider the Steel and Coal Community and the EEC as steps towards ultimate European unity, economic, political and military.  The object of this unity is to ensure that the Western <Col N="85" /> European countries have an equal voice in shaping their own destinies and the destinies of other countries with the major power blocs of America, China and Russia.  They foresaw the necessity for unification 20 years ago and each year the accuracy of their foresight is being demonstrated.  Who knows what power blocs will be formed before the end of this century by the emerging nations of Asia and Africa?  Who knows what unjust treatment these individual power blocs will hand out to European countries who do not have a power bloc of their own?  History is full of examples of the fate of countries unable to defend themselves.  The attitude of powerful nations to defenceless ones has not changed since recorded history began.  There are no grounds for thinking that there is a future in this world for a defenceless nation.</P>
    <P>Europe is the fountainhead of civilisation as we know it.  The leading political philosophers in Europe started a movement towards unity 30 years ago.  That intensely patriotic Frenchman, General de Gaulle, when his country was occupied by her traditional enemy, said that the main objectives of the French people after the war should be to build a Europe united from the Atlantic to the Urals.  The EEC is not merely a trade pact designed to increase the wealth of a few.  It is the greatest European movement since the Roman Empire or it is nothing.  We are now asking to play our part in that movement.  We should be thankful that we have our independence and are able to play our rightful part in the building of that Europe.</P>
    <P>Partition cannot exist in the Europe as foreseen by the authors of the treaty because of the supranational nature of their ideals.  Barriers to trade and labour must go and military alliances must remain.  We will be left only with a partition of minds and hearts made more formidable by the events of the past few weeks.  Just government will in time move these partitions and the actions of misguided men will be seen in perspective.  Our economy will be under considerable danger in the EEC but we shall have splendid opportunities.</P>
    <P>To my mind the Government should <Col N="86" /> publish another White Paper setting out fully and objectively the likely results of Britain's entry to the Community with Ireland remaining aloof. The Government have a duty to explain to the people the consequences of this situation in terms of the likely drop in employment, wage levels, exports and growth rates.  It is essential that the issues of the referendum required to change the Constitution are not confused with emotional clap-trap and with people whose only aim is to further the interests of extreme political views.  There are those on the extreme left and on the extreme right who feel they could exploit for their own partisan interests the severe hardships which would result from our exclusion from the EEC.</P>

    <P>I welcome the opportunity of being able to speak on the EEC.  I admit that the occasion has arisen rather more quickly than I had hoped.  I should have liked a little more time in which to brief myself more adequately. I will therefore confine myself to one or two aspects of our proposed entry to the EEC.  It is a great source of gratification to me to know that Ireland <Col N="87" /> is recognised in Europe as a nation.  Ireland, unfortunately, is not the nation we should all like it to be but in respect of the 26 Counties at least it is accepted now that we are a nation.  The position heretofore had been that the three-quarters nation&mdash;physically speaking; in spirit and in heart we are at one&mdash;had not been accepted because we live under the umbrella of the oppressors who were at the same time our neighbours.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the attitude of the Labour Party who would suggest to us that this is an attempt by us to sell our republicanism.  The Labour Party mind is not easily understood.  I shall revert to the question of our independence in a moment. In a situation in which they claim to be the progressive party, the leftist party, and would point to us as the conservative party, it is rather strange that they make the case that in the present EEC deliberations we should have remained aloof as have Spain and Portugal rather than follow the dictates of this House.  I find it difficult to associate that type of recommendation and opinion with the progressive, leftist Labour Party.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the benefit of independence is that you are free to move in whatever direction you think best for yourself and your country.  There does not seem to be any unanimity in the Labour Party.  At times some of their speakers remind me of a dog chasing crows; they chase after everything.  On the one hand, they say we are going in and next moment they are advising us about what our attitudes should be in the negotiations.  At Question Time today they showed a very lively interest in how the negotiations were being handled.  Where <i>ab initio</i> you take the view that you should not be there at all, the onus is on you to make the case for not being there and I think that to a certain extent you forfeit the right those who say you should be there have to be concerned about every move in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the logic of what the leader of the Labour Party said as regards how small a voice we would have in the European community.  He <Col N="88" /> makes the case for our abstention on the ground that our voice would be so small that we should not bother.  We would only have, at ministerial level, one in ten representatives and at Commission level, one in 14.  Apart from saying that a small voice is better than no voice, I point to the Labour Party itself.  That representation compares fairly well with the representation of the Labour Party in this House.  Would the Labour Party argue that because they constitute only about one-tenth of the membership of the House they would be better off outside it?  I do not accept that is the position: the Labour Party voice is welcome here.  By and large, members of the Labour Party have something to offer to the House and certainly, whatever they have to offer they have a much better opportunity of offering it here and advancing whatever cause they claim to advocate than if they were not here.  The same applies to our involvement in the EEC.  Surely it is preferable to be there and try to change things and guide events in our own interest and protect ourselves in matters which may seem disadvantageous rather than to be outside barking at the moon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, as reported at column 1679 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    <P>Remember&mdash;and again we stressed this from these benches before&mdash; what we are concerned about is people and work in this country.</P>
    <P>I hope he would not suggest they have a monopoly of the interest in the people in this regard.  Surely he would not contend that members of the Fianna Fáil Party and members of the Fine Gael Party have no interest in the people?  It is because of that interest that we seek to advise them where their interest lies.  Where there is in Europe a scheme or plan for European countries to come together, we must say we think that it is in our interest to take part in this plan.  Here it must be said and repeated that this plan did not emanate from the capitalists and big businessmen but from some of the most socialist-minded people in Europe.  It is a plan aimed at pooling the resources of Europe for the best advantage of all, a plan aimed at producing a situation where the stronger <Col N="89" /> powers in Europe would think kindly of the poorer countries.  I would not make any apology here for what might be termed political consideration: this is a plan aimed at building into Europe a unity that might, and probably would, be necessary in a situation in which the world of the future might be divided into three or four camps. At least Europe would be one.</P>
    <P>For too long the people of this country have lived in the shadow of our neighbour and because of that a certain inferiority complex and a certain frustration have grown into the Irish people.  We have a lackadaisical, indifferent attitude to nationhood and, perhaps, we have an indifferent attitude to work and to our neighbour, an attitude which, extraordinary as it is, was not corrected until our people moved to other countries where they found themselves meeting new challenges and being called upon to use their imagination, their ingenuity and their inborn talents.  It was only then, apparently, that the true Irishman was revealed. Now that Ireland is being called upon to make a contribution to Europe and indeed to the world, I hope the true spirit of the Irishman will again manifest itself and that we shall be able to accept and meet the challenges involved.</P>
    <P>While I would question very much Deputy Tully's reference to the excruciating experience of our entry to Europe, I am not without thinking we shall all be obliged to work somewhat harder than we have done to date. Deputy Godfrey Timmins did refer to the attitude of management towards workers.  I would include the attitude of workers towards management.  In this whole field of labour relations the worker should understand that if he is being paid what is considered an adequate wage he has a duty to give a fair return; and if he is giving a fair and honest return there is a duty on the employer not merely to reward him in financial terms but to honour the importance of that worker to the industry.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking&mdash;and perhaps it is not the popular thing to say&mdash;I have an idea that in Ireland we enjoy a <Col N="90" /> standard of living which is not entirely in accordance with the amount of effort we put into the nation.  Whether it is at the professional or other levels, of the teacher, doctor, lawyer, labourer, carpenter, shoemaker, or bricklayer, we have reached the stage where we have begun to take life rather cushily, not realising that the more comfortably somebody else takes it the greater is the price that must be paid in the end. Hard work, whether it is physical or mental, has its reward and in EEC terms it should be borne in mind that we shall be competing with the traditions, the capabilities and the ingenuity of countries which, especially in the matter of industry, have a much longer tradition than we have, and that we must be on our toes.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Tully, in envisaging that situation, would describe it as being excruciating I disagree with him.  Every normal human being is happiest when he is working.  There may be times when the less attractive side of the being would prefer to idle but ultimately, whether we are working for a wage or a salary, we shall be unhappy until we are convinced that the employer recognises the contribution we are making and does not merely recognise us when something has gone wrong as invariably is the situation in some of the bigger industries.  I have been talking to men who are employed in worthwhile industries and who are in receipt of good wages.  They tell me they feel rather lonely in these big industries because the only time they are recognised is when a machine breaks down or when something goes wrong. Ordinarily the managing director or any other director walks by and is utterly oblivious of the fact that such a man works in the firm.  However, when something goes wrong this unfortunate man becomes the most important person.  We cannot have it both ways.  There have been seminars and all classes of research and study into this, but common sense should tell us that in every person there is a craving for importance which cannot be satisfied in terms of money alone.</P>
    <P>In the matter of culture&mdash;and when I talk about culture I mean what we believe in, how we think about things, our philosophy and our attitude towards <Col N="91" /> life generally&mdash;I would hope that Ireland would have a worthwhile contribution to make to Europe.  I see in this an opportunity never offered to us before for the advancement of the Irish language.  In speaking about the advancement of the Irish language I am not solely concerned with communicating our thoughts to one another through that medium but about the language as the stamp of a culture which is not in any other part of Europe or the world but which could well be copied by other countries having regard to our attitudes towards life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about one matter on which I must admit to having certain reservations, the extension to this country of the principle of equal pay for equal work.  I understand that the regulations and the conditions in the EEC are not fixed or immutable, and that we might hope for some little change here.  We should make it known in Europe that we do not concede that economic factors alone are those that matter.  I would be concerned to ensure that we would not exhort or encourage housewives to leave their homes because of economic factors.  Already, in other countries where there was encouragement and exhortation in that direction the folly of that is now presenting itself.  In Russia and indeed in parts of England they have now realised that, apart from the social aspects, it is not the best approach economically.  Instead of the mother leaving the children to the nursery school and depriving them of care and love, it would be far better if the mother were subsidised and asked to remain at home.  I appreciate that there will be occasions when it will be desirable for mothers to leave their homes but we should not lose sight of the fact as far as young people are concerned &mdash;and we are more concerned about young people&mdash;that they can withstand physical hardship, hunger and deprivations, all of which can presently be rectified, but the one thing which can never be rectified is deprivation of maternal love and consideration when they are young.  If equal pay for equal work means that we are going to deprive children of that natural and desirable <Col N="92" /> love which can never be replaced by any other human institution and if we feel we are going to find ourselves in an area where that principle is adopted we should at least present the Irish side of the picture, plead our case and show how we have discovered that where there is family unity, where the family is not disrupted, there is invariably happiness and advancement and where there is disruption of family life, there is the reverse.</P>
    <P>I promised initially that 15 minutes should be sufficient for me to speak and as I have exceeded that length of time I ask Deputy O'Donnell's pardon or Deputy Dr. Browne's pardon, whoever is next to speak.  As often happens when one rises to speak one finds other thoughts flitting through one's mind.  I will conclude by saying that I am happy that Ireland as a nation now has an opportunity of expressing her voice in Europe.  I should like to express my faith and confidence in the ability of the people, the workers, to meet the challenges and in the competence of the farmer to adapt himself, to co-operate and to meet the challenges.  If we find ourselves in Europe, as I hope we will, Europe will benefit from our voice and I hope that we will benefit from involvement in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel obliged to say how much I admire Deputy Tunney's contribution to this debate. I was greatly impressed by his assessment of the necessary philosophical attitudes and outlooks and his hopes for the role which Ireland can play and the contribution she can make in the EEC, spiritually as well as materially. It is something which has been largely overlooked in this debate and something which I should dearly like to follow up but now, the fourth day of this debate, the general picture regarding the EEC and its implications for Ireland have been well and truly discussed and it is time the debate went from the general to the particular. Some attempt should be made to analyse the effects of EEC membership on the various sectors.  I therefore propose to examine the implications for transport, for power and for tourism.  There are other sectors of the economy which I should like to <Col N="93" /> examine also but there is a limit to what one person can do.</P>
      <P>Transport will be a key factor in determining the competitiveness of our industrial and agricultural exports in the EEC.  This is so for obvious reasons, the main one being that because of our geographical position we will be further away from the heart of the European Market than any other member country and our exporters will have to bear a higher element of transport costs than most of their competitors on the Continent of Europe.  It is vitally essential that every means should be explored to bring about a reduction in transport costs and to improve the speed and reliability of our various transport services both internal and with the Continent of Europe.  In view of the importance of transport to our progress in the EEC I must confess that I felt disappointed and frustrated by the rather casual manner in which the White Paper dealt with the question of transport.  Indeed, very little information of value in regard to transport is contained in the White Paper.  The chapter on transport is remarkable for its brevity and shows a failure to realise and appreciate the implications of EEC membership for Irish transport. I would in particular criticise the failure in the White Paper to emphasise the key role of transport in enabling us to survive, prosper and trade competitively in the EEC.</P>
      <P>When I was so disappointed at the manner in which the White Paper dealt with this important topic my first reaction was to leave it so.  I felt that perhaps there was nothing of great importance to the transport aspect of this question.  I began to make further inquiries and to do some research.  In the absence of any official information in the White Paper, I contacted various national transport operators in this country.  I contacted the semi-State bodies, CIE, Aer Lingus, the B &amp; I and Irish Shipping Ltd.  I also contacted the Road Transport Association, which is a trade association representing the road hauliers in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I had been very critical of the manner in which the White Paper had dealt with this important topic of transport, <Col N="94" /> I was greatly impressed at the manner in which the State-sponsored bodies had been keeping abreast of international developments in transport. I must thank the people in those bodies to whom I directed many different queries recently, for the prompt and courteous manner in which they dealt with my various queries.  The Federation of Irish Industries made a valuable contribution to the study of transport <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.  They issued a publication in 1968 entitled &ldquo;The implications for Irish industry of the EEC transport policy&rdquo;.  This was a report of a study group set up in August, 1967, by the Federation of Irish Industries to examine the implications for Irish industry of membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to give a detailed account of the history of transport in the EEC since the Treaty of Rome was signed.  It would take hours to do so.  I doubt if I have the ability or the training necessary to analyse and assess the progress which has been made up to the present.  From the massive documentation available it is possible to identify certain important guidelines in relation to transport and to identify the implications for Irish transport.  The Treaty of Rome, in articles 74-84, called for the adoption of a common transport policy by all member states.  It is of significance to Ireland's application that the Treaty of Rome exempted air and sea transport from its provisions and from the common transport policy.  The formulation of a common transport policy, and the various steps which have been taken up to now within the EEC in the field of transport, do no include air and sea transport.  They are confined to surface transport, that is, road, canal and waterway traffic in Europe. Because the four new applicant countries are maritime countries, each with a considerable interest in air transport, provision is being made to bring air and sea transport within the scope of the common transport policy in the EEC.  This is of great significance to Ireland because, while in our negotiations we will have to accept the various rules, regulations and decisions which have been made over the past decade in relation to surface transport, <Col N="95" /> we are fortunate in that we will be in at the beginning in the formulation of proposals for a common transport policy covering sea and air transport.</P>
    <P>On 5th June of this year a meeting of the Council dealt with transport questions.  At the end of the session the Council took note of a communication adopted the day before by the European Commission as to the action which should be taken in the sphere of air and sea navigation.  Various factors influenced the Council in making their decisions.  First of all, four essentially maritime countries, all of which have large interests in the sphere of air transport, have applied to join.  In addition, the various steps which had been taken in relation to surface transport were finalised at that particular meeting on the 5th June.  Our negotiations will start and we will have to accept the rules.</P>
    <P>There are numerous rules and regulations which have been made in relation to transport.  Many of them will have a vital bearing and a considerable effect on transport, particularly for CIE and for private hauliers in this country.  There are rules and regulations in relation to road haulage.  A number of the decisions which have been made by the European Community will have important repercussions on the Irish road haulage industry. The restrictive legislation relating to road haulage which we had in this country under the Road Transport Act, 1933, will have to be considerably liberalised.  I noticed on today's Order Paper that the Minister for Transport and Power has announced his intention of introducing a Bill to liberalise road haulage.  We know that the liberalisation measures proposed in this new Bill relate mainly to the haulage of livestock.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the various documents in relation to road haulage in Europe it would appear that a degree of liberalisation much greater than that envisaged in the new Transport Bill will be necessary.  It is not possible to say yet to what degree road transport will have to be liberalised in this country. Under the common transport policy in the EEC Irish road hauliers will have the right to travel through <Col N="96" /> various countries in the EEC and, likewise, foreign road hauliers from the Community countries will have the right to come in here.  There will not be, in the foreseeable future, unrestricted rights of entry to this country. The position at the moment is that trucks and lorries from one EEC country can enter another EEC country, or can travel through a second country on their way to a third country.  There is free movement within the Community up to a point.  There is a system of Community licences in force which limits the number of vehicles from any one country which can haul goods to another country.</P>
    <P>I presume when Ireland becomes a member of the EEC we will be entitled to a certain number of haulage licences permitting Irish road hauliers to transport goods from Ireland to Britain and the Continent.  However, an Irish haulier will not be allowed to pick up goods in, say, France and deliver them to a point in that country. I do not know how many licences Ireland will be allowed.  Looking at the number allocated to existing EEC countries we find that the present scheme provides for the issue of 1,200 licences allocated as follows: France and Germany, 286 each; the Netherlands, 240; Italy, 194; Belgium, 161; Luxembourg, 33.  Apparently the number of licences issued is in proportion to the representation of the country; taking the fact that Belgium have 161 licences and Italy 194, it is reasonable to assume that Ireland will probably get a fair deal.</P>
    <P>There are other decisions that have already been made and are in force in the EEC in relation to road transport which we will have to accept. There are rules in relation to the working conditions of drivers of trucks and vehicles.  From an examination of such conditions for transport operators in the EEC and in Ireland, it appears the EEC conditions are much more rigid.  For example, the number of driving hours per day a driver is permitted in the EEC is nine, whereas in Ireland it is eleven hours; a driver in EEC countries is allowed to drive continuously for four and a half hours while in Ireland it is permissible to drive continuously for five and a <Col N="97" /> half hours.  Under EEC regulations a driver must keep a log book and proper recording must be done.  In fact, a major discussion is now going on within the transport committee of the Community regarding the fitting of various devices to vehicles to record time, the amount of mileage covered, the hours operated non-stop and so forth.</P>
    <P>In relation to the weights and dimensions of vehicles, the maximum size of vehicle in the EEC is substantially larger than that permitted in this country.  Therefore, hauliers and road transport operators will be permitted to use larger vehicles and this will have the effect of reducing transport costs. However, this heavier vehicular traffic will create serious problems for our roads because they are not suitable for such traffic.  It is interesting to note that under the domestic transport policies of France, Germany and Britain, these countries are making an effort to siphon off as much heavy traffic as possible to the railways.</P>
    <P>In this country there is complete freedom in the matter of transport rates &mdash;it is decided between the customer and the haulier&mdash;but under the common transport policy of the EEC all rates will have to be published and there will be little room for private bargaining.  Various regulations have been drawn up to operate the system of tariffs and charges for road transport. I do not wish to go into detail on this point because the system is highly technical.  In this system of forked tariffs a range of charges is fixed and it is not permissible, except to a 20 per cent margin, to go outside these fixed rates.  It is interesting to note that our road tax for heavy vehicles is much higher than the rates obtaining in Great Britain and Europe.</P>
    <P>There are several other regulations applying to road transport but I have picked out those which appear to be the most important so far as Ireland is concerned.  In so far as it applies to surface transport, the common transport policy of the EEC has implications for the Irish transport industry.  Therefore, it is important that we be aware of the regulations and the decisions that have been taken.  I have had discussions <Col N="98" /> with the Road Transport Association, which is the organisation looking after the licensed hauliers in this country, and that association have made a thorough study of the situation so far as it applies to Irish hauliers.  The Bill the Minister for Transport and Power has announced he will shortly be introducing is of great interest now and perhaps it is appropriate that this Bill should be introduced at a time when our negotiations for entry into the EEC are commencing. I have not seen the provisions of the proposed legislation but I assume it will have regard to the regulations and implications of the EEC transport policy.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few comments about the implications of the common transport policy for rail transport in this country.  I realise this is a dull subject but it is of vital importance. These are practical facts and they will have a vital bearing not merely on those whose livelihood depends on transport but to the future competitiveness of our exports.  The common transport policy has met with considerable difficulty in regard to the problem of the railways.  Indeed, the controversy which has surrounded CIE policy during the past decade in relation to the closure of railway lines and so on is not peculiar to Ireland, because rail transport has been a controversial topic in all European countries during that time.  Very often people are inclined to be critical of CIE because of the fact that although they are being subsidised by the Government, they continue to incur losses but it is interesting to note that there is no European railway that is paying its way.</P>
    <P>I have taken the trouble in recent weeks of examining the returns for rail transport from 17 different European countries.  Some of these countries although highly progressive and industrialised have their problems in relation to their railways and these problems are considerably greater than those we have had here.  Their railways, too, are incurring annual losses and these losses are proportionately greater than the losses incurred by our national transport system, CIE.  It is also interesting to note that CIE are among the top <Col N="99" /> bracket of railways in Western Europe which receive the least amount by way of subsidy.  In other words, the £2.6 million which we voted to CIE last December under the 1969 Transport Bill is, by comparision with other European countries, a relatively small subvention.</P>
    <P>The intention with regard to railways in the European Community is that they will be financially autonomous by 1972.  The most important provision of the common transport policy of the EEC in so far as it applies to railways, and the one which has the most important implications for Ireland and for CIE, is the provision which calls for the normalisation of railway accounts. This may seem a highly technical term. I recall dealing at considerable length during the debate on the Transport Bill of 1969 with this question of the normalisation of the accounts of CIE.</P>

      <P>While I might appear to be going away from the point, what I am saying is of vital importance to the future of CIE&mdash;a body employing 20,000 people in this country.  I have spent the past four weeks doing a detailed study of all aspects of the common transport policy of the EEC.  Our negotiators are at present in Brussels and we shall be confronted with the rules and regulations of the common transport policy of the Community.  Surely I am permitted to speak about this situation, or am I to be permitted to speak only on matters we have been talking about for the past ten years?  I am sorry if I appear to be contrary in relation to this matter but I considered that it was time somebody had a detailed look at a particular sector of our economy which <Col N="100" /> might be affected by EEC membership. I assure you, and I think you will agree, that what I am talking about is very relevant to the whole question.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to be contentious in any way, I have here among the many documents that I have obtained from the EEC Information Office here in Dublin, through the kindness of Mr. Denis Corby and his staff to whom I am greatly indebted, an information memorandum dated March, 1968.  It is headed &ldquo;Common Transport Policy&rdquo; and deals with the normalisation of railway accounts.  This document points out that the railways in Europe must be financially autonomous by 1972.  I was beginning to relate this provision to what I had already said in relation to the railways of Western Europe, all of which are losing a substantial amount of money. How is it proposed that this be done? I went on to point out that this would be done by means of what has come to be known as the normalisation of railway accounts.</P>

With all due respect, I submit that the common transport policy is relevant to this discussion, that common transport policy being the policy formulated and implemented within the European Economic Community in the years since the Treaty of Rome was signed.  These are the rules and regulations which will have a vital bearing on our national transport system, on Coras Iompair Éireann, which employs 20,000 people.  They are very worried about this.  I have studied the matter at great length and, perhaps, I am overconscientious, but I trust I will be permitted to refer very briefly to this question of the normalisation of accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No place outside Europe.  In so far as a common transport policy affects CIE, the White Paper, of which I was quite critical, lists in a general way certain implications which the common transport policy will have for CIE.  The blanket subsidy we have been giving to CIE under the 1964 and 1969 Transport Acts will no longer be permissible, but the Exchequer in each country will be allowed to compensate the railway companies for any services which come within the category of public services&mdash; in other words, services which do not pay their way.</P>
      <P>Normalisation of accounts will mean that the commercial operations of the railway company will be separated from the non-commercial ones.  Under the regionalisation policy of the EEC it will be possible, I believe, to obtain certain concessions for Ireland so far as transport is concerned.  We will be allowed to continue uneconomic transport services if they fulfil certain criteria.  If our application is accepted, CIE will have to step into line with other European countries so far as the presentation of its accounts is concerned and its commercial operations will have to pay their way.  This new accounting procedure has important implications in relation to staff and conditions of employment.  I had intended to spell out the implications but, in view of the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, I cannot do so.  I do not dispute the Chair's ruling but, when one is thrown off beam in a highly technical matter of this nature, it is most frustrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that the common transport policy does not apply to air and sea transport but provision is being made to include air and sea transport within the scope of the common transport policy.  This will have certain implications for Ireland, for our national airlines and for our shipping companies as well.  Where our airlines are concerned it is very difficult to assess the situation properly.  Certain guidelines have already been laid down for the formulation of a common air transport <Col N="103" /> policy.  One of the specific aims of the common air transport policy will be the improvement, first of all, of the Community's air network.</P>

This will be <Col N="104" /> the major theme of what I have to say. The change since 1939 in direct taxation is outrageous in the way it has increased the burden on the people I would call the ordinary workers. Those are the men who today have an income of £1,000 a year or less, equivalent to £200 a year or less in 1939, which was about the income a craft worker had at that time and is still about the income the average craft worker has in this community.</P>
    <P>This Bill reminds me of the Finance Bill which came in with the introduction of PAYE.  It was of enormous size, consisting of 25,000 words.  The White Paper explaining it consisted of 3,000 words and, although the Minister took in section by section in his Second Reading speech, all he had to say on it was contained in 2,000 words. One of the significant things about a Bill of this size, a Bill of 25,000 words, is the amount of work it creates for other people.  I remember quite well that when I protested in the Seanad in 1959 about the Finance Bill introducing PAYE it seemed to me&mdash;one is closer to the officials there than in this House&mdash;that the then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, who is an old friend, was extremely sore with me. I said at that time that the Revenue Commissioners were creating an awful lot of work for other people to do. I am afraid this happens continuously. There are certain people in the community such as chartered accountants and other accountants, who have no objection at all to the Revenue Commissioners creating plenty of work because they are remunerated for it.  Those things could be simplified without a great deal of work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe in his speech on this Bill told us that if the workers did not behave themselves we would be pricing ourselves out of business.  I quote from the Official Report, Volume 247, column 1365:</P>
    <P>We must try to get the people to see that by making unnecessarily large claims for increases they may put themselves in an uncompetitive position in relation to other countries and eventually we may put ourselves out of business.</P>
    <P>By a coincidence the previous week <Col N="105" /> I was in Kilkee and the president of the International Federation of Chemical Trade Unions said: &ldquo;You know you will be told this kind of thing.  You will be told that you will put yourselves out of business if you insist on getting increased wages&rdquo;. Of course, we were constantly told this. I fear, however, that we will put ourselves out of business by the enormous increases in direct taxation which are imposed on the people by the vast amount of money which the Government are taking from ordinary incomes. This is effective in the sense that it increases GNP because you are including it both ways and you push up the amount of the gross national product.</P>
    <P>When I looked at the amendments of the Income Tax Acts, contained in sections 5 to 16 of the Bill, giving minor concessions, I asked myself the question: &ldquo;How many people paid income tax in this country in 1969-70 compared with 1939-40?&rdquo;  Strangely enough I found great difficulty in getting anything more accurate than what I had in my head, which was that in 1939-40 there were about 180,000 paying income tax in this country and, unless I am mistaken, in 1969-70 close on 700,000 people paid income tax in this country, that is to say, four times as many.  Is anybody going to suggest to me that four times as many people are so much above subsistence level in this country compared with 1939-40 that they now have to pay income tax?</P>
    <P>The comparison I want to make is between 1939-40 and 1969-70 because of what is supposed to have happened in increases in income compared with pre-war.  I did some research in the reports of the Revenue Commissioners, which reports, however informative they may be to the Revenue Commissioners, are very uninformative to the public.  I will not go into this matter in detail although there would not be any difficulty in doing it.  There are all kinds of tables which are of no significance to the ordinary person. The report itself is a miserable document from the point of view of genuine information: the 46th Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners for the year ended 31st March, 1969.  The reports of the Irish Land Commission <Col N="106" /> should be used as a pattern.  I notice that, in the last report, they have a number of rather high class graphs about wines imported, consumption of spirits, and so on.  There are no graphs about income tax or about the relative weight of taxation on the people. There are particulars about mineral hydrocarbon light oil, and all kinds of things of that sort, but nothing about income tax.  Let me fill in the picture.</P>
    <P>From 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939 the rate of income tax was 4s 6d in the £.  Earned income relief was one-sixth and the personal allowance was £125 a year.  Therefore, the first £150 of earned income was free of income tax. What is the equivalent amount today of £150 in 1939?  It is £750.  As a matter of fact, if one wanted to be difficult about it, one could prove a case that it is more than £750, but let it go at that.  In other words, Is in 1939 would buy as much as 5s would buy today.</P>
    <P>In 1939, a half rate applied to the first £100 of taxation after that on a single man.  That is to say, 2s 3d in the £.  So that, on his first £100, he paid £11 5s in tax, i.e., he paid taxation of £52 10s or £55.  Today, on £500, what would he pay?  He would pay&mdash;make the same allowance of one-quarter&mdash; £125: i.e., he would pay 2½ times as much.  This applies with even greater force to married people and people with a number of children.</P>
    <P>A single man on £200 in 1939 paid £5 a year tax.  He paid it at the rate of sixpence in the £: the reference is the 17th Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners, page 134.  We have moved on quite a bit since then&mdash;from the 17th report to the 46th report: the next one will be the 47th report. We have moved on quite a bit in the way we tax the people.  The sixpence in the £, with £5, pre-war which he paid on his £200 would be equivalent to £25 today.</P>
    <P>What does the single man on £1,000 a year pay today in income tax?  He pays £150 a year, i.e., three-twentieths of his income so that, in real terms, he pays six times as much today as he did in 1939.  Let nobody tell me that workers are paid proportionately so that they are no worse off than they were in 1939.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> I did one other piece of comparative work.  I thought I would have a look at the comparison between a man on £1,000 a year&mdash;the other side of the coin for the kind of financially conservative Government we have here in certain respects; most unconservative in other respects considering the remarks today about devaluation of the Irish £&mdash;and the amount of tax a man on £5,000 a year pays.  He pays £1,500 a year in tax, i.e., three-tenths of his income.  He pays £40 a year in surtax but that was not worth taking into consideration because of the activities of the present Government party over the past three or four years in relation to surtax.  The case made for altering the surtax rates in recent times would not hold water for a moment i.e., that we were anxious to get back experts from various parts of Britain to work here.  From what I know of business, I do not think salaries here are so non-competitive with British salaries that we could not have maintained a fairly stiff surtax.</P>
    <P>In paying £1,500 out of his £5,000 he pays three-tenths of his income, i.e., 30 per cent of his income, against the unfortunate man, by comparison, on £1,000 a year who pays 15 per cent of his income on tax.  In other words, the man on £5,000 a year does not pay any surtax at all.  He is still essentially on the same rate of tax as the man on £1,000 a year.  The rate of £150 on £1,000 is 6s in the £ and the standard rate of tax at present is 7s in the £ so that we are back where we started.  It is the same thing.  As I can see it, the man with £5,000 a year really pays no greater taxation worth talking about than the man with £1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to another angle of this as regards, again, the man on a medium income, i.e., the man subject to tax.  If I might mention the Revenue Commissioners again.  I shall mention them many times during this speech because the care of these taxes is assigned to them in section 38 of the Bill which reads:</P>
    <P>All the taxes and duties imposed by this Act are hereby placed under the care and management of the Income Tax Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> This is an unusual section to have in these Acts though doubtless it has a well-documented history but it is quite unnecessary.  However, there it is and it did give the Revenue Commissioners a certain kind of status that certain other people in the community did not have.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the turnover tax which was doubled.  The first thing I want to say about it is that the Minister, in his Budget Statement, said that he would get £20 million from doubling the turnover tax although the White Paper estimates of receipts and expenditure had shown £23 million for the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  Therefore, he will not get an extra £20 million, as he was pretending in his Budget Statement: he will get an extra £23 million and, of course, this extra £23 million could have made a worthwhile contribution to a matter we shall be debating later on&mdash;I do not want to develop it&mdash;namely, a proper increase in children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Let us take the turnover tax.  Again I looked at the Revenue Commissioners' report and I noticed that they have various headings in the column dealing with turnover tax.  Strangely enough they have not got butchers' shops in a separate heading.  They showed grocers as just under £2 million and they showed grocers and public houses together, that is, the kind of public house that is also a grocery shop, as under £1 million.  I assume if we take grocers' shops and butchers together, and take them as being a sum of £3 million a year, the Minister, as an alternative to spending the money on children's allowances, could have taken the turnover tax off food.  He would not do that.  The trouble about the Fianna Fáil Party is that when they do a dirty trick if one talks about it and attacks it he is a dirty fellow.  It is not the Fianna Fáil Party who do the dirty trick.  They are not dirty at all or smeared or anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen it time and again over 20 years.  One is rolling oneself in the dirt if one dares <Col N="109" /> to mention something the Fianna Fáil Party do.</P>
      <P>This £3 million, on the basis of the figures of the last report of the Revenue Commissioners, would have enabled the Government to take the turnover tax off food.  If they had done that, my speech today would be very different. I would have to be honest and speak out the truth.  I look at this turnover tax as it applies to food and I cast my mind back, though I may be regarded as going into antediluvian periods, to Adam Smith and his four canons of taxation.  I notice the modern books leave them out but this does not mean I think any the less of them.  Thought is different from engineering or from any from of modern activity, say computers. Pure thought can be as good with the Greeks as it is with the most modern German philosophers.  The canons of taxation, according to Adam Smith 200 years ago, were equality, certainly, convenience and economy. These words, of course, like all words can have different meanings just as there are certain words in this Finance Bill which are defined as meaning something which they do not mean, an Alice in Wonderland kind of stunt. Let me look at those four words.  The turnover tax has no equality in it, no matter how one interprets equality. It has no certainty in it because one cannot tell what the price of food will be and one cannot tell, if one is a young person, what the size of one's family will be.  There is, from the point of view of the Exchequer, economy in it and there is an element of convenience in it from the point of view of the purchaser of any article, that he pays at the time he makes the purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When turnover tax was first imposed there is not the slightest doubt that it had a most disastrous effect on the cost of living.  It is doubtful if it did not have a more disastrous effect this time. Only last night I was with a group of grocers, an independent group of retail people in this city.  They told me that many of the ordinary retailers with one shop had not bothered with the tax when it was 2½ per cent.  They paid it up and left it at that.  However, when it became 5 per cent they just could not bear it and they had to collect it.  This <Col N="110" /> is not a concoction of mine.  They told the Minister this when they saw him before the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of 4½ points in the cost of living in the three months from the middle of February to the middle of May, I suppose the greatest increase ever in a period of three months.  The Central Statistics Office had abandoned the new index they had set up in 1968, I suppose under pressure, I do not know, it showed such a huge increase between November, 1968, and February, 1969, of 3.3 points, 1.1 per cent a month, but they are back on it again because the 1953 index would show such a colossal increase that it had to be abandoned and the 4.5 per cent increase in the cost of living which was shown in the figures which were sent out to us by the Central Statistics Office, I would say was primarily due to the operation of this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>There are several things wrong with it.  First of all, it applies quite unfairly because a shop providing labour pays the tax on the cost of the labour so we have an additional reason for the success of the supermarkets.  They do not provide labour services for the community and, therefore, quite apart from the kind of conditions many of the bigger ones get, the way they squeeze the manufacturers and the kind of terms they get and the way they collect their money in cash, they are a kind of bank with no depositors and the ordinary small retailer is being grilled.  I am of the opinion that, as has been happening recently in the United States, the wheel will turn and people will feel they want to go in to their grocer and say: &ldquo;Good morning, Tom,&rdquo; and he will help them himself and talk about the matters of the day.</P>
    <P>There are many real difficulties about this direct and indirect taxation on this massive scale.  Perhaps the Minister will remember, because I remember very clearly the Minister talking about a 7 per cent increase in incomes at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis on a Sunday and two days later, on the Tuesday of that week, the Labour Court awarded a group of workers a 23 per cent increase.  I would say the Minister noted that.  I certainly did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me examine this 23 per cent on the basis of what I have been saying about income tax. Income tax will take over a quarter of that 23 per cent, 5s 3d in the £, because every person who got that increase is now paying income tax.  If one knocks 5¼ per cent, almost 6, off 23, one is left with 17.  Then knock 5 per cent off the 17 because it does not matter whether they appeared to put on the extra 2½ or the 5, it was, in fact, somewhere between 5 and 6 per cent that went on prices for the reasons I have given. It did not matter who was operating it. Everybody did put it on because one cannot pay 5 per cent to the State without collecting it.  One knocks another 5 per cent off the 17.</P>
      <P>There is no point in stating what the Central Statistics Office told us about the year 1958.  What the workers got in real terms was about 13 per cent. Would anybody argue that this would compensate for the futher inflation the Minister is so proud of, judging by some of his remarks in answer to questions: it is everywhere around us; therefore we are in this inflationary game.  The 13 per cent they got in real terms would not even compensate them for the increase in their cost of living since the last round of wage increases, let alone allow them to make provision for the further increases in costs every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the famous Budget introduced by the former Deputy MacEntee on 1st April, 1952, there has been no period of one month in which there <Col N="112" /> has been a greater increase in the cost of living than there was in the month of May of this year.  In 1963, the effect of the introduction of the turnover tax was not noticed immediately because the traders did not quite know how to handle it, but by now they know it pretty well.  Deputy Maurice Dockrell raised a point on which I support him very strongly, that is, that our method of getting in revenue for the State is inequitable.  The burden of taxation falls on too few people.  It is about ten or 12 years since one of the then Revenue Commissioners said to me: &ldquo;There is legal and illegal evasion of tax&rdquo;.  As Deputy Dockrell pointed out, the farmers are now completely free of income tax.  This party stated what we had to say in our policy document. We would require farmers with a valuation of more than £100 to submit accounts, the same as other people. This certainly was a liberal point of view.  No effort would be made to bring a man with a valuation of under £100 into the income tax net.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell also pointed out the disincentive effect of this high rate of taxation if you have to employ somebody on overtime.  This is an old problem.  It was most forcibly pushed home by the coalminers in England immediately after the last war.  Having worked four days in the week, they refused to work any more because it was not worth it.  Deputy Dockrell went on to say that we are still following a method laid down by the British. He is correct from the philosophical point of view, but I do not think he is correct in practice.  In fact, the farmers in Britain are liable to income tax, whereas our farmers are now legally free of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Donegan mentioned death duties.  There used to be a theory in this country which was expressed by many people&mdash;the city engineer of the city of Dublin was one man who held this view very strongly and when the former Deputy John A. Costello was Taoiseach he also held it strongly&mdash;that if we abolished death duties, big numbers of wealthy people would come in here and this would be of great advantage to the country.  For a long period of years the yield from <Col N="113" /> death duties was £3 million a year. I was looking at the figures recently and the yield is now £8 million to £9 million a year.  That is because real property is valued in quite a different way from the way it used to be valued, and has also increased in value.  It is also true that our estate duties are lower than those in Britain but they are not as low as they were when Sir Chester Beatty came here.  He was attracted to this city by the low rate of our death duties.</P>
    <P>I remember that when a member of the Guinness family who lived in Knockmaroon died leaving an estate of £3 million, the estate duties paid here were £1.3 million.  If he had died in Britain the estate duties would have been £2.4 million.  In other words, those who were bequeathed these moneys would have been left with £600,000 in Britain whereas in this country they were left with £1.7 million.  I am not so envious of people that I would wish to see an estate of £3 million reduced to £600,000.  It is becoming a question as to whether these huge increases in death duties are not pressing too severely on people. A great deal of money is taken out of businesses of moderate size &mdash; for example a business worth £100,000&mdash; and this creates cash difficulties for the people running the business.  It creates problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher spoke about section 17 dealing with tax deductions from payments to sub-contractors.  The drafting of that section is most peculiar, to put it mildly.  The section runs into two pages and there is no provision in it for the cost of materials.  It states that the principal shall deduct from the payment and pay to the collector tax at the rate of 7s in the £ on the amount of such payment.  That is on the gross amount of the payment.  The sub-contractor can avoid being penalised in this fashion by getting a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. This is not exactly my idea of equitable behaviour on the part of the Revenue Commissioners or anybody else.  I certainly have great sympathy with the point of view put forward by Deputy Gallagher that it penalises savings.  That is not its purpose, of course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Its purpose was stated by the Minister. It is so innocent.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is an anti-avoidance measure designed to deal with another recent development, namely, the system of sub-contracting in the construction industry, or &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; as it is commonly known.  These sub-contractors have, for the most part, been escaping tax because of the difficulty of identifying them. The measure now being introduced will require tax to be deducted at the standard rate from payments made to these sub-contractors unless the Revenue Commissioners authorise otherwise.  The Revenue Commissioners may make regulations for the operation of this provision.</P>
    <P>Of course, the regulations will have to be laid before the House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That is not the kind of legislation that commends itself to any ordinary person. We all know the intention behind it but there ought to be some other method of collecting the money.  This method creates difficulties for persons engaged in genuine operations.  Certainly it will create a lot of work for the principals, as they are called, because of the way it is drafted.  It will sometimes be difficult to determine when a contractor is a sub-contractor and when a sub-contractor is not a contractor.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister why section 53 was not drafted in a straightforward way?  This section deals with the 3½ per cent Exchequer bonds and the 3 per cent Exchequer bonds which the Department of Finance has said are due for repayment in the middle of 1970.  Payment is being prevented because of the bank strike.  In fact, many people have not received the dividend payments due to them on 1st May.  The State has defaulted in the payment of the National Debt and many people will be hard hit financially as a result.  It is all very well to say it is not possible to pay these debts because the Bank of Ireland is closed but that is not good enough.  No matter what it may look like on the surface we all know that there is plently of <i>sub rosa</i> banking being carried on <Col N="115" /> at the moment in the city.  The only thing is that it has to be done quietly. Instead of giving us all the gobbledy-gook as stated in subsection (3) of section 53, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Where an order is made under subsection (2) of this section, interest at such rate as may be specified in the order, shall be paid on the outstanding stock aforesaid in respect of the period from the 15th day of July, 1970, to the date of redemption, fixed under this section, of such stock.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not specify the rate of interest?  What is all this rubbish about making orders and not making orders?  I realise the inference may be drawn that the 3 per cent Exchequer bond holders will be paid a higher rate of interest and that the 3½ per cent Exchequer bond holders will also be paid a higher rate of interest but there would have been no harm if that had been inserted.  Subsection (4) of section 53 states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order revoke or amend an order under this section including an order under this subsection.</P>
    <P>One noticeable omission in the Bill is a capital gains tax.  No doubt those people who have been watching the behaviour of the stock exchanges in the United States, Britain and here will ask: &ldquo;Where is there a capital gain to be made today?&rdquo;  This does not alter the fact that a capital gains tax is long overdue.  I personally think this is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. As I have mentioned the Revenue Commissioners, I should like to point out that I thought it was most improper of the Revenue Commissioners, during the course of last year's general election campaign, to make a public statement that a particular transaction was not subject to tax.  I am not saying they were wrong.  In fact, it is extremely likely they were right having regard to the man who was chairman of the Revenue Commissioners until recently, but I do think it was most improper of them to make such a statement publicly. There is a serious snag here from the point of view of the community.  The <Col N="116" /> Revenue Commissioners have always been treated with great respect by everybody.  Nobody ever reflects on them in this House except when they get involved in some way.  But if they ever again issue such a statement, then in the words of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass: &ldquo;I cannot stop them getting black eyes and bloody noses.&rdquo;  Such an action takes from their status.  It should never have hap-happened: I do not know why it did happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to consider the Budget and the taxation imposed in the Budget, its relevance, its adequacy, its appropriateness and the consequences that flow from the tax policy in the Budget.  This country's economic position has deteriorated fairly steadily in the past two years, although the position over the last few months is more obscure and difficult to interpret. If we look back over this period we see some disturbing indicators.  If we look at the Government's policy statement and the Government's action, particularly the taxation imposed in this Budget relating to the increase in expenditure proposed in the Budget we find a disproportion between the gravity of the situation, the seriousness of the position disclosed by the economic indicators and the action taken by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall take just a couple of these indicators.  First of all, the trend of non-agricultural wages and salaries.  In 1967 these increased by £38 million, in 1968 by £55 million and in 1969 by £79 million.  This year they are projected to increase, by the Economic and Social Research Institute, by £101 million.  Thus, the rate of increase of wages and salaries has trebled in three years.  One does not need to be an economist to appreciate the gravity of such an acceleration of wage inflation. Indeed, it would not be easy to find any other country in Europe&mdash;there are parts of the world where inflation is endemic&mdash;with anything approaching that kind of trend or pattern.  This has had its effects.  If we look at the trend of prices we see an extremely disturbing position also.  Between 1967 and 1970 the average annual increase in the consumer price index was 7 per <Col N="117" /> cent.  There is no other three-year period that I can find since the war in which the average price increase attained even 5 per cent.  The average over the 20 years from 1947 to 1967 has been 3¼ per cent but in the last three years prices have been rising at a rate more than double the average of the post-war period, a period on the whole of considerable inflation both here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The figures published in the consumer price index for May show an increase in the first quarter of well over 4 per cent giving an increase over the two years between May, 1968, and May, 1970, of no less than 16 per cent so that the average rate at which prices are rising has accelerated and has reached 8 per cent per annum as against the average of 3¼ per cent per annum during the post-war period. Here we have a trebling of the rate at which wage and salary incomes are growing combined with an increase of 2½ times the rate of price inflation all occurring within two to three years.</P>
    <P>We need to consider why this price increase position has occurred.  I do not want to put the whole blame directly on increases in wages and salaries although I believe much of the blame must go directly and indirectly to this particular cause.  If we examine the factors that have contributed to the rapid price increase which has occurred during 1967 to 1969 we find that the labour cost per unit produced in manufacturing industry has risen by 13 per cent.  When we look at the import price picture we also find a startling increase of 15 per cent in import prices in two years.</P>
    <P>This phenomenon has attracted extraordinarily little attention.  I and others have spoken frequently in the last few months, even in the last two years, on the subject of the direct effect of wage and salary increases on the cost of living, but very little has been said, if anything, about the increase in import prices.  It is time we stood back and looked at the situation to see why this increase occurred.  There is a lesson to be learned here.  One might think import prices were something beyond our control, that it is a case of somebody else putting up the <Col N="118" /> prices and not our fault, but I think it can be shown this is not the case. In fact, the increase in import prices that has occurred is an extraordinary increase: in two years it has been one-third greater than in the previous 16 years; in other words, the rate of growth of import prices is running something like 11 times the rate to which we have been accustomed.  That is an enormous increase.  This occurred because this country was forced, with another nearby country, because of the increase in its labour costs that occurred between 1963 and 1967 to devalue its currency.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we have seriously considered the implications of that devaluation. We have tended to assume that what happened was that Britain devalued and we had to go along with them.  We have become so accustomed to following Britain in everything that nobody has even queried whether our devaluation was necessary.  It was just assumed that if Britain devalued we also had to devalue.  We devalued with Britain because with Britain we have pursued the same kind of inflationary policy, with the same effects on labour costs, through wage and salary increases, as Britain had and these two countries together in four years increased their labour costs in both cases by 13 per cent while other countries in Europe had held their labour costs fairly steady over the same period.</P>
    <P>In West Germany there was an increase of 5 per cent&mdash;that is the highest&mdash;but that was a purely temporary phenomenon in 1967.  In the following year there was a drop and the labour costs increase in Germany for the five-year period 1963 to 1968 was only 1 per cent.  In France there was a 2 per cent increase and in Italy there was a drop of 4 per cent in labour costs in this period.  In the US and in Japan the increase was 2 per cent in each case.  Virtually, there was no change in all these countries while Ireland and Britain increased their labour costs by 13 per cent. The value of their currencies diminished and that had to be recognised in devaluation for devaluation merely recognises what is already a fact in a case like this.  Through wage inflation, which we pursued here simultaneously <Col N="119" /> with wage inflation in Britain, we had undermined our currency and accordingly had to devalue.  This was not exposed for the tragic situation it was because it happened that it coincided with a similar phenomenon in Britain and our devaluation could be comfortably hidden in that of Britain. As a result, the fact that it was necessitated by deficiencies in our own policy and by the lunacy of our own behaviour was obscured.</P>
    <P>We had to devalue our currency because our labour costs went up in that way while the labour costs of other countries did not.  Our costs structure changed and we could no longer compete and we were forced to devalue.  As a result of that devaluation over a period of several years&mdash;because devaluation took much longer than, perhaps, people thought to produce its effects on prices&mdash;import prices have risen because the effect of devaluation is to have a marked impact on import prices.  In our case this was longer delayed than usual, I think, because as Britain devalued also and as we derive half our imports from Britain part of the effect of devaluation was cushioned, but only temporarily, by the British situation.  Devaluation worked its way through the British prices and costs structure rather slowly, as is usual, and then in turn we were influenced in the first instance directly by the increase in the price of imports from the rest of the world and more slowly by the delayed effects on British costs and prices of their devaluation. As a result, something like 10 per cent, I believe, of the 15 per cent increase in import prices is a direct consequence of the devaluation of our currency which we forced on ourselves by the incompetence of our own policy and by the careless way we proceeded to increase our costs.  It is that which constitutes the larger element in the increase in import prices, accounting for something like two-thirds of it.  It is that big increase in import prices as a result of devaluation combined with the continued and accelerated increase in our labour costs that has put up prices in this country at the phenomenal rate that it has happened.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to control <Col N="120" /> this or do anything about it has forced on the Government forms of taxation that have further increased the prices spiral which has now attained a pace never before attained in this country since the end of the war.  That is the background to our present position. The fact that prices here are rising at the moment at the present rate is due to a combination of two things; current wage and salary increases and a second stage inflation arising out of that devaluation.</P>
    <P>I want to warn that we should learn from this; that we are already at a stage where our prices are being put up not only because of current wage inflation but because of the last wage inflation and this is a spiral that can continue and very easily we could get into the position where every couple of years we would have to make a similar adjustment to our currency parities and face a similar further increase in wages and causing a similar further increase in costs and so on.  We are now well into this cycle and yet there is no sign of this being recognised by the Government, no sign of any recognition of the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>There have been times in the past when our labour costs have risen a little more than in Britain, but only briefly, because we have tended to have a two yearly cycle of wage increases whereas in Britain they tend to rise more gradually by the same amount each year.  As a result, our wages and salaries have pushed ahead temporarily and then they tend to level off and the British catch up again.  There is no period in the past where the disparity between the way our labour costs and those of Britain increased was more than 5 per cent in the 12 month period and no case where this was not substantially retrieved in the following 12 months.</P>
    <P>There was no such case until now, not even in the 1963-67 period when we and Britain followed this path of wage inflation.  But now it is happening; we are at the second stage of this inflation.  We passed through the first stage hand in hand with Britain.  We wrecked our currencies.  We were <Col N="121" /> forced to devalue them but now, whereas the late British Government made valiant efforts to bring this situation under control and succeeded to a significant degree and have been able to produce a £500 million balance of payments surplus as a result of policies pursued, we in this country at present have failed to take any adequate action to deal with wage and salary inflation and we have a balance of payments deficit which in British terms, if related to the British national product, would be counted in thousands of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>We are told it is a £60 million deficit and the British national income is about 30 times ours.  We are talking, therefore, of an external deficit here which in terms of British national income would be about £2,000 million whereas in Britain they have a surplus of £500 million.</P>
    <P>Although the British have succeeded in controlling this salary and wage inflation to some extent and succeeded in getting their economy into such shape that they have a balance of payments surplus, they consider themselves, and are widely considered in the world, as being still in a dangerous position.  There have been gloomy references in Britain to possible further devaluation of the £ and to a serious economic situation.  Much of this was election propaganda but the fact is that international opinion regards the British economy as still far from being out of the wood even though they have a substantial external surplus and have control of their situation to that extent.  We have an external deficit which in British terms is four times as big as their surplus and we are now in a position where, far from bringing our wage inflation under control, for the first time in the history of this country it has outpaced the British rate of wage inflation and for the first time there is a significant and by no means temporary disparity emerging between the trend of our labour costs and those in Britain.</P>
    <P>On what does the parity of our currency with sterling depend?  It does not depend on any ability on our part to be as productive as the British economy, partly because of the different <Col N="122" /> mix of our economy, partly because we have a large agricultural sector in which incomes are low for reasons part of which at least are outside our own control and which we hope to remedy by EEC membership, and for that reason&mdash;sorry, I have lost my point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we have a wage inflation leading to an increase in labour costs which is running ahead of the position in Britain, and ahead to a substantial degree.  Let me quote some figures in relation to this: in 1969 labour costs in Ireland increased by 10 per cent; in Britain by 5 per cent, in Italy by less than 5 per cent&mdash; because of strikes it is difficult to get the precise figure but it is something below 5 per cent, perhaps a good deal below it&mdash;in Germany by 4 per cent, and in France by 1 per cent.  Therefore our labour cost increase in 1969 was double that in Britain and two and a half times or even more times the increase in labour costs in the other major European countries.  In the last quarter of 1969 our labour costs were running 12 per cent above those for the same quarter of the previous year. In the other European countries apart from France, that is, Britain, Germany and Italy, the increases were between 7 and 9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time our labour costs are now clearly running ahead of labour costs in Britain.  The increase is bigger.  This has not happened before and the reason it has not happened before&mdash;and this brings me back to the point I missed a minute ago&mdash; is that our two economies, although very different in character, have kept pace with each other over the last half century.  It is true that our productivity is lower than in Britain.  It has been so partly because of the mix of the economy, because of the larger agricultural sector, and partly because productivity in our industrial sector is lower than in Britain.  Up to now we have always been willing, taking the country as a whole, to pay ourselves proportionately less than Britain.  Our <Col N="123" /> currency could attain parity with sterling not because we were as productive as Britain but because the amount we paid ourselves for what we did was lower than the amount the British paid themselves by the same proportion as our productivity was below British productivity. The parity of our £ with sterling depends upon the maintenance of that relationship.  If at any stage we allow our payments to ourselves of wages, salaries and profits to rise faster than in Britain in proportion to the productivity of the two countries, then that parity of currency cannot be maintained.</P>
    <P>This is a crucial relationship, and it is a remarkable fact that for 50 years we have maintained it.  Despite all the temptation to increase our wages and salaries faster in relation to productivity than in Britain, in has never happened, except by a percentage point or two occasionally and then there was a pull back a year or so later.  Over this entire period of 50 years this relationship has not been significantly or permanently disturbed until now.  Now for the first time under this Government this situation has arisen and we can see the damage that has been done already in 1969. Already there is a 5 per cent margin between our labour cost level and the British labour cost level in this short period of time.</P>
    <P>Does anybody think in this year of 1970, with the trend of wages and salaries now, this position will be retrieved?  We are no longer in the two-year wage round pattern where in the year after the wage round we mark time while the British catch up. Far from it.  It is likely this year our labour costs will rise again by 10 per cent.  The best forecast that can be made at present is that labour costs in Britain may rise by something like 6 per cent.  That is the forecast of the National Institute of the Economic and Social Research.  That 10 per cent is not a figure I put forward with any certainty.  It is rather a crude guess at this point of time.  We do not know enough about the trend of wages and salaries this year, but I think it is very unlikely we shall be able to maintain <Col N="124" /> the increase in our labour costs at 6 per cent or less.  It is now certain &mdash;and the Government's policy has made this inevitable&mdash;that the increase in labour costs here will be greater than in Britain this year, thus further increasing, instead of, as in the past, wiping out the differential that has arisen, and thus further eroding the value of our currency <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling.</P>
    <P>This is the central problem that must be talked about and tackled. There is no evidence that the Government&mdash;perhaps because of their other preoccupations&mdash;are facing this.  Ministers are not talking about it.  They are not getting across the seriousness of the situation.  They have perhaps cried &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; so often when there was little or no reason to do so that their voices do not carry much weight at this stage.  They have devalued their own authority by repeated warnings in the past when the situation did not merit the kind of warnings given.  Now even if the Government tried to convince the people, they are so discredited in the economic sphere as in the political sphere these warnings would not be heeded.</P>
    <P>It is necessary therefore here, as in so many other aspects of our national policy, for the Opposition to take on the job of Government and to put to the country how serious the position is and the need to tackle this position. It is the Opposition therefore who are pressing the case today for a prices and incomes policy which in any other country faced with this problem would be done by the Government.</P>
    <P>That is the economic situation in which we find ourselves.  It is having its effect upon our international trade. The effect of this erosion of our economic position, of the erosion of our currency, is to increase the cost of our exports sold abroad and&mdash;this is of more importance than is usually given to it&mdash;to increase the cost of our home production sold in competition with imports from other countries.  There is evidence in the figures available to us of a very rapid erosion of our competitive position as a result of the policies pursued by the Government. If I may just give the figures for exports and imports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am trying to set the scene for an examination of the Budget in its context.  This Budget involves a certain increase in taxation and a certain increase in expenditure. I believe there is disproportion between them and that the wrong measures were taken in relation to the economic situation.  I am trying to set the scene. I have nearly completed that part of my speech, but it is necessary to see the Budget in its economic context. One of the troubles in this debate is that, while it is a debate on the Budget and the tax measures in it, the taxation measures have to be seen nowadays in their economic context.  We have been used to seeing them in the financial context and this makes it difficult in this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall proceed to relate my remarks to the Budget and in particular to the taxation imposed, and I think the relevance of it to this Bill, which deals in particular with the increase in turnover tax, will be seen very quickly.  The increase in the <Col N="126" /> volume of exports, which was 11 per cent in 1967 and 1968, dropped to 6 per cent last year, with a very narrow base, one-third of all products accounting for five-sixths of the increase. On the imports side, there has been a five to six times increase in the rate of growth of the import share of the home market, and as far as I can estimate from a careful study of the figures only one-third of this up to last year arose from the Free Trade Area Agreement and two-thirds of it from other factors, the principal of which, I suggest, is the erosion of our competitive position.</P>
      <P>Therefore last year the import bill was £40 million above what it would have been if the rate of growth of the import share had been maintained at its pre 1967 level.  That left us with 7,500 fewer jobs than we could have had in industry and 15,000 fewer jobs altogether.  That is the basic thesis I want to make there.</P>
      <P>Coming to the taxation measures in the Budget, this Budget increased expenditure by £22 million and increased taxation by £12½ million.  These are the net changes in the Budget. As a result, and if you take from August onwards, because of certain fluctuations because of the temporary transitional effects of the measures involved, this Budget pumps into the economy an additional net £1 million a month.  To what extent is that an appropriate budget?  To what extent are these taxation measures appropriate to the needs of the economy at this time?  I would regard them as totally inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures we now have available tell us that retail sales in the first quarter increased by 15 per cent in value terms.  Allowing for the phenomenal price inflation, it is still a 7½ per cent increase in the volume of retail sales in the first quarter.  That is the background to the Budget and it is against that background of this exceptional increase&mdash;I do not recall offhand any first quarter of any year in which the volume of consumption rose at this rate&mdash;that we must view this Budget.  Faced with the background of a massive increase in prices, in wages and in the volume of consumption, <Col N="127" /> the Budget imposed taxation related to expenditure which was to my mind completely inadequate in relation to that increase in expenditure.</P>
    <P>What is the form of this taxation? The taxation has taken the form of an increase in the turnover tax.  It is my belief that turnover tax has a very limited value as a tax measure because if you raise the rate of turnover tax above a fairly insignificant level the large number of units you have to supervise and the temptation to evasion being in those circumstances so great, render this tax unsatisfactory.  I am not opposed to expenditure taxes.  I do not share the views of those who see the simple dogmatic difference between direct and indirect taxes.  It is not necessarily the case that direct taxes are more progressive than indirect taxes.  We know in this country from studies carried out some years ago that, in fact, apart from the taxation on tobacco, the other principal indirect taxes are all progressive in character. This emerges from studies carried out by Mr. Reason and published in the seventh report of the income tax commission so that we are in the position that indirect taxation may or may not be more progressive than direct taxation but we should not be dogmatic about it.  Moreover, to the extent that direct taxation is less progressive, in the economic sense of the word &ldquo;progressive,&rdquo; that is more than in proportion to income, to the extent that it fails to meet that criterion it is possible to adjust incomes in other ways.  It is possible to so use the taxation raised as to compensate less well off people for the extra burden of taxation so that the net effect of the budgetary measure involving a non-progressive tax may be progressive if the money is spent the right way.</P>
    <P>I do not object in principle to indirect taxation but an indirect tax which is reaching the point at which a definite danger of evasion arises is one that has in it a serious defect.  An indirect tax which has to be paid through something like 40,000 outlets&mdash;perhaps not that many are engaged in the actual transaction because of the exemption measure but there is a very large number <Col N="128" /> of outlets running into several tens of thousands&mdash;is a tax which is unnecessarily costly to administer and which imposes a very unfair burden on many people who need not be involved in this tax net.  When this tax was introduced the argument in favour of it, and at the time it seemed to have a certain merit, was that if you imposed taxation at the wholesale level there would be a tendency, because the retail mark up is of a percentage character, for the retail mark up to be increased as a percentage of the percentage tax imposed.  Although the amounts involved were so small as from a national economic viewpoint not to be significant, this case seems to have some merit but what merit it had was undermined and totally eliminated by the subsequent decision of the Government not long afterwards to introduce a wholesale tax, a wholesale tax which meant that now we have taxes paid at two levels by two sets of people.  If the wholesale tax which we now have is to be justified despite this danger that it might involve a certain accumulation at the retail level, then if that objection to the wholesale tax has been overcome to the extent that this tax has been introduced and was yielding, before this Budget, just as much as the turnover tax, then I see no reason whatever for continuing the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The only objection raised against a wholesale tax as distinct from a turnover tax was this point.  The Government have undermined that point by introducing a wholesale tax and why have we still got a turnover tax?  Why have we still got tens of thousands of people unnecessarily involved in the process of tax collection, spending their time in the evening doing the Government's work when the tax could be collected by firms at the wholesale level who are already doing this kind of work?  It would give very little more trouble to these firms who are in any event larger firms and better equipped to do the job, when filling up the existing wholesale tax forms to fill up figures in relation to taxation on a wider range of goods at a lower level.  This is what the turnover tax is meant to be.  In fact, what we have already is a wholesale tax at several different levels.  We have <Col N="129" /> already departed from the principle of a single level of wholesale tax and if we can have two levels of wholesale tax, why can we not have three levels? Why cannot the turnover tax be imposed at that level, thus relieving some tens of thousands of people of the burden of having to cope with this tax?</P>
    <P>Moreover, the case in favour of a value added tax is strong because if you do bring this back to the wholesale level I would recognise the danger that the burden of taxation at that level is so great it may be then creating a temptation to evasion.  Therefore, when you have expenditure taxes imposed at a single level, as I believe this tax should be imposed within our existing framework, that is at the wholesale level only and not wholesale and retail, when the taxation imposed at any given level becomes so high as to create the temptation to evasion, you then try to spread it but you should not spread it forward to the retailers who are least able to cope with it, who are most numerous, who create many more administrative problems, but you should spread it backwards to the relatively small number of manufacturers&mdash;2,000 to 3,000&mdash;and to the importers&mdash;perhaps 1,000&mdash;who would be involved in a value added tax system.</P>
    <P>We need now to consider a restructuring of taxation because the Government went into this the wrong way round.  They convinced themselves that a turnover tax was the right tax to have to the exclusion of the wholesale tax.  Then they introduced a wholesale tax and we now have a wholesale tax at several levels.  At this stage we should eliminate turnover tax and have a value added tax from the wholesale stage backwards, which would involve only a few thousand people in this process of tax collection instead of some tens of thousands of people as at present.  There seems to me to be, from the technical aspect of the way taxation should be levied, a very strong argument in favour of that.</P>
    <P>To come back now to the adequacy of the tax measures, it seems to me that the tax levied in this Budget is inadequate in relation to the economic situation and in relation to the expenditure <Col N="130" /> proposed in the Budget itself.  I would hope to be in order in referring to the outturn of the Budget in relation to this tax.  The question before us is whether this was the right tax to impose and whether the amount imposed is right.  I submit that there is evidence that this Budget has been so designed because of the disproportion between taxation and expenditure that it is likely to yield a budget deficit.  I should like to give my reasons for that which I submit are well within the limits of the debate.</P>
    <P>This question of the likely outturn of the Budget is a little complex.  It involves an assessment of the future pattern of expenditure, largely predictable in accordance with the Government's Estimates but subject to a certain marginal variation, and of revenue which is, perhaps, less within the Government's control.  The Government have to make estimates as to what increase in revenue will accrue at existing tax levels and, having done that, they have to decide whether in relation to the likely level of expenditure as set out in the Book of Estimates, plus the increase above that which we know normally takes place, that must be allowed for too, whether the natural buoyancy of revenue from existing taxes will balance the books or whether increases in taxation of the kind proposed in this Bill are necessary in order to achieve a balanced budget is the right answer.</P>
    <P>In this instance it is quite clear&mdash; and was made clear by the various economic commentators such as the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Bank&mdash;that we need a budget surplus.  I belive this Budget will produce a deficit for the reasons which I now state.  The natural buoyancy of revenue last year was estimated by the then Minister at £28.5 million in accordance with what has, until this year, been standard practice and that practice was to underestimate. In the past the practice has been to underestimate the buoyancy of revenue and to write it down to much less than the figure is likely to be, so that there will be a margin to pay for unexpected and unbudgeted increases in expenditure, which can be <Col N="131" /> substantial.  Last year the increases amounted to £17 million.  The Minister for Finance very properly estimated the buoyancy of revenue at £28.5 million.  The Minister actually secured £46 million and he must have known that he would get at least £40 million.  The £46 million could not have been much of a surprise.</P>
    <P>This year, however, in making the Budget forecast, the Minister allowed for a natural buoyancy of revenue, at existing tax rates, of £50 million.  In arriving at £28.5 million and £50 million I am, in each case, making allowance for the overflow effect from the previous Budget where taxation is imposed some distance into the financial year and some of the effects overflow into the following year.  The actual buoyancy figures shown on the face of the Estimates were £42 million and £51.2 million, respectively, for the two years.  The previous year's £42 million was not natural buoyancy but arose from tax measures late in the preceding year which had an overflow effect in 1969-70.  In this year's Budget the Minister allowed for £51.2 million and £1.2 million arises from a similar overflow effect.  The true natural buoyancy of revenue arising from the basic tax level already there was £28.5 million allowed for in the previous year and £50 million allowed for this year.  What justification is there for this increase in the figure?  The £50 million allowed for is greater by £4 million even than the amount actually achieved last year. To what extent is that likely to happen?  I think that it is unlikely to happen and that the buoyancy of revenue will be less than this figure. This depends on what further steps have to be taken to restrain the growth of the economy in the months ahead. It can be said, on the basis of the commentaries of the Economic and Social Research Institute and the expectation of the income/expenditure increases that if there were no restrictive measures taken this year at all the increases in revenue would be of the order of £55 million, and certainly not more than £55 million.  With the restriction in credit and other measures which the Government may be forced to take it is unlikely that this figure will be <Col N="132" /> attained.  I believe the buoyancy of revenue will be less than £50 million. It could hardly be more than £50 million even with the measures already taken with regard to restrictions in credit.</P>
    <P>Consequently this year, unlike all previous years, the Minister has taken full credit for the entire natural buoyancy of revenue.  There is nothing left to pay for unbudgeted increases in expenditure.  These increases in expenditure can be big.  Last year they amounted to £17 million.  That £17 million included a substantial figure in relation to public service pay.  The Minister has made a provision in this Budget for an increase in public service pay of £10 million.  I would like to ask the Minister to tell us whether the increase in public service pay which will arise from the negotiations just completed will be more or less than £10 million.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy is entitled to claim that I should have furnished to the House, when introducing the Second Stage of the Bill, an estimate of the cost of the increases in public service pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I do not see how the Minister could justify this measure unless he produces some <Col N="133" /> figures of his kind.  It seems to me that the Minister is thinking in such Gladstonian terms as to be totally irrelevant to the economic situation of any economy since the Great War.  My point is that even allowing for such contingencies as public service pay and assuming the £10 million is adequate &mdash;although I doubt it in view of the recent settlement&mdash;there still occurred last year and the year before increases in other expenditure not allowed for in the Budget of £9 million to £9.5 million.  The turnover tax measures in this Budget yield in relation to the expenditure proposed an amount which is likely to fall short of total expenditure. These taxation measures, taken in conjunction with the buoyancy of revenue, are unlikely to yield a sufficient amount to cover the increases in expenditure.  The natural buoyancy of revenue has been fully discounted and there is no provision of any kind for the additional expenditure which always occurs and is usually of the order of £9 million or £10 million, other than for public service pay which occurs over and above the amount set out in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>I believe this Budget will produce a deficit.  I believe it is inappropriate particularly when the Minister has been advised that there should be a budget surplus.  The measures taken in this Budget are, therefore, inappropriate.</P>
      <P>I am precluded from discussing any question of reducing expenditure.  I can only say that given the levels of expenditure which the Government propose the level of taxation is totally inappropriate to our economic situation. The effects of this Budget, in the words of a headline put on one of my articles by the <i>Irish Times</i>, are serious. The headline reads: &ldquo;Budget adds fuel to the flames of inflation&rdquo;.  I lack the imagination to think up such headlines but my journalistic colleagues occasionally put a phrase of that kind on an article of mine and the phrase puts across very well what I intended to say but had not the wit to say so succinctly myself.  Perhaps what the Budget has done is &ldquo;add fuel to the flames of inflation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several points I would like to make arising directly from the <Col N="134" /> Finance Bill.  In relation to estate duty, this Bill makes no adequate provision to cope with the many difficulties in connection with this tax.  I am personally convinced that a tax of this kind and having this kind of effect is necessary.  It would be most regressive and put us into a position of being one of the most reactionary countries in the world if we had no taxation on capital or if we allowed people to accumulate wealth indefinitely.  I am unconvinced that the rate at which taxation is collected&mdash;I will not say imposed&mdash;on capital in this country is sufficient.  I am not convinced that it is adequate to prevent the continued accumulation of capital.  A study of estate duty figures themselves for what they are worth&mdash;and they have a limited value &mdash;would tend to indicate that wealth is accumulating in fewer hands to a greater and greater extent and that estate duty is inadequate.  Having said that it is inadequate to achieve this necessary social objective, I do not accept that the present level of estate duty and the method of levy are appropriate.  The purpose of this tax is to prevent wealth accumulating from one generation to the next.  There is no social case, or no case in equity, for the taxation through estate duty of funds passing from husband to wife. This is something which I have never understood.  I cannot see on what possible grounds such a tax should be imposed.  I understand why wealth should be taxed passing from one generation to the next.  Too much wealth goes from one generation to the next, largely because the form of taxation is so inappropriate and inefficient and a large part of it is avoided.  It has been estimated in Britain that two-thirds of the estate duty is avoided&mdash;not evaded, but avoided.  A prominent solicitor said to me recently that for any estate of any large size, which runs up to £100,000 or upwards, where it is worthwhile going to some legal trouble to avoid estate duty and where the person concerned is well off enough to be able to set money aside in a way where he will not have access to it himself, there is no difficulty whatever in avoiding estate duty completely.</P>
    <P>For somebody who has a small <Col N="135" /> estate, who owns a house or has an insurance policy, it is not possible to avoid the estate duty.  That person cannot avoid it because he needs the house and the insurance policy for his wife and the difficulties of avoiding duty at this level are great.  Indeed, at the lower level the estate duty is rarely avoided: it may not be worthwhile making the necessary legal provisions, paying for expensive legal advice and going through the technical business of setting up companies and so on.  Also, it may not be possible because the person may not be able to afford to alienate his property in the way necessary to get around this estate duty.</P>
    <P>That is the position for the ordinary man who has a house or holds an insurance policy but the wealthy man can avoid completely payment of this duty.  Any solicitor can tell you that a man with £75,000 or £100,000 would be a lunatic to pay estate duty and if he is paying this duty he certainly needs a more competent solicitor to advise him.  A system of taxation so inequitable that the rich can avoid it completely but the less well-off cannot avoid it at all is socially unjust and is the most regressive type of taxation any country could have.  That is the form of capital taxation we have in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many problems are created in regard to the agricultural sector. Whereas in Britain provision is made to deal with estate duty in regard to farming, similar arrangements do not apply here.  The incidence of estate duty on farmers in Britain is very light but here the level is of the order of 50 per cent higher than in Britain and this applies to the range of £30,000 to £100,000.  Although we are an agricultural country we do not make any provision for the difficulties involved in the agricultural sector where frequently there is undue pressure to break up farms into smaller units because it is necessary to sell off part of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, that is also <Col N="136" /> another technical difficulty.  Agriculture is one area where we could be a little lenient on the transfer of property from one generation to the next but in this connection we are much tougher than the British.  Here we have a tax that is inequitable to the farming community&mdash;although this is a most important sector&mdash;and it is inequitable to the less well-off.  It has now been tightened up so that it covers insurance policies and it has this peculiar arrangement whereby if one takes out an insurance policy for one's wife&mdash;as I have done&mdash;one is liable for estate duty at a very high level on a modest policy.  It has all of these defects and very few virtues; it does not prevent capital from accumulating from one generation to the next and it can be avoided completely by the wealthy.  It has all the marks of a bad tax judged by the canons of taxation of Adam Smith and I endorse the remarks of Deputy O'Donovan in this regard. Although it is unusual to hear Adam Smith quoted from the Labour benches, in this case he need not worry because these canons of taxation could be accepted by any Labour or Socialist Party as they involve commonsense on the one hand and equity and fairness on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a most unsatisfactory position in regard to estate duty and I recommend to the Minister that he would take a long, hard look at this matter. The basic defect of estate duty is that it is levied at such long intervals that the incentive to evasion is great.  The average interval at which estate duty is paid is 29 years and any tax at such a long interval is paid in such large sums that it is worthwhile going to some trouble to evade payment.  If the duty were paid every year evasion would not be possible in the same way because, whereas one can avoid payment of estate duty by transferring property to one's children seven years before death, if the tax were paid annually this could not occur.  All that would happen would be that the children would have to pay the capital tax each year and it would not alter the position except that the splitting up of the property might bring it into a lower level of annual capital duty.  When the duty is paid after an interval of 29 <Col N="137" /> years there is created an incentive to avoid payment which, in fact, is occurring on a very large scale.  In Britain it is estimated that avoidance amounts to two-thirds of the total amount that should be paid.  I am expressing a personal view, rather than party policy, when I say that this tax should be on an annual basis rather than payable on death and it should not extend to transfer of property to one's wife.  The burden should also be eased in regard to farmers and the whole problem needs to be looked at afresh.</P>
    <P>In this connection the Minister has a great opportunity because there are very few cases where one can change a tax so as to reduce the level of taxation and yet collect three times as much money, but this the Minister could do. He could change the system of taxation to an annual tax that could not be avoided, he could slightly reduce the rate of tax, but by plugging the loopholes in the matter of avoidance of payment, he could collect more money. If the Minister instituted a reform of this kind it would be remembered to him subsequently, although he would want to do this fairly quickly if he wishes to carry out this reform in this term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I do not think the reliefs given in section 9 are adequate.  I think it leaves married women in this country in a worse position than women in Britain although the need to encourage married women to return to work is quite considerable. In many parts of the country it would be worthwhile to attract married women back into jobs in industry; I consider we should make more generous provision although I welcome what has been done.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 deal with some technical points in relation to the 20 per cent dividend relief for Irish companies. I am not satisfied that this relief is of value.  From my own limited experience in this field I do not think anybody has ever floated a company to get the benefit of this relief and it is not given a very high priority by those concerned with financial matters. I should like to ask the Minister if it is not true that this relief will have to be discontinued in EEC conditions <Col N="138" /> as it would be discriminatory as between Irish and other companies.  I am not too sure of the position and perhaps the Minister would clarify this point.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to put to the House.  It relates to the question of the value of stock exchange securities for the purpose of estate duty.  Let us take an example of a person worth £200,000 who died in the last two years.  Let us suppose his investments are entirely British and attract the higher British rate of 60 per cent which would reduce the estate to £80,000.  Let us say the shares drop by 40 per cent&mdash;and this is not impossible because the drop in shares during this time has been at this percentage&mdash;then the position could be that there would not be any money for the heirs because of this system of valuing shares.  This seems extremely inequitable and something should be done to give an option to the personal representatives to choose as an alternative to the value on that date the average value of the securities spread over a period of three years.  Some such provision is necessary to get over what could be a grave injustice.  I am concerned that there should not be too much accumulation of property from one generation to the next but that somebody could lose all because of a flaw in estate duty legislation appears grossly unfair.  That is a matter that, with advantage, could be considered.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some points on the Bill itself, the main burden of which relates to the adequacy of the whole measure in relation to the economy.  I think that I have succeeded in keeping my remarks relevant to the Bill for a good deal of the time and I hope that I have not been too far out for the rest of the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming in, as I am now, between learned discourses from two economists, is not exactly the position that I would normally choose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be quite pleasant to have the last word after the economists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be pleasant for me but it may not be for some <Col N="139" /> of the economists.  A number of the points raised by both Deputy Dr. O'Donovan and Deputy Dr. FitzGerald would seem to be slightly outside the scope of the Bill but at the same time, they were all worth making.  I shall try to confine my remarks to the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers commented on the effect of the turnover tax on prices.  It has been suggested that in most cases retailers did not put on the first 2½ per cent turnover tax in 1963 so that, therefore, the increase this year was an increase of 5 per cent. Of course, this had a disastrous effect on prices particularly in the smaller shops.  When the Budget was introduced I was one of the people who was sorry for the smaller shopkeepers but since I have studied the effects of the turnover tax, I am now quite satisfied that most of them are well able to look after themselves.  I am satisfied, also, that most of them did put on 2½ per cent in 1963 but that some of these were under the impression that it could be reasonably assumed that that was forgotten about and that people would not know, whether, in fact, the 2½ per cent had been put on then. Consequently, they felt that they could take a chance on putting on an extra 2½ per cent in addition to the increase which the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey or the present Minister for Finance put on this year.  I am not sure which one of them was responsible for that increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, the result was disastours. I mentioned to the Minister for Finance while he was Minister for Industry and Commerce that he should endeavour to find out what exactly was happening with regard to this tax.  The bigger shops and, in particular, the supermarkets seemed to be able to get over this easily enough by reason of the fact that they buy in bulk and so on.  Some of them say that they are not charging turnover tax but I assume they are paying it.  However, most people who are buying goods in small quantities complain that they are paying very much more than 5 per cent.  In many cases if a person buys a small article for a couple of shillings, he is charged a <Col N="140" /> penny or twopence tax on it.  We had the case of a person who was charged an extra penny on a box of matches. I presume that the sale of matches fell drastically in that particular shop so that the matter would have regulated itself within a very short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech referred to an added value tax.  When he is replying to the debate, I should like him to tell us if he is talking of a tax, as Deputy Dr. FitzGerald said earlier, to replace other taxes or is he talking about another tax that would be added to the taxes already being paid. I assume the latter is what he is talking about but if that is the idea, it will not be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Continental system of added value tax is not operated in the way in which Deputy Dr. FitzGerald suggests it should be done here.  It is spread over the entire range in most cases.  If an effort is made to introduce a tax in addition to those already being paid, every effort will be made to prevent its imposition.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in the Bill that improvements are being made in relation to those paying income tax and, in particular to those paying tax under the PAYE system.  I have said in this House and outside that the PAYE system of collecting income tax is entirely wrong and that many people are paying tax on money which they never see.  Of course, this has resulted in very substantial amounts of money coming to the Government above what is budgeted for.  We had a typical example of this last year when the Budget, according to the then Minister for Finance, was meant to be balanced in such a way that it would cover only outgoings but during the three or four weeks towards the end of the financial year, we had Supplementary Estimates in this House amounting to £35,600,000 while there was a surplus of half a million pounds on the Budget at the end of the year.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is off the mark when he says that there will be a deficit this year because of substantial wage increases because I would estimate that since the average increase appears to be in the region of £4 and since the agreements are usually made to cover a period of about 21 <Col N="141" /> months, the Government will get at least £1 and, in some cases, 30/- out of the weekly wage of each taxpayer. This would be in addition to what they are already getting.  I am sure that this will result in a substantial credit balance at the end of the year but, of course, the Government, if they are still in office at the end of the year, will find ways of removing it so that it will not be used next year to the advantage of people who are already being over taxed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald referred also to the question of wages in so far as wages are going ahead of those being paid in Britain and on the Continent at the present time.  He said that the percentage increase here is greater than it has been on the Continent. Perhaps, he will agree with me when I say that the basis on which they work on the Continent is very much greater in most cases than it is here. Wage levels here are so scandalously low that substantial increases are required to bring them anywhere near to what could be regarded as a living wage.  I should hate to think that if Deputy Dr. FitzGerald were Minister for Finance he would suggest preventing substantial wage increases.  Maybe I am misjudging him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I think any Labour Minister for Finance would do, I would try to discourage wage increases of such a character that they would reduce employment as is happening at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that the only way in which to increase employment is by keeping down wages is, I am afraid, something which is not very acceptable, as Deputy FitzGerald and everybody else knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I can find nobody in this country, earning a week's wages, who is being paid excessively.  Most people have to work very hard.  Deputy FitzGerald may know some who do not. There may be exceptions, but I am <Col N="142" /> still trying to find them.  I certainly do not believe that the solution to the problem is to keep wages down.  It an effort were made to keep prices down, I might be able to go along with what Deputy FitzGerald says.  If we are ever going to do anything about trying to standardise or regularise the cost of living we must make an effort to tie down prices.  That has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Which came first?  The chicken or the egg?  Prices go up and then we attempt to follow those with wages, but so far we have not been very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as well to know the way people like Deputy FitzGerald think about these things.  As far as PAYE is concerned, I mentioned on a number of occasions the fact that I think one bad mistake is the collection of income tax on gross wages.  Very many workers have to pay substantial sums to get to their work.  They may club together to buy a car.  It must be taxed and insured.  They must pay for the petrol to run it.  None of these expenses is allowed when they pay their income tax.  There is something wrong in the system.  Why no Minister has had the courage to look at it in the correct way I just do not know.  I hope I live to see the day when this will be dealt with in the proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a section then which is supposed to deal with what most of us call &ldquo;lump&rdquo; jobs.  Deputy Gallagher &mdash;I do not always agree with him&mdash; spoke the other day and there was a great deal of justice in what he said. The amount of money involved as far as income tax is concerned is relativly small.  &ldquo;Lump&rdquo; jobs are jobs where ten or twelve men get together to do a job at a price.  The price of the job may represent the correct cost of doing the job, but they work very hard to get a few extra pounds by doing the job in a shorter time.  It is as simple as that <Col N="143" /> In most cases they do not pay income tax and the suggestion now is that they should be made to pay.  The section provides that the person who employs them will be docked income tax at 7s in the £.  This matter could be dealt with in a more humane way if the Department of Social Welfare insisted that cards should be stamped.  We would not then have the situation in which, if one of them falls ill or is knocked off, he is not entitled to benefit of any kind.  That is the approach we should have instead of using a very large sledge hammer to crack a very small nut.  Some smart person in the Department obviously decided this was the way to deal with the matter.  This is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that the married women's allowance has been increased by £29 a year; that is £29 at 5s 3d in the £, which is something like £6 or £7.  That is all it will amount to.  Will this make any difference as far as married women are concerned? Does anyone suggest this will bring any more married women out to work?  Those who are anxious to work will not work because they are taxed on everything they earn over £1 odd a week.  Does anyone think this inadequate concession will encourage them to go out to work?  Of course, it will not.  The matter is again being dealt with in a rather stupid way by people who obviously never were in the position in which their own wives had to go out to work because, if their wives had to go out to work and the combined wage packet at the end of the week was barely enough to keep the household going, as is the case with costs as they are at the moment, they would have a different approach from their present approach.</P>
    <P>Death duties are very complicated. It is true that, if one takes up a newspaper, one sees members of the farming community, for instance, leaving a substantial amount of money.  The fact is that farms and houses are now very highly valued.  The cute fellows make sure that, when they are dead, their money will not go to the State. As Deputy FitzGerald said, the fellow who has plenty of money makes sure <Col N="144" /> it will not be possible to catch him out and tax him after he is dead with death duties, but the ordinary individual usually does not bother about these things and the result is that those who are left behind are stuck with debts they find it very difficult to pay.</P>
    <P>There was a lady a few years ago who died and left a 30-acre farm to her niece.  The niece was married.  Her husband left his job and went to work the farm.  He knew nothing about death duties.  He was only a short time in the farm when he got a bill for £3,000 death duties.  The only way they could get the money to pay the death duties was by selling half the farm.  Then they met another snag: the Land Commission would not let them sell the farm to anybody but an uneconomic holder. The number of buyers available was small.  Those who were prepared to give a very substantial sum for the farm just could not buy it and, in the last analysis, these people were worse off than they were before they got the legacy from the aunt.  This sort of thing should be guarded against.  The same kind of thing happens with house property.  Some one dies and leaves a house.  The value may be £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000.  The house may be a very ordinary house.  Where is the person who gets that house to find the money to meet death duties?  In most cases they have to sell the house or raise a loan on it to pay the death duties.  This is wrong and something should be done with it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made again and again from these benches that a capital gains tax should be introduced. For some extraordinary reason no Minister for Finance in a Fianna Fáil Government wants to hear a word about that.  The present Minister is new to the job.  He should take a good hard look at this because this is one way in which money can be taken off those who get money &ldquo;fairly soft&rdquo; and who can afford to pay.  Up to now in most cases taxation appears to be imposed on those who can least afford to pay it.  It is about time something was done to make those who can and should pay bear some of the extra taxation.  A capital gains tax is one of the surest ways of doing this. <Col N="145" /> Maybe it is too much to ask that the present Minister should try to rectify this obvious, very obvious, fault in our taxation system.</P>
    <P>The taxation system has come under review again and again.  I agree with Deputy O'Donovan that the former Minister for Finance, no matter what anybody may say about him on other fronts, was a very competent Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He could always defend his proposals and the result was that he was able, in some cases, to put across things, the wisdom of which many of us doubted, but he always had a very good argument in support of his proposals.  We are in the extraordinary position that it was he who prepared the Budget.  It was introduced here by the Taoiseach and the Finance Bill is now being piloted through the House by a Minister who had nothing whatever to do with the original proposals.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to read the mind of the person who thought out the proposals contained in this Bill. I should like to ask a number of questions on this but I do not think there is any point in asking the present Minister for Finance what Deputy Haughey meant when he introduced certain things.  For instance, he has in the Bill that the first £100 will be taxed at 4s 7d in the £ rather than 5s 3d or 7s.  Would somebody tell me what it is expected will be produced by this or who will be pleased because he gets 100 times the difference between 4s 7d and 5s 3d?  What will 100 eightpences do?  I would like to know what was the thinking behind this because, obviously, there must be a reason for it.  That is the sort of thing that is written into the Bill.  This actually gives the impression that something is there when, in fact, there is nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, with regard to the married women's allowances, it is rather ridiculous that those very small concessions should be put into this Bill.  A Minister producing a Budget and afterwards producing a Finance Bill should at the very least be able to say when he is <Col N="146" /> introducing it: &ldquo;This is something which will go down on record and somebody at least will appreciate it&rdquo;. I cannot see how this £100 at eight-pence in the £ will make any difference. I am afraid I cannot see that the difference between £47 and £74 for a married woman will mean anything to those people.</P>
    <P>There are several little things like this in the Bill and it is hard to see the reason why they were included.  In the Official Report of 17th June last, volume 247, No. 9, column 1336 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The income limit for the purpose of the dependent relative allowance is raised by section 11 to £222 which is the annual equivalent of the non-contributory old age pension as increased in the Budget.</P>
    <P>The non-contributory old age pension increase granted in the Budget is only given from 1st August next but the tax year starts on 6th April.  This may be only a minor point but I am sure the Minister must know the complications this will involve.  I wonder has he done anything to ensure that this small allowance will, in fact, be given.  We know at the present time that dozens of people have not got their amended tax certificates.  I am quite sure that there is a good reason for it, the good reason being that the Department of Finance cannot get staff to do their jobs.  The juniors are not being paid enough.  The whole thing is a vicious circle.  One thing causes another and because the Department will not pay enough they cannot get staff and people are not able to get their amended tax allowances.  Some of them have not yet got their tax allowance for this year.</P>
    <P>Let us take the lower paid State employee.  For some extraordinary reason he is taxed on a different basis from people employed outside.  This applies to forestry workers, Bord of Works employees, soldiers, gardaí and so on.  Is there any reason why this should be so?  Do the Department and the Minister not know that this is causing a certain amount of annoyance? It causes much annoyance to the person who moves from one place to another, if he is in State employment for a few months and moves outside <Col N="147" /> or <i>vice versa.</i> This causes all sorts of complications.  Why will the Minister not do something about it?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not also aware that if somebody does not get his tax-free allowance until the month of June and he has been working since April a certain amount has accrued?  Would it be too much to ask that when the tax certificates are sent out the aggregate amount would be brought to the notice of the employer so that the employer will not continue to collect tax at whatever the rate is on the tax certificate, completely ignoring the fact that over a period the employer has either being deducting tax or the employee has not been with that employer at all?  An amount has accrued and the person does not get credit for it.  Those may be small points but they really affect the small man or women who is depending on a week's wages.  The unfortunate thing about it is that when a person who is getting a small week's wages has a substantial deduction made from his wages for one week because of some mistake made at tax level, and gets, not £14, but £9, in some cases this can result in hunger or at least embarrassment for the man and his family.  I can see no reason why a greater effort should not be made to have this matter rectified.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who believe that the people who collect the tax are not enemies of the public, as some would have us believe.  They are simply people who are doing their job. Incidentally, let me make this comment about the people who collect income tax: It is disgraceful that in the year 1970 they are asked to work under the conditions in which they work in this city.  They work in little rooms with absolutely no privacy, very little light and no filing accommodation. In fact, if an ordinary member of the public goes in to inquire about income tax he might as well make public confession because he has to stand in a queue and everything that is said can be heard by the people behind.</P>

      <P>They might sometimes. I would not be too hard on them. Those are things which should be dealt with.  I asked the Minister for Finance three years ago if he would do something about this.  He said he had great plans to try to reorganise the income tax collection system in this city but unfortunately it has not been reorganised. I have visited one or two offices down the country and they are worse than the Dublin offices.  I would not be one bit surprised, having regard to the cramped conditions under which they have to work, if they were in pretty bad form and were not inclined to listen to people who go in to make a case about an assessment or about a deduction of income tax.</P>
      <P>I said at the start I would not detain the House too long because I believe there are a number of Deputies who want to take part in the debate.  I want, however, to refer again to the question of the turnover tax.  The simple position about turnover tax is that when it was introduced first in 1963 it was bad. It was then 2½ per cent and nothing else.  The wholesale tax was later introduced and subsequently increased. The turnover tax has now been increased to 5 per cent and we now have the ridiculous situation that in many cases the 5 per cent is added to the 2½ per cent which was already being deducted.  That is added to the wholesale tax.  Not alone are the goods which are being bought taxed but the tax itself is taxed and a return must be made by the retailers of the amount collected on the goods they sell in turnover tax and the amount they collected on that turnover tax.  The position has become so ridiculous that it is completely out of hand.  Unless an effort is made to rectify this and to put matters in order before any other type of tax system is introduced, we will have serious trouble with the people who go into shops to buy the ordinary things of life.  One sees a price on an article in a shop and if one buys the article one is then told that the price is not right because so much tax has to be added under two or three different headings.  The situation is too ridiculous for words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that if the Minister for Finance <Col N="149" /> does not rectify the matter then somebody must do it because if it is allowed to continue it will only make matters worse as the months go by.</P>

      <P>I am not all that well versed in financial matters, as such.  On the other hand, I would claim an ordinary layman's knowledge of the subject.  Money is something we all reach out for.  In so far as it gives me the opportunity of purchasing or availing of the skills and the sacrifices of other people, naturally I am anxious that I should have some of it.  I am slightly envious, perhaps, of those who have more than I have.  I am in sympathy with those who have less than I have.  I would hope that, in our treatment of financial matters generally, we <Col N="150" /> should all approach the subject in this frame of mind.</P>
      <P>There are, however, matters which are more important than £sd.  Here I would take slight issue with the Deputy who, perhaps, to his embarrassment at times, finds his name confused with mine.  I have in mind now allowances to married ladies.  In circumstances where a married lady finds that she can cater adequately for the needs of her family, in a situation where, if she cannot be present with her children, she can afford to employ somebody who can look after the children in her absence, I would readily concede that she should have all the freedom she desires to engage in outside employment and that there is an obligation on us to see that in respect of that employment she obtains adequate financial compensation.  But, I do not agree that because of economic circumstances in the home, the mother should be encouraged to go out working.  I should much prefer that in those circumstances, the State would make a special allowance to the mother so that she could remain at home and look after, protect and instruct her children. I have already said here and I shall continue to say it until I am convinced of the contrary, that we are doing a disservice to many young people by pretending that it is necessary for the mother to leave them in order to take up employment.  There are, I would admit, cases where it would appear necessary and in those cases I would advocate that the State should make special generous allowances to those ladies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

If the point is made that there are some ladies&mdash;I accept there may be some&mdash;I submit we are doing a disservice to a large percentage of the ladies in Ireland if we say that they want to be refugees from domestic responsibility.  I concede that there are some but to those who would make the case that there is a monotony <Col N="151" /> attached to housework I would say that we should be examining the situation to discover if perhaps we could so organise matters that the monotony would be less than it is alleged to be. If there were in certain areas&mdash;certainly in certain built-up areas&mdash;a centre to which such a lady could adjourn in the morning and have a cup of coffee and a chat with her neighbour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully mentioned that people who can pay taxes should pay them. I agree.  However, I find it rather difficult to reconcile that sentiment with an earlier sentiment expressed by the same Deputy that certain skilled men who indulge in &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; and who earn a substantial amount should not have to pay tax at all.  He makes the point that people who can afford to pay tax should pay it.  Why then should he endeavour to make the point that those who are earning good wages should not pay tax?  That, to me, is quite illogical.  On the other hand, if he claims that taxes are too high, I cannot relate that to his anxiety to have everybody better paid to provide all State servants with more palatial offices than they have.  I would agree that some State servants should have better offices than those in which they operate but, having said that, I am prepared to support the taxation required for the provision of these offices.</P>

I am not happy that at the moment we are working to our full capacity.  I am dissatisfied when I see people&mdash;and these people are not confined to any particular section&mdash;who think that whatever happiness there is in this life is to be obtained by doing as little as one can and getting as much as one can for it at the end of the week or of the month.</P>

Despite the promises that were made in the past&mdash;I remember away back Fianna Fáil promised to reduce taxation&mdash;today we are taxed to the tune of almost 4½ times what the people of this country were taxed in 1956.  Indeed many people claim, and I think justly, that at the present time they are ground down with increased <Col N="155" /> taxation at national and indeed at local level.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney stated that the people were not working to full capacity. Many people are inclined to argue, and perhaps justly, that if they work harder they pay more in taxation to the Government.  They will tell you that the incentive is not there to work harder.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The then Taoiseach in the same year stated in Ballinrobe, I think, that they would never dream of taxing the necessities of life.  He talked about the blood-curdling lies of Fine Gael in saying that Fianna Fáil had any intention of ever taxing the necessities of life.  A turnover tax of 2½ per cent was imposed in 1963 and it has now been doubled to 5 per cent and food, clothes, coal, all the necessities of life, are being taxed.  Despite the promises made by those two gentlemen at that time, a few years later they removed the food subsidies to the tune of £16 million.  That is the audacity of the party that would stand up on platforms throughout the country and tell us they always kept their word to the Irish people and that they always had regard for the poor.  Certainly that cannot be said for them now, because they are taxing them as cruelly and as harshly as they possibly can.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out at that time and since then that the turnover tax would increase the cost of production and would increase the cost of living.  The cost of living is now increasing at an enormous rate due to Government taxation. The £ is jet-propelled and it is impossible for any worker or any worker's wife to live because, as somebody said recently, if you are going shopping with a basket you would almost want to bring a basket of £ notes to get the necessities of life to keep your family for even one week.</P>
      <P>Due to Government taxation CIE charges were recently increased.  Television charges and radio charges and charges for anything you like to name are increasing due to the burden of taxation imposed on the people by the Government.  Fianna Fáil are just being true to form.  The moment they get back into power, public taxation and local taxation start careering upwards.

      <P>It can truthfully be said that never in the history of this country was it more desirable and necessary to have a period of stability than it is now, so that producers, whether they be farmers or industrialists, can prepare and equip themselves for the more competitive period which undoubtedly lies ahead when we enter, as seems likely, the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which tax revenue can be increased without causing inflation&mdash;and according to Deputy Childers, the Minister for Health, who has spoken on two occasions recently about inflation, inflation is gripping our economy&mdash;without causing an increase in the cost of living and without causing bad industrial relations is by a growth in the national production which will provide a larger taxable income.  Our aim should be to bake a larger national cake so that every section of the community can get its fair share of it.  It is an inescapable fact that if taxation maintains its upward course as of recent years it will outstrip the real growth of the economy.  Financial experts claim that this is what is happening at the present time.  The danger signs are there and it is up to the Minister for Finance and the Government to take heed of those danger signs because when taxation outstrips the real growth of the economy we are, as a nation, in trouble.  The Government have their own problems.  They seem to care little <Col N="161" /> about the nation's problems or about the economy.  The Minister, when questioned by Deputy O'Leary, did admit, and more or less prophesied, that measures may have to be taken shortly to right the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>If I held on to a drain pipe I hope I would not fall off. Deputy Haughey went on radio and television last March and told the people the economy was in a dire state. He told us to tighten our belts immediately and he told workers not to force wage claims.  The Taoiseach then called a Cabinet meeting and Ministers agreed to impose on themselves a 14 per cent reduction in their salaries because the economy was supposed to be in such a bad state.  In less than two months the Minister for Finance introduced an inflationary Budget imposing increased taxation and handing out gifts all round to various sections in order to win the general election.  The Government won the election but the people are paying for the fraud committed in 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are allowing the economy to drift from bad to worse. Ministers seem to be more interested in tearing down the institutions of this State than in building them up or building up our financial viability.  The future of this country rests in the hands of the Government and to a large extent in the hands of the Minister for Finance, and the action he takes to right the economy.  The Government are meddling and muddling and as far as financial affairs are concerned they have deceived the nation <Col N="162" /> and that is wrong.  They have been proved to be incompetent and their forecasts about reducing taxation have been wrong in the past.  The Government's carry on has lost them the confidence of the world and, as far as the people are concerned, that is humiliating. Many people claim that we shall lose £30 million alone from tourism this year.  If that is the case an extra financial burden will have to be placed on the people in the years ahead because of the incompetence of the Government and the harm that has been done in the last five or six months by the Government and especially by some Ministers.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 or 14 years we have had three doses of a stop-go policy under Fianna Fáil.  In 1967, when Deputy Haughey became Minister for Finance, we had a balance of payments surplus of £15 million.  We had been in a period of recession from 1963 to 1966.  At the end of 1968 we turned that balance of payments surplus into a deficit of £22 million. With those signs of inflation one would have expected mild corrective measures to be taken but instead, as I said a few moments ago, in March, 1969, we had dithering and hesitant legislation but we had no proper leadership. The second Budget of 1968 was definitely a deflationary Budget.  It imposed £19 million new taxation.  This was the Government's effort at trying to tackle the problem of inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though taxation, direct or indirect, has continued to rise it never seems to be sufficient to enable the present Government to <Col N="163" /> pay its way, Loans and still more loans have left us deeper in debt.  We are now paying over £105 million each year, I think, to service the national debt owed by local authorities and semi-State bodies.  Sooner or later&mdash;unless it is too late&mdash;the Government will learn that it is impossible to borrow itself out of debt.  We seem to be getting deeper and deeper into it.  In reply to a question I asked about a month ago I was informed that the total national debt was over £1,000 million and that the amount owed by State and semi-State bodies and local authorities came to almost another £400 million.</P>
      <P>I am old enough to remember in 1950-51 when the Government of that time borrowed money and taxed people to build houses and hospitals, Fianna Fáil supporters outside the polling booths were saying: &ldquo;Put them out; they will put the country in pawn&rdquo;. At that time the national debt was but a fraction of what it is now when we have to put taxation of over £106 million per annum upon our people. That is more than it took to run the country in 1956 and it has to be imposed now to pay the interest on what is owed by the State, semi-State bodies and local authorities.  We are entitled to ask how long can that continue.  If as a result of increased taxation we were putting more people to work we could give the Government some credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated at one time that the yardstick by which the Government should be judged was the number of people put to work.  If the Minister for Finance could say that, due to higher taxation they had created more jobs than existed 14 years ago, we could give them credit for it.  I asked a question here on the 9th April last about employment statistics.  I asked what was the number of people at work in 1956 and at the latest available date and the reasons for any decline.  We must remember that when listening to radio or Government speeches you only get half the story: they tell you so many more are employed in industry but they leave out agriculture and other sectors.  If the Minister could claim that there were more jobs due to the higher taxation <Col N="164" /> it could be said they were doing good work but the facts are that in 1956 when taxation was £105 million we had 1,125,000 people at work; in 1969 with taxation of over £400 million we had 1,069,000 at work, a drop of 56,000.  Those figures cannot be denied because they were given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. It is the Government's duty to say what has happened in the meantime.  If that is the yardstick by which the Government are to be judged, according to the words of Mr. Lemass, when he was Taoiseach, the present Government are a failure.</P>
    <P>As a constructive Opposition with the national interest at heart and a united party which is not divided between gun-runners, gun-smugglers or doves and hawks, we have not only the right but the duty to ask ourselves what lasting value have we got from this huge taxation on the country.  Where is the country heading?  If, as a result of Government policy and growing taxation, we had more people at work and emigration had been stopped&mdash;it has not stopped&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that despite the increase in taxation if we could say we got value for money we could concede that the Government was right in increasing taxation but I can prove that instead of providing more jobs we have provided less.  I can prove by statistics that despite the huge increase in taxation, 450,000 of our brothers and sisters have been driven from the country in the past 14 years and over 100,000 driven from the land.  Am I not entitled to make that argument? If the Minister could say they were getting results from higher taxation in the form of more jobs and less emigration and that they built sufficient houses for the people, we could give the Government credit: but when the reverse is the case, am I not entitled to argue that the Government's policy has been a failure and that we have not benefited by the increased taxation?</P>

      <P>I have nothing to withdraw.  I am quoting a statement which was made by a former Taoiseach, and I intend to ask the present Minister for Finance how Fianna Fáil kept the promise that was made at that time that they would not increase taxation above the 1953 level.  Is it not true that instead of not increasing taxation above the 1953 level they have increased it from £87 million or so to £450 million now?  Can he give us any valid reason why a Taoiseach would come into this House, make such an important statement to the Irish people, why he would fool them and that the Minister would have the audacity to stand up here and say Fianna Fáil, the true Republican Party, never misled the people: &ldquo;We are here because we have always told the truth to the people.&rdquo;  I have heard the Minister say that inside the last two or three months.  He always refers to the <Col N="169" /> true Republican Party.  Now you have one of these Republicans quite recently saying some of them never joined a local security force and that they are in the Republican Party because they are hurlers or footballers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy care to enlighten us?  Could we suggest the reference made to Deputy Lemass was based on a statement made by a prominent member of the inter-Party Government to the effect that the inter-Party Government would reduce taxation and that they failed to do so? Would that be correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am not denying that, but they increased taxation by only £1 million or £2 million. Fianna Fáil made a promise, when it was £87 million, to leave it at £87 million, and they have kept that promise by increasing it to £450 million. Mr. Lemass went on to say that if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burden on the taxpayer.  That important statement was made in this House in May, 1956.  As I have already informed the House, that promise was kept by increasing taxation by £370 million.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest difficulties facing us today and one of the greatest dangers facing us on the eve, almost, of negotiations for entry to the Common Market, is our high-price economy which has been forced on the people by the Government's high taxation policy &mdash;by reducing the food subsidies by £16 million, by the turnover tax of 2½ per cent which was imposed in 1963 on food and on all necessaries of life and which was doubled in the recent Budget, by the extravagant increase in the cost of administration at Government level and also the high cost of local taxation.  I remember when rates were six shillings in the £ and we were promised complete derating by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <P>Local taxation has nothing to do with the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time only £5 million was collected in rates.  Last <Col N="170" /> year £50 million was collected.  It would have to be admitted by all concerned, by industrialists and workers, that many of our exports are being priced not only out of the British market but out of some of our home markets.  Many of our industrial products, due to high Government taxation, are much higher priced even at home than they are in Common Market countries.  Due to the increased taxation which takes place every year and due to the Government's economic policy it is impossible for industrialists to plan ahead because they do not know where they stand.  Government taxation policy affects all spheres of our economy and drives up costs of production for our industrialists, our farmers and indeed for all our people from one year to another.</P>
      <P>The flabby cost structure has been inflated like a balloon and there is a serious danger that the balloon will burst.  The Government's financial policy has been calculated, both in regard to its timing and its general direction, to raise prices and to raise costs while the opposite is what we need at present.  We want stability so that everybody can plan ahead for the more competitive period which lies ahead.  We require greater encouragement for our industrialists and our farmers, who are also important producers and exporters.  Instead, they do not know where they stand from one year to another in regard to taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe in an incomes policy.  We believe everybody should get a fair share of the national cake.  We believe something to which Fianna Fáil often pay lip service and that is that all our children should be cherished equally. If we had an incomes policy taxation would be more evenly distributed on all sections of the people.  It would be a fairer system than that which we have at present.  The majority of wage and salary earners and those taxed under the PAYE system have a sense of acute grievance because they are paying tax on 20s in the £ of their income under a set of restrictive rules. It is well-known that other sections of the community can and do evade their responsibilities.  If all sections of the <Col N="171" /> community were caught in the income tax web through an incomes policy then income tax and other taxes, and perhaps turnover tax, could be reduced. It is time, because of the situation that has arisen whereby we are dependent for direct tax revenue on wage and salary earners to an inequitable extent, that a fresh look should be taken at the whole concept of taxation.  Those people are probably the most sorely affected section also as far as indirect and other taxes are concerned.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1965 we advocated an incomes policy.  It might be no harm to quote from volume 217, column 1557, of the Official Report for 15th July, 1965, when Deputy Lemass stated:</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and some other Deputies were referring to what they called a national incomes policy.  I wish Deputies who use this vague phrase would attempt to tell us what they understand by it and attempt to define it in more precise terms. I believe this is a phrase used by lazy people to conceal the absence of thought and understanding of this situation.  At best, it represents a process of wishful thinking, the hope that some magic formula will emerge out of the air which will solve all these problems and introduce the golden era in which after their day's work employers and workers will be dancing around maypoles together.  So far as I know, no satisfactory incomes policy of the kind Deputies appear to be thinking of has emerged in any free democracy.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it is now a phrase used by lazy people because the Taoiseach and the Government have now been converted to the idea of an incomes policy.  It is a pity that they did not try to make some headway in regard to an incomes policy in 1965 when Deputy Cosgrave advocated it here.  If we had an incomes policy taxation would rest more fairly and more justly on all sections, everybody would be more or less caught in the web and we would not have to increase turnover tax from 2½ per cent <Col N="172" /> to 5 per cent and in all probability wage earners could get a reduction in income tax.  One thing which is certain is that the wage earner is caught and he cannot evade even one penny of his liability.  His total income is known and income tax is assessed on it and he has no way out.  It is a pity that the Government did not introduce an incomes policy back in 1965.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government have to impose this huge burden of taxation on the people is due to the stop-go policy of the Government over the years.  It is all due to the terrible inflationary policy of the Government which they have pursued since they came back to office in 1956.  They have at their disposal a highly effective weapon which, if properly used, can create and expand wealth internally and attract wealth from foreign sources also.  I refer to the use of taxation. Fianna Fáil have used taxation as an instrument for destroying and discouraging wealth instead of using it to attract wealth to this country.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, welcome the Government's conversion to a situation in which taxation is being used to encourage industrial enterprise. We proposed this type of taxation in 1956.  Two Bills were introduced, one by the late Deputy Norton and the other by the late Deputy Sweetman, to give tax concessions to people to set up industries and exports.  We had had for a number of years the Control of Manufactures Acts.  Certain tax concessions were given in the West of Ireland which were not applicable to other parts of the country.  The two Deputies concerned were satisfied that, instead of having Irish boys and girls forced to emigrate to earn their living in Birmingham or Coventry, we could, through the proper use of the tax system here and with the aid of tax incentives, encourage industrialists and the people with technical knowhow from abroad to come here to invest their wealth and to build factories here.  We had the people to man the factories.</P>
    <P>Those two Bills came before this House.  Deputy Lemass, then leader of the Opposition, opposed them vigorously. I defy the present Minister for <Col N="173" /> Finance to say that it is not true that Deputy Lemass, when he was leader of the Opposition, got up and said he believed that at some future date he would be in a position to wipe those Bills off the Statute Book.  He also said that the moment he came back to office he would do so.  I ask the Minister for Finance is it not true that the then leader of the Opposition said this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I said there were two Bills, one introduced by the late Deputy Norton and the other by the late Deputy Sweetman. The aim of the two Bills was to give to industrialists outside the western areas tax incentives which would encourage them to set up factories which would employ our own people. The leader of the Opposition at that time, Deputy Lemass, made that statement. I am glad to say that the Fianna Fáil Party afterwards approved of the work done at that time and to their credit they increased the tax incentives which were given.  That work was well done.  The late Deputies Sweetman and Norton did excellent work in introducing those Bills.</P>
      <P>Less than a year after those Bills had passed through this House the Whitegate oil refinery was established. It brought £12 million into this country. We were using our taxation in a proper manner to encourage industrialists to come in from abroad.  The Government have continued and expanded that industry.  It gives employment to Irish people at home.  We are proud of anything which gives employment to our own people.  We started the Shannon Scheme also which provided power for the industrial revolution which took place and we were told it was a white elephant.</P>

      <P>An insured person who has less than 156 employment contributions paid in respect of him is entitled to disability benefit for a period of not more than 52 weeks.  The insured person referred to in the question has had only 36 employment contributions paid in respect of him since he entered insurance on 8th November, 1965.  He was paid disability benefit for a period of 52 weeks from 22nd October, 1968, to 20th October, 1969, and he cannot re-qualify for any payment of disability benefit until a further 13 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him.</P>
