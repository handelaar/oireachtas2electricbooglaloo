    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening contribution last night I made the point that the opposition in this country to the European Economic Community and to Irish membership has been based on a number of delusions: that the EEC was invented by capitalists for their own benefit; that it was organised for the benefit of the great Powers and was disastrous for less-developed countries; that weak industries will go to the wall and that the law of the jungle will prevail.  I proceeded to rebut those propositions and pointed out that in all cases they were the opposite of the truth as could be seen by even a simple examination of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested that the objections that are made are based on a failure to grasp the nature of the Community and a failure to grasp the concept of multi-level sovereignty.  This is a revival of an older concept and is one not familiar to the peoples of Europe in the last three centuries.  I spoke also of the support given to the EEC in its early stages by the politicians of the <Col N="1929" /> left in Europe and particularly the socialist parties.  I should like to add that the commission which is in the process of being appointed contains some outstanding socialist leaders in Europe: the German socialist leader, Herr Haferkamp, formerly Vice-President of the German Trade Unions, and the Dutch socialist, Dr. Sicco Mansholt, former Dutch Minister for Agriculture, whose proposals on agriculture have been so distorted.  I might add that Dr. Mansholt's life has been dedicated to raising the living standards of farmers and he rejects the conservative policies that condemn farmers to perpetual doles and misery.  The latest appointment is that of the Italian socialist, Dr. Spinelli, the right-hand man of Signor Nenni before he entered the Italian Government.  Signor Spinelli has been a constructive critic of the European Communities for many years but nevertheless in view of the role the Communities have to play and desirous of playing his part in making them work democratically he has accepted an appointment to the Commission.  There is also the president of the Commission, Signor Malfatti, who is a Christian Democrat of the left.</P>
    <P>These are four of the nine men who have just been appointed to the Commission and they will formulate policy in the years ahead.  They are men who should command the respect of socialists and who see the Communities as capable of developing on democratic lines if guided by people who are concerned with such progress.</P>
    <P>I have been reading an interesting article in a journal which I think ought to be in the Library of this House, and I shall so propose later.  In the April issue of <i>Agenor,</i> the European review of younger left-wing people in Europe, there is an article which I commend to my colleagues on the right, and in this debate they are in both senses on the right.  The article is entitled <i>La gauche découvre l'Europe.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all a question of relativity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would want to be careful because if he keeps leaning over any more he is in trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1930" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to lean that far to the right in any circumstances.  I shall read a summary of this article.  In referring to the forces of the left in Europe it states that the parties of the left appear to be waking up in face of the facts.  It states that politics in the seventies will be carried on increasingly in a European setting. However, this should not preclude action being taken at national, regional or local level.  Important decisions are being taken for the whole of Europe, if not for the entire world, by multinational groups and, following them, by governments more and more worried at seeing their economic power being gently removed beyond their frontiers.  The article points to this new, albeit diffident and naive, approach to political action on the part of the forces of the left.</P>
      <P>There is much in the article that responds to the spirit of the statements made by the Labour Party.  It is an article that recognises the fact that Europe is being created and this new Europe is going to influence everybody inside and outside the Community.  If we wish to ensure that it takes a course that will not be adverse for us, and we will be affected just as much by it outside as inside, then we should get in, become involved and play our part.</P>
      <P>In my view, what Ireland needs comes down to certain fundamentals. Because of our position as a small country, having to import half our needs, at the mercy of the trade winds of the world and at the mercy of the policies of the great powers on which depend peace or war, what Ireland needs is a voice in the policies of the great European powers, a voice that would help to restrain them from exercising their sovereignty to the disadvantage of weak countries like ours and from pursuing traditional policies that have led in the past to war and to colonialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An aspiration on our part to play a part in the formulation of their policies, to encourage them when they are right and to inhibit them when they are wrong, would have been regarded a quarter of a century ago as being an absurd aspiration.  No one at that time would have thought it possible for such <Col N="1931" /> a course of action to be open to this country.  Twenty-five years ago in the wake of the First World War we had a world divided among warring nationalities who pursued policies which were sometimes right and often wrong but were in any event in their own interests without having regard to the interests of others.  We were at the mercy of those forces but by the grace of God we avoided involvement in that war.  It might have been otherwise; it might be otherwise in a future conflict but we had no role to play that would have influenced them in any way at that time.  We did attempt to play our part in the League of Nations and it was a constructive part played by the first and second Governments.  Ireland was one of the countries which upheld the principle of collective security when it was being brushed aside by the great powers but our role then was a limited one because in a body like the League of Nations or like the United Nations today, the voice of one small country raised can have some little influence but it can have no great power.</P>
    <P>We are offered now an opportunity of not only influencing events by our voice but of actually playing a part in the decisions, in some cases helping to formulate the decisions, voting for decisions and throwing in our weight in favour of decisions that we wish to see being adopted, while in other cases inhibiting decisions that we believe to be contrary to the interests of the world and to the interests of this small peaceloving country.  Assuming all goes well in so far as these negotiations are concerned, we now have the opportunity of this participation in a Community in which the great powers of Europe accept, astonishingly, binding obligations for the first time in history.  They accept the obligations not to discriminate against their weaker neighbours, obligations to pay fair and equal prices for the products of the other members, obligations not to discriminate against the goods or nationals of other members or of smaller countries, obligations to prevent large cartels from getting control of trade and to prevent monopolies from abusing their power internationally.  They accept the obligation <Col N="1932" /> to secure the more rapid growth of the peripheral regions of the Community which have tended to fall behind, where living standards are lower than in the rest of the Community. They accept obligations to secure more rapid economic growth not only in the peripheral regions of the great powers themselves but in the peripheral regions of the smaller countries who join with them in the Community.</P>
    <P>These are the commitments that these countries have entered into.  They are commitments that are binding on them.  When we hear it said from other benches that if we join the Community, we shall be bound by decisions, we accept that this is true, but so also are bound in a way in which they cannot otherwise be bound, the great powers. Once they have accepted the Community's constitution and decision-making process they have no alternative but to accept the decisions taken by the Community within the limits and within the framework of the Community.</P>
    <P>They can no longer exercise their power arbitrarily to the benefit of their own nationals and to the detriment of those of other countries within the Community, smaller or weaker than themselves.  They have agreed to these supranational institutions having power to bind them.  They have given up their right of veto over new decisions within the economic and social field.  They have agreed also, and of this we have not heard much from other sides of the House during this debate, that the smaller countries shall, together, have a power of veto over proposals for changes in these policies proposed by the great powers.</P>
    <P>We know how these Communities work.  We have seen them working for the past 12 years.  Fears have been expressed that they might change their course.  Attempts might be made to do so but if attempts are made to change their course by modifying the policies that exist at the moment these policies can be changed only by a qualified majority of the member States, a majority of such a character that we and other countries like us could join together to prevent such changes being made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> Within that Community the great powers have not the power to change these policies to our detriment or to the detriment of other small countries if we and the other small countries disagree.  As far as agricultural policy is concerned, the industrial countries have not the power to change these policies unless we and the other agricultural countries agree, because we, whether as a group of small countries or whether as a group of agricultural countries, have a power of vetoing changes in policy.</P>
    <P>This is something that must be told to the Irish people in plain terms.  The people should know how this Community works.  They should know that what is there now cannot be changed save with the consent of a qualified majority&mdash;a majority that could not be found if we and the other small countries voted against it.  They should know also that if we enter this Community we accept the obligations to move towards political unity and that the policies to be pursued in any political union must be settled by unanimous agreement because if we go beyond the Treaty of Rome into the field of foreign policy as we are committed to doing, it will be done on terms agreeable to us and to the other member countries.  It should be made clear to everybody&mdash;the Government have done this in a shaky sort of way&mdash; that if we go into this Community, we are accepting an obligation to move towards a common foreign policy and it must be clear that that is a moral obligation that would be imposed on us.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Treaty of Rome to bind us to that effect, but for us to go in without accepting such an obligation would be dishonest and dishonourable and if it were to be suggested for a moment that that was our intention, we would be unacceptable. However, that does not mean that we are forced to accept some form of political union or some type of foreign policy that other countries want but which does not suit us because before such a political union would be formed, a treaty would have to be signed with the unanimous agreement of the member States.  We could raise our voice then and we could <Col N="1934" /> make sure that the political union was of a democratic character.</P>
    <P>If such a political union were to formulate a foreign policy, we would have a right to seek assurances in advance that this foreign policy would be peaceful and if it is the wish of the Irish people that the attitude we should take up in Europe should be one of neutrality by the great powers, then we have a right to require that that should be part of that foreign policy.</P>
    <P>There is no question of our being dragged into something that would be forced upon us against our will.  Within the framework of the Treaty of Rome decisions will be taken by a majority. There will be times when decisions will be taken by majorities and when we will be in the minority on matters contemplated by the Treaty and we must accept that.  We must accept also that we are going to go beyond that political union and move towards the stage when Europe will have a common foreign policy but on terms agreeable to us because, in setting that up, we, like every other member country, will be able to veto any proposal which is of a kind we regard as unacceptable to our democratic and peaceloving principles and there is no one in that Community who will raise a voice against us in doing so.  We must, of course, make it clear that we are fully prepared to go the whole way on those terms. If a political union is proposed which is democratic in character, and if it is proposed to formulate a foreign policy which is peaceloving and which meets the wishes of this House and of the people and which, it is believed, is one that will keep us out of involvement in the struggle between the great powers, we will be entitled to put forward that view and have that view incorporated in the treaty to be agreed with unanimity.  It is important that this should be said.  There is great confusion about this&mdash;constant confusion for the last ten years&mdash;as to what this treaty involves us in, and the Government, although they have at times had dragged out of them various statements, all a little self-contradictory, have never explained clearly to the Irish people what is involved.  I think this needs to be done and, in default of <Col N="1935" /> the Government doing so, it is up to the Opposition, to this party, at any rate, to do so because, so far, we have not had very much clarity from either the Government benches or the Labour benches.</P>
    <P>This Community is one that has many defects.  I shall come back to this later.  I do not want any suggestion that we should enter this Community in a mood of euphoria.  There are many defects which will have to be remedied : inadequate democratic control, a supranational Commission still not sufficiently independent of national pressures, a lack af adequate emphasis on social progress and an inadequate regional policy.  I submit that these are defects of great importance and I shall come to them later in more detail.</P>
    <P>There are these defects in the Community at the present time, but they are remediable defects, in a grand design intended to create an international order, at least in one corner of the world, an order of justice and peace, of equity and of respect for the rights of smaller countries.  What the EEC gives us is a massive extension of our sovereignty.  It gives us the power to prevent any further exploitation of our people by a former colonial power, using economic policies to pursue aims detrimental to the interests of this country.  It gives us a right to a voice in decisions about the future, a voice five times larger than that warranted by our population, for we will have one Minister in ten exercising a voting strength representing 5 per cent of the voting strength in the Council of Ministers for a country that has barely 1 per cent of the population of the Community. We will have one Commissioner in 14, one-seventh of the voting strength for 1 per cent of the population of the Community.  We will have 30 parliamentarians out of 624, again 5 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sticking to facts.  These are the proposals being put forward to our Government by the <Col N="1936" /> Community.  These are the proposals they are making to us.  Perhaps we can better them in the negotiations, but they cannot be made worse at this stage because they are what they are proposing to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is the offer being made to us and agreed in the negotiating package being put forward by the Community to us.  Personally, I regard it as so generous from the point of view of the institutions that I believe we should sign quickly, before they have second thoughts about it.  If the Labour Party thinks we should try and negotiate something better they are entitled to their view.  If they think we should try to get 6 per cent or 7 per cent for our 1 per cent of population, fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us face the fact that what we are being offered, what has been put to us by this Community at this time, is that our voting strength should be five times&mdash;in the Commission seven times, but in other areas five times&mdash;the voting strength of the total population of the Community. That is a not ungenerous offer to a small country and, as the other small countries are similarly overweighted in their voting power and, as the qualifying majority voting system gives a right of veto to a group of countries controlling a minority of votes against changes to their detriment, the small countries, which have only a fraction of the population of the Community as a whole, either in the existing Community or in the enlarged Community, have a right of veto over the voting power of countries with three and four times their population.  These are the facts that need to be put forward when we talk about loss of sovereignty. It is an extension of sovereignty; it gives us a voice in Europe out of all proportion to the population of this country in recognition of the fact that Ireland is a nation and, as a nation, it deserves a voice beyond that of other populations which lack the characteristics of nationhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> Sovereignty is the right to decide one's international political relationships, but a right without power to exercise it is valueless, and what we have discovered in 50 years of political independence is that the rights we gained have little value in international relationships with other countries and, above all, in relation to the colonial power from which we freed ourselves 50 years ago because the economic situation we inherited, which we have failed to change despite successive Governments adopting different policies, is one of total economic dependence on Britain.  There is no similar relationship between any two independent nations on earth of such great dependence.  As I mentioned before in this House, the only case I have ever come across is the case of Mauritius and the United Kingdom. Mauritius may at this stage be an independent state but, apart from it&mdash;it is a rather dubious example&mdash;there is no other case similar to ours and so, because of the fact that we depend, even today with a growing diversification of our trade, which has been achieved, on Britain for two-thirds of our export markets, that leaves us in this position of economic dependence.</P>
    <P>We have political sovereignty.  That is why we are debating this.  Had we not got this political sovereignty there would be no debate but, as many speakers have said, Labour speakers especially, we have the right to stay out.  However, the consequences of staying out are such that we have, in fact, no alternative but to go in.  This can be regarded as a poor culmination of 50 years of political independence. This may be arguable, but I am not clear what other policies would have secured substantially different results.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins wholeheartedly in saying that, in signing the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;which, contrary to a statement in one of this morning's papers, was not supported by Fine Gael in this House&mdash;the Government aggravated our dependence on Britain. That could have been avoided but, apart from that, it is not clear what positive steps could have been taken to diversify our trade relations that <Col N="1938" /> have not been taken.  We could argue the details of this but I myself think that inadequate use was made of legislation passed about seven years ago to enable us to make better bargains with Eastern European countries. I have argued that before.  But I am realistic enough to recognise that, had the fullest use been made of those powers, it would not have affected our exports by more than 1 or 2 per cent; it would, in fact, have left our dependence on Britain substantially unchanged. I do not know what other policies could have got rid of that dependence.  Some policies might have altered it marginally.  Somebody else will have to tell us what could have been done.  I do not know.  We would have to deal with it country by country and see on what assumptions as to the growth of trade in different countries we could have secured any significant change in our dependence on Britain.</P>
    <P>I believe, however, that we could have avoided aggravating that dependence by the Free Trade Area Agreement, an agreement which should not have been signed and which can only be justified, as Deputy O'Higgins said in the debate at the time and again yesterday, in the context of the imminent membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Should this bid for membership fail, and God forbid, that agreement will leave us in a disastrous position <i>vis-à-vis</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not vote for this agreement in this House, as was stated this morning.  They made clear the dangers.  In not voting against it, we were doing so on the basis that this country would be joining the EEC and that, as a preparation for the EEC, and that alone, could this agreement be justified but, because of the risks involved, we did not support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall come later to the consequences <Col N="1939" /> of staying out of the EEC, the alternatives, but they are clearly so disastrous that they cannot be faced.  To stay out when Britain joins would leave us in a position of utter economic disaster.  I will develop that point and I trust to prove it to the satisfaction of everyone later on. Because of that, our sovereignty, the right to stay out, which we certainly have, is inexercisable since it can be exercised only at the cost of destroying this Irish community, of creating economic conditions in which the emigration of the late 1950s, which was at a rate equivalent to 85 per cent of our school leaving population going each year, would appear paltry by comparison with what would follow if we remained outside the Community when Britain joined it.  It is not practical politics for us to stay out.  That is a fact that has to be faced. There are some people who would join simply because of that.  There are others&mdash;and my party and I are among them&mdash;who feel that the Community offers great opportunities. Whether one accepts that thesis or not the fact is that there is no alternative to joining at this point in time.</P>
    <P>Britain's sovereignty, on the other hand, is not inexercisable.  Britain, because of her economic power and strength, can exercise her sovereignty to our disadvantage and has done so with the normal disregard for the interest of other countries, which is a characteristic of power politics everywhere, no more and no less.  I make no particular criticism of the British Government for this.  The policies they have been following have been no more detrimental to us than the policies that any other great power would have followed. They have at times shown us more consideration than other countries would have.  I have often thought and said that if one had to be colonised by somebody I suppose the British were the least objectionable.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that Britain has pursued those policies, which have had the effect of exploiting this country. They have established and maintained since independence a neo-colonial relationship with this country by virtue of <Col N="1940" /> their agricultural policies which force down the price of agricultural produce in this country, which have left our agriculture in a position of permanent poverty and which have prevented this country from achieving the kind of prosperity which in conditions of free and equal competition it would have achieved.</P>
    <P>Britain exercises her sovereignty in this way.  She has the power to do so and she has no inhibitions about doing so.  I would define sovereignty as a weapon the big use against the weak, the strong use against the weak.  It has no other function because sovereignty of itself is useless if one has not the power to exercise it.  The problem of this country is not that we have not enough sovereignty.  We have too much sovereignty, more than we can use or can find anything to do with.  The problem for us is that Britain also has too much sovereignty, too much for our taste, too much for our good health, and Britain exercises that sovereignty against our interests.</P>
    <P>The only way we can solve this problem is by securing a diminution of British sovereignty that will deprive Britain of the right to exploit this country.  That precisely is what the European Community does.  It is extraordinary, looked at from our point of view as a small weak country in this position <i>vis-á-vis</i> Britain, that this situation should have arisen, that this opportunity should arise.  It is an extraordinary thing, looking back over eight centuries of Irish history and looking back over 50 years of independence, that we should now find ourselves with this opportunity given to us on a plate, because Britain for her own reasons wishes to join&mdash;at least, the British Government and the British Opposition wish to join, whatever about the British people at this point in time. The British wish to join but in joining they would be giving up this sovereignty, the right to exploit us, and if we join with them we can benefit from this.  This is a unique bonus.  It might never have happened.  We might have passed another 1,000 years in the kind of relationship of economic dependence combined with the theoretical political independence we have had <Col N="1941" /> for the last 50 years, but by the grace of God the world has taken a different course and we are now given this extraordinary opportunity of benefiting from an abrogation of British sovereignty which will remove Britain's power to exploit this country once and for all.  There are people in this country who would turn their back on that and who wish to remain outside the Community so that Britain's power to exploit us would be retained and so that the consequences of that exploitation from being damaging, as they are now, would become disastrous.</P>
    <P>We have never faced those realities. Ever since the Treaty debate&mdash;and I have no wish to raise issues in the past because what I have to say is fair criticism of both sides of the Treaty debate&mdash;we have been concerned with irrelevant symbols.  We have not lived in a real world.  We have lived in an unreal world, ignoring facts, ignoring realities, pretending that political sovereignty is everything, ignoring the realities of uneconomic relationships. Our independence movement was, perhaps, unique in that it was a movement of intellectuals and poets and, necessarily, gunmen, but a movement that contained no economists.  I make no vast claims for economists but they have their small part to play.  They can bring people back to earth with thumps which are often painful and which, indeed, make economists very unpopular, a particular hazard being a political economist, of course.</P>
    <P>The national movement contained no economists and there was a complete lack of economic realities in the national movement with the single exception of Arthur Griffith who saw clearly the need to protect Irish industries although his policies were not, unfortunately, followed by the first government but were followed by the second, later on, a debt they have never particularly acknowledged, may I say.  Throughout our history we have, until the last ten years, failed to face economic realities.  It is only in the last decade that we have faced them and by facing them we have made progress. Credit must be given to the present Government for the work they have done in that sphere for economic <Col N="1942" /> progress has been achieved because the Government have faced some of those economic realities.  They have not done it at times very intelligently or adequately. One might criticise them at great length on the subject.  But they have, in fact, made and secured progress by facing economic realities.  This has been true of all parties.  It has been true of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Economic realities have been faced in the last ten years.  Let us face them now.  Let us face the international economic realities now.  Let us not pretend that we have the economic freedom to do as we like.  Those who oppose entry to the EEC proclaim that the loss of sovereignty would deprive us of the right to protect industry and this is perfectly true.  It will, however, also deprive Britain of the right to exploit Irish agriculture.  The real question, the only relevant question, is what are the relative benefits and losses of those two exercises.  I am not aware of any attempt being made either by the Government or by those who oppose Irish entry to quantify those gains and losses.</P>
    <P>Of course, precise quantification in this field is not easy but in every country which has a reasonably competent public administration and a reasonably competent government, economic quantifications of this kind are made as a basis of policy.  In another country it would be unthinkable for a government to undertake the kind of negotiations we are undertaking without trying to assess the gains and losses.  It is possible to quantify them, not with precise accuracy, but to an order of magnitude sufficient that if you find the gains exceed the losses by two to one on a rough approximation you can be reasonably sure that even if there are margins of error in both figures, the balance of advantage lies on that side.</P>
    <P>This exercise has not been carried out.  I should like to ask why not.  If the Government wish to persuade the people of Ireland that entry to the EEC would benefit us at least they should tell us the benefits, should quantify them, and produce some figures.  Indeed, if other people wish to oppose entry the least they can do is <Col N="1943" /> to do their bit of quantification and tell us what the losses will be.</P>
    <P>I have made a crude attempt at this. I admit it is crude.  I have not the resources the Government have and I have not given it the time I should have done, but on a crude quantification of this&mdash;and I am more than willing to discuss this in detail although this House is not the place to go into details of economic calculation&mdash;I calculate roughly that Britain's power to influence us adversely through exercising her sovereignty is worth twice as much, that is, is twice as damaging to us, as our power to protect ourselves from Britain through a protection policy is worth to us.</P>
    <P>I would assess at this moment, on a very rough quantification, that the immediately direct consequences of Irish protection, that is the direct impact on the people directly employed as distinct from the indirect impact through the multiplier effect of their spending on other groups in the Community, at about £30 million a year.  I would assess the effects of British exploitation of the Irish economy at about £60 million a year.  Those are rough calculations. I am willing to go into them in detail with anybody who wants to do so and to refine them somewhat because they need some refining.</P>
    <P>I am throwing them out as the best guess I can make as someone who has some concern with this side of things and is used to working with figures to do with the Irish economy.  I should like to ask the Government what are their figures.  We are entitled to know what they are.  I should like to ask those who oppose this what are their figures, and how they arrive at them? In the meantime, pending figures from any other source in this House, I suggest tentatively that my figures might provide some basis for discussion until somebody contradicts them and produces evidence to the contrary.  On the basis of those figures it is clear to me that sovereignty is an expensive luxury for this country, in its extreme form. The right to protect our industries in the early days of independence was vital.  I regard it as providential and necessary that we secured complete <Col N="1944" /> political independence for a period of half a century and that we were able to protect our industries which did not previously exist, to build up industries behind protection.  Had we not had that power, had we moved from participation in the United Kingdom, straight into the European Economic Community, our position would be very different, indeed, and there could then, perhaps, be arguments made for staying out, but it would be a very difficult case to make, even then.</P>
    <P>We have had, fortunately, and in God's good providence, 50 years of independence.  Throughout most of that time we protected industrial development.  We built up industries in this country which provided us with a substantial industrial base.  Of course, those industries as first established were weak.  The new industrialists were men of no experience.  They produced goods that were often of poor quality and they produced them inefficiently, even within the limits of what was then possible.  As time went on, however, that changed.  As time went on, they gained experience.  They were replaced by their sons or successors, by professional management, by people who learned their trade, having been sent away to other countries to learn it, who have come back here and who now produce goods whose quality is second to none.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that there is now any general complaint about the quality of Irish goods.  From my own experience in dealing with industrial problems I have come across at least one case where the problem with Irish goods was that the quality was too high or that excessive attempts were made to achieve too high a level of quality with results that they were detrimental in competition with goods elsewhere.  The problem of efficiency in the narrow sense of producing a particular range of goods efficiently has been largely overcome.</P>
    <P>Most of our firms attain a level of efficiency comparable with that of other countries.  Of course, by the standards of perfection they are not efficient.  One can always apply two standards of efficiency in any enterprise, whether it is a public service <Col N="1945" /> department or a State company or an industry.  By the standards of perfection every Irish industry is less than perfect, but by the standards of other countries, within the limits of the kind of production in which they are engaged, it is my belief, from the experience I have had, which has been reasonably wide, that the standard of efficiency is as high as elsewhere and it is in many Irish firms higher than in many firms abroad.</P>
    <P>We do, however, face a problem, not of inefficiency in the sense of not doing the job to be done efficiently, but one that arises because the small size of the home market has forced on us too wide a range of goods so that we have difficulty in competing.  That has to be changed and that is the problem of adaptation.  It is not a problem really of efficiency in the strict sense. It is not a problem of quality.  It is a problem of changing the structure of Irish industry to orientate it towards specialised production for export rather than, as at present, towards the production of a wide range of goods for the home market.  This is the problem to be tackled.</P>
    <P>We fortunately had the opportunity to protect industry for a period, but protection is not a policy for an indefinite future.  It is not a permanent policy.  It was never envisaged as such. It was never suggested that it should be kept permanently.  Behind protective walls firms have things too easy and they do not make the effort they should make.  They cannot be persuaded to export and to benefit the economy by exporting because it is too easy to make profits at home. There are these difficulties.  Protection is a policy which is essential for the development of an industrial sector in a country which has not got one.  I do not believe, whatever other economic views there may be, that industries can be built up with subsidies and without protection.  In practice, some form of protection is required. However, the maintenance of that protection indefinitely results in a weak industrial structure, incapable of competition and incapable of performing its job of serving the country by exporting <Col N="1946" /> and by developing exports to other countries on a scale that will bring in the purchasing power needed to buy the goods required for our standard of living.</P>
    <P>We have had 50 years of independence. We have had 38 years of protection. We have had, in fact, a full generation of protection.  I do not know how long protection should last to give the optimum results and when it should be phased out, I have read no textbook on this, but from sheer observation of the Irish situation I believe that protection, given the interruption of the war, should have lasted fully and without any inhibitions for about 20 years and then a process of phasing out should have started.  It did not, due to defects of policy in the 1950s.  We continued the policy of protection. Irish industry was not pushed, pulled or dragged out into the export markets at that stage, and some of the stagnation of the 1950s is due to that particular failure in policy on the part of our Governments here.  I believe that after 20 years protection should be gradually reduced but should not, of course, be phased out completely, save in the context of some kind of agreement with other countries that they would do likewise, an agreement bringing comparable benefits in return. One would not normally hope for an agreement bringing benefits twice as large as what one would give up in giving up protection at a late stage in this process of developing new industries but that is what, in fact, as far as I can judge, we are offered, what we are likely to secure at this stage because the losses in giving up industrial protection at an advanced stage, such as what we are at now, are much less than they would have been earlier and because the benefits of fair treatment for Irish agriculture are so great that the gains we can secure at this point look like exceeding the losses by two to one.  If anybody wants to quarrel with that figure they can do so and let us have a confrontation of data on the subject but on the information available to me, making use of CIO reports and the Second Programme consultations with industry on the one hand, and looking at the structure of Irish agricultural price levels in <Col N="1947" /> this country and price levels in Britain and in the EEC, it seems to me that the order of magnitude of the gains is about twice the possible losses.</P>
    <P>The sovereignty whose retention secures gains of, say, £30 million but deprives one of gains of £60 million in return, and which secures gains in the urban centres but deprives one of gains throughout rural Ireland, in a country where we wish to protect, preserve and develop the rural parts of our country, is a very peculiar policy.  It is a wrong-headed policy and it involves attaching importance to the symbol of sovereignty rather than the reality.  Sovereignty is a means to an end.  There is nothing in absolute sovereignty which is valuable for its own sake.  We are a sovereign State because we needed to be a sovereign state in the interests of our people.  We needed to exercise that sovereignty for the benefit of our people.  If, by giving up some part of this sovereignty and securing, in return, part of a sovereignty over a western Europe of 300,000,000 people, we can benefit our people far more than we disadvantage them, then surely if we have any common sense at all we make that change?</P>
    <P>It is a question of extending our sovereignty on the one hand and getting benefits far greater than the losses involved through giving up a small part of our sovereignty.  It is only a small part.  Talk of the Treaty of Rome replacing the Constitution is wide of the mark as has been said on both sides of the House.  The Treaty of Rome concerns itself with very important areas, certainly, of economic and social life.  It does not concern itself with foreign policy, with political union, with cultural affairs.  All these aspects are left over.  They are matters to be settled by other means. Many of them are matters which are solely appropriate to the individual nation to settle for itself.  The Treaty of Rome is concerned with economic and social matters and that is the area in which we give up limited sovereignty in return for an extension to the rest of Europe of our sovereignty over those areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> So far, I have spoken of the positive effects of entry, given a free choice.  I feel the case for entry, given a free choice, is conclusive on those grounds alone.  What about the negative effects of not entering?  I have referred to this briefly before.  It has not had sufficient airing in this House to my mind to date in this debate.  What are the consequences of staying out?  We have not heard anything from the Labour benches on this.  It is dealt with in a pamphlet by Anthony Coughlan which is a very useful and full statement of the arguments against joining the EEC.  Mr. Coughlan, of the Common Market study group, is to be complimented on producing this.  One of our difficulties in 1961 and, to a lesser extent, in 1967 was the absence of any adequate statement of the case against. While I will happily try to refute virtually everything in the pamphlet it is very useful to have it to refute because if there is not a case made on the other side, one is in a difficulty in presenting the position to the Irish people.  If we did not have opponents of the calibre of Mr. Coughlan I do not think we could get across to the Irish people what is involved.  It would be disastrous if we joined this Community without our people understanding what is involved.  If after we had joined and when we suffered some of the disadvantages which are certainly there, as well as there being advantages, the Irish people should come back to their political leaders and say: &ldquo;You did not tell us what it was all about; you did not tell us this or that would happen&rdquo; we would all be in trouble and rightly so.  It is not easy to make a case for something unless there are people putting up counter-arguments.  I welcome the initiative in putting this forward.  In 1961 and 1962, in discussing this issue in public myself, I recall the difficulty of getting people to controvert with.  In fact, I remember the first time I heard Deputy Thornley was when he spoke against the Common Market in Trinity College.  I was so delighted to find somebody to controvert with that I persuaded the <i>Irish Times</i> and RTE to lay on controversies between the pair of us on the subject to get some kind of discussion going.  I have an idea it was the <Col N="1949" /> first time Deputy Thornley appeared on RTE, but not the last.</P>
    <P>This case then is useful.  We have not heard from the Labour benches what they think the effects of not entering would be, how they think we should cope with them, beyond a suggestion about association.  However, Mr. Coughlan has made the case here and I think we should look at it. Let us take it phrase by phrase. Because the case is made much more fully here than anything said from the other benches I am using this as my stalking horse.</P>
    <P>Mr. Coughlan starts off by saying:</P>
    <P>If Britain joins the Common Market, the only course which would preserve for the Irish people some control of their own affairs would be for Ireland to stay out, aligning ourselves with the smaller European countries and retaining freedom of action to diversify our trade, reduce our excessive dependence on Britain...</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;aligning ourselves with smaller European countries&rdquo; mean? He does not explain it.  Does it mean trading with Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Iceland?  What is our trade with those countries?  It is 2 per cent of our total trade.  We are to align ourselves with a group who buy 2 per cent of our exports&mdash;1/35th of our exports to the United Kingdom.  Where the other 34/35ths is to come from is not stated. Even if this were possible&mdash;which it is not because of the provisions of GATT &mdash;just consider the relationship between 2 per cent of trade with those countries and 35 times that amount of trade with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Then he talks of &ldquo;retaining freedom of action to diversify our trade&rdquo;. It is a nice thing to have such freedom of action to diversify our trade.  We have been exercising this freedom of action to the best of our ability&mdash; various Governments composed of parties from all sides of the House including the Labour Party&mdash;and how much diversification have we achieved? We have achieved only a certain amount.  Freedom of action to diversify our trade will not of itself enable us to <Col N="1950" /> diversify it.  Nobody will prevent us from doing it.  A person is free to jump off O'Connell Bridge into the Liffey but he may not have the courage to do so.  Freedom to diversify one's trade is no use if one is unable to do so because no one else will diversify with you.  Freedom to marry is great.  It is no use if nobody will marry you.  These are just words: they are not developed any further in this pamphlet.  They tell us nothing of any value; they contribute nothing to the discussion and offer no alternative.</P>
    <P>Then we are told that there is no doubt that Ireland could obtain such a trading agreement with the EEC so as to regulate our industrial and agricultural exchanges with the enlarged community.  How advantageous such a trade agreement would be would depend on how flexibly and imaginatively the Dublin Government forwarded our political and economic interests and how determined it was to act independently.  Let us examine the interesting statement that there is no doubt that Ireland could obtain such a trading agreement with the EEC&mdash; there is nothing to explain the word &ldquo;such&rdquo;&mdash;so as to regulate our industrial and agricultural exchanges with the enlarged community.  Our Government attempted to negotiate one some years ago but the benefits were so tiny that neither side thought it worth while signing the agreement. The EEC did not, anyway.  As I recall, the benefits to us would have been a halving of the duty on fresh mutton and lamb and a redefinition of butter. Yes, we could obtain a trading agreement with the EEC, but on what terms?  The EEC could give us no trading preferences: GATT forbids it. We could get from them only a reduction in their external tariff multilaterally. The only thing our Government could think of that they could give us which would benefit us particularly, and which would not involve other people to any great extent, was the tariff on fresh mutton and lamb because nobody near the EEC has much fresh mutton and lamb to sell.  They cannot give us any bilateral preferences because of the GATT obligations. You can get changes in quota arrangements but the EEC abolished <Col N="1951" /> industrial quotas in 1961 and they also abolished agricultural quotas.  There are no quotas to get increases in from an EEC trading agreement.  They protect agriculture by levies.  Under the GATT provisions, they would not give preferential levies nor could they be prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>It is certainly feasible to sign an agreement with the EEC and it would be beneficial, I think, to our mutton and lamb industry.  The only thing we could get if we decided to stay out of the EEC I believe would be a phasing out of our relationship with Britain. It is generally thought that New Zealand will secure a special phasing out arrangement for her butter exports to the United Kingdom.  I am not sure that Ireland could get an equivalent concession because we are a European country and it is open to us to join as members.  New Zealand cannot join. Possibly they would not make such a concession to us.  The most we could hope to get would be a phasing out. That is the position about this trade agreement with the EEC.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to talk about Britain's interest in trade with this country and about our being Britain's third best customer and that it would be against her interests to curtail all her trade with us drastically.  Under the GATT agreement, Britain would have no power as a member of the EEC to do other than curtail her trade drastically with us.  Moreover, to talk about her third best customer sounds grand until one discovers that Britain sends 4 per cent of her exports to us, but buys 67 per cent of our exports.  We can forget about the third best customer argument.  We buy only 4 per cent of her exports.</P>
    <P>Then we are told by Mr. Coughlan that the terms depend upon our negotiators: he is confident they will negotiate the impossible.  Turning to a later page, we discover a total lack of confidence in the negotiators' ability to negotiate.  He fears we will be done down by the clever Europeans.  I find this viewpoint thoroughly unconvincing.</P>
    <P>The argument is also made that other European countries are staying <Col N="1952" /> out and, if they can stay out, why can we not stay out?  I submit to the Government that if they are serious about getting into the EEC they ought to try to explain this to the Irish people. When you tell people that Sweden and Switzerland, for instance, are staying out, and ask why Ireland cannot stay out too, the argument sounds sensible and it needs to be answered.  I have not ever heard any member of the Government adverting to this.  It is time it were dealt with.  Let me now do the Government's work for them here, as I have also to do it for them in other matters.</P>
    <P>There are two answers to this.  The first argument is that those countries are differently situated from us in respect of their trade.  The second argument is that they are differently situated as regards their whole living standard and their level of economic activity.  Switzerland is used as a comparison. Switzerland is described as a land locked island surrounded by the Common Market.  It is true that she is a landlocked island surrounded by the Common Market apart from her frontier with Austria, but this little landlocked country has not got anything like the concentration of trade with those who are landlocking her as we have <i>vis-á-vis</i> our sealocked neighbour, Britain.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at the Swiss trade figures in the OECD report on Switzerland.  The figures are a year or two old but they cannot have changed much in that time.  I reckon that Switzerland sells only 40 per cent of her exports to the whole EEC, which surrounds her completely.  We sell 80 per cent of our exports to the EEC and 67 per cent to Britain&mdash;that is, to an enlarged EEC.  Taking the EEC including Britain, it would be responsible for 80 per cent of our exports. There is, therefore, a very considerable disparity between the two.  Switzerland, by virtue of her much lesser dependence upon the EEC, which is only half our dependence on an enlarged EEC, has correspondingly greater freedom of action than us.</P>
    <P>Moreover, Switzerland has a highly skilled population built up because of the fact that Switzerland was a free <Col N="1953" /> country when we were not.  She was running her own affairs for centuries when we could not run our affairs. It is a country with over-full employment, with hundreds of thousands of foreigners having to be brought in because there are so many jobs and so few people to work.  We recall the recent referendum in which they nearly voted to put out the foreigners but did not quite.  It is a country with over-full employment on a massive scale and with all-the-year round tourism.</P>
    <P>We are told to equate ourselves with this country, one of the wealthiest in the world, one of the strongest countries in the world financially, a country with the most over-full employment in the world, a country which more than any other country in the world has an all-the-year round tourist season, a country whose population probably has skills beyond those of any other country in the world, a country whose dependence on EEC trade is half ours. We are told the Swiss are staying out and why cannot we?  What kind of argument is that?  That needs to be said.  I never heard that from the opposite benches and it is about time it was said from the opposite benches and that these arguments, with their superficial attractiveness, were nailed.</P>
    <P>May I also say that I have reason to believe Switzerland may not necessarily stay out of the EEC and that, in fact, at the moment in Switzerland serious consideration is being given to how to get out of their neutrality position.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of these developments.  I recommend him to make inquiries through diplomatic channels.  My information is that the Swiss, despite all these advantages, which put them in a totally different position from us, are, in fact, seriously, if quietly, considering what might be done to overcome the neutrality obstacle to participation in the EEC, because they regard being excluded from it as being so dangerous to their economy, despite its far greater strength than ours, that they are prepared to consider giving up their neutrality of centuries old standing which is totally different in character from our neutrality in the last war.</P>
    <P>What about Sweden which has no <Col N="1954" /> equivalent dependence to ours on the EEC?  I have not got the exact figures, but it is very much less than ours.  It is a highly prosperous country with full employment and could perhaps afford to stay out.  Will it?  It is far from certain. The stated policy of the Swedish Government is to stay out but I recall Dr. Lange, the former Norwegian Foreign Minister who, I regret to say, has since died, speaking at the European seminar here three months ago and saying he believed the Swedes will &ldquo;re-interpret&rdquo; their neutrality.  That may be right or it may be wrong, but certainly in Sweden a lot of deep thinking has been going on about the consequences for Sweden's economy, and for Nordic unity, of Sweden staying out of the EEC when Denmark and Norway join.  I am not too sure that Sweden would be such a strong reed to lean on in the arguments against Irish membership of the EEC.  In any event, the Swedish economy is in a totally different position from ours.</P>
    <P>Austria has also been mentioned. Austria's position is unique because Austria is required by international law to be neutral.  Austria cannot join a Community which would impinge upon its neutrality and, because this is a legal obligation, account can and will be taken of this in a way that it would not be taken in the case of another country like Switzerland, or Sweden or Ireland which merely chooses to be neutral.  However, it must be pointed out that Austria's dependence on the EEC for trade is also far less than ours, despite the fact that Austria is almost equally landlocked to Switzerland in the EEC.  Less than 30 per cent of Austria's trade is with Germany and only 45 per cent with the EEC as a whole, despite the fact that she is much more involved in the EEC than we are involved with Britain in a geographical relationship.</P>
    <P>We are told we should do as Spain is doing, and that Spain is staying out. This ignores the fact that Spain wants to get in and has applied for membership but is not likely to be let in because it is not a democracy.  Portugal is in the same position.  These are the countries which are looked towards. It is nice to have a left-wing pamphlet telling us to look towards Spain and <Col N="1955" /> Portugal and to link up our economy with them.  It is an interesting theory, but it has not much relevance because, by the time we had linked up with them, they would quite likely have become democratic and joined the EEC.  One of the pressures towards democracy in these countries is that if they do not become democratic they will not be let in.  They are so anxious to get in that they are even prepared to become democratic over the next few years, and that is saying a lot.</P>
    <P>These examples that are taken are mirages.  All of them will seek association of some kind with the EEC anyway, although I do not think that any country except Austria is likely to get it.  They are mirages put before us to bemuse us, and they will bemuse us if nobody tells the truth about them, if nobody produces the facts.  I again suggest to the Government that they should get down to their job.  The Taoiseach said that, if we believe we should be members of the EEC, it is our job to convince the Irish people of this before the referendum.  I entirely agree with him but I wonder when he will start.</P>
    <P>So much for the Coughlan pamphlet producing the arguments for staying out.  They are as thin as the pamphlet itself.  From the Labour benches we have had, from the leader of the Labour Party, an alternative suggestion of association, sometimes incorrectly called associate membership. Let us be clear about association. There is a good deal of confusion about it.  This is partly the fault of the EEC, which has changed its mind on several occasions as to what association is to mean.  What it means in the cases where it exists&mdash;and I believe it is to be narrowed down rather than broadened our for reasons I will mention in a moment&mdash;is free trade for industry only, with, perhaps, some minor agricultural concessions in areas not adversely affecting the Community's own agriculture.</P>
    <P>It also means that in due course one has to join the Community.  A package which would involve the ultimate obligation to join the Community, so that you do not get out of <Col N="1956" /> membership by this method, and which requires you to free your industrial trade and suffer all the losses, but gives you no benefits on the agricultural side, is a singularly unattractive one.  One could, perhaps, accept the thesis that one should give up some benefits and accept some losses in order to stay out indefinitely but, if the only consequence of paying this price, of losing the agricultural benefits and suffering the industrial losses, is to put off membership of the EEC for a period, this does not seem to be a very useful policy, even if it were open to us.  I do not believe it is.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that association with the EEC will be open to us.  I believe the policy of the EEC has changed on this.  The EEC has found its relationship with Greece and Turkey, the two existing associates, thoroughly unsatisfactory as, indeed, have the Greeks and Turks because it is, of its nature, a neo-colonialist relationship and, as such, makes everybody unhappy on both sides, particularly those who are neo-colonised.  It is a relationship in which the peoples of the countries concerned get certain benefits which tend to orientate their trade even more towards the EEC and make them more dependent on the EEC, but deprives them of any voice in EEC policy-making.</P>
    <P>This has not proved satisfactory, even disregarding the political complications in the case of Greece.  The thinking of the Community over the years has moved away from this.  It has been found that the complication of having to have two separate sets of association institutions on top of their own institutions is cumbersome, and that the countries concerned become dissatisfied with neo-colonialist relationship because it is so one-sided and they have no adequate voice in policy.  The EEC found it expensive also in the aid it had to give to Greece. It is particularly unsatisfactory in the case of Greece because Greece ceased to be democratic, but that is another matter altogether and it does not concern us here.  At least, we hope it will not concern us here.</P>
    <P>All the evidence is that the Community is not disposed to extend this <Col N="1957" /> kind of arrangement any further.  May I suggest also that this thinking is not confined to the institutions of the Community. I think I am right in saying that the socialist parties of the Community are so unhappy with this neo-colonialist relationship that they do not wish to extend it.  It would be rather nice to have a situation in which an Irish socialist party were seeking association because it would establish a better relationship and avoid anything neo-colonialist, but was being opposed by the socialist parties of the Community because they did not want to neo-colonise Ireland! It would be almost worth while going ahead on those lines because of the irony of the situation which would thus be created.</P>
    <P>I do not see any future in changing our neo-colonial relationship with Britain to a neo-colonial relationship with the EEC, involving ourselves in having to free our industrial trade with that organisation, but not securing participation in the agricultural market and having no voice in policy.  Those who advocate that policy have not thought much about it.</P>
    <P>The issue which has not been faced by those who oppose this is the alternative. Vague talks about association and the position of Switzerland or Sweden does not answer the question.  Let us face the facts of what staying out of the EEC would mean.  A trade agreement with the EEC would give us nothing except a five-year phasing out of our access to the British Market. Association would leave our agriculture out in the cold in exchange for extending the period of transition of industry&mdash;making a blunder but getting very little in return.</P>
    <P>We have been told that it is madness to think that Irish industry could face up to free trade in a transitional period of five years.  It has been a bit longer than that.  The CIO was established in 1961.  We started reducing tariffs in 1963.  Assuming we join and taking account of the EEC, the transitional period which is likely to emerge, we will have had a 15-year period of tariff reduction during which time tariffs will have been reduced on two occasions unilaterally <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries <Col N="1958" /> and subsequently under the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.</P>
    <P>Throughout that period the CIO reports have been preparing Irish industry to adapt itself for free trade. The view of most people concerned with industrial economics is that if you have more than a five-year period of transition it would be useless because industrialists will not face up to the crunch until they see the whites of the eyes so far as free trade looming ahead is concerned.  If we were to have a transitional period of ten years, industrialists would drift along adapting in a vague half-hearted kind of way for five years and, as soon as they came within five years of free trade, they would get on with the job and really adapt themselves.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it, they are very adaptable.  The one thing which can be said for private enterprise industry is that it is by nature adaptable &mdash;it has to be in order to survive.  If we were to extend the transitional period for more than five years, which would give us a total of more than 15 years of tariff reductions, it would not help in any way.  It would merely prolong the agony and, what is worse, it would postpone the achievement of the benefits of membership for Irish agriculture without gaining any commensurate benefits for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The alternative to membership if Britain joins&mdash;I am arguing on the hypothesis that Britain joins&mdash;as far as I can see, and I defy anybody to produce any kind of a realistic model of the alternative to join, is poverty and unemployment on a massive scale. Everybody recognises in his heart of hearts that this is the case.  The views expressed by the Labour Party can be interpreted as meaning that they do not like the EEC but they accept we have to join.  We are in a difficulty here because we have not had a clear voice on this.  I listened with attention to an excellent address by the Labour Party spokesman on EEC when we jointly attended a meeting in Cork some months ago.  The message came across loud and clear on that occasion. He did not like the EEC; he found many things unattractive about it, but he had the honesty and sincerity to <Col N="1959" /> refute the allegations made by some people in the audience that it would be a disaster for Irish agriculture and that Irish industry would be wiped out. Whilst not accepting the extreme statements he saw many things unattractive about it but he said we had no alternative but to go in.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we have had the same statement from Deputy Thornley.  He said the Government were quite right in reactivating our application because there was no alternative.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien when speaking on the subject, as reported in the papers this morning &mdash;I was not here for the latter part of his speech&mdash;said that the Labour Party opposed a Referendum to modify the Constitution to enable us to join but he proceeded to argue that the Labour Party, by taking the line they had, by acting as a responsible Opposition, were helping the Government in their negotiations by toughening the Government's bargaining position. This is a very fair point.  It is very helpful to have the kind of fears which have come from the Labour Party expressed in this House.  It will strengthen the Government's hand; I have no doubt about that.  It is very welcome, but I think we need a little more clarity in the expression of this viewpoint.</P>

      <P>I take it that Press reports are correct unless someone asserts that they are not.  If someone asserts that they are not I defer to it. Deputy Dr. O'Connell made a statement against membership and Deputy Corish seemed rather dogmatic about it.  We do need a clear statement from the Labour Party on this.  I am sure the Labour spokesman on EEC, who is concluding the debate, will clarify <Col N="1960" /> the position.  It is a sincere and consistent position that they do not like what they see very much, but they recognise that joining is inevitable and when we join the EEC the Labour Party will, I am sure, work constructively to democratise its institutions and improve the EEC.  The whole tenor of speeches from the Labour benches has been fear about the unemployment which will follow our joining EEC.  They wish this never would happen but, because it has happened, they realise we have to face free trade, and free trade means change and they do not like change.  In my one year in this House and four years in the other House I have never heard such consistently conservative sentiments as have come from those benches over the past few days.  They are opposed to change of any kind and fear for the future.  This is a valid viewpoint but it is a surprising one to hear from those benches.</P>
      <P>If in fact this is the motivation of the Labour attitude&mdash;I believe it is; they are naturally more sensitive to the dangers of unemployment because they are closer to the problem; many of them are involved with trade unions &mdash;then, of course, this is entirely consistent with their attitude.  They do not like it; they wish it had not happened, but, if Britain joins, we have to join because to stay outside would involve massive unemployment on a scale unimaginable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the effect on trade and industry if we stay outside the EEC, allowing for the fact that we might get a five-year period to phase out our relationship with Britain.  At the moment EEC countries have to pay a tariff on their goods going into Britain&mdash;I do not know the exact figure but I think it is in the order of 15 to 20 per cent on average.  We sell our goods reasonably successfully in Britain with that preferential margin, having free entry.  If we stay out of the EEC, tariffs will be raised against our goods. They will probably not be more than 7½ to 10 per cent on many of the goods, which is not necessarily prohibitive, but is there anything in our industrial position to suggest, or is it suggested by those who oppose EEC, that we are <Col N="1961" /> so much more efficient and developed than EEC countries that we do not need a tariff advantage?  Apparently not alone do we not need a tariff advantage but we can overcome a tariff disadvantage! We can produce our goods so cheaply that we do not have to bother about a 7½ per cent or 10 per cent tariff&mdash;we can overcome that!</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that, if we had to face a tariff against our goods, in competition with countries who because of their scale of production can produce much cheaper than us, this would involve a reversal of the tariff preference we now have, and the impact on Irish industry would be very large indeed.  I have not quantified it, indeed I find difficulty in quantifying it.  I have not tackled the problem in any detailed or consistent way, but I do not think anybody would deny that the effect on Irish industry would be massive.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the effect on Irish industry and Irish agriculture.  It is proposed over a period of at most five years that we would lose free entry to Britain.  We have a little experience of what happened when the EEC levy system was imposed on Irish goods in 1961.  At that time we had some exports to the EEC.  They were not large in absolute terms, but let us consider what happened to them.  We exported 35,000 cattle to the EEC in 1961.  The EEC agricultural policy came in and levies were enforced. Today we export virtually none; this trade has disappeared.  We exported 74,000 cwts of beef in 1961 but, once the levy system came in, we now export only 30,000 cwts.  The value of our exports of beef and cattle to the EEC has fallen as a result of the imposition of levies from £3,150,000 in 1961 to about £1 million today despite an increase of 35 to 40 per cent in the price.</P>
    <P>In other words, the exports we then had, had they been retained, with the price changes that have occurred since, would have been worth about £4½ million.  That has gone down to £1 million.  Over 80 per cent of our beef and cattle exports to the EEC have been wiped out by the levy system.  Those are exports that we had already, even when facing protection from these countries.  All that happened <Col N="1962" /> there was that the level of protection against us was raised.  It was not a question of losing free entry and having levies against us but of changing a situation where there were tariffs against us and quota restrictions in some cases also and substituting a higher level of protection, and the mere raising of the level of protection from an already high level to a higher level wiped out over 80 per cent of our exports of cattle and beef to the EEC.</P>
    <P>Would anybody like to hazard a guess at what the effect would be if our position of free entry were to be replaced by levies?  How much of the Irish cattle and beef trade would survive? Five per cent?  I wonder!  I have doubts.  We are not talking here of being forced to sell our products cheaper than they are sold now by reason of the present exploitation situation we have in Britain; we are talking of not selling them at all.  Where in the world are we going to sell beef? We shall not sell cattle anywhere because we cannot ship them anywhere else outside Europe.  Shall we have to export the whole of our beef across the Atlantic to America?  And at what price?  Where would Irish farming be then?  For all practical purposes it would be wiped out.  It is not a question here of being a little worse off; not a question of a reduction in incomes but a question of a total collapse of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>What effect would it have on industry if the Irish farmer disappears, if agriculture is virtually wiped out? What would happen in those circumstances? To whom would Irish industrialists sell their products then?  The interdependence of agriculture and industry in Ireland is great and the number of jobs lost in industry as well as the number of farmers leaving the land would be on a scale which would bear no relationship whatever to anything that has ever happened in the past with the possible exception of the Famine and I doubt if even that would qualify.  That is the prospect that faces us if Britain joins and we stay out.  Because that is the fact and because people on those benches recognise that fact, they face the fact, as we must all face it, that whether we <Col N="1963" /> like the EEC or not&mdash;we like it; other people do not&mdash;we have no choice but to join because we are concerned to ensure the survival of this economy and our society.  Some of us welcome this compulsion because we believe that Ireland will be a better country within the EEC; others think the opposite.  Either way it is clear that we have no choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the negative attitude expressed by those who oppose EEC membership.  Basically, they are conservative: they fear change.  There will be change.  People will have to change jobs and some people will lose jobs.  I do not welcome this but I certainly would prefer the small loss of employment in industry following EEC membership&mdash;the CIO, I think, assessed it at 11,000 redundancy in Irish industry spread over a five-year period: half of that will be absorbed by wastage and the ordinary turnover of staff and on these figures you will then have disemployment of perhaps 1,000 a year &mdash;to the scale of redundancy that would face us and the collapse of Irish industry that would follow staying out of the EEC.  Although there is a price to be paid in employment and although it is easy for somebody in my position or in the position of anybody in this House to talk glibly about people losing their jobs when we do not have to lose them, from the point of view of the country as a whole and the people as a whole it is better that some few thousand people should lose their jobs and have to be found alternative jobs or be adequately compensated than that the whole country should face collapse.  I want to come back to this; the redundancy provisions are not adequate for this purpose.  I believe it is better that a few thousand people should have to face this readjustment so that Ireland may, in the long run, be a more prosperous country and may be in a position to develop fully its resources and to give its people a full opportunity to develop themselves.  An alternative view is possible.  I recognise that but I think much of the negative attitude is based on fear of change and inability to make the imaginative leap to visualise what a Community of this kind means.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> Much of the opposition is based on failure to examine the EEC as it is, warts and all, and instead, looking at the stereotype put forward by its opponents or at times by some of its proponents. It is also, I think&mdash;and this comes out very clearly in much that is written and spoken on the subject&mdash;a reflection of that national inferiority complex which throughout 50 years of independence has been one of our great weaknesses: this feeling that the world is a sophisticated place full of clever people who will do us down and that we are not up to it and that the best thing for us is to opt out and live quietly with each other, as a simple peasant people, and not get involved with these clever Dicks in other countries who will always get the better of us.  That attitude is very widespread.</P>
    <P>It was not the attitude of mind of the Government of this country in the 1920s.  It is not the attitude of mind of those men who, in the 1920s, in seeking to develop Irish independence to the full, seeking to get everything that could be got from the Treaty before going beyond it, took on the task of transforming the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations. The men who faced that task did not adopt this inferiority complex attitude: &ldquo;all these English and Canadians are far too clever for us to cope with; let us stick our heads in the sand.&rdquo; No; they sat down to plan how they would mobilise the uncertain loyalties of Canadians and South Africans and, to a certain extent, Australians and New Zealanders in search of a transformation of this British Empire into a commonwealth of free nations.  They set out on this vast diplomatic task, lobbying these people at various Imperial Conferences, playing a role in the League of Nations and, over ten years, they succeeded in becoming the most skilled diplomatic team in the Commonwealth and towards the end of that period they became the leading lights in this whole movement and, as an incidental result of securing Irish independence fully, they changed the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations.  That, I think, is the spirit in which we should tackle membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; is over-used; <Col N="1965" /> it means very little as it has been so debased but, in the true sense, this is a challenge.  I believe we can rise to it. I believe there are certain special features of the Irish people that put us in a better position than most to do this job.  First, because we are a small country we are, it is true, cursed with an inferiority complex but at least we do not have a superiority complex. We have not the British attitude or the attitude the French have, and the French are often clever enough to avoid the worst consequences of it, that they are the finest people in the world and that everybody else is inferior. That is an attitude which prevents you ever understanding other people and therefore makes it impossible ever to persuade them to do what you want them to do.  Because we do not have that complex we are more sensitive to other people and much better at getting on with people.  We are also in the unique position that, apart from Britain, we are the only English-speaking country in Europe and we are also unique in being the only liberated colony in Europe.  We can talk to continentals without Anglo-Saxon attitudes.  They appreciate an English-speaking person talking to them without Anglo-Saxon attitudes. Indeed, they are so surprised at the contrast to talking to English people that immediately they are on one's side.</P>
    <P>We have these advantages.  We can exploit them just as we exploited our advantages in the 1920s in a different context and did it successfully.  We can exploit them now in EEC membership to our own advantage and hopefully to the advantage of Europe.  We must work to transform this Community. I do not hesitate to say that it has many unsatisfactory features.  We have to take it warts and all, but we must try to get rid of the warts.  For instance, there is the lack of democratic control which is undoubtedly a problem. M. Rey, the former President of the Commission in his valedictory address on 16th June made this point: &ldquo;Progress&rdquo; he said, in strengthening the institutions of the Community, &ldquo;has been very modest&mdash;after the recent debate on budgetary powers the Parliament is too conscious of this for me to <Col N="1966" /> need to say much on the point&rdquo;.  This was in an address to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>To put it mildly, the Council has not in its recent deliberations, accorded this problem the attention it deserves.  However, voices are being raised on all sides to emphasise the absolute necessity of progress in this field.  The Werner Committee itself, instructed to study the problems involved in creating an economic and monetary union, states that the institutional structure of the Community must be strengthened if we are to get anywhere.  The young Europeans with whom we have just held a first colloquium in Brussels on 12, 13 and 14 June also emphasise how essential the demo-cratisation of the Community institutions seems to them.</P>
    <P>These institutions are not adequately democratic.  There is a Parliament whose only power is to dismiss the entire Commission, a power so great that it has never been exercised and perhaps never will be.  Beyond that it has the right of consultation, without any requirement that its views be listened to.  It is a Parliament elected indirectly by the parliaments of member countries and not yet drawing its strength from the people of Europe by direct elections. The Commission is subject to this one excessively powerful check and is otherwise free of direct democratic control, although its activities are closely interrelated with the Council of Ministers. This is quite inadequate.  It will not satisfy this country with its parliamentary traditions.  The voice of this country will be raised with that of other countries and raised more and more insistently, and the voice of this party and I am sure of the other political parties in Europe will be raised also in favour of changing this system.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the fact the Commission is not sufficiently independent. There is the system of horse trading between the member countries.  The method by which appointments are made is one which enables member governments to express their disapproval of the action of <Col N="1967" /> the Commissioners by not renewing their appointment.  Such a supra-national body, representing the interests of the people of the European Community as a whole, should stand above national interests.</P>
    <P>Again, the Community policies are not sufficiently liberal towards developing countries&mdash;the Third World.  In this regard we must be careful.  Criticism has been made from other benches as well as from these benches about the policy of the Community in this respect.  I think the Government side will agree that we cannot criticise illiberality when we are so illiberal ourselves in our policies and in our aid towards these countries.  We shall have to make considerable progress towards liberalisation of our trade with developing countries and achieve a massive expansion of aid towards these countries if we are to be able morally to raise our voices in favour of liberal policies in the EEC.</P>
    <P>There has not been sufficient social progress.  This has been a complaint of the EEC trade union movement. Apart from the provisions covering equal pay for equal work by men and women in the same State there is nothing more than an aspiration towards harmonisation of social benefits in the EEC, and this is another matter in relation to which we have a role to play on entering the EEC.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the inadequacies of the industrial policy.  It seems to me the industrial policy is of a very Americanised character.  It does not take adequate account of the need to develop participation of workers in industry.  That policy will need to be looked at.  At this stage it is only an embryonic policy.  We shall have to raise our voice in favour of industrialisation in a more European sense, a more participatory kind.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the regional policy.  There are inadequacies there, but I shall come back to that.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, many defects to be remedied.  I am not suggesting we should be euphoric about entry or that we should feel this is some bonanza we are getting in on.  The EEC <Col N="1968" /> happens to incorporate things which are essential to this country: the extension of our sovereignty, and the diminution of the right of the sovereignty of another country to exploit us.  It offers the prospect of going beyond that to create a society of the kind we would like to see, a society which would stand on its own against the societies created in America and in the Soviet Union, which to us seem unattractive in many ways.  We would like to join in that great venture.  However, as the EEC exists at the moment it has many defects but they are remediable.  The power exists to remedy them and the pressures are there to remedy them, and the pressures will be exerted if we, Denmark, Norway and Britain join the Community.</P>
    <P>It must be understood that different problems require to be dealt with at different levels of sovereignty in the EEC, some at a higher level and others at the national level.  There are also great developments towards a devolution of sovereignty to the regional level and that is a direction in which Irish people would like to see progress.  The EEC is the only means of securing control over the increasingly powerful private monopolies and cartels which extend their tentacles throughout the world.  These private companies have got outside the control of any one country.  I believe that ultimately they will only be controlled by some system of world government, but this is so far away that it is no good thinking about it.  The most we can do is to create a body in which there would be institutions strong enough and powerful enough to tackle these international cartels and to bring them under public control and prevent them from exploiting the people of these countries, to ensure that the voice of the public is strong enough to curb the activities of these private institutions. This can only be achieved by European institutions.  No one country in Europe is strong enough to cope with this problem.</P>
    <P>We must also see the Community as a means of preserving the European tradition in all its diversity against the infiltrations from across the Atlantic which are undermining our different <Col N="1969" /> countries.  There is an opportunity to create a new way of life, a new society in Europe which will have neither capitalism of the American kind nor centralised planning of the East European kind, but a society with intensive participation by the people in running their own affairs; one concerned with the cultural identity of the different peoples and nations within the area; one concerned with the conservation of the environment of Europe, which not alone in Ireland but elsewhere is being destroyed at an appalling pace, a society concerned with the development of each individual's personality; a society concerned with the development of individual personality, a society concerned with taming industrialisation so that it is mastered by the individual instead of dominating the individual.</P>
    <P>Only if the peoples of Europe can unite and develop enough strength and force will such a society be created, a society which will contain cultural diversity but which will have common features distinguishing it from American capitalism or from East European centralised socialism.  The Community is the only means by which Europeans can get out of the position of being pawns and puppets of the Russians in the East and of America in the West.  Those who advocate the maintaining of a dis-united Europe will also be advocating the continued dominance of Europe by Russia and the United States.</P>
    <P>Some of the things about which I have been talking are extraordinarily well expressed in a document which I commend to the House.  It was presented four months ago to the European Movement meeting in Rome by the Irish Council of the European Movement by a delegation comprising Mr. Seán Lemass and Deputy Tom O'Higgins.  Although they were acting in their own personal capacities, the delegation can be said to be fairly widely representative.  This document was adopted with the unanimous consent and approval of the members of the Council who represented the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Parties and those who did not represent any party, with an addendum that Deputy Michael O'Leary, Deputy Dr. Thornley and Mr. <Col N="1970" /> Brendan Halligan, while recognising the validity of many of the objectives set out, entered a reservation as to those parts of the document which were at variance with the policy of the Labour Party.  I am not clear that any part of the document is at variance with the policy of the Labour Party except its acceptance of the European Community itself but that is for them to say and not for me.</P>
    <P>In this document there are many points which sum up what should be the Irish position within the Community, the policies which we should pursue. First of all, it is made clear that political objectivity of the Community should be the creation of a democratic united states of Europe embracing all Europe, including eastern Europe, and that this enlarged Community should remain open to any other European country sharing its objectives.  Its primary aim should be to minimise the division of Europe between east and west and to avoid policies which might impede progress towards the realisation of that aim.</P>
    <P>There you have a statement on the role of the EEC.  It is not something which should divide Europe more than it is divided even now into west and east, but something which should be open to the east, something which should work to reduce the tensions of the cold war, such as they now remain, work for a détente in Europe and for peace in Europe, and work towards the time when it will be possible for all the peoples of Europe, on either side of the Iron Curtain, to come together in peace with their different social systems, united on those things which they have in common&mdash;and there are many things we share in common with the peoples of eastern Europe, but not, God knows, with most of their governments.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to deal with the importance of distinguishing between the need for economic and political union on the one hand and the need to preserve cultural and social diversity on the other.  This is implicit in everything that is said and done in the EEC.  One would find it hard to find anybody in the EEC or associated with it who wants to get rid of <Col N="1971" /> the identity of member countries.  They share a common sense of European citizenship at a higher level than the citizenship of the nation to which they belong.  But they are attached as we are, and, in fact, in many ways more attached than we are, to the culture and traditions of their own countries. You will find no movement there to create a Europeanised Europe in the American sense with everybody speaking the same language and with the same culture.  Quite the contrary.  This diversity needs to be preserved and we should not merely assume that this will happen but we need to work towards it. In this document it is suggested that positive steps should be taken even to the extent of setting up an institution to foster and preserve cultural and social diversity.  That is a constructive suggestion.</P>
    <P>As regards political unity the Irish Council document says that on matters of common concern and in particular in its relations with other world powers, a United Europe should endeavour to speak with one voice, and on these matters a United Europe should follow an independent policy, not a pro-American policy or a pro-anything policy but an independent policy.  Some people are so concerned that Ireland should be independent in its policy that they are prepared to work to ensure that not just Ireland but the whole of Europe should have an independent policy.  Our voice should be raised towards that end.</P>
    <P>The point is also made, and it is an important one, that in developing political unity this should be done within the existing institutional structure of the Community.  In this country we do not want to see new institutions set up nor do we want old institutions like NATO carried on and there are suggestions of having new institutional structures parallel with existing ones.  In this we see some dangers.  We know how the present Community works and we believe it could be extended by unanimous agreement to carry out new functions in the sphere of foreign policy and political unity but we do not want to see a proliferation of institutions.  We do not want to see any development of WEU <Col N="1972" /> or NATO; we want the existing EEC institutions to be developed in this sense.  This, again, is worth saying because alternative policies have been advocated.</P>
    <P>The document then goes on to deal with the Community's social obligations. These are often overlooked but the Irish delegation felt they should be stressed&mdash;the obligations of the Community to the under-privileged citizens whose interests have not been sufficiently safeguarded or looked after by the Community; the need for a harmonisation of national social policies for the benefit of all and then the Community's obligations to the less favoured regions within the Community, the need for a much more active regional policy.  This is an important point, to which I shall return, and from our point of view it should be stressed.</P>
    <P>Then there is the point already mentioned here by other speakers as well as myself in regard to the Community's obligation to developing countries, the need to develop liberal policies towards the Third World.  Then it goes on to deal with the development of the institutions, the need to return to majority voting in the Council, which was abandoned following the crisis in 1965 with the French; the need to reinforce the democratic nature of the parliament. There is a specific proposal that direct elections should take place by the 1st January, 1975, so that by the time the parliament begins to exercise power over the Community budget it will be a directly elected parliament drawing its strength, at least in large measure if not completely directly from the peoples of Europe.  There is a positive proposal put forward by the Irish representatives.</P>
    <P>It is an indication of the influence we can have if we apply our minds to these problems and if we are sensitive to other people's attitudes and if we employ effective diplomacy, that from this document four important sections were adopted almost without change as part of the new policy of the European movement.  The Irish delegation coming with this document were able to get them to adopt a number of sections, the sections dealing with cultural diversity, the section dealing with developing countries&mdash;the Third World <Col N="1973" />&mdash;the section devoted to the need to return to majority voting and the section dealing with the need to move towards direct elections by January 1st, 1975.  This is just a small indication of the influence we can have if we can get rid of this inferiority complex, this attitude that we have to wait to be pushed around.  If we know what we want and we go out into Europe and say clearly what we want and mobilise our allies, get people who think like us to vote with us, we can secure many of our objectives as this small delegation secured the adoption of these sections.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to deal with other matters, the need to develop greater participatory democracy, and with the negotiations for the enlargement, on which it has some concrete points to make.  The document is an important one.  It is the first time to my knowledge that these matters have been the subject of Irish policy reactions. Admittedly, the reactions were of a private body of politicians, acting in a private capacity and not necessarily representing their parties but it is the first such initiative and it was welcomed very much when it was made.  We tend very often to go to international meetings ill-prepared, as mere spectators waiting to be told or advised by somebody else about what we should do, instead of going with our minds made up as to what we want and are determined to achieve.</P>
    <P>If we make up our minds as to what we want we can hope to get it agreed.  I believe this policy here is one acceptable to all parties in the House.  The reservation attached by the Labour Party was more to the general involvement of the European movement than to any particular statements here.  If there is some particular thing the Labour Party disagree with, perhaps, they will tell us about it in concluding this debate.  Basically, this document represents a considered statement of a well-thought out Irish position.  It could be the basis of future diplomatic Irish action.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's record in preparing for free trade?  We need to consider this because this is a debate on entering the Community and the <Col N="1974" /> question of what preparations have been made is relevant.  The Government's record, having been in office throughout the entire period of possible preparation, is extremely relevant.  It is a mixed record.  The Government set up the CIO in June, 1961, in response to external initiative.  The initiative did not come from the Government.  The CIO did a useful job in surveying the great bulk of Irish industries and all sections of such industries which were likely to be affected directly by free trade.  That is about all that was done. There was not any adequate follow-through. In the last couple of years the present Minister for Finance, just after he was appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce, initiated a follow-through survey covering a very narrow range of industries without any followup of the kind necessary after a long period during which the negotiations for membership lapsed and when people were inclined to take things easy.</P>
    <P>One cannot help being disturbed by the extraordinary weakness of the industrial side of the White Paper.  This is balanced by the fact that on the agricultural side the problem and possible consequences of membership are well set out.  I have often had occasion to criticise the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in this House but the agricultural White Paper and the agricultural section of the main White Paper are good.  One might have minor criticisms of them but they are a fair and a full statement of the possible implications of membership.  I might have set them out a little differently, but that is possibly a matter of taste and judgment.  Basically, the agricultural side is well covered.  The industrial side is desperately badly covered.  The whole issue has been dodged.  There is a &ldquo;skirting&rdquo; around the issue, but nobody reading the document would know that 30 industries were surveyed by teams from the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Industry and Commerce and another 22 firms were surveyed by the Department of Industry and Commerce and that a vast mass of information on individual firms was built up and an overall assessment of the impact of free trade was carried out.  No one would know <Col N="1975" /> what kind of consequences came from that survey.</P>
    <P>That survey produced very important data which one would hope might have been kept up to date at least by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This data related to the extent of external participation in each Irish industry and to the weakness and strength of each individual industry and on which industries were most likely to face redundancy in free trade and provided information in the files, though not in the actual reports, on individual firms most likely to be hit.  Nobody reading this White Paper would know that such a survey was carried out.  Mention is made of a survey but no quantified assessment is made, of even the vaguest kind, of the impact on industry.  There is a lot of general talk, but nothing comparable to the information given on the agricultural side.  I very often say the opposite in this House and say that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are deficient in something on which other Departments, like the Department of Industry and Commerce, have done well.  The opposite is the case in this instance.</P>
    <P>The state of preparedness of Irish industry is mentioned but the information is vague and general.  There is not a figure of any relevance in sight. At the end of it all, one finds one is as wise as one was at the beginning. If that is a measure of the preparations which have gone on in the five and a half years since the CIO finished their work, it forms a disturbing picture indeed.</P>
    <P>There was one aspect of the CIO with which I was disappointed at the time.  I have no reason to believe anything has been done about it since.  I was disappointed at the failure to use data obtained confidentially from firms in order to build up a free trade geography of Ireland and a picture of the cities and towns which would be most affected by free trade.  One could not publish such information.  If one takes a particular one-industry town and says: &ldquo;This town will suffer from free trade&rdquo; one is saying: &ldquo;This firm is no good and will disappear.&rdquo;  It would be wrong for the Government to <Col N="1976" /> do that but the confidential information was available.  There were confidential reports on all these firms which attempted to assess the prospects of the firms.  Each team was required to add up the results and to assess the losses of employment expected in particular firms.  They were expected to give global totals for each industry.  The individual figures for individual firms put together, town by town, would have given, if they had been put together in this way, a picture of what parts of Ireland would be likely to suffer most in free trade conditions.</P>
    <P>I advocated at the time unsuccessfully that this should be done and that the Department of Industry and Commerce should have available to them and to the IDA this kind of free trade geography of Ireland and that a clear plan should then be built up and that new industries would be pushed, pulled, bribed or cajoled to go to the centres most likely to be hit in free trade conditions and to go there at a tempo which would ensure that as time went on and trade was freed and existing industries suffered, the growth of new industries would take up the slack in employment and that with training centres established in or near these towns it would be possible to ensure that no hardship would accrue to the workers in the industries adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I preached this at the time to no avail.  I am not aware that anything on these lines was done since. This is a serious defect.  It would not have been difficult.  We are talking of less than 2,000 firms.  The information could have been fitted into a decent-sized filing cabinet.  The IDA could have been directed to encourage industries, by financial aid, to go to these particular centres.  This was proposed to the CIO and rejected. This was not done.  It is a matter of great regret that it was not done.  It is late in the day now to do it, but not too late.  I hope that through the work of the committee set up by the previous Minister two years ago, and through an extension and a widening of their work, it will be possible to bring this information up-to-date quickly and to do a quick survey of the firms, to check whether the firms which <Col N="1977" /> were then seen to be in danger have adapted successfully and whether firms which were expected to adapt successfully are now in danger, in order to get into a position to produce a revised free trade geography of Ireland which would enable the IDA to start planning industrial development even at this late stage.  It is not too late.  It takes about two years, on average, from the time a firm shows an interest in coming here until that firm is in production.</P>
    <P>The freeing of trade within the EEC will not start until 1973.  While we are going to face increasingly in the two years immediately ahead the effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement it is possible that we could re-phase the free trade area reductions in the context of the EEC. I should like to hear the Minister's view on this later on.  This might help to ease the burden a little and give us time to start to push industries into the towns most likely to be affected.  I do not know why this was not done in 1962 when I first suggested it.  We need a concerted plan and an attempt to do this properly.  People are often critical of planning.  I see no advantage in waiting for things to happen when one can anticipate them and do something about them and so avoid human hardship which might arise.</P>
    <P>The redundancy scheme has been introduced.  It will be necessary to improve it.  We have had redundancy of 3,000 to 4,000 jobs a year but this was normal redundancy which goes on all the time in an economy ticking over in the normal way.  This will accelerate in the next two years.  It will be not on a major scale but we must have another look at it.  There is a difference between redundancy occurring in the ordinary course of events and redundancy introduced by the freeing of trade.  This is important.  If we in this House decide for reasons of national advantage to go into the EEC this will have certain implications for industry&mdash;though not as bad, perhaps, as if we stayed out of it.  We have a particular duty to look after the people affected.  If Ireland is going to benefit greatly from membership of the EEC in the long term, the few, calculated in the light of the working population of one <Col N="1978" /> million people, who have to change their jobs and bear the brunt of the changes, should be generously treated. I do not mean that they should be sent off at half pay in the hopes that something will turn up for them but they should be maintained with an income similar to what they have been used to.</P>
    <P>People should be adequately retrained for new jobs and resettled, or if they are older workers, they should be given generous pensions beyond what they would normally get.  Such people would be the victims of policy and their sacrifice will give the country the benefits which EEC membership will bring.  Those benefits are great enough for us to be able to afford to ensure that none of these relatively few people suffer any hardship.  Our existing redundancy policy is a first step in that direction but it needs to be radically improved and strengthened. The re-training scheme which was being introduced all too slowly throughout the 1960s&mdash;but successfully &mdash;needs to be extended to cope with this problem.  The resettlement arrangements need to be strengthened to ensure that if people have to move to another town, as will happen in some cases, they will be facilitated in doing so and will suffer no financial loss as a result of having to do so.</P>
    <P>I would also criticise the Government for their failure to prepare the State industries for entry into the Community. One of the troubles about State industries is the difficulty that arises because Government policy tends to be protectionist <i>vis-à-vis</i> their own industries.  If State industries could be treated in the same way as private industries, if they knew the same fate would befall them as happens to inefficient industries in the private sector, many of the problems connected with these industries would disappear.  The Government have tended to treat State industries in a totally different way from private industries.</P>
    <P>We should all recall an extraordinary development in 1962 in connection with Irish Steel Holdings.  At that time Irish industry was being told that it must get ready for free trade, its workers were being told to prepare for redundancies <Col N="1979" /> and the industries were told to prepare for a lowering of tariffs. However, the Government introduced new tariffs for Irish Steel Holdings to give the company extra protection and this at a time when the private sector was preparing for the era of free trade. Naturally enough, the Government's action had a very bad effect on the private industry sector.  This attitude of mind must go and State industries must be made efficient.  The Government will not easily be forgiven if their failure to do this leads to some State industries disappearing in the competitive atmosphere of free trade.</P>
    <P>One can also fault the Government on the agricultural front.  In this sector there is a most blatant movement away from the Common Market by a Government allegedly dedicated to entry into the Communities.  The case of Irish Steel Holdings, to which I have referred, occurred some years ago but in the past year we have had two Government Ministers adopting and proclaiming policies in direct opposition to EEC policy.  This can only suggest to the Commission that either the Government do not know the policies of the EEC or else intend to sabotage them as best they can.  This can scarcely have made a good impression in Brussels and is hardly the way to enter into negotiations.</P>
    <P>I shall speak later regarding the question of negotiation because I have some crows to pluck with Deputy Cruise-O'Brien on his concept of negotiation in this context.  In any negotiation or discussion on joining the Community you do not improve your position by moving in the opposite direction when trying to convince the other party that you are in favour of their policy.  However, the Minister for Lands announced that structural reform must be abandoned in the West of Ireland, that farms will be left at their present size and that farmers should seek part-time jobs.  The lunacy of this policy as a panacea for the West of Ireland should be evident to all but, judging by the reactions of press and public opinion, it has not been as evident as it ought to have been.  It is certainly a policy completely contrary to EEC policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> The Mansholt Plan needs clarification but the Government have failed to clarify it.  It is completely unrealistic to suggest that every farm can remain at the same size and the farmer can augment his earnings by taking a job in industry.  If a decent living is to be provided for farmers in the West of Ireland by enlarging their farms to an economic size, industrial employment in this part of the country will have to be trebled.  However, in the last 20 years we have hardly increased it at all.  In addition to this, if you have to provide part-time jobs for all the farmers&mdash;which appears to be the panacea favoured by the Minister for Lands &mdash;it will be necessary to increase industrialisation fivefold in the West of Ireland, an extraordinarily high target in view of the fact that we have not increased it at all.</P>
    <P>We have had the introduction of the milk price, graded according to the amount supplied, which is in total opposition to the EEC approach.  Perhaps the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries felt like thumbing his nose at the EEC and his recent Republican outbursts would suggest that possibly this was the case.  If this is true I do not think he was the most appropriate person to have been in charge of agriculture during the period of preparation for entry into the EEC.  Both he and the Minister for Lands have succeeded in complicating our negotiations somewhat and I extend my sympathy to the Minister for External Affairs in having to explain this matter.  No doubt if we succeed in joining the Community we will hear later about the total reversal of the two policies.</P>
    <P>On the transport side I do not detect any progress towards liberalisation of road haulage which would be a necessary consequence of EEC membership. There does not seem to be any talk, never mind action, about the whole question of normalisation of railway accounts.</P>
    <P>I am going quickly through the different sectors to show how little preparation has been done.</P>

      <P>My intention is to finish as soon as possible&mdash;it is always so.  If I proceed as rapidly as possible we will all get our meals as soon as possible.  About a year ago I raised a question in this House about what the Government were doing to keep the professions informed in regard to developments affecting them.  I asked the Minister for External Affairs if steps had been taken to acquire full information on existing and proposed regulations in the EEC in regard to professional qualifications and if this information would be transmitted to Irish professional bodies and institutions of higher education with a view to encouraging such adjustments in Irish courses as might be necessary to ensure the acceptance of Irish professional qualifications in EEC countries. I also asked the Minister if he would ensure that this information was made available to Members of this House.  The Minister in his reply stated that our mission to the Community as a matter of course obtains all available information on this subject and that it is passed to the Departments concerned for transmission at the appropriate stage to institutions and organisations in Ireland.  He added that he might mention that the Community's official journal publishes the text of the draft regulations when approved by the Commission and asks that they be adopted as directives by the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was obliged to ask my question again by way of supplementary.  The procedure in this House is to ask a question and when an answer is not given one has to ask the same question again by way of a supplementary question and in many cases one still does not get an answer.  In reply to my supplementary question, the Minister said that all he could do was to ascertain from the Departments concerned that what he had said was the actual state of affairs, that Departments do communicate with institutions. If my recollection is correct, I <Col N="1982" /> came back to this point again and the Minister gave some kind of a timetable, saying that the first time he had heard about the matter of professional qualifications was in the previous February, that the documents had to be translated and that was as far as the matter had got.</P>
    <P>My contacts with professional bodies do not suggest that any of them have received anything from the Department and the suggestion that the first information available about the proposals of the EEC with regard to the professions was in February of last year is at variance with the facts. I have with me two documents which I acquired some two or three years ago, one dated 11th November, 1966, and the other 22nd November, 1966. A translation of the title of the first document is &ldquo;Documentation for a Colloquium at the Union of European Students' Associations on the Mutual Recognition of Qualifications.&rdquo; It sets out the plans of the Commission with regard to architecture, agriculture, medicine and dentistry.</P>
    <P>The second was an introductory note for a meeting of the University of Louvain.  It was a speech made by the relevant official of the EEC and it deals with doctors and barristers. The intentions of the Commission with regard to these professions were in no way secret.  These were public speeches.  I did not go into the Commission and pick these out of somebody's drawer.  Neither was I slipped them quietly as confidential documents.  The relevant official said: &ldquo;Yes, I made a speech about that last year and here is a copy.&rdquo;  Yet the first information the Government got on this was in February, 1969.</P>
    <P>I do not understand this and neither do I understand why the professional bodies do not seem yet to have any information. In fact, they have so little information that I am going to Brussels on Tuesday next on behalf of five of them in an effort to find out what is happening since they have got no information from the Government.  This does not suggest a Government preparing for EEC membership or concerned to ensure that Irish vocational interests are preparing for it.  This is a <Col N="1983" /> serious situation and, therefore, it is worth while dwelling on it.  I hope the Government will be more active in future.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of policy areas of EEC on which I should like to comment, particularly since they do not fall readily within the compass of other &ldquo;shadow Ministers&rdquo; dealing with particular sections of EEC policy.  The whole structure of EEC policy and of the EEC departments dealing with policies does not correspond to our system and, therefore, there is a danger that if we discuss this on a Minister and shadow Minister basis, certain important areas will fall between ministries.</P>
    <P>One of these areas is State enterprise. I wish to refer to this since there is a misunderstanding about it. Both in Coughlan's pamphlet and in one or two speeches from the Labour benches suggestions have been made that State enterprise is not permitted in the EEC.  I do not know where this extraordinary misunderstanding arose because a number of these countries have far more State enterprises than we have, in several cases about three times as much in terms of the proportion of GNP and employment.  None of them shows the slightest signs of wanting to hand these over to private enterprise.  This, therefore, is delusion.</P>
    <P>Mr. Coughlan, in his pamphlet, states that Ireland would lose the power to establish new State industries in the Common Market.  He says that the EEC Commission are currently calling on the French and Italian Governments to break up their oil and tobacco monopolies; that the Rome Treaty effectively prevents any government from taking an industry into whole or part public ownership where this might be socially desirable; that in practice no new State industries can be set up without discriminating against foreign private concerns, which is against the rules of the EEC.  This is nonsense.  One of the weakest things in the Treaty of Rome is in relation to the State industry sector because there is so much concern with the Community's not interfering with State industry that they failed to provide adequately to prevent State import or <Col N="1984" /> distributional monopolies from acting in a manner prejudicial to free trade.</P>
    <P>One can hardly imagine anything further removed from this astonishing statement, echoed from those benches over there, I think, by Deputy Dr. O'Connell.  The position is that Article 90 of the treaty deals with this matter. There is an obvious problem that if there is a State industry, not manufacturing because that creates no problem, but one which has a monopoly of State importation and distribution&mdash; the Irish Sugar Company is the only one of this kind that I know in this country&mdash;there is a problem in ensuring that other industries in other countries, whether State owned or privately owned, will have free and fair access to the country concerned.  This is a real problem.  If a country is to have free trade and yet allow any monopoly or cartel to prevent the effects of free trade, obviously the effects of such free trade will be frustrated.  In those circumstances, one would have thought that, if the Community were so dedicated to free enterprise and free trade and had so little regard for State enterprise, they would simply have said that monopolies for distribution or importation are banned.  This might not have been a bad thing but, on the contrary, so concerned were they not to interfere with anybody's State monopoly no matter how abusive their procedures, that in Article 90 they merely made a weak provision that this should be looked into and that these bodies should not act in this sort of way, but taking no adequate power to prevent them from so acting.</P>
    <P>Despite what has been said by Mr. Coughlan and by speakers on the Labour benches, there is a real problem in this regard and it is a problem that we must face.  While the only such monopoly that I am aware of in this country is, as I have said, the Irish Sugar Company, which has a monopoly of the importation and distribution of sugar&mdash;which I think will become irrelevant with the application of a common sugar policy&mdash;our industries will be faced with considerable problems on this account in EEC countries.</P>
    <P>In a number of these countries <Col N="1985" /> products that are made here either privately or publicly are, in fact, made by State firms that have complete control over the importation and distribution of these goods.  Let me take a simple example.  If, say, Carrolls wish to export cigarettes to France, they must first sell them to the French State monopoly manufacturing cigarettes. Carroll's cigarettes would have to be advertised and distributed in France by the State monopoly.  What chance would Carrolls have of competing with Gauloises under these circumstances? How could they manage to secure that this monopoly do not act in an abusive way?  How could Carrolls prove that the amount of advertising done by the French tobacco monopoly for Carrolls cigarettes is too little in relation to what would be fair to Carrolls in their efforts to expand their market?  How could they prove that the failure to distribute Carroll's No. 1 to the tobacconist at the corner of the <i>Rue de Bac</i> is because nobody ever asked for Carrolls there or because, when their cigarettes were available, nobody would buy them, or because there was a demand but the French monopoly were determined that nobody would buy them?</P>
    <P>Therefore, a number of our industries will be faced with a very real problem in exporting to EEC countries where such monopolies exist.  My concern would be to ensure that these State monopolies do not act in an abusive manner, not because I have any prejudice whatever against State industry &mdash;on the contrary I have always been an advocate of it&mdash;but because I do not wish to see any industry, public or private, act in a manner contrary to the basic principle of non-discrimination as in the Rome Treaty.</P>
    <P>To suggest that there is anything in the Rome Treaty that is prejudicial to State monopolies when they are not even adequately controlled in abusing their powers in this respect is nonsensical and the level of debate to which we are reduced when these kind of assertions are made without any knowledge of the facts is a great deal lower than that to which this House is entitled.</P>
    <P>A more positive approach is desirable <Col N="1986" /> in relation to State enterprise.  In the Fine Gael policy on State enterprise, we have faced the fact that with the freeing of trade some firms here will disappear, but some are firms that might conceivably be preserved or revived successfully by State action. We have proposed that in such circumstances the State holding corporation which it is proposed to establish would have the power to nationalise these firms.  It would be more constructive for people to think in these terms rather than to be making statements that are wide of the mark in relation to State enterprise in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak now about regional policy.  Regional policy will be of immense importance to us.  If there is not sound regional policy, this country will suffer more severely than others. Therefore, a lot depends on this regional policy.  The Treaty of Rome has a very strong commitment in its preamble.  This was quoted by Deputy O'Higgins in his speech.  It is the commitment to mitigate the backwardness of the less-favoured parts of regions of the Community.  The language is clumsy.  It is a direct translation from the French.</P>
    <P>This means a good deal more than anything we have achieved or sought to achieve in this country.  It means, in fact, not alone preventing the further decline of the west but securing a more rapid growth of the economy of the west and a more rapid growth of incomes in the west than in the rest of the country and a more rapid growth of incomes in the rest of the country than in the rest of the Community&mdash;in other words, helping them to catch up. This is a very important commitment indeed.  I do not suggest that the EEC have done much about implementing this so far.</P>
    <P>There are weaknesses in the regional policy, but this commitment is there and the way in which the Community operate is such that it is up to the Irish Government to rely on this in the Rome Treaty and press for its full implementation.  When we are a member of the EEC, which I hope we will be, it will be our job to refer back to this Preamble and to ask why the regional policy is not sufficiently denatio <Col N="1987" /> termined to achieve this objective, why it is not fully worked out, because I believe it is not fully worked out, to achieve this objective.  But the commitment is there and it is one on which we can rely in relation to our course of action in the Community.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about our giving up all our assistance to industry. This is nonsense.  The position is that, throughout the Community, there is extensive State aid in various regions, State aid directed towards industrialising these regions and expanding their economies.  These policies are much more extensive than they are here in one important respect.  It is very common to have rail tariffs so that goods from distant areas can be brought more cheaply than the actual cost of transport warrants.  We have not got any such system here.</P>
    <P>Far from the EEC preventing us from introducing, or maintaining, aid to industry in the less developed parts of the country, it actually permits this particular development, a development we have not even attempted ourselves at this particular point of time.  Such proposals must, of course, be approved by the Commission.  If the Commission feel&mdash;they are a neutral body in this&mdash; that the whole support tariff is not, in fact, designed to help the region but rather to subsidise unfairly an industry in the region to enable it to compete unfairly as regards costs with industry in other Community countries, then the Commission will refuse the support tariff.  Some have been refused, but hundreds have been allowed.  That is not the action of a community opposed to all kinds of State aid to enable industries to be developed in the more backward or less developed parts.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial grants, these are common on a very wide scale and the fact is that the Commission has, so far, felt itself unable to refuse any request for aid of this kind because of the difficulty of establishing firm and objective criteria by which to determine which parts of the Community should get the benefit of this kind of aid.</P>
    <P>The development of regional accounts <Col N="1988" /> has been rather slow.  When I looked into this last, probably four years ago, I found that the regional policy section of the Community not only did not have any regional accounts which would show the relative living standards of different areas but did not know if they existed, and had not inquired, although in fact subsequent inquiries in the statistical office of the Community revealed the existence of estimates of this kind, in some cases estimates as a result of work carried out privately, for all five countries except Luxembourg.  The reason why there are none for Luxembourg hardly needs to be explained.  In the absence of this data the Community are obviously not in a position to say that state aid can be given to one region but not given to another region because they have no means of deciding one way or the other.</P>
    <P>I believe the Belgian Government some years ago&mdash;this reflects the reality &mdash;sought help to industrialise the Walloon area in which the coalmines were declining.  Because of linguistic difficulties they felt unable to put before parliament a measure which would help the Walloon area but did not help the Flemish area and so they had to provide aid to that area also even though it did not really need it.  The Commission let this pass.  As far as I can judge it was a rather flagrant breach to give aid to an area that did not need it, but they passed it because they themselves are situated in Brussels and, if they had turned down aid to the Flemish areas, they might have found themselves within a couple of weeks without any buildings from which to operate.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any proposals for state aid that have been turned down so far.  I think, however, the time will come when they will evolve objective criteria which will discourage the giving of grants to areas in, for example, the hinterland of Antwerp while permitting aid in the hinterland of Clifden.  I would not think that a bad thing at all.  The less grants given in the industrialised areas the more attractive will be the grants given in the peripheral areas.  There is no indication of hostility here.  The Community are developing a regional policy, slowly and <Col N="1989" /> inadequately, which contemplates using such grants and ultimately contemplates not alone that member states will be allowed to give assistance but that the Community itself will do so as well.</P>
    <P>There is only one area of potential difficulty and it has to be faced.  This is the area of tax reliefs.  They fall outside the normal system of incentives for less developed regions and the Minister may have some difficulties in this sphere.  But, even in this sphere, I do not think we should be defeatist because our tax relief proposals are designed to terminate in 1990.  They have a terminal date.  The last date for getting these tax reliefs will be 1980 and, unless you start your industry by 1980, you will not get the benefit.  I may be wrong in that.  I am open to correction but I think that is the case.  The transitional period will end only in 1978 or 1980.  I think the Minister could possibly negotiate a special arrangement here in regard to something which is an integral part of our system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure what the Deputy means, but I shall be saying a little more about the actual proposals which have recently emerged for regional policy.  This may answer the Deputy's question.  Having said what I have said, namely, that the members of EEC would not prevent us from introducing real support tariffs, neither will they inhibit us from the point of view of industrial grants&mdash; they might in Dublin, but we do not give grants in Dublin any more; that is an administrative decision though it has not been made public&mdash;because, apart from Dublin, the rest of Ireland would be undeveloped from the point of view of the standards of the hinterland of Antwerp.  That will not be interfered with.  Tax reliefs are for negotiation and I believe the Minister will be able to negotiate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that the EEC does not put any obstacles in the way of expanding our systems and providing financial assistance to us for that purpose, <Col N="1990" /> I still do not think the policy is adequate.  It is set out in a summary &mdash;this may assist Deputy Dr. Gibbons&mdash; Community Aspects, No. 33: Regional Policy in an Integrated Europe.  This is the policy as it was a year ago.  There have been some developments since, but this is a reasonably good summary of the position.  Three types of region are distinguished&mdash;agricultural, industrialised and semi-industrialised.</P>
    <P>Within the agricultural regions they distinguish areas in which the problem is simply that agriculture is not sufficiently developed but in which you could get a prosperous community on the basis of agriculture, and areas where depopulation and their geographical character make it impossible to envisage successful agriculture where the area may have to be written off from the point of view of agriculture or industry and be an area solely for tourism or afforestation.  There is no specific statement as to what kind of area falls into this category but I have a slight fear that, in the context of the whole EEC, in which things are looked at on a large scale, parts of the west could be regarded as falling into this category whereas, from our point of view, it is essential to maintain a balance of population and ensure rapid industrialisation of the west to enable us to replace employment lost in agriculture.  I should like some reassurance on this point.</P>
    <P>This is a matter for negotiation.  I will come back to what negotiation means in this context.  I am not suggesting that we should negotiate at this stage on this.  We are talking here of a proposed policy not yet adopted as an actual policy and we as a member would have the opportunity to modify this policy and to say what we have to say on it but within the Community. We would want to have a say on this. I would suggest to the Minister that he would in the course of the discussions make it clear that the Irish Government do not regard any of this island as falling within this agricultural sub-category and that from our point of view within this small island we propose to secure, and expect to have the support of the European Community, <Col N="1991" /> to secure a balanced development throughout the area.</P>
    <P>That does not mean a factory in every village, of course.  This would not be practical and it is the pursuit of that policy which has left Ireland so much unindustrialised.  I have no sympathy with Deputy Thornley's reactionary views on this particular subject.</P>
    <P>This means, however, the establishment of industrial centres in various parts of the West of Ireland, so that people who have to leave agriculture in the West of Ireland&mdash;they will have to do so and there is no good in this House trying to cod people about this &mdash;will be able to obtain employment elsewhere.  Any politician who promises that people in the West of Ireland will not have to leave the land is certainly codding the people.  We have to ensure that industries are established not in Coventry or Birmingham, not even in Dublin or Cork, but in the West of of Ireland to provide employment for those people.  It is important that our intentions and our views in this respect should be notified to the European Community in the course of those negotiations.  We do not know how they will interpret this part of the regional plan but we can let them know how we interpret it now.  We can leave them in no doubt about that.  This is an important point to get across.</P>
    <P>There is one point of interest here in relation to the actual determination of what is an area of this kind. Although it is impossible to define this level, that is, the level where migration from thinly populated regions threatens to push them below a viable level and could lead to whole regions lying waste, they identify them in these terms:</P>
    <P>Although it is impossible to define this level clearly in the general adaptation and adjustment process in 1962 eight agricultural regions had a population density lower than 50 persons per square kilometre and 15 had a density lower than 75 per square kilometre.</P>
    <P>If those are the criteria it is a little disturbing to find that Ireland, outside <Col N="1992" /> Dublin, has a population density, if my metric conversion is correct and I have slight doubts about it, of 30 persons per square kilometre.  So, Ireland outside Dublin, in terms of population density, comes well below the bottom eight agricultural regions out of 100 or so regions in the Community.</P>
    <P>It needs to be said that Ireland is a very different case from other countries in this respect.  Our population density is very much lower than almost anywhere in the Community and policies which are designed in the context of the kind of population density in the Community would not be relevant in the case of Ireland.  This point needs to be made and our intentions, as I have said, in relation to this regional policy need to be notified in the course of the discussions.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words now on economic and monetary policy. Again, I am not too happy with the EEC thinking on this, not because I disagree with it but because I think it is unrealistic or, at any rate, nobody has convinced me it is realistic.  The Minister and the House will be aware of the proposals within the last two years to move towards an economic and monetary union, to move towards perhaps at the end of the decade a common currency&mdash;a legitimate and laudable aim.  It is difficult to see how you could have any kind of real political unity without a common currency of this kind.</P>
    <P>But let us consider what is involved in this.  A common currency involves an extraordinary obligation on all the people in the area of the common currency to support each other.  It is, although it is perhaps not always seen in this context, a statement of mutual obligation.  We have a common currency with the people of Connemara. This means even if the people of Connemara were able to get themselves paid twice as much as the rest of us, and as a result perhaps reduce employment in the area because there was nobody who would employ them at such a high rate and they all had to go on the dole, that we would have to accept the obligation to pay them and accept for the small number who succeeded in getting <Col N="1993" /> those very high salaries and wages the obligation to transfer resources to them in proportion to their higher money incomes.  It means accepting an obligation to run the whole country or area as a unit and that even if some people manage to grab more for themselves through pushing up wages and salaries you accept their right to continue to get a share of the national output proportionate to the level of salaries and incomes they have got.  That is a very serious obligation to enter into.</P>
    <P>It does not create many problems within an ordinary nation state because normally in a nation state the level of salaries and wages is reasonably uniform throughout.  There is a tendency to have them somewhat lower in rural areas, but the level of difference is not usually great and it is usually in that relationship&mdash; higher in urban areas lower in rural areas.  It would not be very feasible in this country in fact for people in one part of the country to push up their wages rapidly because the people in all areas would look for the same amount.  You cannot see the carpenter in Dublin accepting a situation in which the carpenter in Connemara doubles his wages and the carpenter in Dublin does not get any increase.</P>
    <P>Wages are determined nationally and by nationally we mean within the nation State.  Therefore, a common currency largely works, but of course there are distortions involving social injustices.  Some groups can occasionally push a bit far ahead, geographically or otherwise, but not very much further ahead than others, certainly not very much further ahead on a geographical basis.  Therefore a nation State works as an area for a currency unit, but when you try to move towards a common currency for the whole of Europe which consists of nation States which will retain their identity, very much so, retain their own languages, retain their own bargaining systems for wages and salaries, then you may be in difficulties.  It bothers me what happens supposing within this Community with this common currency the people of one country increase their wages and salaries very rapidly, as we have been doing very recently, and stake therefore <Col N="1994" /> a greater claim on the Community resources than people in other areas, and if the normal process of increases by comparison geographically that operates within the nation State does not operate within this Community. I can see certain advantages for people as active in increasing their wages and salaries as the Irish but could a Community work like this?</P>
    <P>A common currency would mean that if we managed to double our wages and salaries overnight we would have to be baled out by the Community. This currency which in the ordinary way would be devalued if it were a separate currency, would retain its value and the cost of carrying us and paying us so much more and giving us a bigger share in the Community resources would be borne by the other peoples.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House is familiar with the difference in attitudes if you sit down at a table and order a meal with some other people, depending on whether you are either paying for your own meal or are sharing.  If you are sharing with other people and prawn cocktails against soup cost 6s extra, you are only going to pay 1s of that because it is shared around.  Everybody will then have prawn cocktails very quickly.  That is a very fair and apt analogy.  I am a little bit afraid that a common currency in the Community before you have a common wage and salary negotiation system, which I see as a very long way away, could create a prawn cocktail economy in the EEC. It would be nice if the Irish could just order prawn cocktails and the others did not&mdash;and perhaps that might happen.  But it might happen the other way round.  The more likely thing would be that everybody would be going for prawn cocktails simultaneously.</P>
    <P>The inflationary pressures which could be created by a common currency created in advance of a common wage and salary negotiating system could be appalling.  Frankly, having read all the relevant memoranda on this subject, having read all Schiller and Barre have written and anything I can lay my hands on, I have not detected in any of them a single note <Col N="1995" /> of realism on this point.  They are all talking in the language of planners.  I do not often denigrate planners, being a bit of a planner myself, but there is a certain kind of planning which ignores realities.  It seems to me throughout those documents this kind of planning mentality exists.  The whole line is if we could persuade the Germans to inflate a little more and the rest to inflate a little less and if we planned that, if we got the Germans to agree to plan a little more inflation and we got the French and Italians to agree to plan a little less inflation, then it should be grand, because as we would all then inflate at the same rate there would be no problem with a common currency.</P>
    <P>This, however, assumes you can plan inflation.  I do not understand how these eminent gentlemen, with their experience of Europe over the past 25 years, retain this delightful innocence on the subject of planning inflation. Yet these documents are, throughout, entirely based on the concept that you can plan it.  Perhaps the Europeans are a more orderly people than we are.  Certainly, however, if they think they are going to plan Irish inflation&mdash;that is part of the deal&mdash;they will have to re-think the Schiller and Barre memoranda.  I cannot see how anything that happened in this country in recent years, and even in the past two years, offers any evidence in support of this thesis.  I may be wrong in this.  This is not an aspect of economics on which I am an expert.  However it seems to me that there is a basic element here which has not been allowed for.  While I am certainly in favour of moving towards closer economic and monetary co-operation, towards economic and monetary union and towards a common currency, I think the countries planning these will need to be very realistic about the whole business of incomes.  In a series of countries, none of whom has a viable incomes policy&mdash;none of them, apparently, has such an incomes policy as we have not&mdash;I do not see how a common currency will work.  I should like more enlightenment on this.  However, this is something that is in the future. We shall have our voice on this as time <Col N="1996" /> goes on and we can sound a warning note.  There is a problem here in regard to economic and monetary union and it is something we will have to take account of in the future.</P>
    <P>The harmonisation of taxation has been discussed.  I think there is some misunderstanding that should be clarified. The harmonisation of taxation in the EEC arises because of a technical problem involved in ensuring that imports are treated on an equal basis with home production.  Because the home product of countries has to pay a turnover tax of some kind or an expenditure tax of some kind, it is necessary that imports while not being less favourably treated, should certainly not be more favourably treated either. Therefore, it is necessary that they should pay a tax equivalent to the domestic tax.  In most of these countries, the kinds of expenditure taxes they had were ones imposed on the value of goods at each stage of production. Consequently, goods made by a series of firms selling raw materials one to the other, and so on, would bear much higher tax than the tax paid by a virtually integrated firm which bought the raw material, put it through all the processes in its virtually integrated complex, and then sold the final product.  It was, therefore, impossible to determine the full and valid import tax one had to pay on a product because, as each domestic producer paid a different tax level, depending on the degree of integration, the Government could not know what was the right import tax to charge and it was impossible to put imports on an equal basis with home production. Therefore, it was necessary, for this highly technical reason, to move towards an added value tax in which you would not tax the total value of goods at each stage of production but only the value added at each stage of production. That is the argument about this.  There is nothing sinister about it. It is simply a technical necessity if you are creating a common market and if, in that common market, you already have this kind of expenditure taxation.</P>
    <P>However, it could pose problems for us&mdash;not arising from introducing such a tax: there would be some ordinary problems but none that we cannot <Col N="1997" /> overcome.  There are strong arguments for such a tax.  It would spread the burden of taxation over more stages. The burden on the final stage of production will be reduced.  This reduces the incentives for evasion and enables us to have a higher level of taxation without risk of evasion.  All these are technically good points.  The problem is that the actual level of expenditure on taxes in the Six is a good deal higher than it is here.  The average level is somewhere around 15 per cent: the range is 8 to 20 per cent; perhaps slightly higher in one case.  A 15 per cent expenditure tax would be something like double the added value tax required to produce the tax revenue we now get from turnover taxes and wholesale taxes.</P>
    <P>If the EEC move, as they are doing, not only towards harmonising the added value tax system, which we would have to accept, but towards the harmonising of the level of this tax at about 15 per cent, it would then be necessary for us to raise very sharply the level of indirect taxation at that point in time or perhaps gradually over a period of years before that point in time.  This would pose problems. Some people suggest they are insuperable. Some people have a rooted idea that all direct taxes are good because they are progressive and that all indirect taxes are bad because they are regressive.  This is nonsense.  Life was never so simple.  A very interesting paper which I recommend to anybody with that view is the paper read by Mr. Reason of the Revenue Commissioners and incorporated in an Appendix to the Seventh Report of the Income Tax Commission.  It explains how a number of our expenditure taxes, other than, I think, that on tobacco, are in fact progressive.  There is no economic law which says that all indirect taxes are regressive.  On the contrary, most indirect taxes are progressive and some of them are more progressive than income tax.  One should not be dogmatic about this. Nevertheless, one accepts that the added value tax, over the generality of goods, if applied to all goods including foodstuffs&mdash;it is quite possible they could be exempted&mdash;could be regressive in its operation.  There is an <Col N="1998" /> assumption that, if that happens, there is nothing you can do about it.  This is not the case.  There are many ingenious ways of collecting money from people and giving it back to people.  There would be some technical difficulties, too.  However, there would be no insuperable problem of devising a system of collecting other taxes, of reducing other taxes or of making payments out to people through family allowances or other means&mdash;perhaps even through direct payments involving a negative income tax system&mdash;if it is necessary to avoid this new type of taxation being regressive.</P>
    <P>It would certainly be a mistake to think that you have to accept the regressive element in indirect taxation which exists and do nothing about it.  It would be necessary to do something about it.  I should like to hear from the Government what calculations they have made corresponding to the kinds of calculations Mr. Reason made 16 years ago to assess the regressive element that would be involved in this indirect taxation and to show what steps may be taken to ensure that adjustments in other parts of the tax code would eliminate this and ensure that the impact on the less well-off sections would not be adverse.  I have no doubt this can be done.  I should like to know that the Government are thinking on this subject.  That is really my point.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the Government have applied their minds to this and that proposals have been drawn up to achieve this result.  I am afraid the Government here, as in other aspects, have not done their homework.  The Minister should ask his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to publish a White Paper showing us how the added value tax could be introduced with such adjustments in the general tax system as to avoid any regressive effects.  That is what we should be thinking about, studying, planning.  How is it proposed to achieve this?  It is important that it should be achieved.  One element in the package, but only one, will have to be a reduction or elimination of rates.  We have often wondered how to eliminate or reduce them.  They are <Col N="1999" /> obviously a very inequitable tax.  If you have to double your expenditure taxes, there is an ideal opportunity for getting rid of all, or a large part, of rates.  That alone might not restore the balance of equity because people paying rates may include the relatively better off people in the community. It may be necessary to make other adjustments to avoid the net effect of such a change being regressive.  The Government need not say that to disclose their plans here would weaken their negotiating position.  This is entirely a domestic matter.</P>
    <P>On cartels and monopolies&mdash;I shall not dwell on these&mdash;I have said a few words already I think that this part of the EEC policy is very important. The present policy is designed to encourage mergers just as our policy here is designed to encourage mergers to strengthen firms and it is also designed to prevent monopolies and cartels from operating in such a way as to have an adverse effect on the freeing of trade.  I am not convinced that the overall cartel, monopoly and merger policy of the EEC has a sufficient social content.  It seems to me to be exceptionally industrially oriented &mdash;too much towards industrial efficiency; the growth of large units&mdash;not sufficiently taking account of the social factors.  I may be unfair in that.  This is something on which the Government should have views and should express them.</P>
    <P>I want now to move to agriculture. I shall say a little about agriculture at this point and conclude by talking about the negotiations as such.  I want to tell the Minister that is what I propose to do because he wanted to know when I would finish.  On agriculture, we must confront the problem. We are not honest with ourselves and if that be the case we cannot be honest with anyobody else.  The name Mansholt has been held up in this country to extraordinary abuse.  This man is the devil incarnate whose whole pleasure in life is found from whipping the kulaks, the small farmers, into the ground.  This picture of Dr. Mansholt I find difficult to reconcile either with the man I have met or with the man's <Col N="2000" /> personal history.  He is a socialist and whipping kulaks is not a normal characteristic of socialists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, it is conditioned and because I share Dr. Mansholt's aim of improving the level of incomes in agriculture to the level of industrial workers, an aim which is not apparently shared by many people in this country, I find a good deal to sympathise with although much that is inadequate in his proposals.  This man is a Dutch Socialist Minister for Agriculture and he has been on the job in the EEC for the last 12 years trying to produce an agricultural policy that works.</P>
      <P>I recall his visit here about ten years ago because I had the pleasure of presiding at the meeting and it gave me a rare pleasure which I have treasured ever since.  As I was chairman I was sitting facing the audience.  In the first row of the audience there were four Government Ministers, alas all now departed elsewhere.  At one stage Dr. Mansholt, who has an impish sense of humour, as well as long experience as a politician, congratulated the Irish Government on their success in getting people off the land.  The faces of the Ministers concerned were a picture and I was very glad I was facing them and could see how they looked at that moment.  I am afraid Dr. Mansholt's sense of humour, perhaps, gets the better of him at times and it is not always appreciated by some of the people to whom it is addressed.</P>

      <P>The problem with which we should be concerned here is to secure that the people of this country get a decent living in this country and I sometimes think, with all I hear about agricultural policy, that nobody is ever thinking about this for farmers. Oh, yes, for industrial workers we are all for higher wages, but when it comes to farmers, farmers are people whom we, who live in the cities, like to stay on the land.  We like these little cottages to be populated, with smoke coming out of the chimneys.  We do not mind if they have only a third of a day's work; we do not mind if they have only £5 a week to live on, as long as they stay there and populate the countryside and do not give us a guilt complex by leaving the cottages empty. This, I am afraid, is the attitude of all too many urban dwellers and, I am afraid, of all too many politicians of all parties.  I cannot accept this.  I am speaking personally on this point and I feel strongly about it.  I feel we should aim to secure for the farmers of this country a standard of living comparable with that of the industrial workers of this country.  That is the aim of the Mansholt Plan.  It may be in some respects inadequate, in some respects ill-conceived, but it is a valid aim and anybody who criticises it faces a moral obligation to show an alternative route towards this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> My own belief is that in this country, if one looks at most of the country other than the West, the size of a farm being so much bigger than in most EEC countries and climatic conditions being so favourable to certain forms of agriculture&mdash;most farms in Ireland are of a size which is close enough to the level that could yield an adequate income &mdash;that is an income similar to what the industrial worker will get in the years ahead&mdash;to secure that structural reform may not be a major requirement or problem throughout most of this country.  I shall give a few figures to illustrate this because in all the nonsense that is talked on this subject the absence of figures is what enables people to talk nonsense.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by the Agricultural Institute on farm incomes several years ago, though badly presented, in a misleading manner, yields information from which it is possible to deduce that in 1968 the average level of farm incomes in, for example, east Munster, on a typical size of farm &mdash;30 to 50 acres&mdash;would have been about £750 a year from farm activities plus the best part of £100 a year from other sources.  We have been told by the Government in their White Paper, and I accept this as a reasonable estimate, that the increase in prices under EEC conditions which would be of the order of approaching 50 per cent for beef and milk would produce an increase in output of 30 to 40 per cent. This would roughly double the gross income of farms over the country as a whole with a natural tendency for the increase to be bigger in the areas where the farms are more capable of expansion of output and where the farmers are better equipped to achieve it than in the other areas which are less favoured.  A virtual doubling of gross income not accompanied by a proportionate increase in the cost of inputs, although there would be a big increase, would tend to yield, if anything, a rather larger increase in family farm income.  It seems to me, therefore, that very roughly under EEC conditions a particular farmer in, say, Munster with a 30-50 acres farm could expect to have an income of the order of £1,500 <Col N="2003" /> a year after the EEC agricultural policy has been in operation for some years.</P>
    <P>The typical income at the moment of industrial workers is £1,000 a year in this country and, of course, it is going up all the time.  I am talking here in real purchasing power rather than money terms.  It does not go up that rapidly in real terms.  Given that the income of the industrial worker is now £1,000 a year and rising and given that the typical sized farm throughout most of the country would be capable under EEC conditions of yielding an income of the order of £1,500 a year, I feel that for the most of Ireland structural reform on any substantial scale will not be necessary to reach the Mansholt objective of achieving camparability of farm incomes and industrial incomes so that the farmers are not placed, as they are today at a disadvantage.  I may be wrong in this. I am not an agricultural economist. I am puzzled by the fact that agricultural economists do not seem to do these kind of calculations.  They leave them to a non-agricultural economist like me.  I should like somebody to do the calculations who is better qualified than I am, to tell me if I am wrong.  It seems to me that we do not face a major structural problem in most of Ireland of the kind that is faced on the Continent.  On the Continent of Europe the farms are small and more fragmented than here and, consequently, the problem of structural reform is much greater.</P>
    <P>We do, however, undoubtedly face a major problem of structural reform in the West of Ireland.  It is no good pretending we do not.  Information derived from the same survey suggests to me anyway that the level of income in the West of Ireland on a typical farm there, which is 15 to 30 acres, in 1968 was about £250 a year from farming plus £100 from other sources. Even if, which I think is improbable, the EEC higher price levels induced as big an increase in output in the west as in the rest of the country, the maximum income that could be got from such a farm under the most favourable conditions, with EEC prices which are <Col N="2004" /> at such a high level that they create a vast surplus, would be £500 a year after years of progress towards this level in response to the higher price levels.  This is an order of magnitude. Somebody can say it is £450 or £600. It does not matter.  You cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, show that the incomes of these people are going to be much over £500 a year even in the most favourable conditions imaginable.  I do not think people in this House or outside it have a right to talk about keeping people on the land at that level of income, and that is what is going on.  What we have to do is to face the fact that this is the position.  It is not a nice position.  We do not like it but we have a duty to do something about it.</P>
    <P>There is no conceivable method of farming that will yield incomes of the order of £1,500 a year from farms of this size on that quality of land in the West of Ireland.  To evade the problem by suggesting that the farmers can all go off and get spare-time jobs in industry, when this would involve a quintupling of industrial activity in the West of Ireland, is nonsense.  Not only is it nonsense, it is dangerous nonsense.  It is trying to delude people into thinking they will get something they cannot possibly get.  It is a particularly painful and unpleasant kind of deluding for politicians to indulge in.  The people who are being deluded in this way have a right to resent this kind of treatment.</P>
    <P>The part-time farming idea is excellent in itself.  There are many cases where farmers with small farms could get other employment but, to suggest that is a panacea and that you can avoid any need for structural reform in the West of Ireland by having part-time employment for all the farmers, is absolutely nonsense.  Those who make this assertion know it is nonsense. It is an attempt to delude the people in the West of Ireland into thinking something is being done for them when it is not.  The fact is that the West of Ireland has a problem of structural reform.  There is no conceivable way in which farms of that size could ever yield an income, under any conceivable circumstances, that <Col N="2005" /> would give people a decent living.  To pretend otherwise may be politically popular and politically convenient, but it is dishonest, and dishonest in a peculiarly objectionable way.</P>
    <P>The Mansholt Plan is designed to deal with this type of problem and to face it.  The honest politician, the socialist Minister for Agriculture in Holland, who faces it is, to my mind more to be commended than people who try to dodge around the problem by refusing even to look at it.  If anyone in this House thinks I am wrong let him get up and tell me how the £250 income is to be multiplied sixfold by any combination of prices and systems of farming.  I am not an expert on farming.  Perhaps this is possible.</P>

      <P>It must be possible not just for the most brilliant farmer in the area, the farmer of the year, but for the average farmer in the West of Ireland, and it is not possible.  We must face this fact.  That means there will have to be structural reforms in the West of Ireland, not because Mansholt says so but because the people will not remain at this level of income.  We know they will not remain and we are trying to salve our consciences by pretending we will keep them on the land by saying they should stay there, while ensuring that, by failing to do anything about the problem, their incomes will be such that they will not be able to stay on the land and the West of Ireland will become depopulated.  If we do not face this problem, and face it by providing alternative employment for the people in the West of Ireland, they will not remain on the farms and they will not remain anywhere else in the West of Ireland.  That is the lesson of the Mansholt Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have many difficulties about the details of that plan.  Frankly, I do not believe that some of the provisions are in any way adequate to achieve the stated objectives.  As regards the pensioning off of people, the proposals as adumbrated at the moment involve deducting the old age pension from the <Col N="2006" /> pensions given to farmers who are pensioned off.  The maximum incentive, I think, is £100 a year.</P>
    <P>There are many other proposals here, some of which have merit and some of which are generous enough to induce some changes, both in pensioning some people off to release land for others and in encouraging people to develop their farms.  That side of it is good, but I think there is a weakness in that, just as our scheme to achieve this result of releasing farmland in Ireland was so inadequate that only about 13 farmers in the entire country showed an interest in it or accepted it over the past five years, so also the Mansholt Plan, it seems to me, is quite inadequate in this respect and will not achieve the objectives it sets out to achieve&mdash;if that is any reassurance to those who want people to stay on small farms at inadequate incomes.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that the proposals to assist farmers to develop their farms into viable units are good.  In this instance, while the financial provisions may be adequate, the number of farmers we can expect to use this scheme is so small as to make it quite unrealistic.  I would also hazard a guess that there are enough farmers in Ireland alone to take up the terms offered, to use the full amount of money allocated for the purpose, not to speak of the rest of the Community. The Mansholt Plan is unrealistic in its under-assessment of the number of people who will go in for the farm plan and the financial assistance to develop their farms&mdash;unrealistically low in its assessment of that, and unrealistically high in its assessment of the number who will agree to be pensioned off. That is a matter of opinion.  As I say, I am not an expert on farming.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear this subject debated in this House, not by simply using the word &ldquo;Mansholt&rdquo; as a term of abuse backwards and forwards across the House but by talking about the Mansholt Plan.  There is no difficulty about getting it.  The original plan is readily available.  This is the revised plan which has been prepared in response to the criticisms made of the original plan.  It was produced on 29th April, 1970, and it is available.  I presume <Col N="2007" /> the Government have got it.  I presume they have it translated into English.  I would hope so.  They should circulate it so that we could discuss the realities of it and refer to what the effects are likely to be in Irish circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is a plan designed to solve the problem of low agricultural incomes.  I do not think people are entitled to criticise it until they have some other proposal, until they can say what they would do about it.  To suggest that the plan is objectionable, <i>per se</i>, and that there is no alternative to be put forward, simply to hope that people will stay on the land at this income of £250 a year now or £500 a year when the EEC policy is in effect, may be good politics but it is not social justice and not good economics either, for what that is worth.  That is all I want to say on that subject.  Others can develop it more fully who know more about agriculture than I do.</P>
    <P>I want now to conclude on the question of the negotiations.  I want to take Deputy Cruise-O'Brien up on this point because, interestingly enough, I was reading an editorial in the Agence Europe Bulletin of a few days ago on this very point.  The point made was that of course these are not negotiations in the ordinary sense at all.  The early part of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's speech was an excellent account of how international negotiations are carried on.  I was with him all the way.  I think one of the papers says this morning that one would love to have Deputy Cruise-O'Brien engaged in negotiations of that kind.  He would do it very well with his experience.</P>
    <P>But these are not negotiations of that kind; at least in large part they are not. There is one area in respect of which international negotiations of this kind would, I think, be proper, that is, in relation to the proposals for the structure of the Community, the allocation of the numbers of members of parliament and the voting power of the Council of Ministers.  There is an area for hard international bargaining, with each country wanting to get a bit for itself and trying to do a bit better than another country.  That is an area in <Col N="2008" /> which Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's concept of negotiations would be applicable.</P>
    <P>But the point here is that the terms are so generous, as I mentioned earlier, giving us five times what we are entitled to in terms of population, that the last thing we should do is to negotiate. We should just accept them quickly before they think twice about it.  For the rest it is not a question of negotiation.  This is a complete misconception because it goes back to the failure to appreciate what this is.  It is a Community.  It is not two countries trying to get the better of each other in trade negotiations.  It is an attempt to create a Community in which there will be fair treatment for all.</P>
    <P>Talking of going in to get the best bargain and insisting on getting concessions on this and concessions on that, misconceives the position.  There is, of course, room for discussions&mdash;I would hardly call them negotiations&mdash; on the terms during the transitional period.  There are things here to be discussed and our Government must seek certain concessions.  I would agree entirely with Deputy Cosgrave that it would be the wrong approach, and perhaps disastrously wrong, to go with a long shopping list of the things Ireland needs in order to get in.  This would betray such a misconception about the Community that it would do us a lot of damage.  It did the British a lot of damage in 1962.</P>

      <P>What does the Deputy think about voluntary engagements for which we have not been asked, such as an engagement that we will enter into military commitments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that because I think the Deputy has a good point.  I would tend to agree with him on that particular point.  The last point I want to come to is the question of defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the transitional period there are certain points for discussion between ourselves and the Community.  There are points of detail for discussion which are important to us, but the Community work as a Community within which a balance is sought to be maintained in the interest of all concerned <Col N="2009" /> and if this balance fails, if as a result of the operation of economic forces or the operation of the provisions of the Rome Treaty and the directives under it, a country or a sector of a country suffers, the Community have the obligation to remedy this problem.</P>
    <P>That obligation is carried out through supranational institutions whose job it is to safeguard the interest of the people of the Community just as when the French refrigerator industry got into difficulties they applied for assistance and got assistance.  It would be inconceivable that they would not.  We are not dealing here with hard-hearted people as one Labour Deputy said by a slip of the tongue.  They are hard-headed perhaps, but not hard-hearted.  They are concerned to create a Community.  Each one knows that he might be in the position the next day of having to look for some concession because of a difficulty that had arisen in his country. They might need the sympathy of their opposite numbers.  They know they are trying to create something together. We are not talking here about a hard bargain to win some concession for us&mdash;this could be true of the voting system but I do not think it will arise there.  It could be true to a very small degree of the transitional period of negotiations but basically we are concerned with securing entry to a Community within which we will on equal terms with the other members work out our problems together.  Failure to appreciate this was evident in Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's approach and is the root of many of the difficulties in this affair.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to understand what is involved as regards political unity and defence.  I may be unfair on this, I am not too sure of my ground here.  I am a little in sympathy with Deputy Cruise-O'Brien. We should make it clear that we are prepared to go into a political union accepting all the implications of that.</P>
    <P>The question of defence has not arisen.  There is no proposal in regard to this.  The nearest they have got to anything in this sphere are the discussions between Foreign Ministers <Col N="2010" /> which are going on at present on the subject of political union which simply amounts to coming down to an agreement to consult together on common problems without any commitment on what is going to be done about them.  Defence is nowhere in the offing at the present time.  It is premature for us to talk about involving ourselves in defence commitments.  I accept if this becomes a full political union that the common defence of the Community could become an issue at some time.  I think the Government have gone further than was necessary in this respect.</P>
    <P>I want simply to conclude by restating my view of the whole position.  We have to see this as a Community and as something completely new in international affairs, involving the devolution of parts of our sovereignty upwards to be shared jointly at a level where we will have our part to play and where we will play our part in decision making, while retaining sovereignty over the remaining aspects of our own affairs and I hope extend the sovereignty downwards to regional governments of one kind or another as time goes on.  I believe through this mechanism we will achieve results which will be economically superior to what we have had in the past&mdash;they would need to be&mdash;and which can potentially be socially superior.  I believe there are many other peoples in this Community who share our aspirations for peace and social justice who will go with us on this path.  I do not think the Community is perfect, I have listed at some length its imperfections. In fact, I can claim credit for having introduced to the House some imperfections which they had not heard of.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to cover anything up at all; on the contrary, we must know the Community, warts and all before we join it.  We must see it as something which is in process of being built, something which we are getting in on, not quite on the ground floor&mdash; there are some things in it which might have been quite different if we had been there on the ground floor&mdash; but are getting in on early enough to help to mould it into the shape we <Col N="2011" /> desire.  This is the opportunity offered to us.  I believe we should grasp it.</P>

      <P>I agree with those people who say that when we begin formal negotiations next Tuesday we shall be entering into one of the most important phases of our history as an independent nation.  Before going any further I should like to say that I accept what the previous speaker, Deputy FitzGerald has said.  I think Deputy Cruise-O'Brien is wrong to think of these negotiations as a bilateral trading type arrangement where one gives a bit and takes a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is different even to multilateral trading where one gives something to gain something else.  We have applied for and are seeking to negotiate membership of a Community, a Common Market which will be our market, bodies in whose decision-making we shall participate.  I raise these matters at this time because the purpose of this debate is to make available the greatest amount of knowledge at this particular time.  Deputy Corish complained that nobody told him about the Community but I think he is getting information in abundance now.</P>
      <P>The question of defence does not arise in our negotiations.  We intend to seek to become a member of a united Europe.  We intend to participate as a member of the EEC and to take on all the obligations of members.  If political unity which is a part of the commitment of membership from the very beginning develops far enough, we will have a part in that development and if the defence of the Community arises then we will not refuse to participate in the defence of the Community of which we are a part.</P>

      <P>Commitment to political unity is demanded by the Treaty of Rome and the implication of defence arose out of that.  Those who spoke on our behalf felt it more <Col N="2012" /> honest to say that if political development goes to its finality and an institution is created of which we are a part and defence is discussed in that Community of which we are a part we shall not renege our duties.  This does not imply that we have given anything or received anything in return.  It has not been part of our negotiations and I do not believe it will be part of the accession negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A full commitment.  I would like to refer to the Deputy's statement that we have nothing left to negotiate because I think the whole basis of our policy to date has been to look outwards internationally and to participate in international co-operation and seek peace in the world. It is in this new European co-operation that it was sought to serve the cause of peace.  The greatest possible contribution can now be made by the Communties. There are two ways of looking at this&mdash;and I think it needs a great deal of imagination even for people who say they have been deprived of the knowledge&mdash;one can think of Europe in terms of war and in such terms a good place to be would be on the periphery of the Continent and the other way to think of it is Europe at peace and the periphery would be a bad place to be because we would be a voice without authority lecturing the people on the mainland who are working at the protection of peace.</P>
      <P>Since 1945 our life has been based on the prospect of peace and every attempt we could make to preserve peace.  If we could not plan on the basis of peace life would not be worth living.  I believe the basic function of the creation of an united Europe was to contribute to peace.  If one thinks that the only future for the world is another holocaust&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We can envisage it but we must not force ourselves into inaction. I accept the thesis of the Leader of the Labour Party that it is a good thing they objected to this country becoming a member of the EEC because it is rather unreal to be in the Dáil and hear people saying: &ldquo;We take note of it&rdquo;.  We should be debating the matter. I would accept it as much more sincere if he had taken the line and said: &ldquo;We must now seek this line of action&rdquo;.  If he went out and tried to carry this line of action in which he believes, and if he is willing to take the responsibility of taking the country there and standing up and being counted when they arrive there, then I think it would be a good thing.  But to stand up here and say first: &ldquo;The Government did not tell us&rdquo;, and then: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will vote us into Europe whatever we do&rdquo;, raising the caoin as we go into Europe, is hardly an alternative policy &mdash;&ldquo; `We'll all be ruined,' said Hanrahan, `before the year is out'.&rdquo;  An argument against that is that it makes people fearful.  Deputy Corish allowed the Dáil and the public to have a look at him as he took counsel with his fears: he has been doing that for so long that it can end up by freezing you into a conservative reactionary position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be no reason to have all these arguments. Deputy FitzGerald had quite a long argument with himself, although he did honestly admit that he missed the controversy, that he felt there should be somebody arguing that we should not go into Europe.  Since the very beginning there has seemed to be acquiesence&mdash;acceptance or enthusiasm, according to the person you are talking about&mdash;in regard to the prospect of joining Europe.  Only recently people had what I thought was the <Col N="2014" /> audacity, but I am willing to accept it as truth to suggest that the silence of most people on this matter represents a lack of interest because of the frustrations so far at the failure of previous negotiations.  Now that negotiations are imminent people are beginning to have anxieties.  If this is the case, we should give our point of view positively and seek to get as much agreement as possible.  If this is one of the most important phases of our history as an independent nation the period ahead will call for a decisive commitment from the Irish people to mobilise and deploy our energies and resources so that we can prepare ourselves to become a member of the Community and to play our part in it.</P>
      <P>This is not just a trading arrangement in which we are offering something to get something.  We have to live side by side with others and take successful advantage of the opportunities which membership will present.  To some it could clearly be a question of: is it to be a war situation or do we plan for peace?  Twenty years ago, Robert Schumann, who was one of the great architects of post-war Europe stated: &ldquo;The contribution which an organised and active Europe can make to civilisation is indispensable for the maintenance of peaceful relations.  Because Europe was not united we had war.&rdquo; The first thought among other things at that time was on the question of peace.  For this purpose he sought a unified Europe which he said &ldquo;will not be achieved all at once nor in a single framework but will be formed by concrete measures which first of all create solidarity in fact&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is part of the Schumann declaration which led to the establishment of a European Coal and Steel Community in 1951.  Six years later the member states, encouraged by the success of the Coal and Steel Community, signed the Treaties of Rome.  These established the EEC and Euratom.  The three Communities which the Treaties of Rome and Paris brought into being were, perhaps, the most ambitious and far-reaching efforts made by the countries of Europe in the post-war years in organising co-operation in the reconstruction of the Continent from the ravages of war, in ensuring the <Col N="2015" /> economic and social wellbeing of their peoples&mdash;perhaps one should refer again there to the suggestion that the Community are not concerned with people &mdash; in moving towards the political unity of which we have spoken and which the experience of the then recent holocaust and the desire for future peace demanded in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Member Governments at that time set themselves a series of tasks: common action for the economic and social progress of their countries; the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their people; concerted action to guarantee steady expansion, balanced trade and fair competition; strengthening the unity of their countries' economies and their harmonious development by reducing regional difference; the progressive abolition of all restrictions on international trade.  All these objectives form the basis of the EEC and the means of achieving these objectives were spelt out in the Treaty of Rome.  These were the concrete measures, I suggest, envisaged by Robert Schumann when he spoke of creating a solidarity in fact which had at that time, and still has as its ultimate aim the political unity of Europe, &ldquo;the ever closer union of the European peoples&rdquo; to which these great Europeans of the post-war period aspired.</P>
    <P>What has been achieved by the member States to date in the realisation of their objectives has been very impressive. At the end of 1969, the EEC had completed its transitional period. It has now entered on its final, definitive stage.  The customs union is fully in operation.  Tariffs and other trade restrictions between member states have been eliminated.  National tariffs between member states and the outside world have been replaced by the Community's common customs tariff.  The agricultural systems of the Member States have been integrated, so far as all the more important products are concerned, under a common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>All discrimination as between nationals of Member States in employment, pay and working conditions has been abolished.  Important measures <Col N="2016" /> have also been taken towards the adoption of a commercial policy towards non-member countries and towards the achievement of full right of establishment and supply of services.</P>
    <P>With a view to financing the budgets of the Community there has been the most important agreement for the replacement of the contributions of Member States by the Community's own resources.  These are some of the achievements in the 12 years since the EEC was established.  Now that the final stage has been reached, Member States have set their sights on the strengthening of the Community.  This they regard as the next stage in the Community's evolution.  They are concentrating now on the measures which are necessary to strengthen the Community. The Heads of States or Governments met in The Hague last December and set a series of actions in motion in various fields.  Work is now in progress on such important matters as the creation of an economic and monetary union, the formulation of an industrial policy, and the Community is pressing ahead with vigour in areas such as energy and transport.  All these actions are aimed at strengthening the EEC because, although 1969 saw the end of the transitional period, the EEC continues to evolve.  Indeed the creation of the economic and monetary union is seen by the Member States as the next major step for the Community, the achievement of which will mark a most significant step towards the goal of political unity.</P>
    <P>I might say at this stage&mdash;and again I have in mind people who I think are a minority but often speak as if speaking for the silent majority who they say have not said this but want to say it&mdash;that this development in Europe cannot be ignored by us. We must make a decision and we must have a policy based on the options open to us.  There is absolutely no way out of making a decision except by becoming a member of the Labour Party!</P>
    <P>At the Hague Summit Meeting the member states in their agreement on the future course of the Community associated with this question of completion <Col N="2017" /> and strengthening of the Community the question of its enlargement. The three questions which came up at that time were completion, strengthening and enlargement.  The member states at the Hague Summit Meeting reaffirmed their agreement on the principle of the enlargement of the Community and indicated at that time their agreement on the opening of negotiations on this question of enlargement.</P>
    <P>At that time they clearly restated the essential conditions required of any applicant for admission, and these conditions are: acceptance of the treaties and their political finality, the decisions taken in the implementation of the Treaties and the actions taken in the sphere of their development.  Since then and following agreement on outstanding measures necessary for completion, including the financing arrangements and steps for further strengthening of the Communities, the Member States have been involved in preparing the Communities negotiating positions for the opening of the enlargement negotiations. This preparatory work has now been completed in accordance with the original schedule as envisaged by the Member States.</P>
    <P>I had intended at every few pages of this contribution to remind the House that decisions have to be made by Ireland now, and have to be made because of the development in Europe. There is no way out of deciding what policy this country must have because the European Communities exist as a fact.  We are not here to say this development in Europe should not happen or this development in Europe should not affect us.  It has happened, it is evolving and it is affecting us, and no matter what decision we make, no matter what policy we follow, it will have a profound effect on us.</P>
    <P>The opening of negotiations on Tuesday next, 30th June, will be a formal meeting in which the representatives of the Community, the six members, and the four applicant countries will participate. We understand that the ministerial representative of each of the applicant countries will be called upon to make a statement, and accordingly I shall be making a statement on behalf of the Government.  In that statement, <Col N="2018" /> among other things, I shall refer to the matters of particular importance to this country which we shall wish to have discussed during the course of the negotiations.  We have been informed that a substantive negotiation session with Ireland at ministerial level is planned for 21st September after the Community summer recess for August and meetings with Norway and Denmark are planned for 22nd September. It is understood that one substantive meeting with the British will take place before the summer recess, on 21st July.</P>
    <P>I think that what I have said about the Community in summary outline of its developments gives a sufficiently clear indication of how impressive the achievements to date have been.  The programme for future Community action agreed at the Hague Summit Meeting by the Member States is evidence of a new determination which, after the disappointments and setbacks of recent years, now informs the Member States in their deliberations and actions on matters relating to the actions on matters relating to the Community.</P>
    <P>In the early stages of my consultations with Ministers of the Member States almost a year ago now, I discovered that it was a critical time for the Community, that it had evolved to the position where a definite decision had to be made, and the decision which was made was for enlargement, completion and strengthening. This positive, purposeful and decisive spirit has enabled the Community to formulate its common position on the negotiations on enlargement in time for 30th June as scheduled.  I am confident from my talks with Ministers of the Member States that the negotiations themselves will be conducted in the same spirit.</P>
    <P>I had further evidence of this from the distinguished Foreign Minister of Belgium, M. Harmel, with whom I had talks yesterday morning.  M. Harmel is President in office of the Council and as such he will speak on behalf of the Community at the opening of the negotiations.  Our Government will, for their part, approach the negotiations with a matching determination <Col N="2019" /> and a hope for their success. We have waited a long time for this opportunity.  As Deputy FitzGerald said, we might wait another thousand years before such an opportunity would come again.  We are most conscious of how vital it is for our own future and the future of Europe that the negotiations should succeed on this occasion.  If these negotiations fail we may never have another opportunity.</P>
    <P>Somebody said it was desirable to have argument, and I agreed with this. However, it is the desire of the Government that as many people as possible in the House and throughout the country should be fully informed and, being informed, should be in agreement on the course on which we are now embarking.  What we want to ensure are the national interest and the common good of our own people. There are other cogent reasons which can be related to the national interest, but the national interest and the common good must be for us, as no doubt they were for the founder member states and will be for the other applicants, the paramount considerations determining our policy in relation to Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government's assessments over the years of the position in relation to membership, the implications of membership&mdash;and the most recent of those were the studies on the preparation of the White Paper&mdash;were made with these criteria in mind, the common good of our people and the national interest. The original application for membership of the EEC was made in the firm belief that the future of our country lay in joining with the member states of the Community and those other European countries who desire to become members in working towards the political and economic unity of Europe. The Government believed then and believe now that our own interests would thereby best be served.  This conclusion was based on an awareness of Ireland as an integral part of Europe; on a realisation of the need to act in close concert with other like-minded peoples in Europe in the interests of peace and economic progress <Col N="2020" /> for all people, and especially our own; and on an examination of the economic options open to us.  These are the things upon which the Government based their conclusions.</P>
    <P>We are Europeans; we can contribute and should contribute to this new European situation in the cause of peace and progress for all our people. We must examine the economic options which are open to us and come to the conclusions which Deputy FitzGerald has spelt out in great detail, having examined these economic options.  The evolution of the Community in the nine years or so since our first application was made and the facts of our own economic development and of our economic prospects, have strengthened the Government in this conviction that we should be part of Europe, that we should apply for membership. This same conviction has influenced all our policies, all Government policies and actions over the past decade in relation to economic development and in the preparation of the economy for conditions of free trade.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has reviewed the important aspects and the implications for us of membership of the Communities which we dealt with in the first chapter of the White Paper.  It is not necessary for everybody to go over all the ground but I should like to point to the inescapable conclusion to be drawn from the searching examination upon which the White Paper was based.  It is a conclusion which anybody who has given serious study to the question of joining the Community shares.  It is that as a member of the enlarged Communities Ireland will best be able to realise her economic and social potential and will best be able to ensure the welfare of her people.  Membership should, as the White Paper concludes, provide the long term and assured markets and the guaranteed prices which will be vital for the future prosperity of agriculture. The huge market of the enlarged Communities, which will be the world's largest, will provide unparalleled opportunities for industrial exports on which the growth of our industry, and indeed of our economic development, depends.  These opportunities <Col N="2021" /> if availed of fully and imaginatively should result in industrial growth here at a much faster pace than heretofore. Furthermore, as a member of the enlarged Communities&mdash;I think nobody needs to produce any evidence, as demanded by Deputy Corish&mdash;Ireland should provide a more attractive economic environment for foreign industrialists, foreign-based industry.  I think the Deputy will accept that this has been and should be in the future a very important factor in our industrial expansion and in the provision of job opportunities.</P>

      <P>As I see it, membership of the Community and the creation of job opportunities will mean that more Irish people will be able to live and work in Ireland.  I do not think membership of the Communities will stop the keening being raised from the Labour benches.  We must have more industry and we must have more employment if we are to keep our people in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something which has been touched upon by many and that is that apart from providing these opportunities of which I have spoken membership of the Communities will put us in an environment in which we can fully realise what somebody has described as our &ldquo;European-ness&rdquo;, the fact that we are an independent nation <Col N="2022" /> with our own culture, or maybe more than one culture, belonging to Europe and respected by the different European countries.  Those with vision can see that we shall find in the Communities an environment in which this European aspect of Ireland will develop in a much fuller and more significant way than it did up to now.</P>
    <P>Geography has placed us on the periphery of the Continent but we are Europeans and in case anybody thinks we are losing our identity by becoming Europeans I would say that we are a European nation just as the other members of the Six are separate European nations.  We are an integral part of Europe.  We are bound to the Continent by centuries of shared civilisation, traditions and ideals.  It would be unthinkable that Ireland, now at the time of decision, and the decision has to be made now, should turn her back on the Continent when the democratic countries of western Europe are banded together for action in the economic and political fields. It is true to say that all the successful international endeavours in Europe in the post-war years have been on the basis of multilateral co-operation between nations.  It is fair to say that we ourselves have played a not insignificant role in a number of these endeavours.  Deputies do not need a full list&mdash;I mention the OEEC and its successor, the OECD, the European Payments Union and the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The European Communities represent the most far-reaching and the most impressive example of multilateral international co-operation in the post-war years.  Now that the way is open, admittedly after some years of frustration and disappointment, for the admission to a community of like-minded countries as was envisaged by the founders, we would be untrue to our traditions as a European nation and to our record of full participation in European co-operation if we were to reject what we in the Government see as an historic opportunity.  There are some people who, for some strange reason, seem to say that to stay apart from Europe would be an expression of a proud independence.  If one man <Col N="2023" /> did this you would say he was a head case but here they are saying that a nation should do it.</P>

      <P>Apart altogether from the near disastrous economic and social consequences for Ireland of remaining outside the enlarged Communities, and I will return to that, it would be a totally barren independence, this independence of sitting in an island by yourself and not talking to anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a lone voice in the international arena, heard no doubt but carrying little or no influence.  They might hear us but it would not carry much weight.  We would only perhaps impress ourselves.  The result would be an inevitable turning inwards on ourselves, a reversal of the historic trend of the post-war period towards international co-operation.  What would be our ultimate fate if we were thus to reject the opportunities which are now presenting themselves?  Such an opportunity might never again present itself. We do not want to see Ireland caught in the tragic position of isolationism. Each one ought to think it out and to think about how many people this island would support.  How many Irish people would want to live in that type of society?</P>
      <P>I remember hearing a story some years ago about a clan in Scotland who were fighting men and drinking men. They were happy people who had some form of missionary come to them.  I will not say what he was like.  This man came to their valley.  He had a policy whereby they should live.  He preached it and frightened them and ultimately the valley was empty except for the preacher.  All others had gone away. One should think of that and ask whether one could force, perhaps by misunderstanding, a position of isolationism on the people of Ireland.  That thought is depressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By contrast, as a member of an enlarged EEC, Ireland will be participating fully and equally with the other <Col N="2024" /> member states in what is potentially the strongest, most progressive and most effective economic entity in the world, an entity which has a powerful role to play internationally in the cause of peace.  In this enlarged Community with all this power Ireland will have a voice, an effective voice, and full participation in the decision making processes.  The very concept of the Community demands that the interests of all members, large and small, must be taken into account in the definition of the Community interest.  Our interests will equally be recognised and provided for and our participation on the decision-making processes will further ensure that they will be protected.</P>
    <P>I think I should say something about national sovereignty in the context of our membership of the Communities. It has been dealt with very well this morning but not everybody reads Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's statements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been made before, and the White Paper adverts to it, that all international co-operation involves a limitation of sovereignty by the participating countries to some degree.  This is accepted by independent nations all over the world; we certainly have accepted it, as witness Ireland's membership of the United Nations and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and our series of bi-lateral trade and other agreements with other countries.  All these involve some limitation on our unilateral freedom of action in the areas with which these bilateral agreements and international organisations are concerned.  Countries agree to and willingly accept a limitation on their sovereignty when their national interests and the aims and actions of the international co-operation concerned coincide, where the national interest is served by participation in this international co-operation.  Countries agree to and willingly accept a limitation on their sovereignty.  If they are not in a position to do that their freedom is limited by sovereignty.  The very idea <Col N="2025" /> of sovereignty implies that when the national interest requires it one can go into an agreement which demands this freedom of action.</P>
      <P>Because of the wide scope of the Treaty of Rome the range of limitation on our freedom of action will be greater than in the other cases of our membership of international organisations. But because the Government firmly believe that, in membership of the European Communities, the national interest and the welfare of our people can best be served and enhanced, they see the limitation on sovereignty and the limitation on freedom as acceptable.  We see the situation in the Community as a pooling of sovereignty with the other member states in respect of matters covered by the Treaties.  The Community institutions could be regarded as instruments of our national self-expression on the matters concerned in the Treaties once we become a member. There is no question of putting national independence in jeopardy.  There is no question of sacrificing national identity. In this connection, one has only to look at the countries which at present constitute the Communities: three large and three small countries, all democratic and independent and each with a quite distinct national identity, long based in history.  It is instructive for those who are fearful to reflect that the other three applicant countries, Britain, Denmark and Norway, are also proud, independent nations and they are prepared to accept the limitations on national sovereignty which membership of the Communities will entail; this because they are prepared to accept a limitation on sovereignty when it is for their own national interest and for the good of their own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In applying for membership of the EEC in 1961, the then Government stated that Ireland shared the ideas which inspired the parties to the Treaty of Rome and accepted the aims of the Community as set out therein, as well as the action proposed to achieve those aims.  That was reaffirmed by the Taoiseach in 1967 in our request for the reactivation of our application for membership.  The Government <Col N="2026" /> will so reaffirm in the forthcoming negotiations.  We shall be conscious of the fact that, despite the essentially economic and social content of the Treaty of Rome, the founders had political unity very much in mind when the idea of the EEC was conceived. They envisaged their Community, on its completion, as, in the words of the Preamble to the Treaty:</P>
    <P>the foundations of an ever closer union among the European peoples.</P>
    <P>Following the close of the transitional period, the Community is now completed although the enlargement which I believe will be successfully negotiated will add a new dimension to this completion.  Great political significance, of course, attaches to the acceptance by member states of common Community policies in the various economic and social sectors covered by the Treaties and the common action taken in implementation of these policies. This acceptance, with the limitations on national freedom of action involved, has an essential political content.  But in the political area itself, on the question of political unification in Europe, practical progress among the member states since the founding of the Community 12 years ago has been really minimal.</P>

      <P>The provisional trade totals for February, 1970 were published on 18th March.  The detailed report &ldquo;Trade Statistics of Ireland&mdash;February 1970&rdquo; will be published within a few days.  The corresponding February publications in 1960, 1965 and 1968 were published on 17th May, 20th May and 20th May respectively.</P>
      <P>There is at present a temporary deterioration in the time lag for publication. This has arisen from special circumstances.  For the past six months or so arrangements have been proceeding for using a computer to produce the material for the booklet so that it could be printed by the photolitho-graphic method.  It had been planned to produce the January 1970 issue under the new system but, in the event, the necessary computer programmes were not completed in time and it was necessary to revert to the traditional system.  This gave rise to the present delay as certain-changes which had to be made to the publication to facilitate the computer processing and to improve the content had to be accommodated in the printing process.  It is proposed to print the April publication using the new method.  When the new reproduction system becomes operative not only will the present delay be eliminated but the monthly publication will be available much earlier than heretofore.</P>

      <P>Very often, the disposal of houses is inextricably bound up with the disposal of the lands on which they stand.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are standing instructions to the effect that houses which come into the possession of the Land Commission, and are not required for land settlement purposes, should be disposed of promptly and that all houses <Col N="2036" /> on hands should be maintained in good condition.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give any advice as to what exactly can be done where a local authority <Col N="2039" /> do not appear to be enforcing their own regulations?  There are several areas in Dublin in which light industries have been changed into heavy industries with detrimental effect to the value of adjacent property.  What do we do when the local authority do not adhere to their own regulations?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has any particular case in mind he should bring it to the notice of Dublin Corporation and Dublin Corporation will give him all the necessary information. Though an area may be zoned for particular use, it does not necessarily mean that the area is confined to just one specific type of development; several uses can be permitted in more than one zone.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is very unfair to a person who has invested in a house&mdash;the only capital investment he may have&mdash;and an adjacent industry which was originally a light industry suddenly turns into a heavy industry?  This is very unfair to the householder.  This is prevalent in Dublin.  It may be prevalent in other parts of the country too.</P>

This assessment was made in respect of the period ending on 31st <Col N="2040" /> March, 1971.

      <P>The Blackrock main drainage scheme for which contract documents are at present being finalised will cater to a considerable extent for whatever pollution is taking place there and will provide sufficient accommodation for future development in the area.  In reply to the Deputy in a general way I should just like to say that I have initiated discussions with Dublin Corporation on a number of occasions recently and my officials have been in constant touch with them about the question of pollution in Dublin Bay.  Although there are many large schemes being planned and about to start which will alleviate this problem in the long term.  I have asked the Dublin County Manager to take special measures to help to reduce the existing degree of pollution if it is possible to do this in the immediate future &mdash;in other words, for the present swimming season.</P>

      <P>From what I can gather from the Minister's statement, all the present plans amount to is pumping even more efficiently further sewage into an already saturated bay. I cannot understand from whence the Minister derives his optimism about the improvement in the situation.  As far as I can see, the situation will get worse rather than better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The continued development of Dublin will naturally increase the amount of effluent and waste to be disposed of.  The sewerage schemes which are at the planning stage and <Col N="2048" /> which are being finalised&mdash;there are many difficulties to be overcome&mdash;will adequately cater for this pollution.  An estimate given to me suggests that when those schemes are completed the degree of pollution in the bay at the moment will be reduced by 50 per cent which will be a substantial contribution towards alleviating this problem. I should like to emphasise that this is no danger to health.  It is mainly an interference with the visual amenity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if any public funds are being provided for this work?  There is no doubt that the danger to health may in some cases be less great than in others.  In certain instances there is an obvious danger to health.  It may be localised but in the particular case I have mentioned of Salthill and Seapoint there is some risk to health at least if people bathe there.</P>

If the Minister is referring to a visual impediment, I would advise him to visit the Bull Island any day at all and I will point out to him that there is something more than visual involved in the matter of pollution along that beach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that it is not a matter for the county council?  The Department very frequently direct the county council where to spend the arterial road grants. As a matter of fact, Westmeath County Council were directed this year to spend it south of Moate when we wanted to spend it around the Ratrabridge area.  The Minister travels this road very often.  Will he not agree that it is one of the worst stretches of road in Ireland?  While we have excellent roads west of Kilcock on the road from Kilcock to Dublin you very often have queues one and two miles long and this road needs to be repaired immediately.</P>

      <P>No, you direct. The Department directed us.  Westmeath County Council wanted to spend <Col N="2052" /> the money on the stretch of road between Ratrabridge and Kinnegad. Despite the fact that the county council by vote wanted to spend the money in the Ratrabridge-Kinnegad area, the Department directed the county council to spend it in the area south of Moate, between Moate and Athlone.  Will the Minister make inquiries now and look into this matter? Perhaps it was when Deputy Boland was there and he was more inclined to direct than discuss.  The present Minister may be inclined to cooperate a bit more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The law provides that <Col N="2056" /> every sanitary authority may, and when required by ministerial order shall, themselves undertake or contract for the removal of house refuse from premises and that if the authority is required by the owner or occupier of any premises to remove any trade refuse, other than sludge, they shall do so.  In the latter instance, the owner or occupier is required to pay the authority for doing so a reasonable sum to be settled, in the case of a dispute, by order of a court of summary jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>House refuse has been judicially defined as meaning such refuse as arises from inhabitancy or domestic occupation of a premises and trade refuse as the refuse of any trade, manufacture, or business, or of any building materials.</P>

      <P>As regards the cost of disposal of refuse by incineration, I would refer the Deputy to reply to Question No. 31 of 18th November last in which it was stated that Dublin Corporation estimated a few years ago that the disposal of refuse by incineration would entail a capital cost in excess of £2 million and that each ton of refuse dealt with would entail a further increase of from 15s to 20s per ton as against the then cost of 3s 7d per ton for disposal by the normal method of controlled tipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the differences in views about how political unification can be achieved and what form it should take.  It may be necessary to remind Members of the House that people in other governments in Europe are, like ourselves, politicians, and like ourselves they face the realities of political life.  They do not expect any certificate of having been to confession recently or anything and I think Deputy L'Estrange should drop that line of talk.  We will do our job all right.</P>
      <P>Some of the initiators of the European idea envisaged a unity based on a federal Europe.  Another concept of unity was confederation in which the member countries would retain sovereign power and whatever unity on political unity aims and methods was achieved would be by co-operation at government level.  This is not far removed from the abortive Fouchet plan of 1962.  It proposed a council at Foreign Minister level, a European political commission and a European Parliament.  This institutionalisation was to be effected by treaty and all the decisions of the Council were to be unanimous although member countries could abstain without invalidating the decisions.  There are other ideas on political unification which envisage a looser form of political co-operation than in a federal or confederal arrangement.</P>
      <P>As I have said, progress towards political unification has been slow, but the member countries in recent months have initiated action in this matter. This action is based on an agreement at the Hague Summit Conference in December of last year, under which the Governments of the Six agreed to instruct their Ministers for Foreign Affairs and I quote: &ldquo;to study the best way of achieving progress in the matter of political unification in the perspective of enlargement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group of officials, the Davignon <Col N="2067" /> Group, has prepared a report which the Foreign Ministers will finalise for submission to the Governments before the end of July.  Ireland and the other applicant countries are being kept informed of the deliberations of the Davignon group.  We understand that our views will be sought on the Foreign Ministers' report when they have made it final.  There are also moves to bring the applicant countries into consultation on the question of political unification after the enlargement negotiations begin.</P>
    <P>The information available is that the Governments of the Six, the Community as already existing, are approaching the question of political unification in a rather tentative manner. It is possible that they will emerge from these deliberations with what will be a preliminary charting of the course which might be set, moving by stages towards the ultimate goal of political unification and the possible elements of political co-operation at each stage.  We, as a member of the enlarged Communities, will be involved in the further deliberations by member states in the political field.</P>
    <P>It cannot reasonably be expected that any achievements in the actual creation of the substance of political unification will be possible in the short term.  The full realisation of the concept of political unification remains an ultimate long-term goal.  Given the lack of progress towards political unification to date, it is clearly impossible to give any indication of the forms of political integration and co-operation which may ultimately emerge.  The Government have made it clear on many occasions that they accept the political aims inherent in the Treaty of Rome and that we stand ready to work with other member nations of an enlarged EEC towards the goal of political unification, a unification of which Ireland will be an integral part.</P>
    <P>The ideal is a political integration in Europe which would reduce even further the barriers between the nations of this Continent and enable Western Europe to play a more cohesive and, therefore, a stronger and more effective role in international affairs, a role <Col N="2068" /> which will make Western Europe a potent force for peace in the world. This is an ideal to which the Government fully subscribe and for which I believe&mdash;in fact, we are certain&mdash;there is a ready response in the Irish nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the context of the political evolution, the question of the defence of the Communities arises.  I have spoken on this already and the Government have indicated in the most recent White Paper of April of this year, and elsewhere, that as a member of the EEC we would be prepared to assist, if necessary, in its defence.  This whole question, as I have said, is still at a very early and tentative stage.  There are no commitments in regard to defence in the Treaty of Rome.  Any arrangements for the defence of the Communities would have to result from further agreements, agreements to be negotiated by the members of the expanded Community.  As I said before, I do not see this being part of our negotiations for accession.  Any agreements negotiated by the members of the expanded Communities would be in relation to the whole question of the political evolution of the EEC.  As a member, Ireland would be directly involved in the shaping of all such future political developments.</P>
    <P>I should like to elaborate on what the Taoiseach said on the amendment to the Constitution which the Attorney General's committee has advised and which the Government have accepted will be necessary to enable the State to undertake the obligations which membership of the Community will entail.  A number of the provisions of the Treaties of Rome and Paris have direct application in the national law of the member states but, for the most part, the Treaties are implemented by means of Community legislation, that is, by regulations and directives issued and decisions made by the Council and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The main part of the corpus of Community legislation, that is, the Treaties and the implementing enactments, could be applied in this country without the necessity for any amendment of our Constitution.  Some aspects of the legislation, however, <Col N="2069" /> could not be so applied and a constitutional amendment will be necessary to enable this to be done.  I should like to emphasise that all the Community legislation deals only with matters covered by the Treaties, matters such as customs duties, agriculture, free movement of labour, services and capital, transport and restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>I might mention as examples of Community legislation, the application of which here would require an amendment to the Constitution, certain provisions of the Treaties and Community regulations which have direct effect in the Member States, those which are directly applicable in national law.  The constitutional amendment would also be required to take account of and provide for the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice which is one of the institutions of the Communities. Again, I should like to make it quite clear that such functions as the European Court of Justice would have in respect of this country when we join the Communities, would be confined solely to matters relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Treaties and other Community legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the European Court, for example, is to decide, when called upon, whether acts of the Council&mdash;that is, the Council of the European Community&mdash;or acts of the Commission or individual member Governments in relation to matters covered by the Treaties are, in fact, compatible with the Treaties.  This function would include ruling in cases submitted to the Court by national courts for interpretation of the Treaties and their implementing legislation.  The proposed constitutional legislation would also have to provide for the possibility of the reference of cases by our Supreme Court to the European Court of Justice for this type of interpretation.</P>
    <P>Deputies should know that all present member states have either introduced amendments to their Constitutions to enable the treaties and other Community legislation to be applied in their respective countries in conformity with the Constitution or <Col N="2070" /> had originally introduced into their Constitutions suitable provisions which did not require changing. Denmark and Norway already have suitable provisions in their Constitutions which were introduced respectively in 1960 and 1961.  Britain has no written Constitution.</P>
    <P>We applied for membership and we have reactivated our application in the conviction that this country's best interests will be served by membership. The treaties and their implementing legislation are devised on the Community principle with the interests of all member states in mind.  The principle is that of one community.  This principle will continue to apply when we become a member.  The proposed constitutional amendment will be in the nature of a clearing of the way for the application here of the treaties and Community legislation.  Deputies know that a referendum is necessary to change the Constitution.  The necessary referendum will be held in due course.</P>
    <P>In opening this debate the Taoiseach stressed&mdash;as I have done&mdash;how important the Government consider it is for this country to become a member of the enlarged European Communities. It is important so that we as a nation can take our place and play a proper role in the building of a greater Europe which is already in the process of being created.  As a member of the enlarged Communities this country will be better able to realise her own economic potential and ensure the welfare of her people.</P>
    <P>No one has really fully examined the alternatives except Deputy FitzGerald who did it very thoroughly. As I said at the beginning, the EEC is there; it is evolving and we have to decide our policy towards it.  Having seen the Government's positive attitude to entry we must now consider the alternatives which would be open to us if we were to remain outside the Communities especially if the other applicants joined.  This is what is known as the negative argument for becoming a member.  Negative or not, it is an argument of great force.  It does not detract in any way from the positive reasons which the Government, Deputy FitzGerald and others have <Col N="2071" /> adduced for joining the Communities. The negative argument relates the positive argument to the economic realities. Those who are opposed to our joining the EEC&mdash;and I believe they are very few in number&mdash;seem to be either unaware of or purposely trying to ignore the economic realities.  They say we should stay outside the EEC rather than be swallowed up by the giants of the Community and face economic ruin.  They ignore the experience of the present small member states, Belgium, Luxembourg and The Netherlands in the Community.  These countries have had as members unprecedented economic growth and unprecedented prosperity for their people.  Each of them has a significant say in the Community deliberations and decision-making. I should refer, in this connection, to the fact that most important roles are played by the Foreign Minister of The Netherlands, Dr. Luns, and M. Harmel, the Belgian Foreign Minister. It is also interesting to note that the important committee which has been set up to formulate proposals on economic and monetary union, a union which when achieved will have the greatest significance not just for Europe but internationally, is headed by the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, M. Wesnes.  It would be an interesting exercise for Deputies to try to conceive how such small countries could have such eminent roles to play on a European scale if they were not members of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The prognostications of economic ruin and the abandonment of our less developed areas made by the critics of membership are based on no real knowledge of the Community, no knowledge of Community principles, no knowledge of Community policies and certainly no knowledge of the application of those policies in the member states at present.  I have heard no mention of the Community's Social Fund which operates to promote employment opportunities in member states with the objective of contributing to the raising of the standard of living within the whole Community.</P>

      <P>The critics should consider the massive aid given by the Community's European Investment Bank for development in the less developed regions and for setting up new economic activities or modernising and adapting existing ones.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish made some more points about the Community which displayed a certain lack of information. He said the EEC was a body which was anti-planning, based on the principles of <i>laissez-faire</i> and that it showed little concern for the Third World.  This group, he said, is called an area of free trade but in the eyes of the rest of the world it is a trade <i>bloc.</i> It needs some homework, but he could have found out that all the member countries of EEC are at present engaged in planning and the Community as a whole is striving through its institutions to develop planning at Community level.  At the Hague Summit Meeting which I mentioned the governments of member states expressed the opinion that the integration process should result in a Community of growth and to this end they agreed that, on the basis of the memorandum presented by the Commission in February, 1969, and known <Col N="2073" /> as the First Barre Memorandum after the Vice-President of the Commission, a plan in stages should be worked out during 1970 with a view to the eventual creation of an economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I have some figures about aid.  The House already knows that the leader of the Labour Party is really exposing himself when he complains about the Community's treatment of the Third World and its place in international trade.  In regard to assistance to the less developed countries the Community record compares very favourably with that of other industrial countries.  The Community has an association arrangement with the 18 African and Malagasy States and a special European Development Fund has been set up to provide finance for measures aimed at promoting the social and economic development of these countries.  It is fed by contributions from the member states of the EEC.  Finance for the aid of the Associated States is provided also from the European Investment Bank which was originally intended to handle projects within member states only.  The capital for that Bank is subscribed by member states.</P>

      <P>A recent agreement extending the Association provides for the increase of financial aid to almost $200 million a year from 1970 to 1975. <Col N="2074" /> In a table of the total official and private financial flow of development aid expressed as a percentage of national income, in the first five donor countries if you want to compare performance, there are four members of the Community.</P>
      <P>I have digressed a little but only to correct some misconceptions.  I do not think anyone will deny that it is in the area of trade that our utter dependence on exports becomes obvious.  Trade is the obvious solution to many of our social and economic problems and it is in this area that the arguments for an alternative to membership of EEC become unreal.  They more than touch on the unreal and at best they are unrealisable. The economic realities we must face are that we are a very small country with a tiny&mdash;by international standards&mdash;home market and we are completely dependent on exports for our economic development.</P>
      <P>Britain is by far our largest market, taking about 70 per cent of our exports. This concentration on one market may not be the happiest trading situation from our point of view, but it is an economic fact and it will not go away no matter whom you blame for it. Membership of an enlarged European Community will afford us an opportunity of great potential value to diversify our exports in the huge market of continental Europe while retaining our access to the British market with improved conditions.  The diversification of industrial exports that it has been possible to achieve in Europe is up to now necessarily limited by the fact that Ireland has been neither a member of EEC nor EFTA and, as far as agricultural exports are concerned, the operation of the Community's common agricultural policy has effectively cut off the potentially very valuable markets of the member states for our principal products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to stay outside an enlarged Community which included Britain the adverse effects on our exports would be incalculable.  Our industrial exports to Britain, which now represent 62 per cent of our total industrial exports, would be subject to tariffs, the Community's common customs tariffs, while the mandatory <Col N="2075" /> operation in Britain of the Community's common agricultural policy would make our agricultural exports to Britain, which now represent 77 per cent of our total agricultural exports, subject to Community levies.  These levies would operate to diminish drastically and, perhaps, eliminate in some cases, our agricultural exports to the British market.</P>
    <P>I could illustrate this by recalling that the operation of the common agricultural policy has had the effect of reducing our exports of cattle and beef to the member states from £14 million worth in 1964&mdash;and they were growing at that time&mdash;to under £1 million in 1969.  I do not think Deputies who are close to reality will forget that other countries of the enlarged Community would quickly avail of the opportunity in the British market which the creation of major disadvantages for our industrial and agricultural exporters would present.</P>
    <P>Those who say there is an alternative do not go far in their thinking. It must be asked: &ldquo;Where would we seek alternative markets to compensate for the disastrous losses in the British market which would certainly be a consequence of our remaining outside an enlarged EEC which included Britain?&rdquo; The major difficulties of securing remunerative stable and long-term markets for agricultural exports, save through a special trading relationship such as we have with Britain or which we would have within a closely integrated economic group like the EEC, are well-known.  We know that whatever the circumstances we must continue to intensify our efforts to expand and seek other markets in places outside Western Europe&mdash;Japan and the United States and the state-trading countries and elsewhere&mdash;but it is only being realistic to say that whatever we can hope to realise by way of exports to those potential markets could never in the foreseeable future compensate us for the losses we would suffer in the British market and the loss of export opportunities on the Continent if we were to remain outside an enlarged EEC.  I should say to the Labour Party that these opportunities <Col N="2076" /> which we would lose can be directly translated into job opportunities for Irish people here at home and better living standards for those who are here.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should make a series of bilateral trade agreements with some of the countries I have mentioned and maybe others.  We are in fact pursuing the question of trade agreements notably with the state-trading countries and with Japan. However, the day is gone when we could hope to obtain specific access for specific products through bilateral agreements.  Trade agreements are now mainly the framework within which export opportunities can be exploited.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion by those who are afraid for Ireland to join the EEC that we can obtain some form of association or trading agreement.  I think it was Deputies on the Labour benches who said this, that we should seek a trade agreement with the EEC rather than seek membership.  Deputy Noel Browne and Deputy David Thornley even charged the Government with being remiss in not examining the possible alternatives to membership. I have said before and I must say again that the Government's original decision in 1961 to seek membership of the EEC and the decision in 1967 to reactivate the application for membership were made on the basis of a searching examination of the options open to us, including the possibility of an association or trading arrangement with the EEC.  We did face the realities and we do.</P>
    <P>In the years after the suspension of the original negotiations in 1963 it seemed that the prospects of their being reopened in the near future were remote and the question of a possible association or trading arrangement with the Community was kept under constant review.  The Government concluded that the likely disadvantages of such an arrangement would, on balance, make it an unattractive economic proposition.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has pointed out in his speech on this motion that, apart from denying ourselves the opportunity of joining with other countries of Western Europe in creating a meaningful <Col N="2077" /> political and economic unity in our Continent, such an association or arrangement would have very limited trade advantages for this country in the industrial field, and that far from ensuring our agricultural exports to Britain, such an arrangement would place these exports in jeopardy.  Under an association or trade relationship with EEC we could not hope to participate in the common agricultural policy.  That is one of the cornerstones of the European Community, and what agricultural concessions we could gain would be only of marginal value.  We could never hope to compensate for the drastic diminution of our agricultural exports to Britain. Loss of export opportunities in the other member states of an enlarged Community, which would be the likely consequence of not becoming a member, could not be compensated for either.  Furthermore, we would have no say in the formulation of Community policy, in the industrial or agricultural sector, although Community policy would have a direct effect on our trading relations with the member states.</P>
    <P>It is true, as was pointed out here, that certain countries, members of EFTA, who are not seeking at this time membership of the EEC, will be seeking some form of association with the Community or some form of trade agreement.  I understand the Community accept the need to conclude such agreements since membership of the EEC for Britain, Norway and Denmark will mean, in effect, the breaking up of EFTA, and the other EFTA countries do not intend to seek membership of the EEC.  Their policies in this regard are dictated by a variety of reasons: Austria and Finland because of fundamental political realities; Sweden and Switzerland because of their traditional policies of a distinctive form of neutrality.  Portugal is a special case.</P>
    <P>What I imagine these countries will seek is to preserve the free trade relationship&mdash;that is, free trade in industrial goods&mdash;which exists at present between the EFTA countries and to achieve similar free trade with the other countries of the enlarged Community. <Col N="2078" /> While certain relatively minor agricultural concessions might be possible in the arrangements to be negotiated by them, whatever free trade arrangements or tariff reductions are agreed upon are likely to be mainly in the industrial sector.  As was pointed out here already, none of these countries has, in relation to any of the EEC member states and the other EFTA countries, anything like the concentration of exports that we have to the British market.  Neither is a country such as Sweden or Switzerland in an economic situation even remotely approaching the situation in this country where agriculture and agricultural products are of such major importance and likely to continue to be so.  In view of certain attempts to equate our situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC with that of countries like Sweden and Switzerland, it is necessary for these points to be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said we are not economically fit to be a member of the EEC.  It would take a great deal more strength economically or export power to stay outside.  If we are not fit to go in, we certainly will not survive outside. It might be of value to the Deputies who are honestly worried about this, worried why Switzerland can do something we cannot do, to study the very high economic development of that country and its achievements in crossing tariff barriers with their products.  We have to face realities.</P>
    <P>With the opening of negotiations imminent, I should mention for the information of the House two matters relating to the negotiations to which the Government attach considerable importance.  There is a vital need from our point of view that the negotiations in respect of all the applicant countries should finish at the same time and that there should be simultaneous accession of all the applicants to the Communities. To ensure that this will happen an adequate degree of parallelism as between the applicant countries will be necessary in the negotiations.  I think I can say confidently, as a result of the assurances I have received personally from representative members of the governments of the six member states in my discussions with them over the <Col N="2079" /> past year, that the idea of simultaneous accession of all the applicant countries is fully accepted by the Community.  It is also of fundamental importance to us that during the negotiations there should be a consultation procedure which would ensure that each applicant country would be consulted on matters of concern to that country arising in the negotiations with another applicant.</P>
    <P>I have in mind particularly the negotiations between Britain and the Community. Because of the nature and complexity of the problem involved these would be given some priorities in time.  What we would wish and what we have to ensure is that decisions should not be taken in the negotiations with the British on matters of concern to Ireland until we have been consulted and our views taken into account when those decisions are being made.  The House already appreciates that without such consultations one set of negotiations could arrive at a conclusion which would preclude negotiations towards a different decision for another applicant.  I have made this clear in all my visits to the Six and to representatives of the EEC Commission.  The idea of simultaneous accession now seems to be accepted by the Communities.  On the question of a consultation procedure the position is that the procedural matter in connection with the negotiation has not as yet been settled.  I intend to press vigorously for the setting up of a consultation procedure in the coming months.</P>
    <P>We shall, of course, be anxious to maintain consultation with the other applicant countries during the negotiations. It was agreed with the former British Government in December last that there should, on this question of application for membership of the Common Market, be close consultation between ourselves and the British at the pre-negotiation stage and during the negotiations.  This arrangement has operated up to now through a number of meetings at ministerial level and at official level on EEC matters.  We hope for a continuation of this arrangement with the new British Government.  We also hope to keep in close touch with <Col N="2080" /> the Danish and Norwegian Governments during the negotiations as our interests will coincide on important matters.  I know from my recent talks with the Danish Foreign Minister and the Market Minister that they recognise the desirability of close contacts between our two Governments and we have indications in this respect from the Norwegian Government through diplomatic channels.</P>
    <P>The visits which I made to the capitals of the Six and to the commission, during the year, the last of which I completed yesterday with a visit to Brussels to meet the Belgian Foreign Minister, were undertaken by me for the purpose of furthering our application for membership of the Communities. I wished to re-affirm to the governments of the member states our Government's continued desire to join the Communities and our readiness to accept the treaties and what has been achieved in the implementation of the treaties.  I was also anxious to ensure that our particular interests were fully understood and appreciated by the governments concerned.  Furthermore, I was most anxious on behalf of the Government to emphasise our deep concern&mdash;this was the beginning of my consultations&mdash;about the idea which was current in the latter half of 1969 of a community of Seven, that the EEC should be enlarged to take in Britain only.  I received firm assurances on this point.  Of course, the idea did not survive The Hague Summit Meeting.  I think that the visits were well worthwhile in this connection.  I must say that, on these visits, I found evidence of a very positive spirit in the Community on the question of enlargement and the utmost goodwill was shown in relation to our application.</P>
    <P>The Ministers with whom I had discussions showed a full appreciation of our particular interests including our position on the question of simultaneous entry of all applicant countries and the setting up of consultation procedures during the negotiations.  Special emphasis in these matters, which are of particular importance to us, has also been given continuously by the Head of our Mission to the Communities and by our ambassadors in the capitals of <Col N="2081" /> the six member countries in their dealings with representatives of the Governments there and with the Commission. As an important part of our approach over the years and particularly in the past year, very close attention has been given and continues to be given to EEC matters by our missions in Europe.  I can assure the House that my own visits to the capitals have been most thoroughly prepared and supported by the essential close contact afterwards at ambassadorial and official level.  The Head of our Mission to the EEC and his staff are very much involved in the preparation for negotiations and are pursuing our interests diligently.  I have ensured the appropriate co-ordination in our diplomatic contacts with all the member states and with the applicant countries and with the Commission of the European Communities by summoning meetings of the heads of our diplomatic missions concerned in this work at regular intervals. It has been possible for me at these meetings to get first-hand impressions from our ambassadors on the likely evolution of events and on the views of the governments of the countries in which they are stationed and also on the main questions which arose within these countries arising from the enlargement and expansion of the Communities.  At these meetings it was possible to brief the ambassadors on the points to which the Government wanted special attention paid and to direct the efforts of our missions abroad on matters related to our application and the Communities generally.</P>
    <P>Somebody said we had not prepared the country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will deal with that on his side and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has dealt with it on his side.  However, I would point out that all our policies for the past nine years have been calculated to improve our position in negotiations and to make us worthy members of the Community.</P>

      <P>I can recall that when I was Minister for Labour, we introduced the redundancy legislation which at that time was interpreted to the <Col N="2082" /> people as an augury of massive unemployment&mdash;of course, there were two by-elections on at the time&mdash;but the massive unemployment did not materialise. The redundancy legislation was to make provision for workers who lost jobs because of the normal disappearance of jobs and also because of free trade and readaptations.  It was to make it possible for them to maintain as near as possible the same standard of living while waiting or training for a new appointment.  At the same time we introduced resettlement legislation to make it possible for a worker to become mobile within our own country and to seek employment away from his home.  Deputies will know the details of the help towards the cost of transfer and of taking lodgings, and what the legislation was for.  The most important thing of all which I did as Minister for Labour was to introduce the legislation setting up the Training Authority.  It is as a skilled people we should see ourselves in the European Economic Communities.  Membership of the Communities will very quickly help to relieve our unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has spoken and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will speak about their preparations.  So far as the preparations in the last year are concerned I think I should put on record the names of the people I met in order to make sure that Ireland's position on her application is clearly known.  These are the people to whom I spoke on the need for consultation and on the need for simultaneous accession and the need for negotiations starting and going on at the same time.  I met the Belgian Foreign Minister in Brussels in July of last year and I met the Netherlands Foreign Minister in London in the same month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the time when the question of the Community of Seven was being discussed from which Ireland would be excluded and I think I explained to the House that this would have had a very great effect on us.  I met the British Foreign Secretary in London in July and August of 1969.  I met the President of the EEC Commission in July also and the Federal <Col N="2083" /> German State Secretary Jahn in Dublin in the same month.  I met the French Foreign Minister Schumann and other Foreign Ministers at the United Nations in New York in September and October of last year.  I had a particularly good meeting with M. Schumann. I also met Mr. George Thomson, the then British Minister with special responsibility for the EEC, in London, in December, 1969.  I met several Foreign Ministers of the Six at the Council of Europe meeting in Paris in December, 1969.  I made a special visit to Rome to meet the Italian Foreign Minister Moro, in January, 1970.  I met the Federal German Chancellor Brandt and Foreign Minister Dr. Scheel in Bonn in February, 1970. The Luxembourg Foreign Minister Thorn met me in Luxembourg in February, 1970.  I met The Netherlands Foreign Minister, Dr. Luns and State Secretary de Koster at The Hague in February, 1970.  In Denmark I met Foreign Minister Hartling and Market Minister, Nyboe Anderson, at Copenhagen in March, 1970.  Again I met Mr. George Thomson in London in March, 1970.  I met several Ministers at the Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg in March, 1970, and had a full meeting with the French Foreign Minister M. Schumann in Paris in April, 1970.  I met the President of the EEC Commission, M. Jean Rey, in Brussels in April, 1970, and I met the Belgian Foreign Minister, M. Harmel, and currently President of the EEC Council, yesterday in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I have been accompanied by the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs on all these occasions and on some occasions by Mr. Morrissey, who will now be in Brussels taking care of our negotiations.  On the occasions of all these visits our Ambassador was present and members of his staff.  I do not think anything more could have been done on the part of the Department of External Affairs to prepare for the negotiations which are approaching.  We expect that by September we will be involved in the substance of the negotiations.  We shall enter negotiations in a positive spirit which we are confident will be matched <Col N="2084" /> by a similar spirit on the part of the Community.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to imagine or to pretend that the negotiations will be easy.  They could be lengthy.  Certainly, problems posed by the British application and their complexities would indicate that they may be lengthy.  We would hope that the approach on the Community side and on the part of the applicants would be, as one commentator recently suggested, a seeking after a mutually satisfactory solution to the serious problems posed.  We enter the negotiations accepting, in the words of the member states at The Hague at the Summit Meeting, the treaties and their political finality, the decisions taken since the entry into force of the treaties and the options made in the sphere of development.</P>
    <P>Our own interests must of course be the major concern for us.  I would like to assure the House and the country that I shall, on behalf of the Government, be increasingly vigilant and continually at pains to ensure that, at all stages of the negotiations, Irish interests are emphasised and taken fully into account.  A great deal of effort will be called for over the period of negotiation by myself as Minister leading the negotiating team, by the officials on the team, by our mission to the Communities and by the embassies in the member states and in the applicant countries.  Those people who would worry about our negotiating leverage as a small country should take some reassurance from the fact that our interests in the Community will lie in the same place as interest of varying groups of other countries. I think especially as a member of the Community we will be in a far stronger position and in a much better position than we would be in a bilateral situation.</P>
    <P>In addition to my leading the negotiations proper I see also the need on my part for considerable activity in relation to the governments of the member states.  I must try to continue what I have been doing during the past year at an even more active pace.</P>
    <P>During the period of the negotiations there will be much to be done at all levels here in this country in all sectors <Col N="2085" /> of the economy in preparation for entry into the Communities.  A great deal has been accomplished with the aid and encouragement of the Government. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has a very proud record in what has been done in the nine years since we first started preparing for membership.</P>
    <P>There is important work still to be done.  The Government are intensifying their own preparatory efforts.  We confidently hope there will be a like response from all levels in the country. By these preparations we will be able in the course of time to take full and effective advantage of the opportunities which membership of the Communities will offer.  It is not necessary to tell the House that membership of the European Communities will not represent the great panacea.  What can be achieved&mdash;and the Government believe that much can be achieved within the greatly improved economic environment of the Communities&mdash;will be achieved only by our own efforts in the full awareness of the new possibilities and the opportunities opening before us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated it was the Government's intention to maintain continuous consultation with the representative bodies such as the farmers' organisations and those representing industry, the Congress of Trade Unions, the chambers of commerce and others while negotiations are going on. All these bodies have a most important part to play.  All the contact with the Community cannot be at Government level only.  It seems to me that it would be most desirable that bodies such as those mentioned by the Taoiseach should intensify contact where it already exists or establish contact where this has not been done with their counterparts in the member states and the other applicant countries.  We should not have the misconception that contact with such organisations in other countries should be done by the Government.  It would be much better done by contact with the corresponding organisations here. These contacts provide opportunities for valuable exchanges of views and for making our interests better known and for getting an insight into the <Col N="2086" /> working of the Communities and for finding out all the things which Deputy Dr. FitzGerald felt the Government should be telling these bodies about. There is definite need for all bodies, the lives of whose members will be affected by membership of the Community, to be actively engaged in finding out how corresponding bodies in other countries are affected by EEC membership.  If anything arises out of their contacts on which the Government can help, we will certainly do so.  I wondered when listening to the extraordinarily learned contribution this morning whether this was a proper function of the Dáil.  We were discussing without any prospect of an outcome in the nature of a division on the passing of a motion; we were simply taking note of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I consider that informed debate and discussion throughout the country on what is involved in membership and how best we can prepare ourselves for the opportunities and conditions in the Community can only be of value.  This debate in the Dáil can give strong impetus to other debates throughout the country and I hope the facts, and not the fearful imaginings of some people, will be the basis of the attitude of the Irish people towards membership of the European Economic Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since our application to join the EEC was reactivated some time ago the Labour Party have been impressing on the Taoiseach and the Government the necessity to get all possible information and make it available to the people.  Eventually the Taoiseach arranged that a White Paper would be published but on reading this paper we realised that the object of the White Paper was not to set out the pros and cons of membership of the Common Market but was simply to see what the Government could get away with without any questions being asked.  When this was realised the Labour Party demanded that there should be a discussion on the question in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am afraid this discussion has not been following the lines some of us would like.  Instead of the Taoiseach and his Ministers attempting to put the facts of the case before the <Col N="2087" /> Dáil, what has happened is that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have discovered they have a unanimity on most of the matters concerned which they appear to think are in favour of Ireland's entry, and they desire to skate over any unpalatable facts.  This was evident when Deputy O'Higgins spoke yesterday, as it was when Deputy FitzGerald spoke this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make that point.  I am not decrying the effort Deputy FitzGerald put into the preparation of his contribution but I am sure when he reads it all&mdash;I see he is doing so now&mdash;he will realise that most of what he said seemed mainly to be for the purpose of saying how wonderful Fianna Fáil were and, since Fine Gael agreed with them, they were wonderful too.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised.  It is inevitable when one speaks for four hours that there will be repetition and contradiction in that speech.  It would happen to any of us if we attempted to do that.  The major difference between the approach of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and that of the Labour Party is that the other two parties seem to be obsessed with the idea of figures.  As Deputy Corish said when opening the debate for the Labour Party, we in this party are obsessed with the idea of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right to try to prove that certain things should happen: a percentage increase in one area and a reduction in another, but the plain facts are that, if we go into the Common Market, not alone will there not be a general improvement in our economy but for a considerable period at least there will be a reduction in the number of people employed, which reduction has been put by some economists as high as 100,000 people in a period of less than two years.  They have also stated that there will be a most substantial increase in the cost of living. <Col N="2088" /> In the reference to improved incomes both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael seem to have ignored the fact that if a person is earning, say, £15 per week and it costs him £14 to live he has £1 over, whereas when a person gets £50 in wages and it costs him £55 to live he is then in trouble.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not be in the same section of the Fianna Fáil Party as Deputy Briscoe&mdash;perhaps that is one of the things on which they may not be in agreement.  Nobody can accuse me of sympathy with the Governments of certain Eastern European countries.  In this debate we have heard repeated references to a united Europe but this I regard as a fallacy when even Germany itself is not united.  In such a situation how can we speak about the necessity to have a united Europe?  In Deputy FitzGerald's speech today he spoke about the Russian and American blocs and said there was a necessity for a third power. When the Deputy was speaking of the two great powers I think he was referring to their military strength and, therefore, his reference to a third <Col N="2089" /> power means, in effect, a military power.</P>
      <P>This brings us to the unsolicited reply the Taoiseach gave some time ago to a newspaper reporter in Paris that we were prepared to accept all commitments, including defence&mdash;incidentally the Minister for External Affairs repeated the reply here today. At the time of the Taoiseach's statement no other country that had applied for membership in the EEC, or any country actually in the Community, had guaranteed the defence of Europe, but the Taoiseach was prepared to guarantee that Ireland would be prepared to take part in the defence of Europe.  The Minister for External Affairs has twice repeated that statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, would the Taoiseach not agree that it was rather foolish to guarantee to participate in a military bloc when, in fact, he was not asked that question and there was no necessity to give such a guarantee before applying for membership?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was wrong to have made the statement on the first occasion. Once such a statement is made by a person like the Taoiseach it goes on the record and that is that.  We have been hearing much about what we are going to get, so far as agriculture is concerned, once we enter the Common Market.  Is it not a fact that on 31st March of this year there was more than one million tons surplus of milk and milk products within the EEC?  In this country we have a surplus of butter which we are having extreme difficulty in selling even at a low price.  In the EEC they have got the butter and cannot even give it away.  Yet, our farmers are told &ldquo;It is all right, once we enter the EEC everything will be milk and honey&rdquo;&mdash;if I may be forgiven the pun.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that on going into the EEC we are prepared to say that everything will remain as it is under present arrangements within the Community.  This is where I would find fault with the Government in particular. They should have spelled out clearly the defects as well as the improvements that could be effected. They should have pointed out in the first place that the milk problem has become so great within the Common Market that the agricultural advisers are strongly considering and, in fact, have a recommendation, to reduce the amount of milk available by the slaughter of milch cows.  According to the Government, a dairy farmer in west Cork or in Westmeath or elsewhere would be quite happy if he were told that he will be all right when we join the Common Market because his best cows will be bought from him at a price almost double what they are worth at the present time.</P>
      <P>In addition to that the recommendation has been made again and again by the Commission that agricultural prices must be downgraded.  I understand that this suggestion has not so far been accepted.  Surely this should have been brought to the notice of the Irish farmer because he will be expecting to receive prices as high as those that have been paid up to now.  Is it not true that not only are milk and milk products being over-produced but also sugar beet and wheat?  What is the substitute? The Minister was very anxious to find out from us what we would suggest should be substituted for membership of the Common Market.  Would the Minister let us know what he thinks the Irish farmer could produce instead of the items for which there is no market?</P>
      <P>We are being accused here of not having gone to the trouble of checking our information in relation to the Common Market but if the Minister investigates our activities, he will probably find that, apart from himself and his civil servants we have spent more time and more energy investigating the Common Market position than anybody else in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, I should hate to have to check even some of the facts that have been given to us today.  To say the least, they were a little hazy.  On the question of agriculture generally, the idea is being put across to the Irish farmer that if and when Ireland becomes a member of the Community, everything in the garden will be rosy for him.  However, the evidence is to the contrary.</P>
      <P>We went to a lot of trouble, also, in investigating what the industrial position would be if we joined.  The Minister may contradict this if he considers it to be untrue.  It appears that the many foreign firms who have come here did so mainly for three reasons. Firstly, they were offered certain grants and factory facilities; secondly, they were offered certain tax facilities and, thirdly, there was available a good pool of not cheap but adaptable labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, some of us were talking to Continental industrialists who seemed to consider that the time was gone when the first two reasons were of any further attraction.  They pointed out that if we joined the Common Market there would be no point in our telling them about the grants available because grants to industry would not be allowed under Common Market conditions.  They also pointed out that there was no point in promising tax concessions since these, too, would not be permitted under Common Market conditions.  Therefore, the third reason was the only one that had any meaning but they considered that, as things stand, the position might be so bad here with regard to employment that they would get the workers in their own Continental factories in any case. This may sound a little odd but it seems reasonable.  Apparently these people were satisfied that there was no incentive for them to come here. <Col N="2092" /> If that is so and if it transpires that we are unable to maintain our industry against foreign competition, we are in for a fairly rough time.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what was said by the two Fine Gael speakers who were prepared to condemn the Free Trade Area Agreement at this stage and who said that Fine Gael did not support that agreement.  I should like to repeat what I said earlier by way of interruption that while it is true they did not support it, they did abstain from voting against it so that by default they allowed it to go through almost unchallenged except by the Labour Party.  That being so, I fear that something similar is likely to happen now. Fianna Fáil are bent on joining the Common Market under any conditions and some of the Fine Gael spokesmen give the impression that they agree.</P>
    <P>I should like to spell out what we in the Labour Party are saying since some people do not understand plain English.  In the first place, we believe that if there is any other way out of it, we should not join the Common Market.  Secondly, we believe that the question of association rather than membership has not been fully pursued or properly processed.  Thirdly, we know that if Britain joins we have no option under present circumstances except to do likewise.  This is plain enough for anybody and those people who suggest that we do not know what we are talking about and that we should join under any circumstances are in the same category as a former Taoiseach who was prepared to go it alone.  Of course, he was on his own because nobody else agreed with him and he had to change his mind and dodge the issue as best he could.</P>
    <P>We are quite clear but we are being practical.  That is the difference between our Party and the other two Parties.  We should endeavour to get the best bargain we can.  There is no use in saying that we have no bargaining power because of the conditions laid down in the Treaty of Rome and that we must stand by these conditions. Neither is there any use in people coming in here trying to give the impression that since we are to have a voice in the Common Market, that <Col N="2093" /> voice will be very important and will have the effect of bringing about certain changes because we will be a very small voice indeed.  I interrupted Deputy FitzGerald this morning to point out that the numbers he had given, 30 representatives against ten, as Deputy Corish said earlier, and Deputy O'Higgins also contradicted Deputy FitzGerald on this point, were not accurate.  The proposal is, of course, that there should be 30, but at present the position is that there are ten.</P>

      <P>While France is sticking to the original idea that this should be a community of countries, Germany wants a federation.  We know why.  The French make no secret of the fact that they do not want a federation and they do not like the Germans for wanting that, and for other reasons too, and they are anxious therefore to make an ally of anybody else who would be likely to be of assistance to them, particularly voting-wise.  Our Department of External Affairs might be a great deal better off if they tried to get as many allies as possible who think the same way as we do on certain issues. That might not be a bad idea at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole problem is whether or not Britain will go in.  I was interested in some of the newspaper reports about <Col N="2094" /> the attitude of Britain.  I am sure everybody reads the <i>Evening Press;</i> I read it to find out what the other side are saying.  This is a cutting from the <i>Evening Press</i> of 24th June:</P>
    <P Just="Center">E.E.C. COST TO BRITISH ECONOMY.</P>
    <P>Negotiations between Britain and the Common Market, due to open on Tuesday, will stand or fall on the issue of what joining the community will cost the British economy.</P>
    <P>The most pessimistic answer&mdash; £1,100 million a year&mdash;was put forward in a British Government White Paper last February and is clearly unacceptable.  The document also gave £100 million as its most optimistic guess.</P>
    <P>One fact, however, has to be faced. Food prices in Britain will rise&mdash;by up to 26 per cent if Britain joins the European Community.  This would increase overall expenditure on Food by 22 per cent and put the cost of living up 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>If Britain joins the Six, she will have to accept the Common Market system under which farmers are paid well above world prices for their produce.</P>
    <P>Curiously, the switch to the Common Market system could help Britain's balance of payments by lopping up to £85 million a year off the food imports bill.  This calculation is based on the assumption of a large increase in home production stemming from price increases.</P>
    <P>These are the facts as Britain sees them.  If Britain has not yet made up her mind about accepting the conditions of membership, then the fact that we seem to be nailing our colours to the mast and saying: &ldquo;O-kay, we are going in&rdquo; does not seem to be the right attitude and, while the Minister for External Affairs was making great play of the fact that we were seeking accession with Britain, I just could not see the point in it.  Britain should first be allowed to find out whether or not she will go in before we commit ourselves because we cannot influence the issue, one way or the other, and I <Col N="2095" /> honestly believe this is where we are making a mistake.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to discover that horticulture and fruit-growing do not appear to be of any interest whatever to the Common Market countries. Is it not something of a coincidence that this year the Department of Agriculture here has let the bottom fall out of the soft fruit industry?  Is there any connection between the two? Down in my constituency farmers, who depend for their livelihood on the sale of fruit, cannot even give the fruit away this year.  Has that got anything to do with the idea that we might be in the Common Market and the sooner we get these people out of the way the better?  It is a heartless approach.  There is an onus on the Department of Agriculture to ensure that these people will not find themselves on the breadline when the season is over.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have the Mansholt Plan.  Deputy FitzGerald said this morning we were making a bogeyman out of Mansholt.  I do not think we are but, if anybody suggests that the traditional small farmer, the backbone of this country down through the years, should be removed and replaced with the massive 200 acres, and upwards, farm and our new agricultural economy should be based on that, then I suggest that these people think again.  If anybody suggests that the small farmer should be asked to seek alternative employment elsewhere&mdash; probably in Europe&mdash;then Mansholt's idea, whether he is a socialist or a capitalist, does not suit this country.</P>

      <P>There was one group farm down in the Deputy's part of the <Col N="2096" /> country and a dishonest bookkeeper put it out of commission.  Another thing I found rather touching today was the desire of Deputy FitzGerald, and other Fine Gael speakers, and some Fianna Fáil speakers&mdash;I regard both of them as belonging to two Tory parties&mdash;to see the Labour Party row in with what they describe as the socialist parties of Europe.  It was very touching to find the socialist parties of Europe supported by everybody, and I hope that will continue, but they seemed to overlook the fact that a French socialist is French first and socialist afterwards and the German socialist is German first and socialist afterwards.  The Labour Party here is Irish first and socialist afterwards.  We make no apology for that.  Deputy FitzGerald and other should remember that.</P>
      <P>One of the things which was passed over as not being of very much consequence was the reference to the change in the Constitution.  A few moments ago the Minister confirmed my view that he, at any rate, felt the question of what changes had to be made was not very important and there should not be too much noise about it beforehand.  If he thinks that Article 5, which states that Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State is not of importance to the people then I think he will have to have another think about it.  As Deputy O'Brien said yesterday, we will find it very difficult in the Labour Party not to try to prevent people voting for this change.  Here is where there should be some hard negotiation because, if we are going to throw our Constitution overboard in this manner and admit that we are no longer a sovereign, democratic nation, but just tied on to other countries as a very small unit without the right to make decisions for ourselves, then I do not believe the people will be prepared to accept that.</P>
