      <P>Arising out of the Order of Business I wish to raise the question of the disappearance from the Order Paper of item No. 1 on yesterday's Order Paper.  This item was not taken.  I rose on it but as the debate had not concluded on Mr. Corish's speech, I was not able to get in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair will be the first to agree that this House, in respect of any Bill, should, if it wishes to do so, have the opportunity to raise a question and oppose the Bill on the First Stage but if we cannot hear it being moved, we cannot be aware that it is being moved. Later, I did hear you call No. 4 but I did not hear item No. 1.  I wish to lodge a protest and to ask that in any case in which a Member of this House cannot hear a Bill being moved that the Bill be put on the Order Paper again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a point that it is a matter for the Chair to ensure that the business of this House is carried on, that people can be heard and that people have a right to carry on business in an orderly way?  If the Chair fails to ensure that, the blame does not lie with us and we are entitled to ask you, if you were unable to maintain order and allowed the business to proceed despite that, to ensure this item is put on the Order Paper again.</P>

      <P>Last night after the House had adjourned, the Taoiseach, both personally and through his Whip, offered us a full-day debate tomorrow on the question of internment provided that we abandon our position in relation to the Prices and Incomes Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the debate yesterday I suggested to the Opposition that a debate on the Government statement of last Friday could be included in the Adjournment Debate at the end of the present session provided that the legislation now on the Order Paper will have been passed by that time.  I mentioned that openly in the Dáil yesterday.  Apparently it was not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, I did convey directly to Deputy Cluskey the offer that we <Col N="522" /> could have a debate tomorrow provided that by next week all the legislation that the Government wished to put through will have been passed.  I did not suggest any abandonment of any principle by anybody.  That offer still stands.  It is reasonable that the Government are entitled to ask the House to have the necessary legislative provisions put through this House at the proper time when there is a statutory limitation on the necessity for such legislation.  Both offers are still open &mdash;the first one having been made openly here yesterday and the second both to Deputy Cluskey and to the leader of his party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair's ruling yesterday was to the effect that the powers were not in operation.  I recall that when major strikes were about to take place but had not actually become effective, debates were allowed in the House.  Therefore, I find it difficult to detect any consistency in your ruling of yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify the situation?  The Labour Party are trying, in some way, to put me in a false position.  I did not refuse a debate here yesterday.  There was a specific motion on the Order Paper from the Labour <Col N="523" /> Party which you found did not comply with Standing Orders for the purpose of providing a debate.  That was the Chair's decision and I had no function in it.  However, I did make the offer to which I have already referred here openly, and also the other one to the Labour Party directly.  I want to repeat that both these offers are still open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's statement yesterday to the House was that there was too much legislation to be dealt with.  We are now prepared to sit any extra hours that are necessary to compensate for the time that would be lost in discussing this major issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that legislation before the House is completed before Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise we shall sit up to Christmas Day, but it is not desirable we should do that.  By offering hours to compensate for whatever hours would be lost in a debate does not mean there is any undertaking from or indication by the Labour Party that the necessary legislation would be put through before the Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is blackmail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is that we shall get one part of democracy if we abandon another.  We are not trading principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, even without the debate for which we are asking, the Taoiseach has no guarantee that the business before the House will be finished before Christmas? Has it not always been the case that there will be certain items which the Government will abandon at the last minute?  Why not be sensible about it?  Let the Taoiseach name the ones he wants and, as Deputy Cluskey says, we shall sit all night, if necessary, to give him the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unreasonable in a democratic society that if a request is made by one side a request would also be made by the other side <Col N="524" /> and both be acceded to.  This is a matter of procedure by the House.  The Labour Party want it both ways.  They want to have a debate on a matter that you.  Sir, have ruled they are not entitled to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to do that provided they accede to my reasonable request.  I mentioned the measures we required and I shall repeat them now: the Finance (No. 2) Bill, the Decimal Currency Bill, the Transport Bill, the Exchange Control Bill and the Prices and Incomes Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in relation to the Prices and Incomes Bill he is placing the Labour Party in an impossible position? The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are about to ask him, in view of their special delegate conference tomorrow on the proposed national wage agreement, to withdraw the Prices and Incomes Bill to enable that conference to take place in a calm atmosphere in which there can be rational discussion.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said just now that the refusal to allow a debate on this matter stemmed from your ruling.  Sir, and not from his decision. We would accept that, but we should like to know what the basis for your ruling is, for your extraordinary interpretation of section 29.  You ruled that nothing definite had happened. Something definite has happened.  The European Commission on Human Rights at Strasbourg have been informed of our impending derogation from the Convention on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>I was about to suggest that the proceedings we have had here yesterday and again today will not help us to get through the business and I suggest to the Taoiseach and to the other Deputies in the House that Parliamentary democracy will function only if the system is properly used; it cannot operate if the machinery of debate is by-passed.  Nobody will be completely satisfied since both sides feel strongly on the matters to be discussed and both sides will, possibly, have to accommodate the other side to some extent. I suggest that in order to make it possible to get a rational timetable to discuss the major matters that have to be disposed of before Christmas&mdash;they would include the question of internment and also some of the business the Taoiseach mentioned earlier&mdash;some arrangement will have to be reached and the question as to whether it is possible to get agreement on all of the business is a matter that might be left over for discussion elsewhere.  At the same time, if we value the democratic system, we can only preserve that system by making it work and that means a reasonable approach by everyone.  I suggest to the Taoiseach and to the Labour Party Chief Whip that it ought to be possible to decide on a timetable which will enable us to do that before the Dáil adjourns for Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear that, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, we have already indicated to the Taoiseach that we are <Col N="529" /> prepared to facilitate all the business on the Order Paper with the exception of the Prices and Incomes Bill which we regard as undemocratic.  We also regard this threatened internment as undemocratic. We cannot sacrifice one principle to try to defend another principle.  With that exception, we are prepared to facilitate the Taoiseach in every way. We are also prepared to give extra time.  As far as the Labour Party protest is concerned, we make this protest to demonstrate clearly to the Irish people that, if democracy is in danger, it is in danger because the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party refuse a debate in Parliament on this major issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to my say.  I have not refused a debate.  In relation to the Prices and Incomes Bill, we regard inflation as the greatest economic threat to this country at the present time.  We believe our Bill is the best means whereby we can defeat inflation.  We believe, too, that it is a matter of great urgency for many reasons.  We have had this Bill before the House ever since the commencement of this term, long enough to have had a debate on it not only here but in the Seanad as well.  I know there are difficulties facing us now because of the shortage of time between now and Christmas, but the Government want this Bill before 1st January when its provisions will begin to operate.  I am prepared to agree to our Whip sitting down with the other Whips to discuss a timetable, as suggested by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have endeavoured to introduce rationality.  Let us try now to proceed along these lines. Would the Taoiseach not agree that had this internment announcement not come&mdash;the normal days' sittings had been arranged&mdash;we would have proceeded with the business as arranged and we might or we might not have got the Prices and Incomes Bill through? We accept fully that the Taoiseach does not want to prejudice that Bill to a greater extent than it is prejudiced already by giving time which he cannot recover but, if the other side of the House is willing to give him the full time lost, he will be in no worse position than he would have been had the internment issue not been raised at all. It is improper and unwise and, I think, from his point of view undesirable, to appear in this House to be using this internment measure and the fate of a debate on it in order to achieve a timetable for the Prices and Incomes Bill which might not otherwise have been achieved.  To use the internment issue for this purpose is creating difficulty here and it is asking the House to enter into discussions without preconditions to see if we can solve this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We can get nowhere on this until we get down and talk to <Col N="531" /> each other.  I have asked the House to take business as ordered.  Would the House agree now to proceed with the business and let the Whips proceed to work out a timetable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows from his experience that, of the five items on the Order Paper, four of them are ones which normally would go through, two in less than a quarter of an hour; the other two might take an hour or a little bit more.  The Taoiseach knows that.  What, in effect, he is saying is that he wants a guarantee from the House that the Prices and Incomes Bill will go through.  If he wants to take a chance on that he is not prejudicing that chance by giving time for a debate on the other important matter; he can still vote it through if he wants to.  But we will not say to him that we are abandoning our opposition to the Prices and Incomes Bill.  We are, I think, being perfectly reasonable.  We will give him all the time he wants, all night, if he wants it, right up to Christmas Eve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not Christmas Day.  I think this is a matter with which, if the Taoiseach reflects on it, he will find it quite easy to deal and I suggest that what he does now is give time for a debate on the internment issue tomorrow and then there will be ample lime for the Taoiseach and his party to deal with the Prices and Incomes Bill in the way in which he intended from the first.</P>

In return for the concession offered I asked for another concession; I have undertaken already <Col N="532" /> to provide in two different ways a vehicle for a debate on the internment statement and, so far, neither has been acceptable.  What I am suggesting now is that we proceed with the business and ask the Whips to meet and report back here, say, before Question Time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this Bill is to give legal effect to the Budget introduced here on the opening day of this session by the Minister for Finance.  The proposals in that Budget are to increase company taxation; to increase motor taxation; to increase wholesale tax; to make provision for matters arising out of the prolonged bank strike which paralysed this country for the greater part of this year.  It is a very important Bill in so far as it implements a second Budget in this year.</P>
      <P>We have been told by the Taoiseach several times during the unseemly incidents in this House that this is a very urgent Bill; that he must have it before Christmas; that he must have another Bill, the Prices and Incomes Bill, before Christmas and we are entitled to a debate on the proposal to intern.  I presume the Taoiseach has been aware for some time that this is an important Bill and an urgent Bill and one which he wanted through the House.  I reported progress on the Second Stage of this Bill as far back as 25th November, 1970, and it was not sought to resume discussion on the Bill until yesterday.  The reason for that was that the Government party wanted to release the members for party purposes and to engage in party matters.  I believe that this Bill is so important that it should get a full discussion in this House and that there should be no arrangement by which discussion on it should be stifled.  It is hardly out of order for me to say that I think time which could have been devoted to this Bill has been wasted yesterday and this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the year ending 30th April, 1970, they will have to provide 74 per cent of their income in taxation as against 50 per cent for which they had budgeted.  These companies, and many companies like them, will have less <Col N="535" /> money to plough back into their business. As the Minister knows, the money that is ploughed back into the business provides for expansion, provides for more employment, provides for general development.  Instead of being good for the economy, this step is bad for the economy; instead of providing for more employment it will curtail employment.</P>
      <P>I dealt, the last day I spoke here on this Bill, with the wholesale tax and motor taxation.  Section 5 provides for payment of interest at 8 per cent per annum on redemption moneys of certain land bonds which should have been drawn on 5th May, 1970, but were not drawn until 27th October, 1970, and will not be paid until 1st December, 1970.  That is a reasonable proposal.  It is only just that the Government should pay interest to holders of land bonds as a result of the failure to pay or draw the bonds on 5th May, 1970.</P>
      <P>But many other people have lost money arising out of the bank strike which paralysed the country this year. The effects of it will not be fully felt for, perhaps, a very considerable time to come.  There are many people of modest means whose lands were taken from them by the Land Commission, who did not voluntarily sell their lands and who were paid not in cash but in land bonds bearing 4 per cent, 6 per cent or 7 per cent years ago.  These wretched land bonds, which they were given at the rate of £100 worth of bonds for every £100 worth of land and which they did not want to take but which the law compelled them to take, are now as low as, probably, £60 or £70.  These unfortunate people cannot sell these land bonds unless they do so at a great loss.  They are not even getting the interest they were promised on them. Under the law they are entitled to interest on 1st July.  That interest was not paid; it has only been paid in the past few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have done as I requested him to do by way of parliamentary question earlier in the year. He should have made provision to compensate these people and he would not be over-generous in doing that: he would only be just.  Many of these people are not wealthy: they are people <Col N="536" /> who had modest holdings&mdash;not all small holdings&mdash;and who had their lands taken from them by the Land Commission and, under the law, the Land Commission said: &ldquo;We will take your lands, whether you like it or not, in the national interest; we will pay you, whether you like it or not, in land bonds and you will find a market on the stock exchange for these bonds because if nobody else will buy them the Government stockbroker will buy them.&rdquo;  We know the price the Government stockbroker will pay for these bonds.  As I say, they have fallen, certainly the 4 per cent ones, between £50 and £60 per £100.  Even those issued recently are well below par.  It is manifestly unjust that these people should be deprived of the interest they were legally entitled to get on 1st July and which has been held back from them for nearly six months.  In many cases this is the only income these people have.  I believe these bonds are trustee securities.  I urge the Minister even at this stage to bring in an amendment to compensate land bond holders.</P>
    <P>This does not stop at land bonds.  It applies also to all Government loans, and national loans dealt with through the Bank of Ireland.  All of these are in the same position.  People who should have got dividends in last May or June did not get them.  They were deprived of them for six months.  Many of these are poor people, many are widows enjoying&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;income under settlements.  The trustees of those settlements were obliged to invest moneys in trustee securities and all these national loans, exchequer bonds and so on are trustee securities.  The Minister for Finance should compensate such people in some way because it is unjust that they should be kept without their money.  I know that in the case of loans processed through the Central Bank payments have been made but in the case of those operated through the Bank of Ireland payments were held up for approximately six months.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also avail of the introduction of this Finance Bill to deal with the complications arising out of the bank strike which should never have taken place.  The matter was of such national importance that the Government should have dealt with it immediately <Col N="537" /> in last April or May and should have taken steps to bring the parties together or introduce legislation, if necessary, to ensure that banking facilities did not break down.  It is only now the enormity of the mess created by the bank strike is beginning to manifest itself.  We are told that it might well be next year before people know how their accounts stand. Some people also unreasonably availed of the bank strike to stop cheques and in that way bring pressure to bear on people with whom they had dealings.</P>
    <P>The banks should not be allowed to arrange things to suit themselves regarding payment of interest on overdrafts and so on.  The banks were closed at the end of April and we are told they think it will be possible for them to calculate overdrafts accurately enough up to 30th June and that they will charge interest up to that date. I think that will be fairly accurate, accurate enough not to injure anybody very substantially, but I am also told that the banks will take the balance on all overdrawn accounts as at 30th June and apply what they call a delayed value dating system and the balance as at 30th June will be the balance on which people who have overdrafts will pay interest up to some unknown date next year.  That is quite unreasonable and the Minister should do something about it.  The banks opened on, I think, 17th November and even if on that date people who had overdrafts lodged perfectly good cheques on local banks they will not get credit for these cheques against their overdrafts until some date in the new year, a date the banks will decide.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have taken the opportunity, when introducing this Bill, to do something about that.  I do not know what the legality of it is but that is the procedure being adopted by the banks.</P>
    <P>The banks closed at the end of April, which is a time when many people, for instance people in seaside resorts getting ready for the summer season and suppliers to the agricultural community giving credit for buying for the spring sowing, would have substantial overdrafts which normally would have been reduced by September, October <Col N="538" /> and November.  Those people will now be compelled to pay interest on those overdrafts up until some date which we have not yet been told.</P>
    <P>It would be possible in my opinion for a bank manager to look over a person's account for the last three or four years and, taking one year with another, to come to a reasonable conclusion as to what the state of that account would be at any given time. The Minister should insist that an average of two or three years would be taken and that it would be left to the discretion of the manager, who has a knowledge of his customers and of the working of his customers' accounts, to decide what interest would be charged.  The banks have said they will charge full interest on the overdrafts as at 30th June last until whatever date they in their own wisdom and in their own arbitrary way will decide.</P>
    <P>This matter has given great concern to people in the country.  The Minister should speak with the banks and if that does not work he should introduce legislation because the Government must take considerable responsibility for the bank strike and for the evils which have flowed from it.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the general effect of this Bill on 25th November.  The purpose of the Bill is to deal with inflation.  The Government have been borrowing abroad for some years.  The Governor of the Central Bank advised against this foreign borrowing and said it is one of the ways of aggravating inflation because it injects money into the economy which has not been earned or in respect of which goods have not been produced.  I would like the Minister, when replying, to deal with the Government's policy on borrowing and to tell us whether he thinks it is a wise policy or one which is in the interests of the economy and whether he intends to pursue this policy.  This is a policy which goes on year after year. The Minister has exhausted his borrowing powers at home and he now goes abroad.  I always thought this was fraught with danger.  I do not hold myself out as a financial expert but when I see such an authority as Dr. Whitaker advising against it and pointing <Col N="539" /> out the dangers of it I think it is time to stop it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should outline Government policy on having two Finance Bills every year.  In the first place it makes it very difficult for the ordinary business people of this country to plan a year ahead.  They do not know what taxation they will be liable for.  They make arrangements at the beginning of the year on one basis and they find that is all wrong.  They then have to have another &ldquo;go&rdquo; at it.  The social welfare recipients are also affected by those two Budgets every year.  We are usually told at the time of the spring Budget by the Minister for Finance, and later by the Minister for Social Welfare, who usually intervenes in the debate, that the social welfare classes have been more than cushioned against the taxes imposed in the spring Budget.</P>
    <P>We are told that over and above the indemnification to them for the taxes imposed they have been given generous allowances to increase their standard of living but then invariably for the last few years we have another Budget in the autumn which in one way or another has a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the social welfare classes.  There is usually an increase in motor taxation and that imposes extra hardship on the social welfare classes.  This year the wholesale tax is increased which imposes a severe hardship on people in poor circumstances if they are to have any enjoyment in life and have to buy any goods which are classed as luxury items.</P>
    <P>This year the Post Office increased their charges and CIE, a State-sponsored body, substantially increased fares which also hit the social welfare classes.  If one were to go into all those increases with a fine comb one would find that the increases promised the social welfare classes in the spring Budget of this year, which did not come into operation until August, October or next January, have already been gobbled up by those increases I have been speaking about.  The old age pensioner, the widow, the recipients of unemployment benefit and sickness benefit, will have to wait until next April or May to get another promise of some relief from <Col N="540" /> the taxes that have been introduced in this Budget and the increases in charges introduced by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and CIE, which promises will not come to be implemented until August or October of 1971 or perhaps January, 1972.</P>
    <P>This is being dishonest with the people.  It is really practising deception. There should be one Budget each year.  We had the rather unusual circumstance this year that we had two Ministers for Finance, each operating a different policy.  It is significant that one of them should arrive in the House at this time as I have been talking about two Budgets and two Ministers for Finance.  I was saying that there should be only one Budget and Deputy Haughey who has just come into the House&mdash;who comes into the front bench, into the Taoiseach's seat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has always been my attitude to be as reasonable as possible in my dealings with any Member of the House, within the realms of reason, that is.  However, certain situations occur in which reason and rationality go out the door.  There are a few points I should like the Minister to clear up for me in connection with this Bill.  One is the question of tax exemption on various ambulances and mini-buses which bring invalid children to various institutions.  I should like to point out that to the best of my knowledge an ambulance has been exempt from taxation since 1952, I think.  There is a slightly anomalous situation in the case where a minibus has not got the word &ldquo;ambulance&rdquo; printed on it but nevertheless is being used effectively as an ambulance.  If a minibus, a small bus, or a small vehicle, is being used for the purpose for which an ambulance is used.  I believe it should be exempt from tax.</P>
      <P>I know a number of cases in my own area&mdash;and I am sure others do too in their areas&mdash;where this situation arises. When the Minister is concluding on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill he might clear up this matter for me.  On the whole question of social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right.  The Parliamentary Secretary can sit down now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Deputy is telling me what to do.  We are in a very difficult position.  I wanted to make a contribution.  I will admit that circumstances found me on my feet.  I will concede that to Deputy Tully.  The Minister is here now and I want to remind him once more of my particular <Col N="543" /> interest in the question of paraplegics. The former Minister for Finance introduced a very fair and socially just item into his Budget of 1968 which was subsequently given effect to in the consequential Finance Bill.  He made provision whereby paraplegics who could operate a motor car would be exempt from car tax.  This is correct.  This is exactly the position at this point of time.  However, I would ask the present Minister for Finance to consider the possibility of giving greater concessions than are being given at the moment for the purchase of cars by paraplegics.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which he might consider and which arises, peripherally at any rate, in the context of the Finance Bill, that is, the position of paraplegics and the blind in relation to income tax, and the position generally of disabled persons in full-time employment&mdash;this is very important&mdash; whose full-time capabilities should be recognised by some type of income tax allowance.  It is important that they should be encouraged to take up employment but by virtue of their doing so they should then get recognition from the State.  For instance, a blind person has to have special facilities in his or her own home; a paraplegic has to have special facilities in his or her own home, but there are very small allowances, if any, available to those people for the maintenance of their own home.  I would ask the Minister to consider these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth remembering that the social welfare increases granted have been substantially eroded by increases in prices.  Two of these increases in prices have been directly brought about by the Government, first, by their sanctioning the increase in bus and rail fares and, secondly, the increases in postal charges.  The Government are always saying how much they have increased social welfare payments but they do not say how much they have contributed to the necessity for the increases in social welfare payments by their direct encouragement of price increases in these respects.  There have been price increases through Government policy also as a result of the increase in the <Col N="544" /> rate of turnover tax from 2½ to 5 per cent.  This indicates that while the Government may increase social welfare payments with one hand they take away the benefit with the other.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the question of land bonds, that people are paid in these land bonds and they very quickly become devalued.  I consider this to be a very unfair method of payment for land acquired by the Land Commission.  As far as possible, people should be paid in cash and, if not, measures should be taken to ensure that land bonds do not become devalued to the extent they have become devalued.  I know of many cases in my constituency where people have suffered very real hardship because all their assets took the form of land bonds and these became devalued very quickly.  This is a very unfortunate situation and I hope the Minister for Finance, in consultation with other members of the Government, will take action to ensure that people are paid in cash for land acquired by the Land Commission or, alternatively, that measures are taken by the Government&mdash;I do not know what measures could be taken&mdash;in the stock market or elsewhere, to keep the value of land bonds up to a reasonable extent.  I am not saying they should be always at 100 but they should not be allowed to sink as far as they have sunk in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a case for extending the matters on which tax exemptions are given.  I have advocated, and I know that my colleague.  Deputy Tully, has advocated for some considerable time, the idea that travelling expenses, where these are a very high component of a person's expenses, should be exempted from tax.  I realise this proposal would pose considerable difficulties in execution, there is no point in minimising those, but it is the apparent policy of the Government to encourage part-time farming and it is obvious that people who live on farms will have to travel considerable distances to work and therefore their travelling expenses will be high.  If it is our policy to encourage part-time farming and to encourage people to travel considerable distances to growth centres to work it is only logical and <Col N="545" /> fair that we should give them some assistance to do this and perhaps the most appropriate assistance would be in the form of tax relief for travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>The point has been put forward in the Fine Gael policy that there should be a speculative gains tax.  This is something which the Minister should consider.  This relates to the question of people buying land at a particular price and, without performing any substantial service, a disproportionate increase in the value occurs because they happen to be in a monopoly position &mdash;the land becomes very much in demand either because it becomes serviced land where previously it had not been serviced land or because of population expansion in a particular area. People can make very substantial profits in this way over a short period without providing any substantial service in return for the profits they make. I think, and my party also think, that a special speculative gains tax should be placed on these people because in many cases private profit is occurring because of public expenditure on making this land serviced land.  The least that should be done is to tax the speculative gains which occur as a result of this.  This has been advocated by my party since 1965 and I hope the Minister will consider incorporating it in future Finance Bills.</P>

      <P>We have had in recent months a number of what I might call general economic debates.  I do not, therefore, propose to go back over all of the ground that has been covered in these debates but rather will confine myself to the main points which were raised in this debate relating to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred again to what he had said before&mdash;that our trouble was due to excessive Government expenditure.  Again he failed to point out anything that he thought the Government were spending money on that they should not spend money on. In particular when he referred to the increased charges by CIE and the increased postal charges he did not indicate in any way what he thought should have been done about that except <Col N="546" /> that they should not have gone up.  Of course this does not solve the problem.  I have dealt with this matter before so I do not propose to go back over all that again except to draw attention to that aspect of Deputy Cosgrave's contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick this morning dealt at some length with the bank closure and the consequences of it.  I think he was mistaken in some views he expressed as to what was being done by the banks but again this is a matter I have dealt with at some length in reply to Parliamentary Questions.  I have indicated what the banks proposed to do and that on the face of it what they proposed to do appears to be reasonable but I have also indicated to the House that in the event of the banks not doing what they have indicated they will do I was certainly prepared to take the matter up with them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Bruton about tax on speculative gains in regard to land I would point out that there are already some provisions which get at these profits but to do effectively what many people would like to see done presents very difficult legal and constitutional problems.  A considerable study has been made of this problem by the Government and that study is continuing.  I cannot guarantee that the result will be satisfactory but certainly if any satisfactory way of dealing with this under the Constitution can be found then the Government certainly would be disposed to act on such a method but I would not like anybody to think that this is a simple matter.  It is not.  It is extremely difficult.</P>

      <P>Effectively, it boils down to the question of the price that is paid for land.  One can put on taxes but this only increases the cost of land and the cost of housing.  This is not a solution of the problem.  The real solution lies in the matter of the price paid for land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The real solution is the complete taking over of building land by the State and the local authorities. The Minister knows that fact very well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of doing something effective, not merely punitive.  To be effective the cost of land must be reduced, but to do this under the Constitution is not a simple matter.  However, I am not without hope that a solution will be found.</P>
      <P>The main criticisms raised in the debate related to the question of additional tax on companies.  It was alleged that the income tax increases imposed by this Bill on companies represent an inordinate increase on Irish industry, particularly in the current year.  Despite the various statements made in the debate, I would point out that the immediate effect is that the rate of company tax is increased by 8 per cent, from 50 to 58 per cent.  It has been represented that because of under-provision made for future taxation in accounts for 1970&mdash;in some cases for 1969 also&mdash;there is an under-provision of 8 per cent which must be provided for in the 1971 accounts. As a consequence of this, the provision in the 1971 accounts will have to be at the rate of 58 per cent, plus the under-provision of 8 per cent for 1970; indeed, it will be 16 per cent where there was under-provision in the 1969 accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> This argument overlooks the fact that many companies have a tax reserve which is intended to take account of changes in the rate of tax. The same consequences mentioned now would arise if the rate of income tax had been increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates the position of a company which has laid aside £360,000 for the building of a new factory, gets a Government grant of £250,000, and then they find that the sum of £360,000 is being taxed retrospectively.  Such a company has reasonable cause for complaint and the Minister's argument does not answer that complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This tax is not retrospective and I will demonstrate that fact.  First, a company prepares its accounts and in this preparation it can only base its provision for tax on existing rates.  In most cases the company is being taxed on the basis of its earnings in the previous year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speaking of income tax in this connection.  What we have done is to increase the company's liability for income tax by providing that corporation profits tax will not be allowed as a deduction in the computation of profits for income tax purposes. A company can only operate on the basis of existing rates of tax and many companies have a tax equalisation reserve precisely because they operate on the existing rates of tax.  They know that tax rates may be changed at any time.  If the rate is increased they may not have made sufficient provision and if the rate goes down they may have made over-provision; to cover this contingency many companies have the special reserve. If the argument that has been made in this House in relation to this provision is carried to its logical conclusion, then it must be accepted that the rate of income tax can never be changed because this problem will always arise whenever there is a change in the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Any change would create this problem.  On foot of the case made here it would have to be urged that should there be a change in the rate of income tax this should never occur in the course of a financial year.  Incidentally, the financial year for companies does not correspond with the State financial year in most cases. However, even if that were done the same problem would exist.  I do not accept, and I do not think the House will accept, that the rate of income tax can never be changed because companies have not made provision for such change in their accounts.</P>
      <P>Regarding the alleged retrospective nature of this tax, the change effected by this Bill is in connection with income tax payable for 1970-71 only, not for any previous year.  The income tax liability of trading companies is based on the amount of profits of the previous year of assessment.  Where a company completes its accounts annually the accounting year is taken as being equivalent to the year of assessment.  Therefore, the liability is in respect of tax payable for 1970-71 and the tax is not payable before January, 1971.</P>

      <P>I would further point out that, as a result of the system of the company paying tax on profits earned in the previous year, the company has the benefit of money it would otherwise be paying in tax, for periods up to 20 months.  In many cases this is worth more to the company than the increased tax being imposed.  Companies cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>Many people who pay income tax certainly cannot afford to set aside money to meet that tax.  A complaint has also been made that there is no indication that this is a temporary measure, designed to deal <Col N="551" /> with a specific situation.  It is quite true that there has not been any such indication.  I could not undertake in advance to have this tax either revoked or reduced at a particular time.  However, the position arising from its imposition will certainly be kept under review from time to time and should the results of such review indicate that it ought to be modified or, indeed, that we should revert to the position as it was prior to the introduction of the supplementary budget, that decision would be taken.  However, I could not undertake that that will happen or that it will happen at a particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that, once written into the tax law, it is there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said also that relief should be given to companies with annual profits not exceeding £20,000.  I would point out that relief designed to help the smaller companies is already provided for in the tax code by reason of the fact that the first £2,500 of taxable profits are charged at a reduced rate of corporation profits tax, at the rate of 7½ per cent.  Consequently, the net effect of disallowing corporation profits tax as a deduction in calculating income tax on companies' profits, where those profits are £2,500 or less&mdash;and these account for about 70 per cent of our companies&mdash;is by no means heavy. For example, a company having a net taxable profit of £2,500 will pay an additional £65 income tax under this provision.  Therefore, it does not appear to me that the extra charge on small companies is such as would warrant the introduction of further special relief for companies whose profits are less than £20,000.</P>

      <P>The Federation of Irish Industries seem to think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I tell the Deputy that 90 per cent of all our companies come into that category he will understand <Col N="552" /> that the Federation of Irish Industries are doing a good job for their members.  I might point out that if we were to do this, the cost of such concession would be £0.4 million in the current year and £0.7 million in a full year.  Certainly, it would not fulfil one of the main purposes for which this tax was introduced.</P>
      <P>It has been said that under this provision, a company in this country will pay tax at the rate of 58 per cent while the corporation tax in Britain is only 42.5 per cent.  This is an unrealistic comparison because it does not follow through to the position of the shareholders. When an Irish company have paid their tax the shareholder pays no further income tax but when a British company have paid their corporation profits tax, the shareholder will have to pay an additional 7s 9d in the £ on the dividend.  Therefore, if one takes the company and the shareholders together, the Irish tax charges will remain constant at 58 per cent no matter what is the distribution whereas the British tax rate will rise from 42½ per cent where there is no distribution to almost 65 per cent where there is full distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, is it not the case that the British company ploughs back its profits into a better competitive position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Irish company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be if these were the only factors to compare but there are a number of advantages for the Irish company which I am about to mention and all of which are not available to British companies.  For instance, there is a very valuable concession available to Irish companies of export tax relief.  This is not available to British companies.  Indeed, to the extent that a company are engaged fully in export, they are not affected at all by this provision and to the extent that some of their products are exported, they are not affected by this provision. One of the arguments that can be made in favour of the provision is that it will encourage Irish companies to engage to a greater extent in the export market. This ties in partially with the point I was making and also with the criticism <Col N="553" /> that was made to the effect that our tax structure should favour reinvestment of profits as against distribution of profits.  I would be in general agreement with that proposition but I must point out that Deputies have not adverted to the fact that our tax system at present provides very valuable inducements to higher investment out of pre-tax profits in manufacturing industries.</P>
      <P>Firstly, between 70 and 85 per cent of capital expenditure on new plant and machinery may be written off in the first year of the life of the assets and the balance at annual rates of 10, 12½ or 25 per cent depending on the circumstances.  Secondly, the total cost of expenditure on new plant and machinery in underdeveloped areas may be written off in the year in which it is incurred.  Thirdly, all expenditure on scientific research for the purpose of acquiring industrial know-how, may be written off in one year. Fourthly, capital expenditure on industrial buildings may be written off by way of an initial allowance of 20 per cent and an annual allowance of 2 per cent.  These reliefs are quite costly in so far as the revenue involved is forgone by the Exchequer.  Therefore, the criticism that was levelled in this respect did not take account of the existing tax structure which, to the extent I have indicated, favours deliberately the investment of pre-tax profits in expansion and in re-equipment as against distribution to shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These, then, were the main points raised.  I am anxious to ensure that at least balancing statements would be made in relation to what I have described as the exaggerated claims made against the additional tax liability of companies as provided in the Bill because the position has not been presented in a balanced way.  There are a number of Irish industrialists who believe genuinely some of the points put forward but which are not true.  I am anxious that these people should realise they are not being treated as badly as they have been led to believe. The case has been made that this could lead to widespread unemployment <Col N="554" /> and so on.  I have no reason whatever to believe that.</P>
    <P>This reaction can be expected any time there is an imposition of this nature affecting any category of the community but we must allow for the fact that in many cases there are exaggerations and one must endeavour to reach the truth.  I would not contemplate with any equanimity whatsoever a situation in which, by reason of additional taxation, we would put out of business a number of Irish companies or that a number of their workers would be left without employment. I have no reason to believe this would happen and I am not anxious that the people in control of Irish companies should be under any illusions as to the effects of this tax.  They should have some knowledge of the points I have mentioned because if they have they will see the situation much more in perspective than they might otherwise do.  Furthermore, in the case of business in general, various impositions and difficulties are experienced from time to time not only because of taxation. But in other countries&mdash;it may be due to wars, to political changes and so on&mdash;the characteristic of the business community is that they can overcome difficulties.  This is what being in business is all about.  People who cannot overcome difficulties that arise do not survive in business.  The business community in general, what has them in business is that they can overcome difficulties and go on and make profits, and I have no reason whatever to believe that what is being done here will have any serious consequences for Irish industry.  Indeed, I think it would be&mdash;and this case was made in another context&mdash;unjustifiable, apart from budgetary considerations which I outlined on another occasion, in the context of what we are doing otherwise in relation to other incomes that we would not try to ensure that industry in general and companies in general, which, of course, include more than industry, would also contribute their share to the effort we are making to deal with inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make a comment on three points which I consider very important?  First, can he <Col N="555" /> differentiate between caravans which are used as temporary homes and those that are used for pleasure, summer holidays and so on?  Secondly, can he promise anything with regard to people who use motor bicycles for the purpose of going to work, because this is a really serious matter?  Thirdly, there is the question of taxation on motor cars being used by people who need them for work but who get no tax remission.  Can anything be done in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If I take the first one, caravans as mobile homes, this has been a difficult problem for quite some time, apart from this Bill at all, because of the effects of duty on imported ones.  This has been going on for quite a while and the association of caravan manufacturers&mdash;I forget their exact title&mdash;have been discussing this with the Revenue Commissioners and have accepted the Revenue Commissioners' view that, for technical reasons it is not possible to differentiate between caravans and mobile homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the caravan manufacturers do not give a damn because the tax is just added on to the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they do.  It is very important to them, and they have been agitating for quite a long time.  While I was in Industry and Commerce I had the problem many a time on this very point.  They have a vested interest in ensuring that there is a difference between the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that it is not possible to differentiate.  If it were I <Col N="556" /> certainly would be prepared to consider the exemption of caravans used as homes from this tax.  Unfortunately, the same thing applies to the use of motor cycles, scooters and cars by people for their work as distinct from pleasure; it just is not possible to differentiate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Subsection (1) provides :</P>
      <P>A bill of exchange or promissory note drawn or made on or after decimal day shall be invalid if the sum payable is an amount wholly or partly in shillings or pence. </P>
      <P>This is a rather harsh provision in my opinion and some effort should be made to leave the position a little more open; if that is not done more chaos will be caused in an already chaotic situation.  Would the Minister consider the matter?  If he said that payments would be met at a certain figure up or down, mentioning the equivalent in decimal currency, that would be a far easier way of dealing with it rather than the way suggested in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To take Deputy O'Higgins's point first, I take it to mean that the legal effect would be the same as it is in the case of a cheque which was inadvertently dated 2nd January, 1970, when it should in fact have been dated 2nd January, 1971. Strictly speaking, a cheque operates for only six months after the date, but the practice in cases in which the incorrect date is clearly inadvertent is for the banks to deal with the cheque as if it were correctly dated.  The reason for the provision here is because there must be some degree of certainty legally as to where people stand.  If the provision were not included there would be an enormous amount of administrative work thrown on the banks. Because of the volume of financial transactions which they handle, it would not be possible for them to work simultaneously in both decimal currency and Lsd during the change-over period.  Furthermore, this provision should encourage a quick change-over thereby reducing the changeover period to a minimum.  I do not anticipate any hardship being likely because <Col N="560" /> the position will be analogous to the situation that arises every year in the case of inadvertent dating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed one point.  If one puts in the wrong year the option is there for the bank to deal with that in a certain way. When this Bill is passed it will be the law of the land and it will, therefore, be an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation will be identical.  If a cheque is incorrectly dated 2nd January, 1970, instead of 2nd January, 1971, as the position stands at the moment, it is invalid and the bank need not honour it but, in practice, it is honoured.  I visualise a similar situation operating under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says a bank does not have to honour a cheque which is incorrectly dated.  If the misdating is clearly inadvertent then the cheque is a perfectly valid instrument and is so regarded but, if you legislate and say it is invalid, has anyone then the authority to deal with it as if it were a valid transaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the precise wording where cheques are concerned, but I feel certain the word &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; or some similar word is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have a look at it to see if it might be preferable to the wording in this provision and then introduce it by way of amendment in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is a small matter.  The wording would give one the impression that it related to all cheques.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a certificate, I take it, in a formal kind of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is that the holder of the post-dated cheque would produce the cheque to a banker and the banker would certify that it had been produced to him and this would make it valid after Decimal Day even though it is in £sd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Why can the Minister not give authority to the banks to convert the whole thing on the basis of the table in the Schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks would then be in the position that people could validly present cheques either in decimal currency or in £sd and this would add enormously to administrative difficulties. There is no reason to believe this provision will create hardship but its being there will certainly speed up the changeover to decimal currency and that is desirable.  The shorter the changeover period the better.  Everyone will, I think, agree on that because, if we do not have a dual system operating, there will be less likelihood of confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of the end of the financial year when someone pays his rates to 31st March in £sd and the cheque will be invalid unless it is changed by the payee.  Rate collectors might lose poundage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is covered by section 4 and by the fact that it would be presented, as the Deputy visualises, immediately after Decimal Day.  It would be similar to a cheque bearing the incorrect year.  I think there will be a limited service provided by the banks on these days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh asked about a cheque made out in £sd and the Minister said it would be the same as a cheque wrongly dated. In the circumstances he described, a wrongly dated cheque should be fixed up straight away with the person who wrote it and should be rectified.  It cannot be rectified in this case unless you find the person.  He would have lodged the cheque.  It is completely wrong.  The rate collector would not get his poundage or whatever it was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind a rate collector who is getting a number of cheques on 31st March.  He has some made out in shillings and pence. Perhaps they are posted to him.  He lodges them.  Some are returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> Thereby, he loses poundage or bonus, say, up to £100, because he did not reach the required figure.  Is there any way in which he can be allowed for the time lost in sending them back to the individuals who wrote them incorrectly?</P>

It may be tied up with the Bills of Exchange Act.  Presumably the draftsman may be using it because it has a particular meaning.

      <P>The Minister knows the existing position and it seems to me that there is an abnormal increase in the number of small coins that may be tendered.  It may be very convenient to lump them all together in this fashion but my recollection is that at present you may tender copper coins up to 12 pence legally and silver coins, or what were silver coins, up to 40s.  Under these provisions now you may tender shillings, five new pence, up to £5.  This is all right from the banks' point of view when the coins are made up in packets but, take the example that you may now tender 100 shillings, 100 pieces of five new pence in payment of a bill.  We hear jokes about what cranks do to &ldquo;to get one over&rdquo; on somebody they dislike by dumping a large bulk of coins on him. The present penny is five-twelfths of a new penny and it may be tendered to the extent of 20 new pence or 4s. That means the equivalent of 48 existing pennies and you could tender 48 of these coins to pay an amount of 4s <Col N="567" /> or 20 new pence.  This seems to me to be an undue extension and it will give opportunities to people to make a nuisance of themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The old legal tender limits were 1s for bronze coins and 40s for cupro-nickel coins.  After some examination of the matter it is believed that these provisions are really more in line with present day conditions.  The old pennies will go out of circulation. One may take the view Deputy O'Donovan takes but one may argue both ways.  The Deputy will appreciate that as in most cases, we are trying to meet conflicting rights of two parties. I do not think I would be in a position to say positively that one was right and one wrong but it does not seem an unreasonable provision here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 40 new halfpence in 20 new pence and therefore you can tender 40 of these small coins.  We know from pictures we have seen that they are relatively small.  To meet my point of view admittedly, you might, instead of having three categories be obliged to have five categories but, making it possible for a person legally to tender 40 new halfpence, 40 coins of a new halfpenny in value, seems to me to be a big extension compared with the position when even with the old halfpenny, which is now gone out of existence, you could legally tender 24 of them theoretically.  You could legally tender 48 farthings when they were there, as that would be within the limit of copper coins up to one shilling.  The new halfpenny is equivalent to 1.2 existing pennies and, despite inflation, I hope they will remain of some value in the future currency system.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that situation.  It would be relatively easy to have a different number of categories, say four instead of three.  You would not have to go very far.  If it is legal to tender the new five-pence, value 1s, up to £5, that would mean 100 coins, a very big number compared with the 40 at present.  I am really asking why must we have this relatively great extension in the number?</P>

      <P>The new bronze coins <Col N="568" /> are lighter than the present ones so that the burden would not be too great for somebody being paid.  The Deputy referred to this in passing when he mentioned the existing limits and said that &ldquo;theoretically&rdquo; one would be obliged to take so much in certain coins.  This is true.  We are talking of a theoretical situation.  So far as I can recollect I never came across a situation where somebody, under the old legal limits, said &ldquo;That is legal tender; you must accept it.&rdquo;  I know it happened; I have heard of it.  It is a very rare situation and I doubt if many Deputies came across it.</P>

      <P>I move : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is a temporary measure to meet ClE's immediate financial difficulties and provide an opportunity for a more thorough examination of the position in relation to future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> It provides for payment to the board in the current financial year of additional subsidy not exceeding £2.98 million, which is the amount of ClE's estimated net loss this year after account is taken of the board's annual grant of £2.65 million.</P>
    <P>The annual grant of £2.65 million was fixed just 12 months ago.  On 31st December, 1969, I made an order under section 6 of the Transport Act, 1964, increasing the grant from £2 million to £2.65 million per annum.  The order had previously been approved, in draft, by both the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>CIE have a statutory obligation to break even, taking one year with another, with the aid of the annual grant and the revised grant of £2.65 million was regarded as a realistic estimate of the minimum subsidy with which CIE could get by, during the five year period ending 31st March, 1974, on the basis of effective management and increased efficiency and productivity.  The board has not succeeded in breaking even and the main reason can be summed up in one word &mdash;inflation.</P>
    <P>The annual grant of £2.65 million was fixed on the basis of estimates of ClE's annual deficit for the five year period 1969-70 to 1973-74.  These estimates did not include any provision for the 12th round increase in salaries and wages on the grounds that it was appropriate that national wage rounds and other increases in labour costs which might arise during the five year period should be recovered by way of increases in fares and rates, to the extent that they could not be met by way of economies and increased productivity. Likewise, the estimates did not include provision for additional revenue from increases in fares and rates.  This, in my view, is the only reasonable approach to the fixing of ClE's annual subvention.</P>
    <P>No one could have foreseen in December, 1969, that the 12th round settlements would be of such magnitude that they would cost CIE almost £5 million in a full year or that the overall increase in the board's labour costs would amount to an estimated £6.7 million in a full year.  Other costs <Col N="570" /> have also increased&mdash;charges for materials and services, financial charges, depreciation provisions, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>Apart from the effects of inflation, there are many other factors which have contributed to the substantial increase in ClE's losses.  I will mention just a few.  Strikes, both inside and outside CIE, cost the board about £277,000 in gross revenue in 1969-70. To date this year they have cost CIE another £430,000.  Strikes in the cement and fertilising industries contributed substantially to a decline of 3 per cent in rail freight tonnage in 1969-70&mdash;over the previous five years there had been an increase of 34 per cent.</P>
    <P>There has been a continuing decline in the number of passengers using the Dublin city services.  Over 7 million fewer passengers were carried in 1969-70 than in the preceding year; compared with the year 1964-65, the number of passengers carried in 1969-70 was down by almost 28 million. The growing traffic congestion, which is, of course, a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, continues to be a major cause of disruption of Dublin bus services. It has, no doubt, contributed to the decline in passenger numbers.  It has certainly contributed substantially to the reduced profitability of these services. The net profit on the Dublin city services was only £61,000 in 1969-70 on a turnover of £7.7 million and on the basis of present estimates these services show a net loss of £280,000 in 1970-71.  While the board's coach tours continued to expand in 1969-70, the hoped for development was retarded due to disturbances in Northern Ireland, which were responsible for the cancellation of many bookings.</P>
    <P>One important factor which is often overlooked is the timelag between the date of implementation of increases in salaries and wages for CIE employees and the date on which consequential increases in fares and rates are introduced. Depending on the time taken to complete negotiations, the retrospective element of salary and wage increases can be quite substantial.  This was the position with the 12th round <Col N="571" /> increase.  In such cases, the timelag can have a significant effect on ClE's losses.</P>
    <P>Even with the two increases in fares and rates in June and October, 1970, which will bring in additional revenue to CIE estimated at £3.5 million in the current financial year and £6.6 million in 1971-72, ClE's estimated net deficits in 1970-71 and 1971-72 will amount to £5.63 million and £4.79 million respectively.  The board's annual grant will, therefore, be inadequate to the extent of £2.98 million in the current financial year and £2.14 million next year.  The present Bill is an <i>ad hoc</i> measure to deal with ClE's financial difficulties during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent, it might be said that CIE are this year the victims of circumstances and not the masters of their own destiny.  Nevertheless, the Government are gravely disturbed by the board's progressively deteriorating financial position.  They are particularly concerned about the growing losses on the railway.  In 1964, when the Government took the major policy decision to preserve the railway system, subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might be practicable or desirable, operating losses on the railway amounted to £905,000.  In 1968-69 these losses had grown to £2.1 million; in 1969-70 they amounted to £3.1 million.  Adding financial charges, the net deficit on the railway last year was £4.2 million and CIE estimate that even with the increases in fares and rates, total net losses on the railway will exceed £5.6 million this year and next year.</P>
    <P>The growing losses on the railway are symptomatic of the inflation to which I referred earlier.  The railway is more vulnerable to wage inflation than the board's other services in that salaries and wages of railway employees represent approximately 81 per cent of total railway revenue, compared with 67 per cent for Dublin city services, 61 per cent for road freight services and 54 per cent for provincial road passenger services.</P>
    <P>Railway losses of over £5.6 million per annum cannot, however, be <Col N="572" /> accepted with equanimity and I have, therefore, set up a joint committee comprising representatives of my own Department, the Department of Finance and CIE to investigate the deterioration in ClE's financial position and to identify possible corrective measures.</P>
    <P>I have agreed that the committee should enlist the aid of consultants in their task.  The first priority will be to examine the reasons for the increased losses on railway working and to determine what can be done, in the short term, to reduce these losses.  A report on this aspect of the matter should be available early in the financial year 1971-72 and we will then be in a better position to decide what should be done about ClE's losses in that year.</P>
    <P>A study in depth to establish what measures might be taken in the long term to achieve a reduction in ClE's losses will also be undertaken.  Arising out of this study, which will outline the various alternatives to existing policy in relation to the railways and the implications of these alternatives in terms of Exchequer assistance for CIE, employment, reduction of services, <i>et cetera</i>, the Government will be better informed as to whether any change is necessary in existing policy and, if so, the various options open to them.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was introduced, I have been advised that section 1, as drafted, is open to the interpretation that the grants payable to CIE under the section would include any grants payable to the board under previous enactments. This, of course, is not the intention and I propose, therefore, to move an amendment to the section at the Committee Stage to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the Bill must be enacted before the Christmas Recess, as otherwise CIE could run short of cash before the end of January.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are left with no alternative but to agree to give the Minister this Bill.  He states that the Bill is purely a temporary measure to meet ClE's financial difficulties and he says in the last paragraph that the Bill must be enacted before the Christmas Recess as otherwise CIE could run short <Col N="573" /> of cash before the end of January.  The only welcome statements by the Minister this morning are that the Government are seriously perturbed about the financial position of CIE and that a special committee has been set up by the Minister to undertake a short term and a long term investigation into the whole financial structure of CIE.</P>
      <P>I have stated at Question Time on a number of occasions over recent months that it appears to be an extraordinary situation that exactly 12 months ago the Minister introduced a Transport Bill, the main purpose of which was to make provision for the State subvention to CIE over the next five years and now CIE find themselves in an unprecedented serious financial position.  The Minister has attempted to pinpoint some of the reasons for this extraordinary state of the finances of CIE.  He has listed wages and said that the 12th round settlement cost CIE £5 million.  He said that other costs have also increased such as charges for materials and services, financial charges and depreciation provisions.</P>
      <P>No indication was given by the Minister a year ago that CIE were heading for trouble.  Despite what the Minister says about it being impossible last December to forecast what the outcome of the 12th round negotiations would be, I do not accept that at all. Surely when the Minister was preparing a Bill to be introduced into this House making provision for the next five years, he must have been aware that the financial situation was not good and that CIE were heading for difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times I accused the Minister of having misled the House in December, 1969.  I want to make this quite clear.  The Minister cannot expect, any more than CIE can expect, that he can come in here as often as he likes and seek £X million, and that Dáil Éireann will give unqualified approval to this.  In the circumstances of this particular measure, and in view of the very serious situation in which CIE find themselves, I want to warn the Minister that this kind of stop-gap legislation, this type of stop-gap financial provisioning <Col N="574" /> for CIE will not be tolerated any further.  The Minister has now given an undertaking in public that a fully comprehensive investigation will be initiated into the affairs of CIE.  I accept that as being bona fide but I will expect that this investigation will be thorough and comprehensive and that it will pinpoint the difficulties and put forward the remedies.</P>
    <P>I have said on a number of occasions that it is the opinion of my party that there is an urgent need for the introduction in Parliament of some method or system of public accountability in relation to the State companies.  We do not know&mdash;we have no way of knowing; in fact, the Minister seems to be at sea and is himself not too sure&mdash;what has gone wrong with CIE.  He gave some obvious reasons such as wages and costs of materials and so forth, but I believe the problem in CIE that has come to light in recent months goes much deeper than the question of wages or the question of increased cost of materials.</P>
    <P>I believe there must be a number of serious defects in the whole management structure of CIE.  I do not say that lightly.  In the past I have complimented the board and the management of CIE but, confronted with the situation that has arisen in the past 12 months, and faced with having to provide a fire brigade action for CIE by providing £3 million, one cannot but suspect that there is something seriously wrong.  I regret to say this but from inquiries I have made, questions I have asked and observations I have made, I am becoming increasingly suspicious about the effectiveness of the management structure of CIE.  To put it bluntly, I am convinced that there are far too many managers.  There are area managers and district managers and God alone knows what different types of managers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cost of the 12th round settlement as being £5 million.  He seemed in his statement &mdash;and this has been the common practice not merely of the present Minister but of previous Ministers&mdash;to lay the blame for any financial difficulties in which CIE find themselves on the question of wages and by implication on <Col N="575" /> the workers having being unreasonable in their demands.</P>
    <P>A few months ago I went to the trouble of having compiled a complete breakdown of the wage rates paid to the different categories of workers in CIE.  When one compares the different scales for engine drivers and various operators one finds that these wage rates do not even compare favourably with the average wage rates in manufacturing industry.  I do not intend to go into too much detail on this because we cannot do so until the investigation which the Minister says he will undertake is completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Dublin bus fares and said there has been a continuing decline in the number of passengers using the Dublin city services. Of course there must have been, when one realises that since 1965 Dublin bus fares have shown an increase of 110 per cent.  Bus fares have grown four times as fast as the cost of living and twice as fast as wages and salaries.  In June this year we had a 7 per cent increase and again in October we had a 17½ per cent increase. Continuously increasing fares is not the correct approach.  I believe there is another approach to the whole matter, that is, by imaginative and proper planning and the introduction of special incentives to encourage people to use public transport.  The situation in relation to the Dublin city services is also very serious.  It is just one aspect of the whole problem.</P>
    <P>To put it in a nutshell in the 12 months which have elapsed since the Minister introduced his five-year plan for CIE, we have had two increases in fares, one in June and the other a few months ago which, taken <i>in toto</i> so to speak, represent an outrageous increase.  My opinion is that these increases were unjustifiable.  They have imposed an intolerable burden particularly on the workers who utilise public transport to get to and from their work.</P>
    <P>The fact that CIE are now so much in the red reflects very badly on the whole set-up in CIE.  Apart from the increases in fares, more recently another even more serious situation <Col N="576" /> came to light when we learned that CIE have placed a £2½ million contract for the manufacture of locomotive wagons or rail-passenger wagons in Britain.  Whatever about the financial affairs of CIE, this will have to be examined and the Minister has undertaken to do so.  To me the placing of this £2½ million contract is a fair indication of gross mismanagement on the part of CIE.  In 1961 or 1962, we had redundancy in the locomotive works and the wagon shops in Limerick.  The Minister was unfortunately engaged, as I was, in western parts of the country last week when I tabled a question on this matter. Deputy Childers stood in for the Minister and the reply was unsatisfactory. Surely CIE, with all the expertise it is supposed to have in its top management and area management&mdash;economists, statisticians and all the others&mdash; should have been able to forecast the needs of CIE for rolling stock and surely the company should have taken steps to ensure that it had an adequate supply of skilled workers?</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that one of our major State companies has placed an order outside this country for the manufacture of wagons which could have been manufactured at home. Surely this is a contradiction not merely of company policy but of the whole Government approach to the provision and generation of employment at home?  I am satisfied, and I have examined the evidence of both sides as far as it has been available to me, that this £2½ million contract need never have been placed abroad, it should never have been placed abroad and I challenge the Minister to contradict what I have just said.</P>
    <P>There has been in the Inchicore Works and also in the Limerick wagon works an outstanding tradition and inherited skills in the manufacture of railway wagons.  I do not know what the future intention is but I certainly do not think this situation should be allowed to recur.  I understand discussions are now taking place.  I sincerely hope the outcome of these discussions will be satisfactory.  The plain fact is that the placing of this contract abroad reflects no credit on CIE and, speaking for myself, it has totally undermined <Col N="577" /> my confidence in and the high regard I had for CIE and which I publicly expressed in this House on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>While this Bill did not really permit the Minister to make a comprehensive statement on the affairs of CIE there were a number of matters to which he might have referred.  However, a joint committee for the purpose of identifying possible corrective measures is now under way I understand and the Minister says :</P>
    <P>A report on this aspect of the matter should be available early in the financial year 1971-72 and we will then be in a better position to decide what should be done about ClE's losses in that year. </P>
    <P>I take it then that this report is expected in April, May or June and that the House will have an opportunity of discussing this report in conjunction with the annual Estimate or otherwise. May I take it from the Minister that we will have an opportunity of discussing this report?</P>

      <P>This news certainly comes as a great shock to me.  There is no question of our opposing this Bill. I do not mind admitting that I was not quite clear when I saw this £2.98 million.  I thought at first it was in substitution for the £2.65 million the Minister put in no further back than last year.  This is the most surprising thing about the Minister's speech.  He made an order on 31st December, 1969, and indeed we had a somewhat similar Bill to this last year but a very much less onerous proposition.  I will not let the blame lie solely with the Minister and his Department.  It goes back to what we have been saying from this side of the House about the Government&mdash;that the Government are really not attending to their work. They have been tied up in all kinds of other matters during the past 12 months and this is an example which bears that out conclusively.  It is an appalling state of affairs, after all we heard from the Fianna Fáil Party in the late 1950s about what they would do in relation to transport, that in effect all they did was to dam up the waters and suddenly they flowed over the land and it is a super flood.  I want to make a specific point.  The Minister is not quite consistent.  He says:</P>
      <P>The present Bill is an ad hoc measure to deal with ClE's financial difficulties during the current financial year. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is correct, but the Minister makes certain calculations in relation to the coming year which do not take into account factors which the Minister and his Department must know are already in the economic system.  For example, there is no provision in these figures that he details in his speech for the inevitable increase in wages next year.  It is an appalling position.  There are many things one could say on this matter but I shall refer only to two major points.  Once more, apparently <Col N="579" /> the Government are reconsidering the study in depth regarding the various alternatives to existing policy in relation to the railways.  The present Government reduced the rail mileage by approximately one-half.  I do not know what more can be done in that connection which, so far as I can see, is the only way in which to cut railway expenditure.</P>
    <P>However, what is devastating about this matter is that in the late 'fifties, when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition for a short time, they shouted from the roof tops about subsidies to CIE although most of the subsidies were for modernising the capital equipment of CIE.  For many years afterwards the Dublin road passenger services paid their way by a substantial margin and showed a profit of £500,000.  The Minister has stated that the net profit on the Dublin city services was only £61,000 in 1969-70 on a turn-over of £7.7 million.  In my opinion one reason the Dublin road passenger services paid their way was that the bus drivers then were among the worst paid workers in the city, having regard to their onerous job.  I am referring to the period 1963-65.  The profit made by CIE can be attributed to the very poor wages paid to the drivers.</P>
    <P>During that period bus fares were quite reasonable.  This morning, appropriately for me in view of this discussion, I travelled by bus from Rathgar.  I met a student whom I had known and we travelled together.  In both cases we boarded the bus at Rathgar Church and got off the bus at Grafton Street.  The student told me that had he gone to the next stage the fare would have been 1s 5d instead of the 1s fare to Grafton Street.  There was much talk in the past about an increase of 1d in the bus fare for one stage but we now have the situation where an extra stage costs 5d.  Students travelling to Belfield pay 1s from Marlborough Road.  In pre-war times it was possible to travel from the Nelson Pillar to Marlborough Road by tram for 2d&mdash;a longer distance than Marlborough Road to Belfield.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fare is six times what it cost in pre-war days. The most profitable part of ClE's operations is reaching a stage where it is putting itself out of business.  The Minister has mentioned the reduced passenger numbers.  Whatever losses there may have been in the last few years will be nothing in comparison to the reductions in the next six months. People who have no option but to use this service will keep a close eye on fares and stages and the receipts of the road passenger services in Dublin will drop substantially.  I think the Minister shares my view.  If the situation arises that it costs an extra 5d for a distance of 200 or 300 yards, people will opt to travel the shorter stage by bus and walk the extra distance.  The extra fares may not matter to some people but the increased cost is bound to hit very many people, especially if they must undertake a journey twice each day.</P>
      <P>In this connection one is very sorry for elderly workers who must use the bus services to get to work because they cannot afford a small car.  However, I have heard that there is greater use of small cars around the city and this aggravates the traffic problem.  The Minister has pointed out that this problem increases the costs of CIE.</P>
      <P>I wish to revert to the more serious matter of miscalculation of estimates. I am giving the Minister credit that in this case it was a genuine miscalculation and that it was not a case that he deliberately back-pedalled 12 months ago, knowing that he was going to run into this trouble.  The Minister might have had an idea at the back of his mind that they would be £500,000 out and that he would introduce the same kind of supplementary estimate this year as last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Estimates did not include any provision for the 12th round increase in salaries and wages.  However, the 12th round was well on its way a year ago.  It is astounding that on 31st December, 1969, the Minister should make an order which he had hoped would last for five years.  This was the system in the past and it worked reasonably well. The Minister stated that CIE have a <Col N="581" /> statutory obligation to break even. This is true under section 14 or 15 of the Road Transport Act, 1949.  This was when the famous phrase &ldquo;taking one year with another, it shall pay its way&rdquo; was coined.  There was almost identical wording used regarding the nationalisation of the British Railways and the coal industry.  It was a piece of goodwill rather than a reality so far as this country was concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister said :</P>
    <P>CIE have a statutory obligation to break even, taking one year with another, with the aid of the annual grant and the revised grant of £2.65 million was regarded as a realistic estimate of the minimum subsidy with which CIE could get by, during the five year period ending 31st March, 1974. </P>
    <P>It is appalling that the estimates were more than 100 per cent out.  Perhaps I am unduly optimistic about what can be done with estimates.  I have had much experience in the preparation of estimates.  I remember dealing with 14 in one year.</P>
    <P>This really is an appalling result.  It is true that CIE have a very big staff; they employ some 20,000 workers; but CIE are not the only transport system with a very big staff.  As one secretary of the post office put it, the post office is in fact a transport organisation. There again we are back to 20,000 and odd workers and we have the 80,000 workers mentioned here who are employed by private transport of one sort and another, either those employed by firms or those people who are themselves engaged in road freight services.</P>
    <P>Transport then is a manpower consuming form of activity and if you do not make provision for the inevitable increases that will come you are not going to be correct.  I do not think that the Minister's figures in this regard are likely to be correct.  He says :</P>
    <P>Even with the two increases in fares and rates in June and October, 1970, which will bring in additional revenue to CIE estimated at £3.5 million in the current financial year and £6.6 million in 1971-72, CIE's net deficits in 1970-71 and 1971-72 <Col N="582" /> will amount to £5.63 million and £4.79 million respectively. </P>
    <P>Unless the Minister has made provision in those figures for an increase in wages next year&mdash;the Minister has not?</P>

      <P>Now I want to come to a suggestion made by the Minister and this relates to something which the Government go in for in a big way.  He said &ldquo;I have agreed that the committee should enlist the aid of consultants in their task.&rdquo;  The Minister may obtain a suitable firm of consultants in regard to this problem but the Government have employed firms of consultants in regard to problems about which those firms could know nothing.  As we know, the Devlin Committee paid £100,000 to an American firm and they might as well have thrown their money into the Irish Sea. I think that was the expression I used before.  How can you expect a firm of consultants to come over here to deal with this problem?  It is possible for the Minister to get people with a knowledge of railway economics, if we say that that is where the major difficulty lies.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's word on that.  This business of bringing in consultants to deal with this, that and the other thing, reminds me somewhat of some famous politicians. I am not going to name them but it will be possible to identify them.  There was one famous politician who thought he had solved a problem by making a rotund oratorical phrase about the matter.  There was another famous politician who thought he had solved a problem when he established a company to deal with the matter.  The Minister may be able to identify these two politicians without difficulty.  However, this was not true and neither is it true that you can solve these kinds of problems by bringing in industrial consultants.  All it does is to add to the Government's difficulty, add to inflation, because you will have the Government getting the banks to create more credit for them to pay these people.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must have a fair idea of the problem and he will be aware of the options before you employ them.  That is true.  The Deputy knows the unpleasant nature of the option in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do.  I want now to refer to two other matters. One is that some time ago an opportunity existed for CIE to make a substantial profit in relation to an operation which they could have carried out.  This was at the time when, following the large scale close-down of railways throughout the country, the line from Harcourt Street to Bray was closed.  The road which it was proposed to build from Dublin to Bray was not built but here was an ideal opportunity for the creation of a toll road from Dublin to Bray.  It would have been a money spinner of the first order and it could have been done quite easily just as a similar thing was done in at least a couple of German cities.  The bridge at Milltown was only wide enough to take one track but despite that there was quite a simple solution&mdash;have the traffic running in from Bray in the <Col N="584" /> morning up to 2 p.m. and have it running from Dublin to Bray from 2 p.m.  It would have been a real money spinner because anybody would have been prepared to pay 1s or 2s to get on to that road.</P>
      <P>However, CIE in a great hurry sold the bridge at the end of Adelaide Road and then they sold bits and pieces of the land.  Now I see that the matter has cropped up again and the suggestion has been made that they buy back these bits and pieces because this is a genuine necessity and it has been such for many years.  Deputy O'Donnell said, and I accept his word for this although I do not know it of my own knowledge, that CIE have a very highly-geared staff.  I must say that this operation did not show very astute planning or that much thought was given to the problem at that time. Of course other suggestions were made to the effect that they were anxious to make a capital profit by selling the land near Milltown for housing purposes. From a social point of view there was no comparison between that and selling off these bits and pieces of railroad.  Both from a social point of view and an economic point of view it would have been ideal if CIE had just taken up the tracks and put a skin on the railroad because then you would have had a good road with an excellent foundation.  Everybody knows that there is no better foundation for a road than the bed of a railroad.</P>
      <P>One other matter which was referred to by Deputy O'Donnell and which has caused a great deal of perturbation was the placing abroad of a contract for rolling stock to the value of £2½ million.  I have heard no suggestion from anybody that this job could not have been done at home.  It has been said that whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.  I get the impression that the Government do not seem to have been able to think out any problem fully over the last 12 months.  We had the example of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara who spent £500,000 on boats made in France. Indeed, I believe they are by no means good.  There were at least a couple of boat-building yards in this country which could have filled that contract quite efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The way I look at these problems is that in this country we do not have many opportunities for what would be called semi-heavy industries&mdash;certainly it is not light industry&mdash;and we ought to avail of any opportunity to get people employed in them.</P>
    <P>There are men in the railway yards here in various parts of the country, at Kingsbridge, at Dundalk and at Limerick, who have long experience of this kind of work and who could have done the job.  I am not &ldquo;with&rdquo; this kind of thing.  When a contract of that size is involved, the matter is primarily one for judgment and the ultimate judgment must be given by the Government.  Of course, we must not forget that current Government expenditure is almost £500 million this year.  I notice from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the figure for last year was £383 million whereas this year we are told by the Minister for Finance that the amount is £491 million.  The Government complain about the difficulties that are created for them by way of wage increases while their own expenditure is up by almost 30 per cent in one year.</P>
    <P>The House has no option but to support this Bill so that a major social service might be kept going.  However, I would have had more respect for the Minister had he come in this morning and said &ldquo;I am trying to provide at least for this year and next year&rdquo; instead of saying that the present Bill is an <i>ad hoc</i> measure to deal with CIE's financial difficulties during the current year.  It is evident that the Minister's Department are not a planning Department at all.  I have been accused of not believing in planning but I certainly believe in making provision for the following year.  I believe also in various other forms of planning. There is no use in the Minister coming in here in the ninth month of a year seeking moneys to cover the 12 months. That is not proper estimating and neither is it a proper method of approach.  I am not inclined to lay the blame unduly on the Minister and on his Department because the Government <Col N="586" /> as a whole must bear a good deal of the blame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have been somewhat naive about this Transport Bill.  If we look back to the basic principles on which CIE were established, we must realise that they were never intended to pay their way; that they were meant always to be subsidised in one way or another.  It is inevitable that a firm such as CIE should be subsidised from the Exchequer. Personally, I have qualms about the utilisation of particular subsidies which CIE are receiving.  I have certain reservations, but it would be grossly unfair for the Minister, or even for CIE, to contemplate the imposition of further extravagant increases in fares in order to offset the deficit in the company's financial position.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Donovan said about certain congested traffic areas.  The burden of fares does not bear very heavily on those in the higher income bracket, because most of these people do not use public transport, but it bears most on old people and on people in the middle class sector.  These are the people about whom I have spoken here on numerous occasions.  On each occasion CIE decided to increase fares, it was these people who suffered most.  These are the people who cannot afford the luxury of a car or of any transport other than public transport.  It is logical to believe that for many years to come CIE will have to be subsidised to a large extent, possibly to a larger extent than is the case at present because of the particular operations of the company.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I must say in support of the company that no private concern would be capable of operating the type of service they operate.  No private concern would be capable of operating a service with the regularity of the CIE service.  Granted, there are deficiencies here and there, but we must admit the service operates in a reasonably effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now we were always led to believe the city bus services were subsidising the rural services.  The city bus services show a profit.  Admittedly it is <Col N="587" /> not a large profit, but the fact that there is profit is good especially when we remember the problems associated with city transport, particularly traffic congestion.  Any evening between 4.50 p.m. and 6.10 p.m. one can see cross-city buses being stopped in the city for a period of 20 or 40 minutes. This is indicative of bad planning on the part of the Departments concerned. The Minister for Transport and Power, in co-operation with the Minister for Local Government, must consider what is to be done about relieving congestion in Dublin city.  We have no indication of what is being done to alleviate the problem to ensure that people on their way to or from work would not be delayed for up to three-quarters of an hour.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a ring road be built around the city.  I suggest that if the railways are CIE's main problem, as they obviously are, we should prevent cars from coming into the city centre, provide parking for them on the outskirts and use either bus or train for the remainder of the journey.  If that should be considered to be unsatisfactory, I would suggest that we use the present railways as a type of ring road.  This can be done.  If one studies the type of railway system we have, one will realise that there would be no obstacle to using the railways in this manner. It could be done in conjunction with some use of private roads.  This would relieve traffic congestion-the congestion that is becoming greater day by day and which is causing so much concern to those people who must travel across the city every day at peak hours.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to the order that CIE placed abroad. This was disgraceful.  We are today voting a subsidy for CIE.  The order was placed abroad, not particularly at the behest of CIE, and I think the trade unions merit a considerable amount of criticism here.  A person appeared on television to explain the trade union position, but I felt he was unable to account for the position in which the trade union found themselves. Again I do not want to place the blame solely on them, because we <Col N="588" /> knew quite well at least two years ago that these carriages were required.  If we did know and if we also knew there was a shortage of labour, did we do anything specific about it?  We should have formulated some plan at that time to train unskilled people, and the trade union should have co-operated in accepting these people who would be responsible for and capable of carrying out the duties of coach builders.  It is disgraceful that such a large amount of money should be sent abroad when we are preaching here daily that as much capital as possible should be kept within the country.</P>
    <P>There was another example of this in relation to Dublin Airport when the curtains for the Boeings were found to have been made in Britain.  I brought this state of affairs to the notice of the Minister and the reply at that time was that nobody in Ireland tendered low enough for them.  That is all right if we want to accept the principle that Irish companies, having to import raw materials in certain cases, should be made to compete with all foreign industries, but I believe we should keep as much work as possible in the country and help to keep our workers at home.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have all these matters reconsidered at Government level.  We should not allow ourselves to be led by civil servants or people employed in the upper echelons of CIE into believing that the decision was necessary because we have not got the facilities available here.  They could be made available. We did it before when it was even more necessary.  We did it when Mr. Seen Lemass advocated the raising of productivity in industry.  There is no reason why, in the technical world in which we live today, something similar could not be achieved which would enable this work to be done at home. This is preferable to allowing money to be extracted from the Exchequer to subsidise people in England who would be living softly at the expense of our own people.  Whoever is responsible for this decision should take steps to reverse it so that there would be no necessity to send these orders abroad.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about <Col N="589" /> the road haulage section of CIE which we are obviously subsidising here.  The road freight section of CIE could be criticised for the decision to ask outside hauliers to quote for particular types of work, country work, if they are licensed hauliers, and local work, if not, and then paying them 4s to 5s per ton less or else they will not get the work.  We have had experience of CIE paying at the rate of 12s, 15s and even up to £1 a ton less on a particular run to Sligo.  If CIE can do this and then come into this House and ask us to subsidise them, there is no way in which the ordinary citizen can be convinced that there is a proper managerial system in operation.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, the Government are gravely disturbed by the board's progressively deteriorating financial position. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is natural, but it is only right and proper that some outside person who knows the working of private concerns should be injected into CIE, and that this idea that the Government can advocate at any time that subsidies will be there and will be made available to CIE if they have a financial loss, will be done away with.  It is the Minister's duty and that of his Department to safeguard the interest of the taxpayer, and I would ask him fervently to take a stem look at the individuals in CIE, those in the upper echelons who are earning good salaries and getting handsome increases from time to time; some of them are very competent, but most of them are not fulfilling the role they have been asked to take and are living for the day when they will retire on a large pension, although CIE will still have a substantial loss.  People in private concerns should be brought into CIE with the aim of making this section pay and CIE as a <Col N="590" /> whole pay, so that not alone will the city bus services pay their way but that the rural bus services will at least break even.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister gives me an undertaking that he himself will investigate these individuals, as I know he is capable of doing, I personally will be happy and will have no reluctance whatsoever in advocating that a maximum sum of £2.98 million be allocated towards the additional subsidisation of CIE.  I have no hesitation in saying that unless progressive methods are employed by CIE further subsidies will be required in the future because no effort is being made in CIE to make it pay.  As I said at the outset I realise CIE was never meant to pay.  I have some reservations about how this £2.98 million will be used and I would ask the Minister to investigate.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the House yesterday that consultants have been employed to make a study of what is to be done about the railway section of CIE.  I am sure these consultants are very honourable people.  We have had experience of consultants in other State bodies and the majority of State bodies responded progressively to the suggestions and advice given by these consultants and I am sure CIE will do the same.  The last time they were called in to make a study of CIE the consultants had to be kicked out because their time and motion study was on themselves rather than on the workers in CIE.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that CIE have a very efficient staff and although I know there are some very efficient people in CIE I would not say the staff are 100 per cent efficient.  I do not make these comments in a derogatory fashion but I feel CIE needs waking up and it is the responsibility of the Minister to do this.</P>

      <P>The Minister is looking for a subsidy to keep the wheels of CIE moving.  Before we hand over sums of money like this we are entitled to criticise and question aspects <Col N="591" /> of CIE.  Increased labour costs have been blamed for the increases, but why are labour costs up?  Is it not due to increases in the cost of living?  I believe this is what has led to these demands.</P>
      <P>CIE have increased their fares, but they are pricing themselves out of existence.  One cannot drive along any road without seeing someone thumbing a lift.  The vast majority of people simply cannot afford to travel by CIE. A sizeable number of people are employed in CIE but CIE could operate with half the number of top executives, the people earning big money, who are given State cars to come and go to work.  I have seen these State cars used on an election day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know Ministers blatantly do that but they do not put posters on the cars as happens to CIE cars.  We have taken the names of the gentlemen concerned, if not the registration numbers.</P>
      <P>Traffic congestion has been given as a reason for losses incurred by CIE. The Minister should look into the possibility of staggering business hours.  It is not an impossible task and it would ease congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are rumblings about the proposed closing of railway lines in the west.  It is not the first time that railway lines in the west have been closed. One of the first things Fianna Fáil did when they got back into power was to close the Clifden-Galway line.  This was a very retrograde step because the <Col N="592" /> amount of tourist traffic in that area in the summer would more than justify the line being kept open.  Tourism is the greatest money spinner in the west and if the Clifden-Galway line had been retained it would have more than paid for itself.  There is another aspect which will affect CIE&mdash;I do not know whether the Chair will rule me out of order for mentioning this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the Government crisis which has threatened and frightened people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the reasons why traffic has not been as good as it should have been.  It is all very well for the Minister to smile and laugh but many a hotelier in the west of Ireland will not laugh like that. Now we have the threat of the barbed wire going up and the opening of internment camps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>But unfortunately they will be empty on the return journey. The point I am trying to make is that I do not want tourists, who will help the wheels of CIE to keep turning, to be frightened about coming here.</P>
      <P>If there is to be any cutting back in CIE it should be at the top.  It is not right to look at the workers and say that the money is being eaten up by them.  I was sorry to hear one speaker say that CIE was never meant to pay. Is that the thinking at Government level?  It is very poor thinking on the part of the Government if that is their attitude</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the wheels of CIE must be kept moving we must ensure that there is no choke-up along the line.  Losses are incurred on city services because of traffic congestion but if business hours <Col N="593" /> could be staggered CIE would not lose money because of this congestion.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would look into the matters I have mentioned especially the position with regard to staff cars and the gentlemen who sit in swivel chairs and eat up a great deal of the money.</P>

      <P>This is a statement of fact.  The position was that the Taoiseach through you.  Sir, requested the Whips to meet to see if it would be possible to arrive at an agreement whereby we would have a discussion on the internment proposal tomorrow and we could not arrive at agreement because the only way in which they were prepared to have that discussion was if we would curtail our opposition to the Prices and Incomes Bill.  That meeting was definitely concluded.  With regard to what business we will discuss next week, or tomorrow, that has not yet concluded.  What the Taoiseach referred to has concluded.  It is regrettable that the Taoiseach, as Leader of the Government, will have to bear a very large measure of responsibility for whatever repercussions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Before the House decided this morning on this procedure of the Whips discussing the matter and referring it to the Taoiseach for his approval, surely we made it very clear it would be impossible for us to agree that all Stages of a certain Bill would be taken in a certain time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not both improper and unfair to put to the Opposition the proposition that they must curtail a debate that otherwise would not be curtailed in order to discuss the internment issue?  We accept that if we take up time on this issue then the Taoiseach should be given the same amount of time so that the debate will not be curtailed, but that does not satisfy him.  What he is seeking is not only that we will curtail the debate in time but give an additional guarantee that we will include the debate on a certain measure.  Will he not get his Whip to discuss with the other Whips an arrangement under which extra time will be given to the debate on the Prices and Incomes Bill without our having to agree to something to which we cannot agree and the Taoiseach knows we cannot agree to it?</P>

If that statement on last Friday had never been made we would have gone to the other parties in any event to seek an arrangement to conclude all the legislative business before the Christmas Recess.  That is something which is always done at this time of the year.  Let us have less of this concession. Their suggestion of an extra few hours is no concession so far as I am concerned.

Is the Taoiseach submitting to the House that there existed a state of national extremity whereby there was a state of war, whereby the life of the nation or a public emergency was threatened and therefore he was obliged to communicate on 4th December, 1970, this particular notification to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, that the situation was of such extreme urgency that he could only do so without consulting Parliament or Opposition leaders and without clarifying to the nation what precisely this rumpus is all about?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement <Col N="607" /> on (i) the present condition of unit 3, St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin, (ii) the proposals submitted to his Department by the Dublin Health Authority and (iii) when it is expected that these proposals will be implemented.</P>

      <P>Unit 3 is the only building not of recent construction in the St. Kevin's Hospital complex which was not included in the general reconstruction programme which took place in the 1950s.  The building was surveyed by an architect in April, 1969, who reported that its condition was such that it would not be feasible to bring it up to modern hospital standards.  As an immediate measure to improve conditions in the building, the Dublin Health Authority have undertaken to reduce the number of patients being accommodated and to use some of the space vacated to provide improved facilities for the remaining patients and staff.  About 70 patients have so far been transferred from Unit 3 to alternative accommodation.  I understand that proposals will shortly be submitted by the health authority for arrangements which would enable a further reduction to be made in the number of patients in Unit 3.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the architect's report, the health authority proposed that steps be taken, which would include the erection of a new hospital building, to enable all patients to be transferred from Unit 3.  As the Deputy will be aware, arrangements for the establishment of a corporate body, involving the Dublin Health Authority and the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals, to take over the operation and further development of St. Kevin's Hospital are well advanced.  It is intended that under the auspices of this body, a modern, general teaching hospital will be developed at St. Kevin's. It would be unwise to embark on any large scale building works at St. Kevin's pending the establishment of the new body.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we are in a most unsatisfactory position when the House has to depend for information about the line taken by its own negotiators and others upon reports of this kind and indeed not even on these reports but upon these reports as relayed by Opposition spokesmen?  Would the Minister not agree that we should be <Col N="610" /> properly and fully informed?  To say that these things are confidential is nonsense since they are published&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not nonsense.  The Deputy is now repeating what he did recently in public : making a totally irresponsible statement about a very serious negotiating position.  The memorandum we presented and the statement we made on fisheries have now become conference documents and, as such, are confidential.  This is a fact.  That the Deputy says it is not, does not change that fact.  The Deputy is working on leakages.  I was quite disappointed about his attitude to the negotiations when he made such a firm public statement on a leakage as he did recently.  As far as the House is concerned, I can say that at every meeting so far we have brought forward the question of fisheries as it affects us.  I suppose I could brief the Deputy on what we presented but I can assure the House that our position in relation to the depletion of stocks and exclusive access to our present fishery areas for inshore fishermen have been brought forward on each occasion.  Our study of the marketing effect of the regulations does not, as yet, show any problems for Ireland, but we have achieved in negotiation a position where we are having discussions on technical matters with technical experts of the Community on the regulations. If we see in the final regulation, when it is implemented, the possibility of problems for our fishermen then we will have discussions with the Community.  This is the same arrangement which has been negotiated for other countries.  I do not know how to deal at each step of the negotiations with Opposition Deputies who are prepared to make statements on facts not well founded.  These are confidential documents.  We are in serious negotiation. I certainly would be prepared to talk to any Deputy who is willing to treat them on a confidential basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate matter.  The problem we face is that accounts have been given of the Irish Norwegian and British negotiating positions.  These have not been denied I or qualified in any way by the Government. <Col N="611" /> I want to ask the Minister whether the impression given by those reports that the Irish position as stated is merely one of explaining the difficulties and not of proposing solutions or answers in contrast to the apparent Norwegian and British position is a true impression or have we put forward, as the Norwegians have done, specific proposals or specific objections to the EEC policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically we have achieved to date the same as the Norwegians, the right to consult on technical matters with technical experts, the right to discuss the effects of the application of the regulation on our fisheries.  This is basically what the Norwegians have achieved.  Again, I would say that this is a negotiating position.  If at any time to protect our position in the negotiations I have to stay silent and allow those leaks and Opposition statements to get legs under them, there is nothing I can do about it.  The negotiations are the important part.</P>

      <P>The delay in restoring pension in this case was due to a most unusual and unfortunate series of errors which resulted in the relevant papers being twice mislaid, the second time being subsequent to receipt of the Deputy's representations in the matter. The pension has now been restored with retrospective effect as from the 6th March, 1970.  The delay which occurred in the handling of this application is regretted.</P>

It was due to ignorance on her part that she did not know she could apply from here.  She feels she is being discriminated against by virtue of the fact that she is one of a minority religion, and cannot get this pension. She lived here all her life in Cavan and she is entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to a report that a charitable organisation had spent over a quarter of a million pounds in Dublin in the past year helping people in need; if he will state the amount by way of home assistance provided in Dublin in the same period; and if in the light of this information he proposes to take further measures to eliminate poverty in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report which I take to be the one to which the Deputy refers.  The amount included in the current year's estimates of the Dublin Health Authority for home assistance is £438,000.  I may say that the estimates for my own Department for the current year include more than £47 million for social assistance, an increase as compared with the previous year of nearly £4 million.  A large part of this will, of course, be expended in Dublin.  These figures do not take into account the increases which came into operation in August last and for which supplementary provision will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that as was announced in the Third Programme, I am having a fundamental examination made of the <Col N="623" /> social assistance scheme&mdash;including home assistance&mdash;with a view to determining what further reforms and improvements might be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is the policy of the Civil Service that widows formerly in State employment can be reinstated in the grade in which they were employed before marriage, but that deserted wives can be reinstated only on a temporary basis, to their considerable loss in both security and remuneration; if so, why, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory authority exists for the reinstatement in their formers posts of widows who were civil servants before marriage.  There is no authority for such reinstatement of deformer posts of widows who were civil servants.  It has, however, been the practice, notwithstanding the general <Col N="638" /> policy on the employment of married women in the Civil Service, to employ deserted wives in a temporary capacity where the circumstances so warrant.</P>
      <P>The wider question of employing married women in the public service falls within the scope of the Commission on the Status of Women whose report on this matter is awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I recently brought to the notice of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the case of a person who had a judicial separation from her husband and who did not receive any income from him?  This woman had been employed for 18 years on a temporary basis at a salary that was £6 per week less than that paid to widows in the same employment.  Does the Minister regard this as fair and proper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be too happy with that situation but I should like to tell the Deputy that this matter has been examined in my Department. I have accepted in principle that those women should be re-employed in an unestablished capacity in the grade in which they served before marriage and on the salary terms which would apply if they were widows.  To give effect to this it is necessary for the Civil Service Commission to make appropriate exclusion orders and the commission have been communicated with on this point. I am hopeful that the matter will be settled up on that basis shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Bank of Ireland that no records were mislaid as suggested by the Deputy. Grants of probate and administration were required to be produced twice in a number of cases because in the first instance they were received in the Bank of Ireland, College Green, during the closure of the banks when they could not be registered.  To avoid delay in the further administering of estates they were returned to the senders with a covering letter explaining the circumstances. On resumption of normal the upper flat areas around this produced again for registration purposes.</P>

These are being examined.  As I mentioned, there are quite a number of interests involved and an effort is being made to co-ordinate those interests.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the upper region of the river Boyne which has been maintained by a joint drainage board for the past 33 years has not been cleared of weeds <i>et cetera,</i> this year, with the result that the upper flat area around this portion of the river is suffering from heavy flooding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass) Noel T. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the existing drainage district of the Blackwater.  The drainage works of that District are included in the Boyne drainage scheme and were entered on in pursuance of that scheme last June. Thereupon, in accordance with the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the drainage district ceased to exist and the duties of the joint drainage committee of Counties Meath and Kildare ended. The works on that portion of the river under the Boyne drainage scheme are proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that as it is unlikely that that portion of the Boyne will benefit from the arterial drainage for three or four years it is most unfair to allow the river to be filled up completely with weeds because the ordinary maintenance which normally was carried out every year is not now being carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the Arterial Drainage Act for the maintenance of such drainage districts in the interval between entry of the district and the completion of the work on the drainage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but <Col N="641" /> would the Parliamentary Secretary not be able to arrange that the staff who are carrying out drainage work further down the river would clear the bigger weeds from that portion of the river? They do not require any special arrangement to do that&mdash;I understand it can be done.  Would he not even do that if there is no other way because otherwise there will be very severe losses in the area from flooding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that under section 8 of the Drainage Act, 1945, there is no statutory authority to do so, but in case the Deputy is worried about the people who are employed by the joint committee, they have been employed by the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the staff carrying out the drainage on that river have the right to do anything they think necessary for the opening of the river, and therefore could he not consult the people in charge and see if there is a possibility of cleaning that particular stretch of the river so that local farmers will be able to use the land this winter and next winter?</P>

      <P>However, as a result of another recommendation by this committee, a nursery unit was established in Cork in September 1968 and are since then operating in a very satisfactory manner.

Is he aware that in other western European countries there is a standard text-book in each language, in Latin, Greek, French and German, going right through the literature, and that in every state of the United States there is a similar standard text-book in English literature which covers the subject from Anglo-Saxon up to modern times?

      <P>The close seasons for salmon fishing are so prescribed as to have regard to the observed habits of the fish which run into different river systems at different times and spend varying periods in attaining the state of maturity at which they finally ascend to the upper waters to spawn.  I would not consider changing the season for any river system except on the basis of being satisfied that a change had been shown to be desirable in the interests of the fisheries in the river system as a whole.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal for an interim increase in wages for their fishery protection staff was received in my Department from Drogheda Board of Fishery Conservators at a time when negotiations for a settlement on rates for boards generally were impending. Negotiations previously conducted in the Labour Court at conciliation level had resulted in common wage rates being adopted for the staffs of all boards, including those of the Drogheda Board.  It was therefore considered advisable to await the outcome of the negotiations already referred to so that uniformity of resulting wage levels might be maintained.

      <P>(i)  aids to encourage the establishment and to facilitate the functioning of these organisations; the Regulation limits the period during which these aids may be given to three years and also limits the amount of the aid to a sum not exceeding 3 per cent in the first year, 2 per cent in the second year and 1 per cent in the third year of the value of the marketed produce covered by the action of the producers' organisations; also these aids must not exceed 60 per cent, 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively of the management expenses of the producers' organisations;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  aids in the form of special loans to cover part of the estimated <Col N="661" /> charges arising on market intervention activities of these organisations; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  financial compensation in respect of the cost of intervention purchases made by these organisations; the Regulation sets upper limits to the amount of this compensation. </P>
    <P>The basic Regulation states that the Council of Ministers are to adopt the general conditions and rules governing the application of the first two categories of aids to which I have referred and my information is that this has not yet been done.  As regards the third category of aid, i.e., financial compensation in respect of intervention purchases, the methods of application of this are to be adopted by the EEC Management Committee for Fishery Products.  I am arranging to have an unofficial translation by my Department of the basic Regulation placed in the Library of the House for the information of Deputies.</P>

      <P>As these regulations become clear to us we make them known to fishery interests as quickly as possible.  There is the feeling that our fishing interests have a great deal to fear about entry into the EEC, but with the present rate of expansion in our fisheries I do not think there is anything whatsoever to fear.  I have no reason to believe but that the present rate of expansion will continue provided the confidence of the people engaged in the industry is not undermined in any way.  We should all endeavour to create confidence in the future of the industry.  I think we can all look forward with confidence to entry into the EEC.</P>

      <P>There has been only one cement manufacture licence issued under the Cement Act, 1933.  This was granted to Cement Ltd. on the 12th May, 1936.</P>
      <P>The maximum price which might be charged by the licence holder was in the form of a condition attached to the licence under section 13 (l) (g) of the Act.  The original condition specified a price ex-works, subject to a number of qualifications relating to manufacturing costs.  The condition in question was varied on a number of occasions and in 1964 the condition was amended to read that the company should not charge higher home prices than those shown in the company's printed price list dated 10th October, 1960, except to offset increased costs which were outside the control of the company.</P>
      <P>This condition was subject to review on or before 30th September, 1970. This period was extended to 31st December, 1970.  The company have given an undertaking not to increase cement prices without the Minister's agreement until new conditions are settled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me as Minister for Justice to set out in detail possible constitutional objections to particular proposals but, as the Deputy's question arises from a reply of mine on 26th November, I think I should say that I had in mind on that occasion that constitutional difficulties might arise in relation to community participation in the judgments of children's courts from the requirement that justice must be administered in criminal matters by duly appointed judges, who may not hold any other office or position of emolument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not to say that utilising the services of lay people as participants in children's courts for proceedings of a non-criminal nature would necessarily be open to the same objections <Col N="679" /> and although the Committee on Industrial Schools and Reformatories did not specifically recommend the use of lay people in these cases I shall bear the matter in mind in my consideration of the proposals of the committee in so far as they might affect the jurisdiction of the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the total number of <Col N="680" /> gardaí as at 1st December, 1968, 1969 and 1970; the total number of Special Branch gardaí as of the same dates; and if he is satisfied that this force is adequately equipped and capable of protecting the security of the State in the context of legislation now in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda strength figures as at 1st December in each of the last three years are as follows : 1968&mdash;6,536; 1969&mdash;6,529; 1970&mdash;6,552.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;Special Branch&rdquo; is not used officially&mdash;the official term &ldquo;Special Detective Unit&rdquo; is applied to a section of the Garda Síochána. I have already explained to the House, as regards the numbers allocated to the Special Detective Unit, that it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose information as to the number of gardaí who are engaged on duties in a particular section at particular times.</P>
      <P>The answer to the last part of the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but that answer is not to be taken as meaning that a situation could not arise at short notice when it would be necessary to augment the force or to extend the law or possibly to take both these steps in order to protect the security of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister find it impossible to give the total number of gardaí out of the 6,552 currently employed by the State who are engaged on special duties?  Surely the Minister is aware that this information is generally made available in most democratic European parliaments and that his refusal to give this information, which is of a most general nature and to which the House is perfectly entitled, can only tend to increase public speculation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position to be that this figure was never given and I do not see any good reason <Col N="681" /> why it should be given now.  It was not given in the public interest and for security reasons.  There are no circumstances at present obtaining that would make it any more desirable to give it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of various statements made that the Special Detective Unit has been specially augmented in recent months and would he give the reasons why it is not in the public interest and contrary to national security to say how many of the 6,500 gardaí in the State are currently employed in that unit?  That is a straight question.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if men were called up in the period around August, 1969, and onwards and if they suffered severe financial losses it is unreasonable in December, 1970, to say that the matter is under consideration, particularly in view of the fact that in most cases those matters were brought to the Minister's notice almost immediately after those people were called up?  In some cases the people concerned have since died and their widows are in a serious financial position because of this.

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the principle of abatement where both service and disablement pensions are payable affects other retired State servants as well as retired members of the permanent Defence Force, I regret that it is not open to me to repeal Article 38 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, 1937, which governs the position of retired members of the Forces who are in receipt of both service and disability pensions.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware how inequitable this is because this particular abatement applies in most cases to the disability pension?  Army pensioners have earned their service pensions.  The medical board award them pensions in respect of their service but, because of the abatement clause, that pension is abated when a disability pension is granted.  Surely it is inequitable to operate abatement in those cases which are distinct from other categories in the public services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, CIE require to be further subsidised to the tune of almost £3 million or, to be absolutely precise, £2,980,000.  In his statement the Minister outlined the necessity for this which basically comes down to the fact that in the past several years the position of the railways has been declining rather badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the period ended 31st March last, according to the annual report of <Col N="693" /> CIE, the railways lost a total of £4,212,000 which was an increase of £1,100,000 over the previous year.  The only other losses sustained in that year were on the operation of canals which lost £95,000, an increase of £23,000 on the previous year, and on the operation of vessels which lost £30,000 which was £3,000 less than the deficit for the year ended 31st March, 1969.</P>
    <P>On all other operations, city bus services, provincial bus services, tours, road freight and hotels, the accounts to the end of March of this year show a profit.  It is true to say that even though profits were made on the city bus services, they had declined markedly from £177,000 to £61,000. Only on the provincial bus service was the profit maintained up to the level of the previous year's operations and there there was a substantial £632,000 profit shown for the year. Smaller profits were made for the other operations but hotel profits were up for that year and apart from the railway operations and canals and vessels there was a profit in that year.  The Minister suggests that for the present year, as a result of inflation, which takes the form mainly of increases in wages, city bus services will show a loss of about £¼ million on the current operation.  I do not recall whether he mentioned what will happen to the provincial services. I imagine their profits too will be affected, as will tour buses.</P>
    <P>People using the bus service in the last year have been asked to pay very substantial increases in fares.  I should like to know from the Minister whether this is a further subsidy towards the railways being paid by the people who use buses. Deputy O'Donovan mentioned that here in the city of Dublin very sharp increases in fares have been imposed on passengers on buses for very short runs.  This has also affected rural travellers for either long or short distances.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the provincial service and the city bus service operate. The city bus service operates into Bray and as far south as Kilcoole so we are affected under both headings by the increases.  The increases in the city fares particularly have been noted and the hazards involved in city travel are causing problems for commuters on the <Col N="694" /> busy roads north and south of the city. If there is to be a continuous fall off in travel, then the problems involved will have to be grappled with, the problem of parking in the city, particularly, where the motor car seems to be taking up an increasing amount of the available space at the expense of travellers on buses.  An extra bridge or two bridges are necessary here to provide for a free flow of traffic over the Liffey from north to south and vice versa. This problem will have to be tackled very soon or for long periods of each working day traffic will come to a complete halt.</P>
    <P>For as long as I can remember the time taken to travel from Wicklow to Dublin was 1½ hours.  This was the position for anything up to 20 years.  In spite of the fact that a great deal of road straightening and widening work has been done between Wicklow and Bray, the journey now takes between 1½ and two hours so not only is bus travel becoming increasingly more costly but it is also becoming much more difficult to arrive on time for work or appointments in the city of Dublin in the mornings or to get out of Dublin between 5 and 7 in the evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he intends to bring in consultants to look at the railways. Judging by the losses sustained on the railways, a very hard look will have to be taken at their operations.  I can see clearly in my own town why people do not travel by train.  The passenger station for Wicklow town is situated 1½ miles from the town centre so one must get a taxi or some other form of transport to reach the train.  Recently, due to pressure from local organisations, CIE started a passenger service from the goods station which is almost in the centre of Wicklow town.  This has proved a great boon to commuters.  It has enabled them to make the trip from Wicklow to Dublin inside an hour and also to get back to Wicklow in the evening by about 6.30.  It now takes less time to travel from Dublin to Wicklow by train than to travel by bus from Dublin to Bray which is 20 miles nearer to the City.  If all passenger services were to be shunted into the goods station in Wicklow I believe by that <Col N="695" /> one small act the popularity of the passenger service would increase immensely.  I do not know if there are many places with this problem but this is one area where great pressure could be taken off a very busy road-the Dublin-Bray road&mdash;if commuters in the Wicklow area were to have all trains leave from the goods station in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for introducing another local issue&mdash;the bus service from Bray.  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned that the Harcourt Street line was closed some years ago because it was not being used enough and was incurring a loss of something in the region of £50,000 or £60,000 annually. That now seems very little but in those days it appeared to be quite a large sum.  A bus service to facilitate the people who used that line was put on between Bray and Dublin.  It was the number 86 bus and it went from Bray to Dublin via Cabinteely and Dundrum. Recently a decision was taken to curtail the distance travelled by this bus and the terminus on the Wicklow side is now Cabinteely which means that people from Bray are unable to make one journey from Bray to Dundrum. and areas on that side of the country.  Because of the necessity to make two journeys the fare has gone up by something like 1s 5d a journey. It costs Is 7d to travel now to Cabinteely and a further 1s 9d from Cabinteely to Dundrum whereas it was 1s 9d for the whole way through previously. It is possible to buy a weekly ticket at no extra cost but it is unfair, having first of all removed the railways, to curtail the bus service further so that people who regularly if not daily make the journey between Bray and areas such as Dundrum and into Dublin are no longer able to do so. I have been in touch with the office of the city traffic manager and although I have been treated with courtesy in this matter I have been unable to get what the people of Bray want, namely, that transport be provided at the same fare as on the previous service.  This is a reasonable request by those who formerly travelled on the No. 86 bus.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would have a word with CIE to see if this service <Col N="696" /> can be provided at the previous rate. There cannot be any great saving achieved in curtailing the journey by three miles and I do not think the decision in this case has been a wise one. The excuse given was that the bus was not used very much but if the service is to be maintained for most of the route the extension of three miles to Bray will not cost very much.</P>
    <P>I realise that all of us can see the problems that exist in the various bus services.  The area of north Wicklow provides a large number of workers for Dublin city but no inquiry has been made regarding how the workers are commuting to the city.  In this way CIE are losing considerable revenue by not revising their timetables.  The working day is becoming shorter&mdash;in many factories the termination hour is 4.30 or 5 p.m.&mdash;but the transport services are not being adapted to cope with the changed working schedule.</P>
    <P>The number of people working in the Bray area who travel from Ashford and Kilcoole each day is considerably increased but there has been no change in the bus timetables for those areas. To illustrate this point, I would mention people who work in an electrical appliance factory in Bray.  They finish work at 5 p.m. but the bus from Bray towards the Wicklow areas leaves at 4.45 p.m.  The next bus arrives in Bray at 6.30 p.m. and shortly afterwards three buses to Arklow, Wexford and Wicklow town arrive practically together. However, from 5 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. there is no service available for the factory workers; they have to wait around in Bray or else try to get a lift.  CIE should cater for these people who are in need of transport.  By their failure to do this they are losing considerable revenue.</P>
    <P>There is an overlap in this area between city and rural transport and it may be that one management is leaving it to the other to do the job.  However, I shall take up the matter with the traffic manager again although nothing was done in regard to my previous representations.  In the areas I have mentioned there are several hundred people involved and this case illustrates just one area where revenue could be increased if CIE had local information <Col N="697" /> regarding the numbers who need transport facilities and the changes in the working schedules of people.  I hope the Minister will take up this matter because I have not been successful in getting any changes in the bus timetable.</P>
    <P>Most of us would not like to see the railways closed, or any further closures being carried out, and this is not only from the point of view of profit but also for sentimental reasons.  The growing loss that is met each year by taxpayers must be a cause for concern. Nevertheless, as has been illustrated by the closure of the Harcourt Street line, the removal of bridges and the selling of land along the line, this is a dubious procedure to adopt without taking into account the long-term prospects. The Harcourt Street line could be very profitable had it been kept in operation.  Those of us who travel daily on the Bray road would be much happier to go by train if this service were available at suitable hours, and I am sure people living in the area between Bray and Dublin would travel by train if the service were available.</P>
    <P>There is a social necessity, particularly in the western parts of the country, for railways and it is difficult to judge in monetary terms the advantage of railway stations being located in those areas.  In addition, some provincial bus services are necessary because people in outlying areas have not any other means of transport.  There is much talk about the losses incurred by CIE and such losses must be considered when one sees the bill that is presented to taxpayers each year.  However, it would be a grave disadvantage to have any further rail closures.  We must ask ourselves if we are prepared to continue meeting this mounting deficit or whether we want our railway system completely closed.  The Minister more or less hinted at this in his document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not like to see any closures and, as a taxpayer, I am prepared to pay my contribution to keep the railways in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would not be any necessity to <Col N="698" /> bring in experts from abroad to examine this problem if there was greater liaison between local areas and CIE.  The business is there if an effort is made to look for it and I imagine the examples I have given are repeated throughout the country.  I am sure that more people could and would travel by CIE if the service was available; if the service was made more efficient by more room being provided for buses in built-up areas and if trains were made available as near as possible to where people reside, and as I already suggested, by using stations, perhaps now being used for a different purpose but which could be adapted for use by passenger trains.  In this regard railways near the city of Dublin could score over road traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech in relation to this Bill is a repetition of what we have heard over the years-that additional sums are required for CIE.  More than a consultant is needed to put CIE right.  A lot of commonsense within CIE, from the managerial level down to the ground floor, could bring about a completely different situation from that which now exists.  We know about the commissions and groups who at various times were brought in to examine CIE but still CIE continue to lose money.  Over the years there have been many changes made in regard to management and many new schemes have been developed but still each year we have to inject further moneys into the CIE system.  Nobody would oppose that because CIE is a social service and it is desirable and necessary to have a State transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine first of all the Dublin city service, which is an important service. I should like to quote one example for the Minister's benefit.  Recently a person phoned me from Dublin Airport and indicated that he was seeing a friend off to London and that he himself wanted to see me afterwards.  I told him that I would be at home for the next two hours and he said he would come to see me at my home in Tallaght.  He came to see me 35 minutes after I received a phone call from the person who had gone to London, so that it took 35 minutes longer to come from Dublin Airport to Tallaght than <Col N="699" /> it did for that person to go from Dublin to London, and have his breakfast on the way.  This gives some idea of the situation and confusion that exists within the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that London city or London airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>London airport.  He 'phoned from the airport.  He could have been there for a considerable time but he was 35 minutes ahead of the person who was only travelling from Collinstown across the city.  The Minister can verify what I am going to say about Tallaght.  There is a two hour time lag in the service in this rapidly developing area.  When CIE test a route they put on either a double-decker bus or a bus which will carry 60 to 70 passengers and if they find that it is only one-quarter full they say it is not economic.  This is crazy.  If there is a demand for a service in an area the size of the bus should be taken into consideration and not just the particular bus CIE send out when they examine the viability of a route.  CIE could have a number of smaller buses. A mini-bus possibly could serve Tallaght effectively in the off-peak periods and it would provide a much needed and valuable service for the workers and residents in the area who could commute to Walkinstown Cross and other adjacent centres in the area to get buses from there.  If people have no transport of their own they are tied up in the area for two, three or four hours.  Other Deputies will support me in what I have to say about this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only one area a few miles from the centre of the city in which people have to stay at home for several hours and yet CIE are supposed to be providing an effective and efficient service. To my mind bus routes are examined by people who have no notion of how a system should operate.  Over the years I suggested the introduction of perimeter services in the city but CIE always wrote back to say that there was an insufficient volume of passenger traffic to justify perimeter services. However, perimeter services were established and CIE found out that they were viable.  Because a suggestion <Col N="700" /> comes from a Member of the Oireachtas or an ordinary passenger on CIE it is discounted.  The suggestion must come from a person who has been asked to examine the system.  He probably uses my brains and the brains of others who make these suggestions for the betterment of the system and he produces these as completely new ideas. Nobody else gets any credit.  It is not that people are looking for credit but they want recognition of the suggestions they put forward and not to have them discarded just because they come from people outside CIE.</P>
    <P>If CIE listened to their own workers and to their passengers they might have a more effective system for their railways, their other works and for their bus services.  They have a crazy system of assessing routes.  I say that a variety of different sized buses is necessary and desirable because of the built-up nature of the various areas, of bad roads into areas which are being developed, because some of the roads going into these new areas which are now being developed are not suitable for full sized buses.  Industry is also being developed in these areas and smaller buses would serve their requirements. I would ask the Minister to suggest to people examining bus services to the perimeter areas to use a little commonsense, particularly in regard to those areas which should be served.</P>
    <P>In the industrial estate in Tallaght we have the situation that buses pass workers and other prospective passengers as they travel empty to the estate.  This is a crazy situation.  CIE have buses running to Tallaght to pick up people from Urney's and other industrial concerns and these buses will not stop to pick up passengers on the way.  No wonder CIE lose money.  If a bus is proceeding from one point to another and there are passengers on the route they should be picked up. As I say, it is no wonder that CIE are down several millions of pounds each year if you have this kind of gross neglect and incompetence in relation to their services.</P>
    <P>The city service as a whole is completely inefficient because the whole system has been blocked by congestion, the congestion mentioned by the Minister. <Col N="701" /> This congestion is brought about by CIE themselves.  Up to a few years ago there was no perimeter services and everybody travelling to a given point within two or three miles of his house had to take CIE transport to the centre of the city and then take another bus from the centre of the city.  CIE have this centre of the city mentality &mdash;buses must go to the centre of the city, they must be parked in O'Connell Street and they must take up room there.  They would never think of parking them outside the main streets in places like Smithfield where there is ample parking space.  This to my mind is done to extract the last halfpenny from the passengers.  They know that a worker must get from one point to another to his work and they also know that if they provide a service then that is the service the worker must avail of: otherwise he can walk to work or get there by any other method he likes.</P>
    <P>No wonder CIE have lost a vast number of passengers over the years. Seven million fewer passengers were carried on the Dublin city services in 1969-70 than in the preceding year and compared with 1964-65 the number was down by almost 28 million.  This indicates that no serious attention was given by competent persons to this problem.  The people responsible for this decline should be moved out of their particular departments and people with new ideas, people prepared to assess the value of passengers' suggestions and if possible put them into operation at the earliest possible moment, should replace them.  Otherwise, we will have a continuing decline and the Dublin city bus services will not pay their way.  It is an effective service in so far as it produces the goods but CIE have extracted the last halfpenny from the workers.  The workers cannot afford to pay any further increases such as the disgraceful increases which have been imposed in recent times.</P>
    <P>These unfortunate people are now being forced into considering alternative methods of getting to their places of employment.  CIE have created for themselves a very serious situation by these increasing stage fares&mdash;a situation that has been brought about by <Col N="702" /> bad planning and by lack of attention to the needs of those who use the transport services.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of scope for perimeter services.  CIE may say that there are at present a few such services but these services were only provided because the company were forced into providing them by the consistent demand for such services.  Year after year we were told that these services were not feasible but now that they are in operation we are told they are very good.</P>
    <P>It is about time CIE introduced a worker's ticket and a transfer ticket so that workers might change from one bus to another while using such tickets. While some workers in Dublin city and county are lucky in regard to transport, others are victimised.  If workers' tickets are provided at all, they should be provided for everybody.  If a person comes from the Dun Laoghaire area or if he must go to work in that area, he will be able to get a workers' ticket.  I wonder if it is because of the fact that some of those people are from the highly residential area of Monkstown that this area was selected or was it because of the number of managing directors or other people of importance in the area who were in a position to bring pressure to bear on the company and thereby qualify for special concessions?  The people in areas such as Ballyfermot and Drimnagh must pay the full amount.  Also, there are women who go for their cup of coffee every morning in the centre of the city and who are able to avail of the reduced fare across town while housewives in Ballyfermot and other areas must pay the full fare in the off-peak hours.</P>
    <P>The same applies to those who can afford to drive to the edge of town in their Jaguars.  These, too, can avail of the reduced fare at off-peak hours. Why should there be selective treatment for any particular section?  Until such time as there is equality for all, there will be no encouragement for many people to use this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that workers' tickets and transfer tickets are made available as soon <Col N="703" /> as possible.  I am aware that this matter was considered by CIE.  There is no reason why it could not be introduced. Because a high fare is charged between any two given points, it does not necessarily follow that CIE will have a greater income in the long term than if they made available workers' tickets and other tickets at a lesser rate.  On the contrary, this would entice more people to travel by bus.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of the bus service to which I should like to refer but I shall not do so on this occasion. Perhaps I shall have an opportunity of speaking again on this subject on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.  However, I ask the Minister to bear in mind that a man can travel from Dublin to London and have his breakfast en route in less time that it would take a person to travel from Dublin Airport to Tallaght.  The Minister might have a look at the Tallaght bus timetable.  If he does he will find that three or four buses to that area leave at almost the same time and then there is no bus for several hours. This is not good enough in the case of a service to an area such as Tallaght which is a vast expanding area, where there are a large number of industries and where the Minister has told us there are a further 38 acres available for the development of another 28 or 30 industries.</P>
      <P>The use of the big bus that is too wide for our streets is not the answer to the problem.  It would be better to put smaller buses on the route and to ensure that there would be a frequent service.  It is commonsense, not consultants, that is required in CIE.  The Minister should seek the views of the man in the street before bringing in the consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various types of persons in CIE&mdash;psychiatrists, time-study experts and others&mdash;but there is still no effective system.  Recently a £2½ million contract was placed with a firm outside the country.  This came about because of bad industrial relations.  The management and the unions should have been able, during a period of years, to work out a system whereby there would be flexibility and whereby <Col N="704" /> questions of the demarcation lines could be broken down on some basis, whether on the basis of additional flexibility allowances, as is done in some firms, or otherwise.  But, again, commonsense did not prevail in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is evidence of gross incompetence on the part of the management of CIE that this contract was placed outside the country.  I worked in the workshops of CIE and I am aware that the workers in that company are second to none.  The best tradesmen available are employed by CIE.  These men are competent to do the work that is now about to be done in Britain perhaps by Pakistanis and others and probably by some of our own people who have emigrated in the past.  The Minister must examine the position in relation to this valuable contract.</P>
    <P>If some Irish firm were to capture a £2½ million contract from abroad it would be given much publicity and we would be told about the valuable employment that such a contract would provide for Irish workers.  Here we have a concern which is costing the tax payers more than £2 million but which is now allowing a £2½ million contract to go abroad.</P>
    <P>The unions and the management must get together and work out a system.  I am well aware of the way in which men have been harassed up there from time to time.  I know the mentality of the management, as I know also the mentality of the workers.  As I have said in this House many times before, there is something wrong with the whole industrial relations situation within the company.</P>
    <P>Since this contract is being executed abroad, the company must depend on cross-channel shipping companies and on other people who are outside this country.  They are at the mercy of the employment situation abroad and over which they have no control.  They would have some control over a minor disruption here but now they will be at the mercy of these outside interests.</P>
    <P>If there is a problem, CIE must examine that problem and they must report back to the Minister and, in turn, to the House and justify themselves in relation to the placing of this <Col N="705" /> valuable contract abroad.  There is no reason why whatever problem existed could not have been overcome between the company, the workers and the trade unions involved.  Perhaps they did not wish to have the responsibility of carrying out this job.  Perhaps this was the easy way out.  I do not know but I want to know and I want an answer from the Minister before the Estimate for his Department is introduced here.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have certain ideas as to why this contract went abroad.  A lot of people have no wish to tackle certain jobs.  Instead, they allow the work to be done outside the country so that if any questions are asked afterwards as to the workmanship or otherwise they can say the goods were manufactured abroad.  CIE have a responsibility to their workers and to the taxpayer.  For that reason we want to know about this £2½ million contract.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no reason why CIE should not move into other fields. There is plenty of scope for them in tourism.  They have to some degree, with credit, moved into the European tour business.  I went on one of their European tours this year to France and Spain, and this aspect of their activities impressed me.  This is a money spinner and if they approach other problems in the same manner as they did this one, then there might be some future for CIE.  This tour activity is one of which I have practical experience. Maybe there were a few minor problems but both myself and those who travelled with me found the tour very enjoyable, fairly extensive and very good value for money.</P>
    <P>I wonder could we get a breakdown of the subsidy figures.  I should like to know what sections benefit from the subsidies.  To what extent do the Dublin city services, the road haulage services, the locomotive section at Inchicore, the provincial bus services, benefit?  To what degree do the management and workers benefit by the subsidies?  There is no doubt that the management get more by way of income increases than some of the workers of CIE.  The labouring classes in CIE, who are competent men, are badly paid, by any standards, for the work they do, and while such conditions persist, there will be confusion and disruption.  It is <Col N="706" /> only when there are good industrial relations, where the workers have confidence in the management and the management have confidence in the workers that the system as a whole will work effectively.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the points I have made and to let me know, by letter or otherwise, if inquiries have been made into this matter of the £2½ million contract, whether it can be salvaged, whether even £1 million worth of it or even £500,000 worth of it can be retrieved.  If the whole lot of it has to go, then it is a disgrace and it calls for a vote of no confidence in the people responsible for relations between workers and management.  The workers realise that the loss of this contract must mean that jobs are in danger, and no worker wants to lose his job.  I know there are problems but these problems can be solved and will have to be solved at some stage.  This is not the last contract to be undertaken. I am quite sure we shall be allocating similar sums to CIE in other years when it is required.  Therefore, this is a recurring problem.  I do not know whether the unions can be blamed for the present situation&mdash; perhaps to some degree they can&mdash;but there are people in the trade union movement with enough commonsense to know that we must arrive at a solution to the problem that has lost us this contract to a British firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with everything Deputy Dowling has said. However, I must say he knows his Dublin&mdash;he speaks for the south side, while I speak for the north side&mdash;and a few of the points he made were quite good.  In regard to the £2½ million contract lost by Inchicore, he said the unions and employers must be to blame.  I would agree with him on this, but I would also blame the Minister for Labour.  At that time he must have been told by the Minister for Transport and Power that this contract would be coming up, that the unions and employers were not agreeing, particularly when the employers were a semi-State body.  Surely the Minister for Labour should have said at that stage : &ldquo;Let us fix something up.  Let us bring in semi-skilled workers and <Col N="707" /> train them.  We have two years in which to do it.&rdquo;  We have spent something like £1 million on the Department of Labour and as far as I can see it would be far better to put it back into Industry and Commerce.  They did nothing in this regard.  The Minister for Labour is merely a rubber stamp and head of the Civil Service in that Department.  We have seen also that the Minister for Transport and Power did not bother lately when a question was asked about Hibernian Transport. We are losing £2,500,000 in the balance of payments as a result of goods being made in England instead of being made here; of course some of the material would be imported but the labour content could have been preserved.  In the case of Palgrave Murphy, we could have saved the profits now being made by Dutch companies.</P>
      <P>I would not go as far as Deputy Dowling in blaming the management of CIE in regard to subsidisation.  I would blame the Minister for Transport and Power for not checking up on things during the last few years.  There is no point in blaming the officials. They work away as they have done, just improving a little.  If a businessman-let it be a grocer, tobacconist, publican or draper&mdash;sees at the end of the year he is losing money and he is not allowed to put up his prices, what will he do?  He will spend more money in renovating his premises in order to make his business more economical, to reduce the labour content or to bring in more business.  CIE have not done any of this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned there were no perimeter buses on the south side of the city or that they were only about to arrive.  I do not think it would take any great brain to have worked this out.  On the north side Cabra has been built up for quite a while. Blanchardstown has also been built up.  There are an enormous number of factories in Finglas and Cabra and the Ballymum Estate is near Dublin Airport.  A number of factories have been built in Coolock and one or two factories have also been built in Sutton. There are between 20 and 30 acres in Coolock reserved for factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> In all those areas corporation houses have been built.  Those houses were given to families with four young children, but it was not possible to give people houses near to where they worked.  This meant that people had to travel several miles to work and as CIE did not operate a perimeter bus service people bought cars on hire purchase in order to get to and from work. The owner of the car would arrange to give lifts to three or four friends who would pay for the petrol.  I do not know how things would have worked out with regard to insurance had there been an accident.</P>
    <P>I know of people living in Coolock who work in Cabra and people living in Cabra who work in Coolock.  This is because it is not possible for the corporation to give people houses in a particular area; yet until a month ago CIE did not run even a skeleton service to those places.  The point I am trying to make here is that people were forced into buying cars because there was no bus service.  It seems to take nearly two years, and I am sure public representatives are sick of writing to CIE about it, to get CIE to put on bus services to those new estates.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this extra subsidy will come from bus passengers, which means that fares will go up again.  I think the Minister said at some stage today that he expected fares to go up in the New Year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks, from the Minister's statement, as though it is to come from the fares.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These estimates did not include any provision for the 12th round increase in salaries and wages on the <Col N="709" /> grounds that it was appropriate that national wage rounds and other increases in labour costs which might arise during the five year period should be recovered by way of increases in fares and rates... </P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that:</P>
    <P>No one could have foreseen in December, 1969, that the 12th round settlements would be of such magnitude that they would cost CIE almost £5 million...</P>
    <P>The maintenance strike was well over at that time.  There was not an employer or union which did not know what the scale of wage increases would be.  After the first case the Labour Court knew what was about to happen.  Later claims always get more than the original claim and anyone in CIE could have seen what would happen.  Probably there was an election or something on at the time and it was decided not to show it then: it could be shown eventually and if the others got in they would be stuck with it. The Minister went on to say :</P>
    <P>...the overall increase in the board's labour costs would amount to an estimated £6.7 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between the £5 million in a full year and the £6.7 million?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also <Col N="710" /> mentioned in his speech that when CIE put up fares because of wage increases the wage increases had already been granted and there was sometimes a lapse of three or six months between the time the wage increases were granted and the time the fares were put up and this has an added effect. Every business which makes a retrospective payment has to pay for it out of its profits.  This is not peculiar to CIE but there is one difference this time because no matter what wage increase was awarded prices were to be increased by only seven per cent, yet CIE in the last increase put an 11d. fare up to 1s. 3d. which amounts to an increase of roughly 40 per cent.  No one else is allowed to do that but a State body can.  I agree that strikes, such as the cement strike, affect CIE and cause a drop in their income.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the continuing decline in the number of passengers carried in Dublin.  As I pointed out before, because there are no perimeter buses people have been compelled to buy cars instead of using the buses.  The traffic situation in Dublin is chaotic.  People going to work spend three hours at least waiting for buses or just sitting in buses.  As many as three buses may arrive simultaneously and then there may be no bus for another 30 minutes.  Most people now try to get lifts or they buy cars.  The traffic situation should have been handled years ago.  Deputy Dowling was, I think, a little severe on the higher staff in CIE.  I do not think they are perfect, but they are doing their best in a very bad situation.  That bad situation has come about because there has never been any proper planning.</P>
      <P>There have been two increases in CIE fares in one year.  I do not know any other business which has had two increases in the last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some semi-State combines may have had two increases. We had, of course, the Post Office, another Government Department.  The Minister referred to wage inflation but I think the Government are the greatest cause of wage inflation.  The increased fares have considerably increased costs <Col N="711" /> on parents who have children going to school.  There was a time when the Opposition here warned the Government about inflation.  As far back as 1964 I remember the former Deputy James Dillon here in this House warning about inflation.  He was laughed at by the Government.  Now the inflation is here.  The Minister has admitted it.  Of course Fianna Fáil change when it suits them.  We hear nothing now but inflation; we must stop inflation.  The Minister for Finance has brought in measures to stop inflation, or so he says; a good deal of it is designed, I think, to collect more taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his opening speech that he wants this money immediately. He must get it before January.  I wonder where the Minister for Finance will get the £7 million he talked about.  Is this just another gimmick?</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Donovan referred to the fact that no real planning has ever been done and there has been no thinking ahead.  There are no targets. No business could hope to operate effeciently if it did not set targets. The target may not be reached, but at least it is there.  All we get here is a return from CIE, the sort of thing any shareholder gets from a company. No details are given.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan also referred to the fact that we have Ministers who are not doing their job; they are fighting with each other.  I do not blame CIE entirely. I know some of the higher officials in CIE and they would get good jobs in private enterprise any day.  I was at school with one or two of them, excellent people.  The trouble is they can do their work only within certain limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any real overall improvement must be brought about by the Government as a whole.  There should be collective responsibility.  The Department of Education are involved because no effort is made to ensure that schools are built in the right area and at the right time.  The Department of Local Government are involved because of the road situation.  The Department of Finance are involved.  So are the Department of Transport and Power.  A <Col N="712" /> constituent of mine could not get her child into the schools in Coolock and now she has to bring the child four times a day to and from school.  There are two other school-going children and her husband also has to travel to work.  Bus fares are an important element in that family's budget.  That kind of expenditure could and should be prevented.  Travelling is a waste of time and, to a certain extent, a waste of money.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance could help to solve the problem in quite a big way by staggering working hours. Hours are staggered in London with quite beneficial results.  Civil servants could start work half an hour earlier in the morning and leave half an hour earlier in the evening.  This would relieve traffic congestion considerably.  It might also help to improve the financial position of the Budget.  Recently, travelling into town, I got a bus at the junction of the two Howth Roads at five minutes to nine and I reached Dáil Éireann at five minutes to ten.  It was a wet morning and people took out their cars.  The following day I left at half past nine, when traffic had eased off, and I reached Dáil Éireann at ten minutes to ten.  There was no rain.  If hours were staggered, there would be a clear run.  There are certain people who do not work in offices and who cannot do this.  If you are working on road works or on an outside job you have to try to get the light of day. However, if you are working inside I do not see why the hours could not be staggered.</P>
    <P>Consider, for example, the civil servant who gets a bus to his office.  At peak hours, he often has to stand in a queue for 20 minutes or so and, if there is a traffic jam, it may take up another 20 or 30 minutes apart from the normal time it would take him to reach the office by bus.  There is a great waste of time.  CIE do not keep an even run of buses.  You may see three Clontarf buses, one after the other, at one period of the morning and there may not be another one for half an hour.  With an even run of traffic, there would be a longer medium period and CIE could make more money.  Furthermore, people would be happier to travel with them.  It would <Col N="713" /> cut down on the waste of time on the roads and get people to their places of work much quicker.  To break up working hours would be of great advantage here, as it has been in London. It is the only immediate solution I can see to the problem.  Otherwise, we should have to ask the local authority to provide new bridges and new roads and more people would give up the buses.</P>
    <P>Here is something which makes me wonder.  A man came to me about a job.  I wrote to various firms, of which one was CIE.  It was only a store-keeper's job.  They told me they had no job.  Nevertheless, the following week, a Fianna Fáil Minister got a job in the same place for him.  If this happens to any great extent then we cannot trust CIE.  I am not saying it is a general thing but if I knew that it happened another time then I would say so.  Is this an isolated case or are we feather-bedding just to suit political pull?</P>
    <P>Let us go back again to the subject of the buses and consider a man who works a 40-hour week.  Suppose it takes him 1½ hours to get to work-queuing for 30 minutes-and another 1½ hours to get home again.  He is on the road 15 hours a week.  You are in desperate trouble until that figure is cut by half. The only way to do so is to stagger the starting hours of business.</P>
    <P>The train between Amiens Street and Howth is a profitable enterprise involving the Killester area and Sutton. It would be well if this were done for the Cabra area.  I do not know if it could be done for Finglas.  It cannot be done now on the south side because Fianna Fáil sold land and broke down bridges on the Harcourt Street-Bray line although they should have realised that Dublin would expand.  That line would run via the back of Mount Merrion, out to Brewery Road, and take up people from a huge built-up area.  It would have been a lot more successful than the train to Howth. Even the Rathmines Road is worse in the morning than the north side.  This traffic will get worse on the north side, not so much on the south side although they are building on the south side too.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dowling's remarks <Col N="714" /> about CIE's package tours to Europe.  It could be very successful. I suppose we shall have to join up with Aer Lingus in London because it would be very difficult to keep it going the whole summer.</P>
    <P>Consider, again, the bus fares involved if a mother has to bring, say, three children to school&mdash;apart from what her husband must spend on bus fares to and from his work.  Whether the child goes to school in town or near town, the fare is the same.  If the husband does not come home for lunch, his fare will be 2s 6d per day.  If the wife goes with the child on the bus, it will be 2s 6d and if she has to collect one or two of the children it is another 2s 6d.  That comes to 7s 6d per day for the adults.  For, say, three children at half-fare it would be 4s.  If they have to come home during the day it is another 4s.  These fares come, therefore, to 15s 6d per day.  Some people may be lucky enough to have a school beside them.  With that sort of set-up, is it not easily understandable why there has been a loss of £7 million on the buses? You can get a car on the hire-purchase, and petrol with it, for that sort of money.  Would it not be more convenient to have a car and to have the wife to drive it?</P>
    <P>ClE's costs are going up too quickly without a proper service in return.  I would not expect CIE to be 100 per cent efficient&mdash;I do not think anyone in the world could be that&mdash;but a better effort could be made to grapple with this problem which will not solve itself.</P>
    <P>Ministers have not given leadership in the past in the Department of Transport and Power.  This is why wages have gone up so much.  They criticise workers for seeking so much money, £4 or £5 a week extra, but when you have this kind of fare which has to be paid five days a week, five guineas out of the wages, you find the increased bus fare takes nearly one-third of the increase in wages.</P>

      <P>This very elegant report from CIE impressed me very much.  I wonder how many of these are distributed and to whom?  Does every worker in CIE get one?  Are they sent abroad?  What justifies this elaborate <Col N="715" /> technicolored production which would not be equalled in Los Angeles or Hollywood?  This is the CIE Annual Report for 1969-70.  Who authorised money to be spent on this and what was the cost of it?  It is very important that we should know this.  The Minister comes here to seek money for CIE. We want to know where is the waste. This report is the start of it, as far as I am concerned.  Is this on sale?  Is there revenue from it?  I do not think the Minister should treat it as a laughing matter.  It is serious; it involves taxpayers' money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am upset that the taxpayers' money is being spent unnecessarily abroad.  We are discussing a transport service that is barely holding together and yet it must open up offices abroad.  I know that our transport service is essential and it is important that it should be maintained within the confines of the country.  I think the policy of CIE may be wrong. In his introductory speech the Minister said :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study in depth to establish what <Col N="717" /> measures might be taken in the long term to achieve a reduction in CIE's losses will also be undertaken. </P>
    <P>CIE were established in 1943,1 think, and now 27 years later we get this beautiful expression that a study in depth will be undertaken.  After all those years we have decided to do that.  That is fantastic, incredible.  Last year's statement by the then Minister contradicts this.  He said :</P>
    <P>CIE are continually striving to lessen the impact of rising costs and they have achieved considerable success in increasing productivity and attracting new business.  I have asked the Board to maintain their efforts in this respect so that the amount of the annual subvention may be kept within reasonable limits. </P>
    <P>I think that was Deputy Childers, who was then Minister for Transport and Power.  We now have a new Minister and he finds that nothing was done for 27 years and he has decided that a study in depth should be undertaken to establish which measures might be taken in the long term to achieve a reduction in ClE's losses.  I should like the Minister to explain that.  It is a revelation to the House.  He found out his predecessors were doing nothing and he decides to do something about the situation.  I hope I shall be here next year to ask the Minister for Transport and Power what resulted from this study in depth.</P>

There seems to be no limit to the endurance of the citizens of Dublin.  They accept things with resignation regularly.  They have given up complaining because they know it is no use and, in view of the Taoiseach's intention to introduce section 2 of the Offences Against the State Act, there will be no purpose in any demonstration from now on.  So, they had better give up forever.</P>

      <P>We have seen mistake after mistake at the top level of CIE.  There has been lack of planning and lack of policy-making.  The signs on the buses are printed in Irish in England.  I noticed on one bus they have &ldquo;X Arald&rdquo;.  I do not know how that could be interpreted for Harold's Cross.  Some time ago CIE decided that the bus signs were not good enough. They decided to take away the signs with &ldquo;Bus&rdquo; on them and erect those new signs all over the city.  I wonder what will come next?  This is the management in CIE which we are tolerating. Those people are squandering the taxpayers' money while the people are being fleeced by them.</P>

      <P>The workers are constantly being blamed for the increased costs of CIE.  The people who say this do not take into consideration the mental strain of the bus drivers in this city.  They are under great strain travelling across the city in the chaotic conditions which we have.  I do not know how they could do it for even £50 a week.  We are told they are now looking for a shorter working week, which is merely looking for a 40 hour week. It was suggested it was criminal that they should look for this.  They should have a much shorter working week. If the Minister were to take over the job of one of these bus drivers for two weeks he would end up in St. Brendan's, because he would not have the stamina of those men.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt about that.  The Minister's colleagues are wonderful.  We should seriously consider those men who have to work under such strain.  The accident rate among our bus drivers is the lowest of any.  They do a magnificent job under trying conditions.  They have to contend with a high level of carbon monoxide in their blood.</P>
      <P>There was a survey taken of bus drivers in Great Britain and the rate of heart attacks was higher among them than among any other section of the population.  It is no wonder this should be the case because of the severe strain imposed by their work. I do not know if the Minister ever heard of circadian rhythm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister will agree with me that the workers in CIE have their circadian rhythm adversely affected by the work they do.  I read a letter in the <i>Evening Herald</i> a few weeks ago which was a heart cry from a housewife.  She said her husband comes home to his dinner in the evening, soaked most evenings because of the bad weather which we <Col N="720" /> get for eight months of the year.  He has to wait a long time for a bus each evening.  This woman said our natives do not matter with CIE.  This was a very pathetic letter.  I have often seen workers standing in the rain without any shelter provided by CIE.  CIE are only interested in the tourists but they only come in the summer months.  We should give some attention to our people who are compelled to wait long intervals for buses, who arrive home soaked and have to dry their clothes before the following morning when they have to face the bad weather again. Proper bus shelters should be provided particularly for Dublin people who have to stand for long intervals waiting for buses.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago I wrote to CIE about the No. 23 bus service.  I am sure Deputy Dowling will agree with me that the people in Drimnagh are very badly affected by this bus service, which is the worst in Dublin.  The reply I got back was very sympathetic.  I was asked had I any suggestions.  That was a fair enough answer because he had none. He agreed that it was terrible.</P>
      <P>I looked into this problem and the trouble is that the No. 23 bus has to try to get out from the quays and across the bridge, and it cannot.  I am moving into another area when I say this.  This is due to the fact that there are no traffic lights on the bridge.  I went further and I found that they were approved three years ago but nothing was done about them.  This is the cause of the poor service in that area. The buses are held up for long periods. I would ask the Minister to look into this and try to establish liaison with the Department concerned, or Dublin Corporation, or whoever it is, in an effort to improve this service at the quays.  This is where the big hold-up is occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that we need a proper connecting bus service on the perimeter of the city.  The sooner it is properly established the better.  It is not good enough to establish one on a trial basis or just to have two areas connected by &amp; bus service.  CIE are the biggest offenders because they bring their buses right into the city centre as they are afraid they will not make <Col N="721" /> enough money if they bypass the city centre, or that if they include the peripheral bus services they will not make money.  For the money they get from Dublin citizens they have an obligation to provide this service.  There is no doubt that without the Dublin bus services the whole structure of CIE would collapse.</P>

      <P>There is the answer. It could not.  It has now reached the stage that four people can go home by taxi cheaper than they could by bus. Four people combining and taking a taxi can reach home quicker and more cheaply than if they went by bus.  This is a terrible reflection on our service. Many people are resorting to this.  The Minister mentioned that fewer people are travelling by bus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not making it any better for them.  This <Col N="722" /> action by CIE, for which the Minister is responsible, is encouraging more and more people to try to get cars.  They group together and go into town.  They find this easier and cheaper.  Something positive will have to be done about restructuring the fares system because it is completely wrong.  It is wrong that people should have to pay so much to travel across from Ballymum to Ballyfermot, into town and out again.  It amounts to a colossal sum in a week.</P>
      <P>It is becoming impossible for people to come by bus from Coolock to Clonskea to work.  Does the Minister think that a person who works in Clondalkin and lives in Ballymum could rely on the bus service when he has to be in to work at 7 o'clock or 7.30 a.m.? The service is bad and the cost is exorbitant. This is what is wrong with CIE at the moment.  The mis-managers, as we will call them, are not concerned. They are completely indifferent because they know that each year the Minister will come in here and say : &ldquo;We want a little more and this is due to labour costs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Imagination is completely lacking at the top level in CIE.  I remember getting a pamphlet from them.  No doubt Deputy Dowling got one too because he represents the area.  In that pamphlet it was stated that machinery in the CIE works was being sunk into the ground and covered over with cement.  That was the way to remove it.  Did the Minister ever hear that?  A works committee disclosed the fact that machinery was being buried to dispose of it.  This is dreadful.  I cannot understand why we have not got rid of men at the top in CIE who would permit that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the experience every single night of trains parking outside my house which adjoins a railway line.  I have gone to CIE about this at six-monthly intervals ever since 1961.  I told them that the engines are revved up constantly.  It goes on for hours.  I wrote to CIE, I went to them, I interviewed different men, and the flimsy excuse given was that there is an incline in the rail, so they have to keep the engines revved up.  These trains can be started with a push button but diesel <Col N="723" /> oil is wasted for hours.  They did not mention anything about the brakes. Nobody could tolerate this.  I have become almost immune to it but people who move into the area find it impossible to tolerate this noise.</P>
    <P>It is the same in Ballyfermot.  Along Landen Road these engines are shunting up and down all the time.  Surely something could be done to avoid this? I am very serious about it.  I know people in the area whose children are very disturbed by this noise going on and on all night.  This happens at 2 o'clock in the morning.  They do not do it during the day because it is a main line to Cork.  The usual time for it to wake me is ten minutes to two.  I have gone down to Houston Station about it.  I went to see the manager of the rail services about it.  It is a simple matter of turning off the engines. If they can have the engines running for an hour without moving, they can turn off the engines for that hour.</P>
    <P>I was told they are waiting to get into Kingsbridge but, while they are waiting, can they not turn off the engines?  I have checked on this and you can turn off the engine and turn it on again with a button.  During that hour I am sure a great deal of diesel oil is used.  I was told that perhaps they were some of the noisy trains.  Would it not be better to turn off the engines and stop wasting fuel?  For nearly ten years I have not been able to get satisfaction on this matter.  People in this area are being disturbed at night.  There are people in Landen Road who cannot tolerate it and who are constantly complaining, but can get no satisfaction. I got one letter from CIE which was not very nice. It amounted to asking me how dare I complain and saying they could do nothing about it.  I should like the Minister to bring seriously to the attention of CIE that this disturbance of people at night must stop.  I should like him to let me know about this matter because it is not right that it should continue like this.  The people's efforts have been in vain.  They have signed petitions and brought them to CIE and nothing has been done.  There is this constant whine of <Col N="724" /> the engines during the night.  It creates a vibration.</P>

      <P>What is happening about the suburban railway services?  On 27th March 1969 the former Minister for Transport and Power said :</P>
      <P>The feasibility of extending railway commuter services to Clondalkin, Ballyfermot, Cabra, Glasnevin and Drumcondra is being studied by an independent market research company commissioned by CIE and the potential for commuter services on the main railway line for Naas, Newbridge and Kildare is also being examined. </P>
      <P>That is from column 1275, volume 239, of the Official Report.  What has happened about that?  The Minister today, inadvertently no doubt, omitted to refer to these services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked here about a year and a half ago whether CIE and the Minister for Transport and Power did not agree that they made a diabolical error in closing Harcourt Street station.  Of course I was told it was no such thing, that it was stupid of me to suggest it was a mistake.  When they decided to close that station they moved in the bulldozers so fast that I got the impression they were afraid there was a body of people who might protest about its closure.  I do not mind people making mistakes but let them come along and admit they made a mistake when they closed Harcourt Street station.  We know they made a mistake.  We know this station could have eliminated some of the tremendous chaos that has arisen.  Is there any possibility of repairing that mistake and reopening Harcourt Street station? We must make use of these stations and inter-city rail lines.  We should have stations at Ballyfermot and Inchicore and places like that.  This is one way of solving the traffic chaos.  I do <Col N="725" /> not think we will see underground rail lines in Dublin in our time.  I cannot suggest that the Minister should ask the present management of CIE about this because I cannot see that these people have any imagination.  The destructive elements of CIE, I would call them.  How can one expect anything constructive from them?  Could something be done to open these stations? It should not cost a lot to open a station at Ballyfermot and people could be taken right into Tara Street. There would be extra revenue to CIE from it and an improvement in the chaotic conditions on the roads.  At the same time CIE would be providing a very good service for Ballyfermot which has over 45,000 people.  We have the line there.</P>

      <P>We must consider extending the bus services at night because people work later hours now. Even if a skeleton service at increased rates were provided it would be a help.  There is an obligation on a national transport service and they should be prepared to provide a service after midnight.  It is a long time since the 11.30 last bus was decided on and conditions have changed. People are working longer hours.  We should therefore give consideration to a late night bus service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider the people who are working shift hours.  Is the Minister aware that in certain factories in Dublin and on the industrial estate on the Naas Road, if a worker is five minutes late three times in a month he loses his job?  If he is more than 15 minutes late he loses a day's pay. We talk about the workers and the demands that they make but in certain <Col N="728" /> cases if they are five minutes late they are in trouble.  Many people from Ballymum are employed in the Clondalkin area and they must depend on bus services for transport.  If they are late they are in serious trouble.  This is a measure of the regard we have for our workers.  This is happening at Brittains, the motor car assembly plant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With due respect, Sir, it does because the bus services are not a help to the workers.  The buses do not meet the time schedules and, as a result, people are continually late.  When accommodation is being offered to workers, their place of employment must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>A short time ago the Minister for Transport and Power told us there was not a drop in tourism during the year and he was quite adamant when Deputies told him otherwise.  However, in his statement today he tells us :</P>
      <P>While the board's coach tours continued to expand in 1969-70, the hoped-for development was retarded due to the disturbances in Northern Ireland, which were responsible for the cancellation of many bookings. </P>
      <P>This statement puzzles me because it is in direct contradiction to what he said previously.  I should like the Minister to explain the statement contained in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE must be regarded as an essential service but they must have a proper <Col N="729" /> policy.  They must do all they can to help the workers, many of whom have monotonous jobs.  CIE should have a proper policy for the public.  There should be a constant effort on their part to improve conditions by the provision of bus shelters and so on.  CIE should not hesitate to make demands on the gardaí or Dublin Corporation to ensure that they are allowed to run their services in an efficient manner.  It is not enough for a CIE official to write back and ask us what suggestions we can make because we are not involved with CIE or aware of all that is happening.  I carried out an investigation and I made certain suggestions but the onus is on CIE to do this themselves. CIE should get in touch with the Department of Local Government and with the Dublin Corporation when certain improvements are necessary.</P>
    <P>Unnecessary expenditure in the publication of elaborate reports should be condemned.  In many cases a simple report is all that is required and the glossy publications that are produced are a gross extravagance.  The Minister should tell CIE to effect economies in matters of this nature.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us what it costs to keep in operation the large offices in Los Angeles, New York and even in Dublin.  If we must have offices abroad surely we can share accommodation with travel agents without any adverse effects on our tourist efforts?  It seems ludicrous to open up large offices in other countries for a national transport service that is crumbling.</P>
    <P>CIE should make a serious effort to improve train services in suburban areas.  There are many people in CIE who only want to change the bus signs and the traffic signals.  This nonsense should be stopped.  CIE have a demanding task; they should be concerned about this and do something to improve the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement is admirable in that he has accepted the stark fact that CIE must be kept in operation by State subvention. The Minister reminds those of us who may be a little longwinded that the Bill must be enacted before the Christmas recess, as otherwise CIE <Col N="730" /> could run short of cash before the end of January.</P>
      <P>The Minister has adopted a factual approach in this matter.  In many ways, CIE are the national Aunt Sally and it frequently happens that people work off their frustration by having a bash at CIE.  I am not suggesting that the organisation does not deserve some criticism.  The shadow of Watt and Stephenson hangs over CIE because when these men made their discoveries regarding the steam engine they hoped for improvements which eventually came about.  The Minister has said that the measures proposed now are of an <i>ad hoc</i> nature to deal with the company's financial difficulties during the current year.  CIE needs more than a mere patching up of its wounds; an injection of cash once or twice yearly.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest problems is the question of industrial relations.  The Minister gave figures for the amount of money lost by CIE through strikes. It is neither my duty nor my intention to criticise either side involved in these strikes.  Indeed, some of the strikes which affected CIE took place in other concerns but CIE had a consequent loss of revenue through loss of passengers or goods carried.  Some time ago the Government, realising that CIE's industrial relations were pretty bad, appointed to the board a member of the Oireachtas, a trade union leader and a very fine and very able man. This man accepted the nomination to the board and there was some criticism about his appointment.  After a short time he resigned from the board.  This was a great loss to CIE and to their workers.  The wisdom, energy and dedication of this man could have resulted in the shaping of a new charter in human and industrial relations within CIE.  However, now we have to carry on as best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dowling mentioned, perhaps the very apex in this whole disastrous industrial relations system there has been reached through the placing of a contract abroad for £2½ million of rolling stock which contract has been lost because of some disagreement in CIE.  I do not know whether we are all going mad or not that in this small country we should think we can afford <Col N="731" /> to have differences on a point like this and sacrifice a contract for £2½ million. Apart from the loss in wages and salaries to CIE employees, apart from the injury to our national pride there is the fact that we could have built this rolling stock here just as well as they can build it in Luton or where-ever they make this stock.  The point is that if we could have reduced our trade balance with Britain by £2½ million it would have been regarded as a tremendous achievement but in our blindness we cannot agree in CIE on what we should do and so the contract is placed outside the country.</P>
    <P>If some firm here decided that on a matter of costs they would place a contract worth such a sum abroad there would be national protests and street marches but because this happened the way it did we must not touch the sacred cow of non-agreement in labour relations and we must see our workers deprived of a £2½ million contract, some 70 per cent of which, I suppose, would go in wages.  Everybody in and associated with CIE has got to tackle this question of industrial relations.  The Dublin bus crews, the conductors, drivers and inspectors are one of the finest sections of our workers.  You will find among them a dedication to duty despite all the obstacles put in their way and the irritations they encounter.  They serve the people very well indeed.  Very often CIE are blamed for the lack of good bus services.</P>
    <P>If the committee to which the Minister refers succeed in their productivity study it may well mean a much brighter future for CIE personnel in general. I am one of the people who believe that the high level of wages will not matter so much if you can have a really fine production effort.  If in this matter we could copy the continentals, who can pay tremendously high salaries because they have this very high productivity rate, we would be doing well.  This should be the aim of CIE. We do know, as Deputy Dowling pointed out, that some CIE workers are very badly paid.  I feel ashamed when I think about the pensions which are paid to their ex-workers.  They are the lowest in the country.  I would like <Col N="732" /> to know from the Minister how much of this subsidy will go to increase those pensions.  Perhaps none of it will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If it does not, then it is to the collective shame of the Oireachtas.  In regard to the Dublin bus services, to blame CIE for bad services is only partly justified.  If a traffic-jam occurs buses just cannot get through. That is just one problem they have. It is impossible to operate a 20th century bus service through a city which in some parts dates back to the 18th century.  The strange contradiction in the whole problem is that the more affluent we become the greater will be CIE's problem.  For many years I did not use a car and instead I travelled by bus every day in the week.  I found that I had to sit waiting in buses in traffic jams for a long time or I had to stand waiting for a bus to turn up because of traffic jams and I was forced to buy a car.  I know I add to ClE's problems if I drive into the city on my own, as do 90 per cent of car drivers.  I realise that a bus must take its place behind all the cars and wait until we all move on.  A bus will carry some 70 to 80 people and if buses had clearways we would have a better bus service and more people would get to work in time.</P>
      <P>Last year I suggested that all bus routes within a mile of O'Connell Bridge should be made clearways so that buses would have easy access to and from O'Connell Bridge.  This would speed up services considerably and reduce complaints and irritations. Until we get a modem road pattern CIE will have this trouble in the city.</P>
      <P>I want to criticise CIE on two points. One is in regard to their fare structure in the city.  How the lower paid worker can pay his fares and still live is a problem.  CIE took the easy way out by upping the Dublin city bus fares because this brought in the most revenue. I do not know how well this proposal was examined but a man living in Ballymum, say, and travelling to the south side is using a big part of his weekly pay packet in fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years we pressed for a worker's ticket in the city.  I do not particularly like the description &ldquo;worker's ticket&rdquo;<Col N="733" /> but we should have a bus user's ticket which would be at a rate which the worker could afford.  This would attract more passengers.  At present a vicious circle in regard to fares is starting again.  The higher the fares the fewer people use the buses, revenue drops and then we have to provide a bigger subsidy which the people also pay for through taxation.  The Dublin city passengers are paying higher bus rates and higher taxation, so they just cannot win.  Perhaps some day CIE will make an all-out effort to attract bus and rail passengers.  They just have not done this.  They always seem to be defending their actions and seldom come forward with new ideas for a better bus service at cheaper rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that inflation was the cause of many of CIE's problems and of course it is but I do not think you help matters simply by increasing bus fares on the sections which are paying best because people will just not go on paying higher fares all the time for services which are not improved.</P>
    <P>An effort must be made to attract more travellers by ensuring that a good bus service is provided at the lowest possible cost.  The people of this city are not seeking anything for nothing and they appreciate the difficulties experienced by CIE.  However, unless the company change their outlook, there will be a continuance of the decline in the numbers of people using bus services.  At some time in the future it may even be necessary to introduce a free bus service for the city.  This might not be a bad idea. People would drive their cars to the outskirts of the city centre and take a bus into the city proper.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dowling has said, there appears to be an obsession that every bus must cross O'Connell Bridge. Nelson's Pillar, before it disappeared, was the focal point but now the focal point is the bridge.  Ring roads could be utilised to a much greater extent.</P>
    <P>One aspect of CIE policy on which I condemn them was their decision to close the Harcourt Street-Bray line. They did this with indecent haste.  Perhaps the line was not paying its way <Col N="734" /> and its closing down on a temporary basis might have been justified but CIE have demolished the bridges and have allowed the erection of buildings on parts of the track.  If it was proved that it was not possible to continue the rail service, the line could have been examined as a possible new road from Dublin to Bray.  Anybody who has travelled on the Bray road will realise that there is a great need for an alternative road.  The railway line could have been rebuilt as a roadway, at a modest cost.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to fault CIE where they are not guilty but it is obvious that the human relations situation within the company is the kernel of a great deal of the trouble that is being experienced.  I am not an upholder of State monopolies but I would remind those who are that most of our industrial unrest is to be found in State companies and in the public services.</P>
    <P>Until such time as there is permanent legislation in respect of public transport, those who retire from CIE will receive no more than the pittance that is now being paid to the company's retired workers.  If industrial democracy should come about in the future, I would hope that the person representing the workers in CIE would not be forced to resign as was the case some time ago when a Government nominee to the board was forced to resign.  I deplore the fact that this excellent trade union leader, this man of great vision and ability, was forced to resign.  I do not know who was appointed in his place but with all due respect I would say that no one could surpass the original nominee of the Government.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the examining body get down to work immediately.  I am aware of the Minister's interest in the transport problem both of this city and of the country as a whole but we cannot continue much longer to patch up the ailing body of CIE by the granting of twice-yearly subventions.  Something more is called for and that is the complete reorganisation of our public transport service.  This must be done immediately. I do not wish to hear anybody criticise the Government for increasing taxation. <Col N="735" /> CIE, in their present form, will never pay their way.  Unless there is this reorganisation I have mentioned, there will be a need in, perhaps, two years time to increase the subventions very substantially.  It is not that I object to our doing that if it would ensure an efficient service but if CIE continue to operate in the shadow of a 19th century railway system, they will not be a viable proposition.</P>
    <P>It may be said there is no country in the world that has a paying national transport system.  In any country I know of, both the railway system and the bus system are subsidised.  Perhaps we could give a lead in this regard and provide a service to suit the needs of our people, a service that, in addition, would be an attraction from the tourist point of view.  The Oireachtas, the trade unions and the management of CIE must tackle this whole matter. Otherwise, the future might prove very difficult for CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to be brief in my contribution but as a Deputy from the west of Ireland, there are a few points I should like to raise. First of all I must say I appreciate that down through the years CIE have modernised in many ways.  Travel facilities now provided by the company are much better than they were some years ago.  At the same time, as one who has travelled on other lines, I must say that in the west and, particularly in the Mayo region, the best railway carriages are not always provided. It appears that if there are any inferior carriages at headquarters, they are pressed into service when our people come home from England.  It is hardly fair to these people.  If we have to make do with substandard carriages they should not all be pushed into the west of Ireland service.  The coaches to the north and to the south, to Cork and other places, are superior to those used, for instance, on the line from Westland Row to Ballina, Claremorris and Westport.  The standard generally has improved down through the years, and for that we are grateful, but when there is pressure on CIE, with extra passengers coming home at <Col N="736" /> Christmas and other seasonal times of the year, they should see to it that these carriages are properly heated and that the passengers are properly treated.</P>
      <P>We in the west have experienced the closure of some of our branch lines, the branch lines to Ballinrobe and other centres.  There were many protests years ago when the branch line to Achill was closed down, but it was part of the process of tearing up branch lines and it went on to the detriment certainly of the tourist business in Achill.  If that rail service were available to Achill today it would mean a great tourist boost to that region.</P>
      <P>However, that is past history.  I am mainly concerned with the people in my immediate neighbourhood, the people of Ballina and its hinterland, the people who have to travel from Ballinrobe, Ballycastle, Crossmolina, Enniscrone in County Sligo, and other centres and use the rail service from Ballina to Dublin.  In recent times an additional train service was put on but that is still inadequate.  There should be at least three services up and down per day.  There is a bus laid on from Ballina which travels through Foxford, my own home town, Swinford, Kiltimagh, Balla and then on to Claremorris, and a considerable amount of time is wasted.</P>
      <P>People should not have to rely on a bus which makes detours, which collects passengers, delivers newspapers and other items along the way, with consequent delay to the passengers.  Let me say from first-hand knowledge that that bus, particularly in the mornings and at this time of year, is very poorly heated.  It is very unfair that people who are sick or mothers who have to take sick children to hospitals or clinics here in Dublin should have to leave their warm, comfortable homes, go out on the roadside and board a bus which is extremely cold and uncomfortable. It is certainly not conducive to the welfare of the patient travelling. These may seem to be small things but they are not small to the people concerned. It has been brought to my notice that these journeys have caused a deterioration in the condition of some of these people on arrival in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The train which passes through <Col N="737" /> Ballina and goes on to Foxford and Ballyvary should make a stop at Foxford. Many of us who travel to Dublin quite often are aware of the obvious congestion to which Deputy Moore referred.  Some years ago it was fashionable for people to travel to Dublin by car but from conversations I have had with people I have found that, especially in winter when there is frost and fog and driving conditions generally are bad, people from the western region are reluctant to use their private cars except in an emergency. If a rail service were laid on, with stops at the stations I have mentioned, I am sure many people would avail of such a service.  In any case there should be a stop at Foxford, which is an industrial town, for a couple of minutes.  It would not be necessary to go to the expense of opening up the railway station and staffing it.  The checker on the train could issue tickets to passengers.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that trains will stop at Foxford at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the necessity for CIE to seek financial assistance from this House once or twice a year when they are unable to make ends meet.  I am of the opinion, like Deputy Moore, that there are so many people employed in CIE and it is such a valuable service to the economy that it must be kept in business, regardless of the cost. Tourism is a very important industry and is of particular interest to people in the western region, especially areas which are noted for their scenic beauty. No other form of transport is acceptable to many people and therefore we must keep the service going and, where possible, even expand and improve it.</P>
    <P>On the general principle of subsidising CIE I have always held the view, and I expressed it as far back as 1952, that there is no real incentive for a company to pay its way when it knows that if it is short of money this House will give a blank cheque, so to speak. This principle is wrong; it was always wrong.  I remember a former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, saying that when our railways were modernised it might be possible to break even.  I do not want to misrepresent him but I recall him saying <Col N="738" /> that so many economies would be effected that the problem would become less and less as time went on.  I disagreed with him about this.</P>
    <P>If CIE examined all their operations I am sure they would find many economies could be made without impairing the service.  It should be possible to improve the service and economise at the same time.  Day in and day out I see ten and 12 ton CIE trucks travelling around the country delivering and collecting packages and on each of these trucks is a driver and a helper.  In fact, I have availed of this service from time to time.  It does not surprise me, and this is no reflection on the driver or the helper, that this delivery service should be a drain on the resources of CIE.</P>
    <P>CIE should hand over this type of delivery service to private haulage contractors because private contractors could organise themselves in such a way that they could make money where CIE are losing money.  I have had an opportunity of examining such a suggestion at first hand because in the west of Ireland a number of small companies own trucks.  Some people who started off from very humble beginnings have found their businesses growing and growing; and if the carriage of such goods was handed over to companies such as these it would be a great saving to CIE.</P>
    <P>Mayo County Council employ a number of small contractors.  They do their work efficiently and they are in good time in the morning.  There is no need to have inspectors driving around in motor cars because very often the owner himself is engaged on the job. He will see to it that the work is done efficiently and economically.  It is not possible for a company the size of CIE to have the same efficiency and flexibility as these small contractors can have.  I have seen a private contractor after he has finished working for the council in the evening go over to the local gravel pit, put on a load of gravel and haul it into Ballina or some other town and collect £5 or £6 for doing so.  This almost covers the week's running costs.  There is not the slightest danger that any CIE driver <Col N="739" /> would do this because he works a set number of hours and when he finishes he goes home.  This is the reason why these people can outdo big companies like CIE.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I engaged CIE to haul goods from the west of Ireland to the North Wall.  I paid them between £150 and £180 a month for the haulage of these goods which I was exporting.  When I took charge of the business I decided to put a truck of my own on the road to haul these goods.  Trucks were, of course, cheaper at that time but a truck which cost me £700 was out of debt in 14 weeks. At the same time CIE were going into the red and could not make their business pay.  It is true to say that the truck was used for longer hours than CIE trucks, but that is not to say I engaged in slave labour : a driver received fair wages and conditions.</P>
    <P>The directors of CIE should look at all the company's operations and see where economies can be effected.  If the organisation were made smaller, particularly in rural areas, and work given to private contractors, this would be a step in the right direction, and I say that from my own personal knowledge and experience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke about industrial relations.  I suppose there is no use in crying over spilled milk but I have never known a company to throw away business as recklessly as CIE have done.  This arose because of strikes, lockouts, bad labour relations and a variety of other reasons.  There are perishable commodities, like fruit and fish, which must be transported as quickly as possible.  If there is a strike and these goods are held up for two or three days they quickly become unfit for human consumption and have to be destroyed.  Those who engage in producing and selling such commodities cannot afford to take chances. Most of them are small people who cannot risk the losses involved in the event of a strike affecting their goods. The result is that these people provide their own transport as do a great many of the big firms in Dublin, such as Jacobs, Guinness and so on.  They will not risk having their goods transported <Col N="740" /> by CIE because of the danger of a strike.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year seasonal goods are being delivered all over the country.  These goods must be sold at this time of the year.  The purveyors of these goods will not transport them by CIE because they cannot run the risk of delivery being held up.  A business firm would ensure that it would not lose business.  I could not take the risk of using CIE.  I was a small customer, £150 a month, but there are thousands like me.  Thousands of firms have provided their own private transport because CIE failed to put their house in order.  Time has been lost and money has been lost, but it is not too late even now for CIE to employ experts who would advise them on how to run their service efficiently and well. It is no good ordinary people making suggestions; they are only wasting their time.  I am afraid that is because CIE know they can come back here year after year for more money and get it.</P>
    <P>There was a rumour recently that CIE were contemplating pulling up more railway lines, thereby closing more railway stations.  That should not be allowed to happen.  We labour under many disadvantages in the west.  In the case of Mayo and Sligo we labour under many difficulties from the point of view of transport.  Any raw materials we need have to be brought in and the finished article has to be taken out again.  It is well nigh impossible for any industrial project in the west to compete successfully on world markets because of this serious overhead. I appeal to the Minister to reduce the freight charges in and out of the west.  We have a declining population; we have fewer people and those fewer people are in the older age groups.  This decline will continue. Special consideration by way of cheap transport is a must where the west is concerned.  If that concession is not granted there is very little chance for the industrialisation there that we all desire.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about this before and the Minister for Lands, a colleague of mine, commented favourably on my speech.  I advocated industries for the west.  Our desire to see more industrial <Col N="741" /> employment can never be met unless we have a satisfactory transport system which will favour the growth of industrial development.  I appeal to the Minister to take a look at this whole problem.  The <i>Western People</i> has been advocating such a policy for quite a long time.  It is a policy with which both the Minister for Lands and I thoroughly agree.  It is a policy commended by development and tourist associations in the west.  Talk is not enough.  We want action.  Nothing would benefit the west so much as the provision of cheap transport for the raw materials we need and for the finished article going out. I appeal to the Minister to bring forcibly the few points I have made to the attention of CIE.</P>
    <P>I certainly would oppose and deplore any tearing up of more branch lines. Our rates in Mayo are high enough. Without our branch lines, we shall have to put more heavy trucks or heavy lorries on the roads with more and more damage to our roads and a greater and greater bill to be paid by our ratepayers and taxpayers in respect of roads which are completely unsuitable for the heavy vehicle type of traffic which CIE operate.  We have a special problem in Mayo and in the west of Ireland.  If CIE improve their services for that region it could bring great benefit and hope to the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past few days we have been very critical of the action of the Chair in dealing with certain matters.  On this Bill the Chair has been so lenient that the debate has spread from one end of the country to the other and every possible aspect of public transport has been debated. Possibly this is a good idea.  I do not think that I have heard such a wide-ranging debate on a Bill to provide £2.98 million, nearly £3 million.  Is this money in addition to the £24 million included in the mini-Budget a few weeks ago or is it part of that Budget? I see somebody shaking his head.  I assume, therefore, this is an additional sum which will have to come out of the taxpayer's pocket later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people on the Government benches seemed to labour the point that CIE were responsible for <Col N="742" /> the losses.  Maybe they are right.  On more than one occasion the Labour Party advocated that more account should be taken by the Minister of what the semi-State bodies under his control are doing.  I have in mind now the loss of a £2½ million contract which went to a British firm.  If the work could not be done by CIE, it should have been given to an Irish firm.  It is all right for somebody who does not like trade unions to say &ldquo;Some trade union official bungled it and they were responsible for what happened&rdquo;.  I will not accept that.  Somebody must be responsible to ensure that, before a contract of that magnitude is placed abroad, with all the ensuing consequences, every avenue is explored with a view to placing it in Ireland.  Not only does it mean finding £2½ million to be paid to a foreign country but there is a consequent loss of employment here and the various other factors which derive therefrom.  The Minister must take his full share of responsibility for this.  He must have agreed to the placing of the contract in Britain. If he had not advance information of CIE's intention then he is not doing his job.</P>
    <P>Dublin is not Ireland and the sooner people realise that fact the better for all concerned.  To those who say that the Dublin city bus service is carrying CIE I would retort that the services operating within a radius of 40 miles of the city are the biggest earners for CIE. It was true that Dublin was carrying CIE on its back but it is no longer true.</P>
    <P>The Minister said :</P>
    <P>The net profit of the Dublin city services was only £61,000 in 1969-70 on a turnover of £7.7 million and, on the basis of present estimates, these services will show a net loss of £280,000 in 1970-71. </P>
    <P>I want to put that on the record again because some people think that all of us who come from the country are living off the fare-paying bus passengers in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The last increase in fares seems to have been based on an extraordinary arrangement whereby, in the country districts, short-distance passengers were <Col N="743" /> charged exorbitant rates.  If some of the Dublin city passengers and workers who have to pay a considerable portion of their pay packet every week on travelling to and from their work had to pay 7s or 8s for a five-mile distance or so&mdash;which is quite common in the country districts&mdash;they would understand what being fleeced by CIE really means.</P>

      <P>CIE have now raised their fares to the point of diminishing returns.  The Dublin city fares have proved that the higher they are raised the lower is the yield.  CIE must <Col N="744" /> realise that value must be given for money.  Four people can now hire a taxi in Dublin at a cheaper rate than CIE charges for four people on a bus. It is time CIE stopped to think.</P>
      <P>Traffic chaos has been mentioned by a number of Deputies.  I do not agree with the idea that the way to solve city traffic congestion is to refuse to allow private cars through the centre of Dublin.  I drive through Dublin several times a day, as many others do, and I believe the chaos is caused by the buses.  Why is it necessary for CIE to drive all their buses through O'Connell Street?  It was said when Nelson's Pillar was unceremoniously removed from O'Connell Street that the appearance of the street was improved immensely.  I agree.  But who thought of making a bus park almost on the site of the pillar?  Who decided that was the proper place to park buses for most of the day so that it is now impossible to see O'Connell Street from end to end just as it was when Nelson's Pillar was there?  Why is it necessary to park buses in O'Connell Street at all?  Why is it necessary for all buses to go through O'Connell Street?  It is the main street but surely it should be possible so to route buses that they do not have to drive through the centre of the city?</P>
      <P>While I have the greatest sympathy with bus drivers, driving behind one of those vehicles which pull in and out at their own convenience is not pleasant.  While motorists in the street may say they are pushed around I suppose if any of us were driving buses and trying to make time as these drivers are, we would do the same thing.  It is no joy to drive through a street thick with traffic with a bus before or behind you.  It is an unnerving experience.  Bus drivers must do their job and timetables are pretty tight although when one sees half-a-dozen buses lined up at one point one wonders if they are really so tight.</P>
      <P>The question in regard to the transport system depends on whether we believe it should pay its way.  I am amazed at the reference by the Minister, which goes back to the Lemass era, where he says :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE have a statutory obligation <Col N="745" /> to break even, taking one year with another, with the aid of the annual grant and the revised grant of £2.65 million which was regarded as a realistic estimate of the minimum subsidy on which CIE could get by, during the five-year period ending 31st March, 1974.... </P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Childers when he was Minister for Transport and Power talking here about the necessity for CIE to break even.  That idea has been handed on from one Minister to another but we all know, as does any Minister with commonsense, that CIE cannot break even.  We do not ask that sewage or water schemes should pay their way.  They are social services and I believe public transport must be so considered also.  Although some Deputies might be inclined to laugh at what was said by some Dublin Deputies who referred to the time when we would have a free public transport system, this might not be so far away.  That must be a possibility.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if when people talk of the losses incurred by CIE due to strikes, they realise who is responsible for the strikes.  Usually, the trade unions and the workers are blamed in that they were unreasonable, but all that is necessary is to check on any wage demand made on CIE through the years, the first offer made by CIE and then the final settlement. It is then very easy to see who was unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical of people who consider that they are just earning a living like any other workers but CIE have a group of people responsible for labour relations in that company.  I have had experience of one of them.  As this is mentioned in the Minister's introductory speech I suggest I am in order in referring to it.  CIE supply school transport and I had the experience of going to the Labour Court to meet a CIE official who was dealing with those employed to drive school buses.  That man, in my opinion, did the same as William Martin Murphy did in 1913: he said he would not make any offer for the drivers collectively but he would deal with each one individually if each case was made to him individually.  There are hundreds <Col N="746" /> of drivers.  This is the type of attitude that has caused the strikes in CIE. Labour relations in CIE are bad because of this attitude and I believe the Minister should do something about it.  It is no use saying CIE are responsible for their own labour relations. In view of the fact that again and again we have had reference in Ministers' speeches here to the fact that so many hundreds of thousands of pounds are lost because of strikes, the Minister should find out who is responsible for the strikes.  I am sure he will find out, as I did, that when you begin dealing with an impossible person who thinks he is God and is always right and is not prepared to give an inch, there is no question of negotiating. There is only one thing such a person can understand.  If a strike continues week after week until eventually the revenue stops he then begins to change his mind.</P>
    <P>In order to prevent that kind of thing continuing the Minister should ensure that those responsible for wage negotiations in CIE are ordinary human beings prepared to see the two sides of a story and prepared to negotiate.  It should not be left to one person to decide not alone the destiny of the CIE workers but that of thousands of workers throughout the country who are affected when a strike takes place. They spend almost as much money advertising in the newspapers how right they are as would pay the increases which are sought in the first place. This nonsense must stop.  I join with Deputy Moore in his regret that Senator Jimmy Dunne did not remain on the board of CIE because he could have brought a breath of sanity to that board in dealing with labour relations.</P>

      <P>I am very perturbed about the Minister's reference to railways where he says :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Railway losses of over £5.6 million per annum cannot, however, be accepted with equanimity and I have, therefore, set up a joint committee comprising representatives of my own Department, the Department of Finance and CIE to investigate <Col N="747" /> the deterioration in CIE's financial position and to identify possible corrective measures. </P>
    <P>The last time I heard a comment like that by a Minister for Transport and Power it was followed by the closing of branch lines, by the tearing up of branch lines, by the tearing down of bridges, by the sale&mdash;to Poland I think &mdash;of the lines in case somebody would change his mind and decide to run the trains again.  I fear the corrective measures the Minister refers to here are more branch line closures.  Before the Minister does anything like that I would ask him to come back to this House and have whatever he or CIE propose to do debated before a final step is taken.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as so many people have said here this evening, that if the Harcourt Street line was opened again it would never be closed.  Those of us who travel around the country find every day in the week that the roads are cluttered up with heavy lorries which are employed to bring goods from one place to the other where formerly the railways carried those goods and where, if the railways were still in existence, the goods could be carried instead of on the roads.  I should like somebody to estimate the additional cost of making and maintaining roads to carry the weight of traffic which has been forced on them by the economies of Deputy Childers, when he was Minister for Transport and Power, when he closed the railways with such unseemly haste.</P>
    <P>I have a document here which is a report on regional development and refers to County Meath.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Infrastructure&rdquo; there is a subheading &ldquo;Railways&rdquo; which states :</P>
    <P>Meath is served by a CIE branch line running from Drogheda via Navan to the Gypsum complex near Kingscourt.  This is a freight line.  A more concerted effort by CIE to attract freight from the industrial complex at Navan might increase traffic and relieve pressure of heavy vehicles on the roads.  This proposal is worthy of special study by CIE as inquiries from local industrialists have shown that not alone are they <Col N="748" /> not aware of CIE rates but most of them have forgotten that CIE serve the towns in that area. </P>
    <P>We hear of CIE offices in American cities.  I do not know what they ar,e doing there or what they hope to sell there.  We find that at a time when they have those offices in America they are very anxious to close branch lines, branch offices and even depots in country districts where with the expenditure of a reasonable amount of money they could get quite a lot of traffic.  It makes me wonder if this is another section of CIE which could do with a little enlightenment and encouragement from the Department.  It is a bit of a cod if the taxpayers of this country are to be put into the position that because of bad management, and it does not appear to be anything else, the public transport system of this country is to be allowed year after year to do all the wrongs and then come back into this House asking Papa for the money when things go the way they did not expect they would go.</P>
    <P>There are so many things which have been discussed during the debate before the House that I do not want to detain the House much longer.  However, I want to ask the Minister for Transport and Power to take much greater interest in dealing with the board of CIE and the activities of this board than he has done up to this.  It is quite obvious from the few points I mentioned here this evening that the Minister apparently has not had very much time to deal with CIE or indeed with any of the other State-sponsored bodies under his control during the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>People are very anxious, when referring to the question of increased costs, to point to the wage earners and salary earners employed by CIE and claim they are responsible for the increases which have occurred.  It is only fair to repeat what two Deputies in the Minister's party said earlier this evening, that is that there are still a big number of badly paid workers in the employment of CIE.  There are people in the employment of CIE whose wages are almost as low if not lower than that of farm workers who are supposed to be the worst paid workers in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> When somebody speaks about excessive wages being paid to people employed in the public transport this fact should be brought home to them. Deputy O'Hara felt the same way when he spoke about a private concern being able to undercut CIE with regard to transport from the west to Dublin.  We should all remember that the people who are employed by CIE are only looking for a decent rate of wages.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has an arrangement with regard to school buses which has resulted in a very substantial payment to CIE.  They are not alone getting the payment which the State has arranged but a new arrangement has been entered into this year since the summer holidays which bears investigation by the Department of Transport and Power.  I refer to the question of the children who, if there is room on the bus for them, are asked to pay.  The usual figure is £3 18s, which I understand does not go to the Department of Education but to CIE. The Department of Education are paying for the buses to CIE and therefore the buses should run for the Department of Education.  CIE, like any other body, cannot have it both ways.  I am aware of a number of children in some areas who are required to pay what I consider to be excessive charges for the purpose of travelling on a school bus because they are only 2.9 miles away from the school and if they were three miles away they would get free transport.</P>
    <P>This matter should not be allowed to go on any longer.  If the bus is paid for by the Department of Education then all the children who can fit on that bus should travel on it and there should not be any question of having extra payments made.  I was amazed, when I made some inquiries about this, to be told that CIE had in fact appointed extra inspectors for the purpose of checking the children going on those buses.  Maybe the extra fee being charged to the children is required to pay the wages of the inspectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill before the House.  It is with some reluctance that I rise to support it.  I do so in the knowledge that although I appreciate <Col N="750" /> that this money is necessary in the circumstances, I feel that a far greater effort is required on the part of those who are responsible for the administration of our transport services in the country, but particularly in the city.  I am concerned mainly with the city and I have to agree with many speakers from the city constituencies in relation to the inadequate and deteriorating bus services we experience.  I am a bus user and I can speak with personal knowledge.</P>
      <P>On the Estimate for the Department for Transport and Power I made some points and although I do not like being repetitive I feel I should refer to them again on this Bill.  First of all, I would say that this document is depressing in many ways.  We have had wide experience with our national transport system and yet we have failed to produce an efficient and economic transport system.  Not alone have we failed in the area of passenger transport but we have also failed in the area of freight transport.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out-and I think we should view this with apprehension&mdash;that over 7,000,000 fewer passengers were carried in 1969-70 than in the preceding year and that compared with 1964-65 the number of passengers is down by almost 28,000,000. These are very depressing and significant figures.  I see a gleam of hope in the Minister's speech where he refers to the inter-departmental committee he has set up to examine the implications of the problems these figures present.</P>
      <P>If I am critical of CIE I am not critical of those who man the day-to-day services.  I blame the management. I do so consciously because, if the CIE services in Dublin city have lost 7,000,000 passengers in one year, there are reasons for that.  The greater use of motor cars is a contributing factor.  It is not unfair for anyone to suggest that there was also a failure by the CIE management to pursue business.  They have adhered rigidly to traditional routes established over 30 years ago and, in spite of the growing and expanding suburbs of the city, they have failed to anticipate the passenger capacity and potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a call today from several <Col N="751" /> Deputies, which I support, for more radial services.  My experience of CIE in relation to the running of the services is that when complaints are made, in general traffic conditions are advanced as an excuse for inadequate services and delayed services.  I am not in agreement with that.  I have pointed this out before.  Outside peak hours on some routes I have witnessed three buses travelling in convoy. I have been in O'Connell Street on several occasions between 8 and 9 o'clock at night and I have seen long queues at certain bus stops and then three buses coming along. I do not know who is to blame for that. I just mention these matters to suggest that whatever is wrong is wrong organisationally.  With the resources at the disposal of an organisation like CIE a more efficient service could be provided.</P>
    <P>The public had to pay substantially increased bus fares in the past few months.  They have accepted that graciously.  At the same time the majority feel that they are being badly served.  Nobody cavils at paying high bus fares or increased bus fares but they do object to and are resentful of the fact that they are not getting an efficient and reliable service.  In my opinion, CIE have failed to provide that service in Dublin city at any rate, or on many routes in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Considering the problems he is facing in regard to road transport and rail transport, I hope the Minister will use his influence to bring about a greater improvement in the Dublin bus services.  There are several areas in this city in which new routes could be opened up but apparently it is the policy of CIE management to go out and count heads first and see how many passengers they will get before putting on a bus.  That seems to be the attitude and the approach.  That is wrong.  There is no reason, for instance, why CIE should not experiment with more one-man buses and single-decker buses for the various outlying areas to provide feeder services for the main routes.  That would relieve much of the congestion at bus stops in the outlying areas.</P>
    <P>In areas like Coolock I have seen <Col N="752" /> people waiting for perhaps up to half an hour for a bus to different parts of the city.  Unfortunately it is a not uncommon experience for people to have to wait for 20 minutes or 30 minutes, or even up to 40 minutes, before they can get the bus they want.  Whatever happens on weekdays applies perhaps more significantly on Sundays and particularly on fine Sundays.  Apparently the organisation is not geared to deal with an exodus of people to seaside resorts.  If a person wants to get to Howth he has to come into the city. Howth is nine miles from O'Connell Street and if he lives 4½ miles away he has to travel 4½ miles into O'Connell Street before he is assured of getting transport to Howth.  These may be small matters but they are important in relation to providing a proper and efficient public transport service.  The development of these services in these days of competition with motor owners is very important.  If the company made an effort to compete for business against the motor cars they would do much better if the public could be assured of frequent buses to their destinations.</P>
    <P>The question of running night services has been raised before.  I think I referred to it on the last occasion I spoke on this matter.  Since then I have seen that that has been turned down by the management.  I would bear with that for the present if I could see some steps being taken to improve the day-to-day services in our city.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to those who operate our bus services at the moment.  They are doing a very difficult task and they are coping under very difficult conditions.  I should also like to mention the plight of old CIE pensioners.  Working in the south-west by-election in the Inchicore area I met many former CIE employees who are existing on miserable pensions, pensions which were determined very many years ago.  I know the Minister has since improved their lot and I hope he will see his way to improve their lot still further and provide them with some little extra in the evening of their lives.  They are very fine people.  They are people with a <Col N="753" /> long tradition of service with the railways. Inchicore was a transport centre in our country and they devoted all their lives to transport and had a special interest in it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear those points in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement said that the unhappy financial difficulty in which CIE find themselves is due to inflation. Inflation may well be a contributory cause.  However, my recollection of CIE over the years I have been in this House is that their losses have seldom gone below the £ million mark and that it is the exception rather than the rule for them to go below the £ million mark.  This is understandable because of the fact that as a semi-State institution they enjoy a privilege which nobody else enjoys.  First of all, they have more or less a virtual monopoly in transport in the country.  Secondly, for any money they lose they come in here with monotonous regularity and we, the Members of Oireachtas Éireann, must vote them that money. Otherwise, public transport would cease to exist.  Thirdly, we are denied the right to raise any matter whatever in regard to CIE by way of parliamentary question.  If we ask a question we are told it is a matter of day-to-day administration.  CIE are in the happy position that they need not bother about anything until such time as a Bill has to be brought forward to recoup their losses or we have the annual discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is no regulation which prohibits his answering questions in relation to CIE. It would be to the advantage of the national exchequer for him to do so because it might encourage them to try to lose less money than they are losing. It is only about ten years ago since the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Seán Lemass, brought a Bill in here with a scheme under which CIE were to be made solvent in five years and we were told they would not have to come back to the State for any more money.  Since then they would have been continuously <Col N="754" /> broke but for the generosity of Members of this House voting them money to exist.</P>
    <P>I do not think CIE run their affairs very well, particularly in the city of Dublin.  Nobody can congratulate them on their bus service.  The Minister has said they have lost quite a number of passengers this year and attributes this to transport difficulties.  I do not very often travel by bus but I take a certain interest in the management of CIE in Dublin.  I have stood alongside bus queues and seen four or five buses of the same number all together going in the same direction.  Sometimes one has to wait a considerable time for a bus to a particular area and while one is waiting the same buses are sweeping by all the time.  That shows grave mismanagement.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister ever considered the system of urban transport which is used in practically every European city?  There is a standardised fee in practically all European cities for buses and trolley buses.  A person can get into a bus and travel for any distance he likes for a prescribed sum. It may seem that that would not be an advantage.  The Minister told us today that the failure of CIE to keep the Dublin buses fully used in order to make the money they made previously and to carry the same number of passengers is due to traffic conditions. Does it not occur to the Minister that, if he instituted this scheme, many people who come in from outlying districts by car might cease to use their cars because it would be more economical to travel by bus?  I know from talking to porters and assistants and people in the different Departments that a tremendous number use their own transport because they say they cannot afford to use public transport. If we had the standardised fee here many more people would use public transport, fewer cars would come into the city and there would not be the cluttering up of traffic that exists at present.  I would ask the Minister to consider this.  There is nothing novel about it.  It is done everywhere else.</P>
    <P>CIE are ordering new railway coaches.  I suggest that if they looked after the old ones and kept them in <Col N="755" /> any sort of workable order it would be to the advantage of the company.  The windows are not cleaned.  The seats are dirty.  In wintertime they are not properly heated.  It is quite usual for engines to break down.  Perhaps we are singularly unlucky on what was the old Dublin South Eastern Railway but I hardly ever get into a train on which there is not a breakdown.  That, I am told, is due to lack of servicing.  There is no use spending huge sums of money on new coaches unless the old ones are kept in proper working order.  If we do spend this huge sum, and it is exported money because we are buying them outside for reasons which I cannot understand&mdash;I fail to see why we cannot manufacture at least some of them here&mdash;it will be useless if they are allowed to go to rack and ruin as all the others have been allowed to.</P>
    <P>The closing of the Harcourt Street line was one of the biggest mistakes ever made, whoever was responsible.  It was not the present Minister.  He was probably sitting on the back benches, if he was in Dáil Éireann at all.  It was a most foolish and shortsighted act. Ever since then there has been a gradual build-up of traffic coming in from the south side.  At a peak hour it is almost impossible to get in at all. Much of that traffic was carried by the Harcourt Street line.  Now it is all road traffic.  The line is still there and belongs to CIE.  Some of the bridges have been taken away but it would not be a very big job to put them back. It would be well worth considering reopening that line.  It would certainly ease the situation considerably.</P>
    <P>CIE have a monopoly of school transport.  They are the agents on behalf of the Department of Education. I cannot congratulate them on making a success of it.  One has to wait weeks on end to get any satisfaction from them.  Parents have appealed to me on many occasions for transport for their children and the Department of Education have agreed and written to CIE and told them to make the necessary arrangements.  It is the old story. Nothing happens.  People come back, one goes to the Department again and <Col N="756" /> they ring up CIE.  There is a local agent who is trying to do the job.  We have a local agent in my constituency who lives in the town of Wexford. He is trying to do the job but he cannot do it without going back to the central authority.  Children are being exposed to traffic hazards on the road just because somebody sitting in a well-heated office in Dublin is foostering over the proposal and will not look after the job properly.  The Minister should look into this.  This is something about which a Deputy should be able to ask questions. If I asked the Minister a parliamentary question about that I would be told it was a matter of day-to-day administration.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  I wish to raise a point in regard to Ostlanna Éireann Teoranta, which body, I understand, are under the jurisdiction of CIE. They have been selling houses in recent times and I have tried to have this practice stopped.  In the southern part of my constituency railway employees find it impossible to get houses. Recently this body sold houses to Roadstone and the tenants were apprehensive that they might have to vacate the houses.  I tried to put down a parliamentary question on the matter and it was ruled out of order.  If I put the question down again will the Minister give me an answer?  It is easy enough for the Minister to say he will answer any question but I must get by the Chair before the Minister can give an answer.</P>

      <Col N="757" /> Questions in relation to the ESB, to Bord na Móna and Aer Lingus are answered.  Why does the same position not obtain in regard to CIE&mdash;possibly the most dull semi-State institution in the country.  They have lost more money than anybody else, they have been responsible for allowing machinery and rolling stock to rot away, and yet they are guarded and protected in every possible way by the State.  I hope that when a question of national or local importance in regard to this organisation is put down the Minister will answer it&mdash;assuming, of course, that he gets the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making my statement and the Minister will have an opportunity to refer to it later.  The photograph in the report I have here shows Ireland as represented by CIE rail services.  Much chopping of the services has taken place.  In the days when the chopping was carried out we had a few specialists who were able to tell us how to ensure that CIE would break even.  However, those days are gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as my area of the country is concerned, the rail system was abandoned completely and this also happened in many other places throughout the country.  According to the Tánaiste, then Minister for Transport and Power, the reason for the exercise was that a country with a <Col N="758" /> small population could not continue subsidising CIE to the extent that was necessary.  We were told that something drastic would have to be done : in fact, it was stated, an operation must be performed.</P>
    <P>Not only did the Minister and the board of CIE perform that operation quite well but they would not accept any advice from county councils or public representatives.  They told us : &ldquo;We are able to deal with this patient, we know what part to remove.  We are satisfied that when the operation is completed the patient will be independent and will not want any injections or subventions from any source.&rdquo;  That operation was performed in the late fifties or early sixties but since then the patient has required many injections from the pockets of the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The operation was not successful and all the remedies prescribed had no effect.  This matter would be funny but for the fact that the people of the country must again dig into their pockets and find £2.98 million to keep CIE in operation, in addition to the £2.65 million they have already provided&mdash;a total of more than £5.6 million.</P>
    <P>I had many arguments with the former Minister for Transport and Power when he stated that, as a result of this chopping exercise in the early sixties, CIE would be viable.  I could quote from the Official Report many statements made by Deputy Childers who, it could be assumed, knew what he was talking about.  His foresight was nil and his knowledge was at the lowest possible point.  It was evident then and it is more evident now that he could not see into the future when he claimed that once all this chopping and changing was finished we would hear no more about having to pay subventions to CIE.</P>
    <P>Can we go on paying subventions to CIE?  Can a country with 2.8 million people go on paying a subsidy of just about £2 per man, woman and child to keep this body going?  I do not agree with Deputy Tully that this is a social service because a social service would be applicable to the nation as a whole. CIE do not operate in south west Cork; their railway system has been <Col N="759" /> abolished completely and buses are running practically empty because their fares are excessive.  If the services were withdrawn tomorrow I doubt if there would be any complaints.  I will illustrate my point.  I live in Schull, 70 miles from Cork, and the return bus fare, except for one excursion day weekly, is £4.  If I went to travel by bus from Schull and on arriving at the bus stop found there another person who was also bound for Cork, the two of us would join together and we would have no trouble getting a hackney car for the amount we would pay CIE.  I heard Deputy Tully staling that four passengers could hire a car for the cost of a CIE fare but I am bringing the number down to two.  CIE cannot do business because their charges are too high. Although I have a great deal of sympathy with them, people are not going to pay more than 6d a mile to travel by the CIE road service.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is a very difficult problem to solve.  The main advantage of CIE's services at present is that they are regular, that you are sure the buses will travel, but I have not got the slightest doubt that if CIE were abolished in the morning you would have&mdash;as we had in west Cork in areas not serviced by CIE&mdash;a plentiful supply of applicants wishing to provide a service at regular times, that could be equal to if not better than that provided by CIE.  Because of the bus fares charged CIE have to be satisfied to travel over a number of west Cork routes carrying only small numbers of passengers, apart from some school children.  Again, take my own area as an illustration.  You can be driven to Cork privately for half the CIE fare. People are only too anxious to drive passengers direct to Cork, with no stops, and to take them to particular parts of the city which they may wish to visit, such as hospitals or other public places, and bring them back again.</P>
    <P>These private owners are able to provide a better service than CIE and I have sympathy with CIE trying to compete with them.  What happens in south west Cork, as far as road services are concerned, is no doubt somewhat similar to what is happening all over <Col N="760" /> the country.  Is there any re-thinking or, to use the phrase most used nowadays, restructuring of ClE's road transport operations?  We are told that they are all right so far as road transport is concerned, that they work out more or less evenly and there is no great profit or loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a substantial profit on the road passenger service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great profit or loss shown.  However, private companies who could provide a service at half the cost are deprived of doing so because of ClE's monopoly.  I know that if such companies were given the same latitude, or if you had&mdash;should I use the term&mdash;possibly it is dangerous &mdash;a free-for-all, they could provide a service at prices which in my estimation would be 50 per cent less than ClE's.  We have to take cognisance of the fact that when a person travels on the road transport system, which is much dearer than the railway system, he is subsidising this CIE monopoly because apart altogether from what he pays by way of taxation by virtue of having to use their transport system he is possibly paying twice the normal fare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if I have made myself clear on that point.  You have two types of subsidies, two types of subvention. First, you have the direct one which you have to pay through taxation to make up this £5.6 million, and secondly, there is the subvention you have to pay by reason of the CIE monopoly.  When you travel on their road passenger services you have to pay fares which are far in excess of what you would have to pay if CIE were not in existence.  Of course, as I mentioned already, if you are fortunate enough to find when you arrive at the bus stop that a number of people are travelling in the same direction, you can then go along to the private man and get him to take you to your destination.  I want to impress on the Minister&mdash;and I think I made this statement on a previous occasion&mdash;that CIE are losing a great deal of money because their fares are so high.  They say that they must meet rising costs of wages and other incidentals, that they must increase their <Col N="761" /> fares, but in many instances they are pricing themselves out of the transport market.  Naturally, individuals with cars for hire are watching this process.  Who would blame them for cashing in on it?  Who would blame them for trying to ascertain who will be travelling here or there tomorrow and trying to coax them to travel with them, which they can do because of CIE's charges?</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed amused when I mentioned that CIE are dying.  I was astonished to learn that the number of persons availing of CIE buses in Dublin city has decreased to such an extent.  According to the Minister's statement, more than 7,000,000 fewer passengers were carried in 1969-70 than in the preceding year and that, compared with the year 1964-65, the number carried in 1969-70 was down by almost 28,000,000.  Seven million is a substantial number when one considers that the population of the city is less than three quarters of a million persons.  Therefore, it is evident that the people of Dublin are not using the services to the same extent as they used them in other days.  Does not this trend justify one in saying that CIE are dying?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a world-wide pattern in relation to public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, it is a question of whether public transport is on the way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a substantial increase in the use of private cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>For how long more can this caper continue?  Who is doing the calculating?  The present Minister for Health, who is regarded as being a man of intelligence and ability well above the average, said that CUE cannot continue to receive the injections that they have been receiving.  Most of the railway lines were discontinued. Fares were increased and, possibly, other services were curtailed.  The same pattern is being followed still.  I did not develop my statement about CIE being a social service as was stated by Deputy Tully.  I mentioned merely that <Col N="762" /> social service should be one applied nationally.  Let us consider the position in relation to west Cork, where there are no railways.  In the Berehaven peninsula, which might be regarded as being the poorest part of west Cork, there is no free service for pensioners or for others who are entitled to such a service.  CIE do not provide transport beyond Glengarriff which is a distance of 32 miles from the end of the Berehaven peninsula.  The result is that pensioners and others must pay fares to the private company which operates in the area.  It will be seen therefore that, while the residents of this area pay their contribution towards the subsidies to CIE&mdash;this year the subsidy is £5.6 million&mdash;they get nothing in return.  The same applies to other sparsely populated areas of west Cork and I am sure the same story can be told of several other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I raised the question here of allowing the private bus company which operates in the Berehaven peninsula to accept those passengers who are entitled to free transport services on the same basis as they are accepted by CIE but negotiations in that regard have not concluded although the free scheme has been in operation now for the past three or four years.  The same applies to the Sheepshead peninsula.  It applies also to the entire parish of Durrus and to parts of the Mizen Head peninsula as well as to other parts of south west Cork.  It is about time we discontinued coddling CIE and gave some concessions to the private companies that are operating in those areas I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I have asked who is doing the forecasting. Who is the prophet in CIE? It is not the gentleman about whom we used hear so much long ago, Theophilus Moore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Down through the years the amount of money that would be required by CIE in any one year has been miscalculated.  This year, the prediction was very far off the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> A sum of £2.65 million was included in the Estimate whereas the additional amount required to keep the company in operation was more than 100 per cent of that estimate or £2.98 million. I am as much entitled to make a prediction now as are the fellows who have been predicting CIE finances during the years.  It is my prediction that the amount required for 1971-72 will be £8 million and that by 1975-76 it will be at least £10 million.  Since they have now passed the £5½ million mark it is reasonable to assume that the amount I have mentioned will be required by them by the year 1975-76.</P>
    <P>I realise that transport services must be nationalised but, as I have stated here before, I am a firm believer in examining alternative methods.  I believe that private enterprise should carry out any operation that could be carried out more economically by them than by State sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Deputy equate that with the views of his colleagues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not casting any reflection on either the board or the executive of CIE, some of whom I know to be very capable men but, at the same time, it must be very nice for a man or a woman to be an executive in a body such as CIE rather than to be an executive in a private company. A person holding that position on the staff of an organisation such as CIE would be free from financial worries.  If things do not go according to plan they know that Kathleen Ní Houlihan must pay.  They know that the Minister for Transport and Power will come to the Dáil and ask for a subvention.  How much more pleasant that is than the position of the private business operator who is worried about his balance sheets, who is worried about a falling-off in his customers, who is worried about difficulties that may arise in one field or another of his activities, and that as a result he, his family and his employees will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no such worry among the members or the executives of the CIE board.  It must be the grandest job in <Col N="764" /> the world to be attached to a company in which you are sure of your money irrespective of how you manage it, irrespective of how you work, irrespective of how you attract custom.  A private businessman, if he is to live and provide for his family, must be nice to his customers, he must devise ways and means of expanding his business and attracting customers.  That does not apply so far as publicly owned bodies are concerned, although I am not saying that within publicly owned bodies there are not a number of very conscientious men who try to expand business and improve as much as possible the services they provide.</P>
    <P>The complaint made by me here on a number of occasions relating to State-sponsored bodies and referred to by the previous speaker.  Deputy Esmonde, is that we are not getting sufficient information on State-sponsored bodies. I have agitated again and again for a committee of this House to be set up to probe into the workings of State-sponsored bodies.  Personally I am satisfied that that claim is justifiable, and if I were asked to produce a single supporting argument it would be the fact that we must provide regular subvention for a number of State-sponsored bodies.  Surely representatives of the Irish people who are elected to this House should be entitled to form a committee and get some information as to how business is managed, as to how the companies are progressing?  In the course of this statement there is reference to the employment of consultants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been employed since yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good one. CIE are now acknowledging failure. They are acknowledging they are unable to devise new tablets for the patient, to prescribe any new medicine. They have to call in a firm of consultants to whom they will possibly have to pay £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people will read that this additional money is required to keep CIE in motion and will recollect the statement of CIE during the past few weeks that they have placed orders for coaches to the value of £2½ million <Col N="765" /> with an outside company.  Are a group or a body that are losing money as rapidly as CIE are losing it entitled to use public funds to buy coaches to the value of £2½ million?  Is that essential?</P>
    <P>I must say there are very few complaints about the condition of the coaches and other vehicles in the public service.  I do not agree with the remarks of the previous speaker.  I do not know where he got his information or whether he was speaking from knowledge of a few isolated incidents. Generally speaking, any time I have travelled up here on the train&mdash;and I see the buses also&mdash;the service has been up to the standard.  How does it come about therefore that a company losing £5.6 million is ordering goods from outside the country to the value of £2½ million?</P>
    <P>This is a question which should be probed by a committee of this House, because I believe Ireland will not be able to meet the demands made on it. It is an additional £3 million for CIE today.  There was an additional £2½ million for the Cork Health Authority last week.  How many more demands will be made all over Ireland?  Is it any wonder the Book of Estimates is showing a sharp increase of around 18 per cent from year to year?  Will that continue or is that supposed to be what is known as the inflationary trend?</P>
    <P>Even in places where CIE services are essential one hears complaints about the cost of travelling by CIE.  Is the declining patronage of Dublin bus services due to increases in fares?  Has a consultant been employed to ascertain whether the consequent loss of custom after fare increases results in a reduction in revenue?  I am satisfied that this applies to rural services and possibly urban services as well.</P>
    <P>Sub-committees should be set up to inquire into the functioning of State-sponsored bodies.  I do not see why a board should be given a free hand. When the Minister is asked questions about that board he replies to them in a general way and public representatives are unable to obtain any more information about that body.  There may be Members of this House who could make useful and valuable suggestions if such a committee were established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> The whole question of establishing committees of this House to inquire into the activities of State-sponsored bodies should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>It is fortunate for CIE that the school bus services were introduced but it should be remembered that if CIE were not there, private firms could operate these services.  At present CIE have a monopoly of school bus services but they employ private companies to supplement their own transport system.</P>
    <P>I always like to illustrate a point with personal experience.  Dunbeacon is a townland in the parish of Schull. CIE operate a school bus service from that townland carrying eight or nine children to the secondary school in Bantry.  Dunbeacon is ten miles from Bantry, but the children travel 42 miles on their way to Bantry.  They have to attend for collection at 7.25 each morning and they are taken from the cross four miles to Durrus village; they are then taken to Sheepshead, which is 16 miles from Durrus village, brought back to Durrus village and finally taken on to Bantry.  This is completely unfair to the children.  A private company collects children at Durrus village and takes them directly to school in Bantry.  But despite repeated representations to have a minibus call at Dunbeacon, which is four miles away, this has not been done and the children must travel more than 50 miles each day to and from the school in Bantry. The Department of Education say that the conveyance of secondary school children is a matter for CIE and I should like to know what the Minister thinks of that kind of service.  Does this sort of thing happen in any other part of the country?  If CIE do not feel they can take the children there are plenty of local people willing to do so. I admit the case I have given may be an extreme one but I want to illustrate how difficult it is to get defects remedied by a big body.  I realise that top executives of CIE are probably not the type to listen to representations from passengers&mdash;they are too big for that&mdash;but it is the passengers who will contribute to the big injection CIE require this year and will require next year and the year afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister can disclaim responsibilty <Col N="767" /> here for the school transport service and place it on the Department of Education.  I am sure that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as an ex-teacher are conversant with the transport scheme for children living more than 2½ miles from a primary school and you may also be conversant with the regulation which some person in the Department of Education&mdash;maybe it was a combined effort on the part of CIE and the Department&mdash;devised quite recently; you are entitled to be carried to school if you are more than a certain distance from it and if you are less than ten years of age but, once you pass ten years of age, you must walk.  I think the distance is 2½ miles.</P>

This is the kind of crackpot regulation we have.  Maybe there is some justification for this kind of regulation in populous districts where transport is taxed to the limit.  I ask the Minister for Transport and Power to get in touch with the Department of Education and discuss this silly regulation with that Department.

It is only through discussion here that the general public can be made aware of what is happening.  I heard Deputy Tully opportioning responsibility for the strikes.  He is more conversant with that side of the picture than I am but, whoever is responsible, it is a damn shame, to put it mildly, that such a position should obtain and that we should have in a country with a population of less than 3,000,000 people so many strikes and so much disruption year after year.</P>

      <P>We must address ourselves to this problem.  I cannot dispute the figures submitted, but the grand' total is £707,000.  It is also pointed out that other strikes resulted in a loss of business to CIE-the cement strike and the strike in the fertiliser industry. We must take cognisance of strikes. We cannot continue to ignore them.  I say that as a Labour representative. When a strike occurs everyone seems to be a loser.  The workers suffer.  Our prestige abroad suffers.  Our chances of getting people to establish industries here suffer.  Our chances of attracting outside investment suffer.  Something must be done.  There must be a change of heart.  There must be more give and take, I realise that well-organised groups will stretch out their hands for possibly more than their fair share of the loaf, asking for a bigger slice than that to which they are entitled.  My standard of intelligence, which is not as high as that of some other Members of this House naturally, leads me to believe that if one group get a slice of the national loaf in excess of that to which they are entitled it follows that other sections must do with a smaller slice than that to which they should be entitled.  The Government's job and the Government's duty is to ensure, so far as possible, that all sections of our people are given their fair slice of the loaf. Any fellow who, having got his fair slice, stretches out his hand and asks for more&mdash;to the detriment of some other fellow&mdash;should be told: &ldquo;Hold on. You are not getting it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Let us leave it at that. CIE's health is not too good.  The former Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, argued that transport companies are not paying in any other place and why should they pay here.  He did not tell us that in years gone by.  There may be justification for continuing a transport service on a national basis but with the financial provisions for that undertaking so upset, as is evident from the introduction of this Bill which seeks approval for still more money, and in view of other Bills which we had recently for additional sums, there is equal justification for closer examination. Will the representatives of the people be given an opportunity to get that closer examination.  I am not picking on CIE.  If it were the ESB or some other State-sponsored body, I should be making the same statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair is aware of the length of time it has taken the Minister for Transport and Power to acknowledge that public representatives are entitled to know how funds are allocated to hotels and guesthouses.  That claim was resisted for years.  If one keeps urging the justice of one's claim, eventually the justice of it becomes so evident that it has to be acknowledged.  Similarly, we must keep repeating, on Estimate after Estimate, the desirability of a <Col N="772" /> body of people, elected by the general group of citizens, examining the activities of this board and of other public bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few points about County Mayo and the west of Ireland in general so far as transport is concerned.  Over the years, we have suffered from the closure of portions of our railways in Mayo.  We have lost our rail link from Ballinrobe to Claremorris.  We have lost our rail link from Achill to Westport.  We have lost our passenger service from Sligo to Claremorris.  We have also practically lost our passenger service from Claremorris to Ballina.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few points regarding matters affecting County Mayo in particular.  I cannot see why a train travels from Ballina, bypassing Foxford and Balla, and stands at Claremorris. Why could it not stand for two or three minutes to collect passengers? A station master would not be necessary in either sector.  The people who would avail of this service could get on the train and purchase their tickets on the train.  Various protests have been made in the past to save the passenger service in those areas but as a result of CIE and Government decisions they failed.  Once again I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the possibility of collecting passengers at Foxford and Balla.  People from the Balla area must pay for a hackney car to take them the eight miles to the train at Claremorris whereas a two minute stop by the passenger train from Wesport or Ballina would accommodate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ballinrobe section of the line has been completely cut out for the past ten or 15 years.  This is one of the greatest farming centres in the county. A new cattle mart has been built there and there is a successful sale every week.  All the stock from there must be transported through Claremorris for whatever part of Ireland it is going to. CIE at that time gave a grant of £12,000 to construct a road from Ballinrobe to Claremorris but the available grant constructed only half of that road.  The condition of the road from Claremorris to Ballinrobe is deplorable.  Seeing that the rail link from Ballinrobe to Claremorris was <Col N="773" /> removed, at least that road should have been constructed all the way.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and see if an extra grant could be given to construct the remaining part of the road.  This is a farming area that can compare with anything in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the increased fares it costs £7 14s for a return ticket from Westport to Dublin.  This means that if four people from Westport wanted to come to Dublin they could pay over £30 for a private car and get home at the same cost as CIE would charge them.  I believe that as a result of increased passenger fares CIE will lose heavily in the west of Ireland because the people will not avail of the services. I appeal to the Minister to do something to reduce fares.  I feel certain that if fares from Ball in a or any part of the west, were kept at the same level, CIE would benefit.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made to me about the prices charged on the trains. I suppose this applies to every passenger service in the country.  You can leave Dublin on the 7 o'clock train for Westport but you will find no dining carriage, only a snack bar, on the train.  People doing shopping in Dublin cannot have a meal before they leave because they are rushing all the time to catch this train.  Yet they cannot be supplied with the meal because there is no dining coach on the train.  I should like the Minister to take full note of this.  Prices charged for meals on those trains are excessive. You pay 2s 6d for a boiled egg.  That is the listed price.  These charges should be challenged.  Surely no sensible man would pay 2s 6d for a boiled egg?</P>
    <P>Various committees of agriculture, county councils and various other bodies of which lama member have raised the matter of freight charges for the west of Ireland in relation to the survival of the west of Ireland.  It costs £6 more to get one ton of stuff in the west than it does in Cork.  In the case of pigmeal this would mean at least 30s difference in the cost of a pig produced in the west of Ireland and a pig produced in any of the southern or eastern counties.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider these freight <Col N="774" /> charges to the west of Ireland.  Regardless of political views, all public bodies in the west are concerned about this. If some subsidy were provided for freight charges for foodstuffs for the west it would be an enormous help and if the Minister could do something in that way it would be a great benefit.  I would not oppose his Estimate because I know&mdash;and we must all be realistic about the situation&mdash;that costs and wages have gone up and as a result we know that no Department can run its business for the same figure.  Therefore the excess must be obtained for extra wages and costs.  As some speakers have said, it may be that things are not all right.  I should like to see a complete investigation of the whole matter to discover why all these costs arise.  I know extra costings are needed to provide the increased wages which have gone on down the years.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this seriously.  The Parliamentary Secretary who was here a few minutes ago representing the Minister accused Deputy Murphy of trying to talk out the debate.  I am not here to talk out the debate and I do not think Deputy Murphy was here to do so either.  I only stood up here to make a few points which concern the people of the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of CIE, their continuing losses and their various problems will, like the poor, always be with us.  For a long time now the problems of CIE have been debated here in this House, in newspapers and in various other places.  As we have heard from the various speakers, <Col N="775" /> it is a subject with many aspects such as the operation of the law of diminishing returns to the cost of the boiled egg on the train to Claremorris. Indeed, I sympathise with a person getting on the train at Westland Row, travelling to Westport and having to depend on a boiled egg at a cost of half a crown to sustain him over that arduous trip.</P>
      <P>The various problems that affect CIE gives us some indication of the complexity of the whole situation.  One must have sympathy with the Minister in coming into the House to ask for nearly £3 million so that this institution can be kept, as Deputy Murphy said, literally in motion.  It would appear from the Minister's statement and from the annual reports of CIE, that the villain of the piece is the railway system.  This is where the big loss occurs.  The Minister said frankly in his statement that inflation would have its greatest effect on the railway end of CIE operations.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his statement also said that salaries and wages of railway employees represent 81 per cent of the total railway expenditure as against 54 per cent in the case of provincial buses. We must regret that inflation has been allowed to develop to the stage where it has had this effect.  If the warnings about the results of inflation had been heeded when they were first given years ago and remedial action taken, it is possible we might be spared this debate and the Minister would be spared the necessity and CIE the embarrassment of having to come to the taxpayer for yet another substantial subvention.  It is depressing when one considers that this subvention is only one of a long line of similar payments. The Minister's statement holds out no hope that it is likely to be the last such subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If CIE's problems <i>vis-á-vis</i> the railway service are to be approached purely on a money basis, the answer must be to shelve the railways.  But I would be against such a step.  I know varying views have been expressed on this side of the House as to whether or not the railways should be retained.  Some people think the purely economic viewpoint <Col N="776" /> should be adopted and the railways scrapped, while others believe the railways represent a social service and should be retained.  I confess I am a supporter of the latter view : that the railways are in effect, a social service and we must pay for it.  It does not follow that, because we describe it as a social service, it should be allowed to lose exorbitant sums.</P>
    <P>The problems of the railway have been with CIE for many years now.  It is not strange that those problems cannot be solved because railway losses is a world-wide problem and is not confined to this country.  It seems odd, however, that they cannot be contained within reasonable limits, that the losses on the railways should continue to increase each year and that the abilities to be found within CIE could not have been directed towards that end.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to learn that the committee which has been set up in CIE have been authorised by the Minister to enlist the aid of consultants because I consider this new science of industrial consultancy to be one of the new modern bluff sciences.  I do not know if anyone has ever yet been able to say in any firm to which those people have given their lofty minds that that firm has improved by £1 as a direct result of a survey and consequential recommendations.</P>

Possibly in a body of this size with all its ramifications it may be difficult for the people in it to see the wood from the rees and a consultant may perform that function.  I have a bias against those people because I feel it is a modem bluff science.  They have their own particular gobbledygook which hides their real inadequacies.  I am disappointed that this is all CIE can suggest towards containing the losses on the railways.  I know in CIE there are very many people of ability and they have all the aids which modern science <Col N="778" /> can give them in identifying and solving their problems.  Despite this they go to one of those outside firms.  I do not know which firm it is.</P>
