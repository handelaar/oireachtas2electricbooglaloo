      <P>I have already arranged to set up a special survey team to examine the fishing ports and fish landing facilities required to meet the needs of the fishing industry on the north Kerry coast and Ballyheigue will, of course, be included in the survey.  Until I receive and consider the team's report I cannot say what marine works, if any, may be approved for Ballyheigue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the maximum width permitted in respect of vehicles, in particular buses, using the public roads; whether approval is required before vehicles of this width are permitted to operate; and whether, in view of the great increase in the number of very wide vehicles using the roads in recent years and of the consequent greater dangers to other road users arising from obstruction of view, he proposes to review the whole question of the permitted width.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations which prescribe the dimensions of vehicles used on public roads allow an overall width of 8 feet 2½ inches for any vehicle including a bus.  The only exceptions to this are, first, certain vehicles technically described as &ldquo;large tractors&rdquo; which may be up to nine feet wide and, secondly, certain special vehicles used for forestry and land purposes.  In the latter case there is no restriction with regard to width but such vehicles may be used on public roads only in daylight and, in certain cases, during lighting up hours in the months of July to October.  Any vehicle which complies with the regulations may be used on public roads without special approval.  If, however, as occasionally happens, an extraordinarily wide vehicle has to be moved along a public road the regulations provide for the issue of a special permit by the relevant road authority <Col N="2017" /> under certain conditions so as to allow the use of the vehicle which would otherwise contravene the regulations.</P>
      <P>The regulations relating to vehicles are at present being reviewed by a committee under the aegis of my Department and permitted overall vehicle widths will be considered in the course of this review.  However, in view of the fact that our existing regulations with respect to width are in line with those of most European countries and because of trends in road transport it is unlikely that any reduction in permitted widths will be recommended by the reviewing committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>My Department has received no general submission from Kerry County Council on dangerous bridges requiring reconstruction.  Proposals have been submitted at various dates in relation to particular bridges, including Blennerville Bridge.  The following is the position in these cases in so far as my Department are concerned:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Madam's Height, Killarney; a grant of £16,125 has been notified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the reasons for his granting of outline planning permission to a person (name supplied) in Killiney, County Dublin, for the erection of an hotel overlooking Killiney Bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The development to which the question refers proposed the demolition of an existing hotel on the seaside of the Vico Road and the construction of a new hotel in its stead.  The planning authority had refused outline permission on the grounds that the development would create a traffic hazard and because the proposal would not be in accordance with an objective which they intended to include in their development plan that a large area including the site of the hotel should become public open space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The developers appealed against the decision and in support of their proposal pointed out that it would open up views of the bay then closed to the public by removing the barriers imposed by the existing hotel which was 20 feet over footpath level, removing and lowering sections of the existing <Col N="2019" /> five feet high boundary wall and by designing the replacement hotel so that it would be three feet below the lowest level of the footpath.</P>
    <P>In connection with the appeal Bord Fáilte Éireann stated that the accommodation which the development would provide was badly needed in the area and the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation indicated that they welcomed the development.</P>
    <P>In so far as traffic hazard was concerned, I felt that the objection was not sufficiently well founded to outweigh the project's advantages.</P>
    <P>The decision on this appeal therefore depended on the feasibility of the planning authority's open space objective which would require an acquisition programme of major dimensions and involve large sums in compensation. A claim for compensation had already been lodged with the planning authority as a result of an earlier refusal of permission for development of the site. I did not consider that the planning authority were likely to find practical or realistic ways to pursue their policy to an extent that would warrant refusal of permission for the development proposed in this instance and I made an order accordingly on the 15th March, 1967, granting outline permission for the development proposed.</P>

      <P>The development proposals for Ballyheigue were agreed to by the local development association in February, 1967.  Bord Fáilte have informed me that the proposals for Ballyheigue include provision for additional car parking facilities, but that the present access to the area is not suitable and is threatened by coast erosion. Efforts to purchase suitable land for better and safer access have not been successful because the price sought by the vendors was excessive and could not be justified by the county council or Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>I understand that until suitable land at a realistic price becomes available, commencement of the work cannot be considered further.</P>

      <P>I understand that the question of the future of this factory may involve legal proceedings.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that in general is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but it might be misleading if it were to suggest that there was a particular project involved.

In view of the Minister's statement that the term &ldquo;blunders&rdquo; should not have <Col N="2023" /> arisen is it not a blunder for his Department or for the Industrial Development Authority to allocate a grant to the former owner of this factory having regard to the credentials which he held?

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The tariff which would apply to imports of cotton yarn from the countries referred to by the Deputies is 48 per cent <i>ad valorem</i>.  However, in the case of the People's Republic of China, there is a further restriction inasmuch as the importation of made up textiles including clothing and yarns for sale on the home market from certain low cost producer countries is limited by a special import quota of £100,000 a year which covers all the goods under these headings from all the sixteen countries concerned, including China.</P>

    <P>As to the provision of alternative employment, I had already asked the Industrial Development Authority to give special consideration to the question of attracting industry to Athlone. The authority, in fact, is, at present, examining proposals for the establishment of new industries in the town; <Col N="2025" /> one of these is expected to be located in the premises vacated by Shannon Yarns Ltd.  I am asking the IDA to make every effort to complete the negotiations as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Does it therefore mean that the Minister, his Department and the Government have written off this factory which was established in 1936? I think the Minister said there was a 48 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> duty on imports from the People's Republic of China as if to suggest that this was the most he could do.  If it means a loss of employment to people in Athlone why cannot it be 100 per cent?</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not pay full attention to what I said.  It is true I said there was an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 48 per cent but I also said there was a special import quota which covers the kind of things he is talking about and a lot of others and that that quota is £100,000 for a full year.  It covers all imports of that nature from 16 countries including China.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it was due to imports of cheap materials from China because it was not.  In fact, virtually none of the yarn used here was from China, that is in relation to the home market.  Of course, in regard to exports we do not restrict in any way because we would drive a lot of factories out of business if we did.  The difficulty here arises because of the nature of the business and the technological changes.  The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that there are quite a number of similar industries which have already closed down in Britain in the last few years.</P>

I am sure the Minister is aware that £4,000 of redundancy money has been lodged in good faith by those workers in a local fund, together with local subscriptions of £9,000 in an effort to get this shed reopened? Would the Minister not go to Athlone and meet the workers and management concerned?  He should not have any <Col N="2027" /> difficulty in doing this.  Would the Minister not endeavour to become directly involved in view of the fact that there are 360 people out of work? There are 120 married men out of work in Athlone at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding lands in the possession of the Land Commission for distribution is subject to constant fluctuation, depending upon progress in intake and allotment. The list of estates on hands in County Donegal requested by the Deputy would be out of date in a short time and, therefore, largely irrelevant.  This is particularly so at 1st January of any year as Land Commission activities in the allotment of land reach their peak during the months of January, February and March.  More realistic figures would then be those in respect of lands on hands at 31st March.  These should be likely to remain reasonably firm for a period after completion, on that date, of the seasonal allotment programme.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, therefore, the total figures for County Donegal already furnished, that is, 768 acres, comprised in 17 estates, would meet the Deputy's requirements&mdash;for the present, at least.  If he would repeat the question about 1st May I will furnish him with the detailed information required, as at 31st March, 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy in regard to the closure of small schools relates mainly to one- and two-teacher schools.</P>
      <P>The ideal arrangement would be one where a school would have a teacher for each separate class.  This in relation to many rural areas would be capable of attainment only through transport services which would cover very wide areas and would result in many children having to spend an undue length of time in travelling. Furthermore it would entail bringing children to school outside their own parish, something that is to be avoided wherever possible.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, if it became a practical proposition to provide, in a parish, a central school with five or more teachers and this involved the closing of a three-teacher school which was due for replacement then efforts would be made to have the three-teacher school closed and to give all the children in the parish the benefits of the larger school.</P>

Only one corvette is in commission at present but this vessel is now undergoing its normal annual overhaul which will take some weeks to complete.  Due to maintenance and manning considerations it has not been the practice to have all three corvettes in commission at the same time.  During the past year, for example, only one corvette was at sea for most of the year but occasionally a second was in use.</P>
      <P>As already announced, the Government have authorised the purchase of two new ships for the Naval Service, one a naval ship with a fishery protection potential and the other primarily a fishery protection vessel.  Considerable preparatory work has been done in relation to both of these vessels.  In particular an inspection has been made of a vessel on which the new fishery protection vessel might be modelled. On 2nd March, Irish Shipping Ltd., acting on behalf of my Department, issued on inquiry to a large number of shipbuilders as to whether they would be interested in tendering for the construction of a fishery protection vessel an outline specification of which was supplied.</P>

    <Title>Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, 1970: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the ceiling of the financial contribution by county councils to county committees of agriculture. Section 1 subsection (i) empowers county councils to increase the contribution payable by them to committees of agriculture for the service of their agricultural schemes to a sum not exceeding 27 times the produce of a rate of 1d&mdash;that is, 2s 3d&mdash;in the £1, in the area consisting of the county, exclusive of any urban districts therein. The existing ceiling is 1s 9d in the £1.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that this provision is permissive and does not make it mandatory on county councils, unless they see fit, to reach it, or indeed to meet the actual requests made by committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Section 1 subsection (ii) ensures that arrangements may validly be made by county councils prior to 1st April, 1970, for the purpose of financing the committees of agriculture for the financial year 1970-71.</P>
      <P>Section 2 proposes, <i>inter alia,</i> that the legislation shall come into operation on 1st April next, i.e. the beginning of the local authorities' financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committees of agriculture are financed each year by means of contributions from their respective county councils together with State grants related to such contributions.  The State grant normally approximates to the amount of the local rates contribution by the county council but, in the case of the 12 committees of agriculture in the small farms areas of the west and north west of the country, further State assistance is granted by way of a contribution of 75 per cent <Col N="2039" /> instead of the normal 50 per cent towards the cost of employing adequate numbers of advisory staff.</P>
    <P>The existing maximum rate contribution by county councils of 21d in the £1 was fixed in the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1964.  Nineteen committees are now approaching, at varying levels, this maximum, although eight committees have not yet reached the maximum of 15d in the £1 which was operative prior to 1964.  One committee has reached the present maximum of 21d in the current financial year and five are in receipt of over 20d.</P>
    <P>As in the case of many other bodies, expenditure by the committees of agriculture generally has been increasing in recent years.  In 1963-64 total expenditure by the committees reached £828,000 and now exceeds some £1,500,000.  This increase is attributable mainly to an increase in the numbers and cost of the advisory staffs employed by the committees.  The total number of advisers in 1963-64 was 402.  In 1968-69 the figure was 509, which represents an increase of about 26 per cent over the five-year period. The educational and other services of the committees have also been expanding. These include new education centres, winter farm schools, the Pilot Areas Scheme, the Small Farms (Incentive Bonus) Scheme and the Farm Home Management advisory scheme. Further advances in most of these areas are necessary, if the farming community are to be adequately catered for in the advisory and educational work of the committees.</P>
    <P>I should not perhaps conclude without referring to the suggestions for restructuring of the agricultural advisory and educational services in both the Jones/Davies Report and more recently in the Devlin Report.  I am actively considering the recommendations in both these reports but I have not yet come to a conclusion in the matter. As Deputies will know, these recommendations range over a very wide area and pose a number of problems the solution to which would, I think, involve bringing extensive legislative proposals before the House in due course should the recommendations be <Col N="2040" /> adopted by the Government in whole or in part.</P>
    <P>This Bill is really an interim measure designed to enable committees of agriculture to carry on with their business as heretofore until such time as a decision is taken on the future of their advisory and educational service. It is required at this stage to meet the needs of some 11 committees who in the immediate future cannot carry on without a contribution in excess of the present permitted maximum. It is expected that about eight committees will be able to meet their needs in the immediate years ahead from within the existing statutory maximum of 21d in the £1.  The remaining eight committees are still further away from approaching the existing maximum.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are quite satisfied to accept the provisions in this Bill.  It is generally agreed that, in the modern circumstances of agriculture, in so far as we can decentralise from the Department of Agriculture it is eminently desirable to do so.  Undoubtedly agriculture is facing changing circumstances. The committees of agriculture are in a position to place before the Minister the problems as they see them.  To do that it is necessary for them to have the most up-to-date advisory services available.</P>
      <P>Our agricultural economy has been built almost entirely on the idea of trading with the United Kingdom.  It is necessary to look into the future and we need people absolutely skilled in giving advice to meet the conditions we shall face.  It is necessary to give the committees of agriculture the requisite funds for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking a broad look at agriculture there will have to be some very drastic changes in the not-too-distant future.  An agricultural plan will be required not alone nationally but locally to meet the particular circumstances of the case.  Today certain counties under the jurisdiction of the committees of agriculture concentrate on a certain type of production and other counties concentrate on another type <Col N="2041" /> of production.  However, we have got to see what will be most beneficial to us in the future.  We must have experts, people who can see further than the parish pump.  Unfortunately, agriculture has been very largely confined to the parish pump, presided over with dignity over a great many years by successive Ministers for Agriculture.  It is quite obvious that we cannot continue under the present conditions and hope to compete in the agricultural race that is taking place today.</P>
    <P>Even those who are not conversant with agriculture have only to open a newspaper to see that the bigger markets, the United States of America, the European Economic Community and so forth, are facing surpluses.  If we carry on blindly as we are doing we shall run into considerable difficulty. Quite recently the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture drew attention to the fact that we were spending £31 million on subsidising dairy products.  It may be desirable to subsidise dairy products and it may have been the basis of the existing information available to the Department through these committees of agriculture that we are doing that. Of course it is desirable to keep those who have invested money in agriculture in full production and to give them a reasonable monetary return.  As against that we must agree it is a state of affairs which cannot continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>For that reason we must place our local advisers or our local committees in the position that they can project into the future.  I do not know whether or not the Minister accepts <i>in toto</i> the advice of the committees of agriculture but I would suggest that, in the light of changing circumstances, he is likely in the near future to get considerably different advice from what he has had in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, when replying to the debate, indicate whether he is going to continue the committees of agriculture or what he proposes to replace them with.  A great many reports have been issued and a great deal of advice given to agriculture generally <Col N="2042" /> and, on this side of the House, we do not know whether the Minister will accept that advice or not.  There have been different reports; he mentioned two reports in his short opening speech. We would like to know what he envisages in the future for the agricultural advisory services and what line he proposes to take.</P>
    <P>It is extremely likely that at some not-too-distant date we shall find ourselves embedded very substantially in another economy.  We must therefore look into the future and see in what direction that economy will lead us.  I opine that the advice the Minister will get from his committees of agriculture, if they are in a position to appoint suitable experts to advise them, will be totally different from what he has been getting heretofore.  Heretofore, in committees of agriculture, the arguments have largely been concerned with whether the marketing system can be maintained in the existing economy of agriculture and whether a remunerative return can be given to producers. Now we face something quite different; a long-term agricultural outlook.  I do not know whether the Minister will accept the advice that will be submitted to him by the committees of agriculture or whether he himself will take a new look at the situation.  Without going too wide of the discussion generally I should like to point out to the Minister that if he gets and accepts expert advice he is likely to get a somewhat different projection to what he has been getting all along.  In other words, there will be a radical approach to agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to discuss agriculture, or agricultural advice, without referring, if only briefly, to future projections in relation to the Common Market and in relation to past circumstances in which we have functioned such as the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delve deeply into it; my point is a very simple one.  The Minister is introducing a Bill enabling committees <Col N="2043" /> of agriculture to strike a bigger rate under which they may pay or employ agricultural advisers but it is totally valueless to introduce such legislation to enable him to get a larger amount of advice if he is not going to take it. I am trying to point out very briefly what the advice is likely to be, looking at it from the expert angle.  I said I did not want to digress from the Bill which I may say is very wide because committees of agriculture have a very wide scope&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what I am talking about, the advice the Minister is likely to receive from the committees of agriculture.  These committees deal with everything relating to agriculture.  There is no limit to the discussion in a committee of agriculture. Therefore, the function of the committee is to lay before the Minister the projection of the best agricultural policy they see in relation to their own county or even further, nationally.  I am pointing out that I think the Minister will get new advice. I think it will be beneficial to him; whether or not he listens is another matter.  I hope he will accept such advice.  Naturally, the advice will be based on what is most beneficial to the farmers the committee represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these committees look to the future and do not continue to gaze admiringly at the parish pump&mdash;a practice that has been so disastrous for agriculture in the past&mdash;they will have to advise the Minister on what is likely to happen in the future.  I was going to make the point that the most likely opportunities for the future will lie in horticulture, a new type of agricultural development.  In his opening speech the Minister specifically mentioned that more horticultural advisers will be desirable.  That is why I was bringing in the Common Market; one of the opportunities in <Col N="2045" /> the Common Market will be for horticultural produce.  It seems entirely germane to the discussion that I should mention that at the moment the prospect of expansion of horticultural production is possibly, under existing trade circumstances, not as attractive-looking as it will be if we become a member of the EEC.</P>
    <P>On the question of beef I can with confidence say that the Minister is almost certain to receive the advice from the committees of agriculture, who will be advised by experts, that there will be a greater opportunity for beef in the future than there will be for dairy products.  That is a point I want to stress.  Quite recently the Minister introduced something here with which I found myself in profound agreement. He introduced the beef incentive scheme.</P>

      <P>That is not relevant to the Bill.  The Deputy seems intent on opening up a debate on agriculture <i>per se</i>.  It does not arise on this Bill, which is limited, as the Deputy is well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  I am trying to point out to the Minister the advice he is likely to receive from the committees of agriculture and their advisers, trying to give some idea of the lines on which they are thinking and what they are trying to do, and in order to do that one must consider outside markets.  I will not pursue the subject any further.  I shall come back and adhere slavishly to the terms of the Bill.  I believe that the committees of agriculture represent a decentralisation of policy.  I believe that one of the disasters of Irish agriculture has been that over a great many years we have adhered unchangingly to the one line of policy.  We have done that largely because successive Ministers for Agriculture have not listened to the advice they have received from the people on the spot who knew what was most desirable.  It is true to say that a great many committees of agriculture have given the advice to successive Ministers for Agriculture that the line being pursued is not the correct one.  This <Col N="2046" /> has happened not only during the tenure of office of the present Minister. There was a good deal of advice given to his predecessor by the committees of agriculture which I do not think he accepted.  I was not a member of a committee then and I was not entirely privy to the advice they gave.</P>
      <P>The idea of decentralisation is very desirable.  I suppose all of us would like to feel that agriculture would as far as possible move outside bureaucratic control.  It stands to reason that, if the policy making is left entirely to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and those on the spot ignored, there will be bureaucratic control. One of the disasters of this country&mdash;it is a disaster that is growing even greater every day&mdash;is that we are tending to hand over everything to bureaucratic control thus removing responsibility from Dáil Éireann.  I want us to go back to the grass roots level for advice.  We do not want to have agriculture looking only at the parish pump, but we want to get our advice from the grass roots level, which is the committees of agriculture.  They can give their advice to the Minister, who is the sole judge in the final analysis.  He can then listen to the advice offered to him by his official advisers but, as against that, he can say: &ldquo;I have received such and such advice from such and such a county and I think that they should know what they are talking about.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I feel it is a good move.  It is a Bill after my own heart because I detest&mdash;and in every speech I have made in this House I have protested against it&mdash;State control.  This is something which liberates agriculture from State control. This is something that gives to a local body the opportunity of offering advice to the Minister which I feel he will be unable to refuse.  Therefore, I exhort the Minister, when he sets up these committees and the advice is offered to him, to evaluate that advice and compare it with the advice offered by his official advisers.  It is their duty to offer advice to the Minister, but generally their advice is not to take any risk for fear of doing something wrong. Now, however, the Minister will have <Col N="2047" /> the committees giving him advice from the areas concerned.  He will therefore be advised from rural Ireland itself and that is a most eminently desirable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this advice.  I hope he will clarify the position in relation to the future of the committees of agriculture, as to whether they will be allowed to continue as they are or whether he will accept the reports that have been given to him relating to the future of agriculture. I welcome this Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party as far as the Bill goes.</P>
      <P>I note from the Minister's statement that 19 committees are now approaching, at varying levels, this maximum which was incorporated in the 1964 Amendment Act.  He did remark that eight committees had not yet reached the maximum of 15d in the £ which was operative prior to 1964.  I wonder if the Minister in his reply would give us the names of those eight committees. That would be interesting to this House because it is rather an anomalous position, and a disturbing one, that there are eight committees of agriculture which have not availed of their statutory permissive levy of even the 1s 3d in the £ operative prior to 1964.  Otherwise, we support the Bill. I have no doubt it will give a much needed injection of funds to the committees themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the future of the committees and their future work as indicated by the Minister, we in the Labour Party have an open mind as to the precise role that would be envisaged for them in the future.  It is not unfair to say that a fairly high proportion of the committees&mdash;at least in their public image, whatever about the actual work done&mdash;in the context of their reports and of public impressions generally seem to lack a sense of dynamism and a general sense of innovation, notwithstanding the growth in staff employed and the growth in the advisory and educational services provided under the general auspices of the Department through these committees. <Col N="2048" /> Therefore, we have an open mind on the restructuring commented on very briefly by the Minister in his reference to the Jones/Davies Report and, of course, to the Devlin Report. The only reservation we would have in respect of the Minister's statement in that regard is that we would stress the urgency and the need for the Minister to bring in as quickly as possible his observations on them rather than that some future Minister might do so. The Minister himself has had very considerable experience in this field and it would be a pity if he would not take the bull by the horns in this regard and bring in the recommendations though it may prove difficult in terms of explaining them to the nation as a whole.  Nevertheless, we must have a basic restructuring of the work and the composition and functions of these committees of agriculture which, in some respects, have stagnated during the years.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another aspect the Minister dealt with in his speech, namely, that there are now some 509 advisory staff employed by the various committees throughout the country.  I would make a special plea here for the staffs employed by these committees.  Money is now being provided on an extra permissive basis and I would hope to see the staff employed by these committees being well paid in an extra special manner.  The work of advisory officers at local level and the work of such staff on a general educational advisory basis&mdash;like all work of an educational nature&mdash;demands extreme dedication, it requires a special form of expertise.  When one is involved in the growing complexities of agricultural technology in rural Ireland I am afraid one tends to forget that there are some 500 staff employed in the field by these committees.  At conciliation and arbitration level there should be some special sense of urgency on the part of the Minister to raise the general level of pay of the staff.  In terms of growth of income they are very much underpaid and many of them must be envious of some of the cattle farmers with whom they have to deal.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Minister <Col N="2049" /> to reform and completely amend the method of appointment of the advisory and general staffs working for such committees&mdash;this is germane to the Minister's speech.  Although I represent an urban constituency.  I do not suffer from this extreme form of urban <i>versus</i> rural propaganda the Minister's Party is so wont to feed itself on in a rather perverse manner.  I have met on many occasions advisory and educational staffs who have had to suffer the humiliation, the despicable and deplorable practice of political canvassing for appointments.  There is nothing more reprehensible than that a highly qualified agricultural expert should have to prostitute himself to local politicians in order to canvass and cadge a couple of votes to secure an appointment.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the staffs are now in rather short supply; there are plenty of vacancies in some areas due to the relatively poor conditions of employment and the committees are not having too easy a time in regard to appointments generally.  However, in regard to the more notorious practices of the past, which are not entirely absent at the present time, I suggest to the Minister that the more acceptable and desirable practice of the Local Appointments Commission could be very usefully and effectively availed of for situations such as those I have described.</P>

      <P>The former Minister will have every opportunity to comment later.  I should like to deal now with the matter of the composition of such committees.  Admittedly, when they were formed immediately after local government elections inevitably there were co-options to such committees and, whether we like it or not, the committees are local political talking shops and debating shops of an advisory and educational nature.  They carry out essential work.  I would suggest to the Minister that in respect of many other national organisations, such as harbour boards and vocational education committees, it has been the practice to have various nominees of vocational groups appointed.</P>
      <P>I do not see any grave impinging on democratic practices if in filling the new membership of committees of agriculture local members of agricultural groups who were considered appropriate, were co-opted; for example officers or nominees of the NFA or the ICMSA in the south and various other specialised agricultural groups.  If the Minister wants to dispel the public impression of antagonism between his Department, the NFA, the ICMSA and various other representative groups in the agricultural community this is one useful way of integrating such bodies into the essential work of agricultural education and advisory services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the comments I wish to make.  I have adhered as rigidly as I could to the comments made by the Minister in his introductory statement.  Essentially, I dislike the practice of coming back here every four or five years and raising the levy rate.  I consider it ineffective and inefficient for those of us fortunate enough to be here in four or five years to have the Minister return here and raise the levy to 2s 7d in the £ and then off we go on another merry-go-round. I suggest to the Minister and his advisers that there must be a more coherent and better way of financing the affairs of committees of agriculture than that incorporated in the Bill.  These are the comments I want to make.  I would urge the Minister to take a sharp look at the £1½ million <Col N="2051" /> now being spent on such work and to analyse the situation in order to discover whether or not the country is getting real value for money.  Frankly, we do not know.  His intention to recast the whole work of committees of agriculture has within it a valuable and essential development in the agricultural services of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I wholeheartedly approve of it. I have served for over 25 years as a member of a county committee of agriculture.  Very few people give these committees the credit and appreciation they deserve.  These committees were first established in the early days of the State; it was a combined committee&mdash; educational, agricultural and technical. There was a division then on the establishment of the vocational education committees.  The county committees of agriculture became a separate entity. These committees have rendered a very valuable service and they have made a very generous contribution to agricultural policy because it is through these committees the farmers find expression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county committees of agriculture are the only statutory committees dealing with agricultural matters.  This Bill is very desirable because many of these committees have reached their maximum from the point of view of the striking of the rate and their activities were considerably handicapped because of lack of funds.  Now that we are, so to speak, on the doorstep of the EEC, I wonder should we have a look at the usefulness of these committees. What would the Minister's view be of permitting these committees to make their own demands, subject to the sanction of the Minister, without tying them down to any particular ceiling?  Some committees are, perhaps, more energetic than others.  Again, because of our geographical situation, there are areas in which the county committees focus their attention on milk production and everything connected with it.  There are areas in which the committees bend their energies to tillage.  In other areas they focus all their attention on livestock production. In the west of Ireland the main problem <Col N="2052" /> is, of course, the supplementing of the income of the smallholder in the congested districts.</P>
    <P>The county committees of agriculture have great responsibilities.  They will have greater responsibilities in the years ahead.  I would ask the Minister to give serious thought to greater co-operation between his Department and the county committees of agriculture. More emphasis should be placed on their work.  They should be given more staff and the wherewithal to meet the expense involved.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong to argue that the county committees are not democratically constituted.  After each local election the county committee of agriculture is appointed by the elected representatives.  Membership is not confined to elected representatives. Under the law there must be a number of non-elected members.  The local authority has the right to appoint to these committees members of farming organisations and others of outstanding ability from the point of view of agriculture. The county committee of agriculture of which I am a member invited the NFA and Macra na Feirme to nominate their own members to the committee.  They did so.  This has been very helpful because the elected members are re-inforced with the guidance, wisdom and knowledge of those intimately connected with farming organisations.</P>
    <P>Lest there might be any misunderstanding in regard to what the last speaker said about appointments, I know of no appointment that has not been made strictly on merit.  Permanent appointments are made by the Local Appointments Commission.  I do not always agree that this is the best system, but it is the best we have at the moment.  County committees of agriculture make temporary appointments. It is only right that I should put on record that those who serve voluntarily on these committees do so in the knowledge that they have a duty and obligation to appoint the best, the most highly qualified and the most efficient.  The first qualification for appointment is experience, efficiency and suitability.</P>
    <P>The present system of appointment has been satisfactory.  It might be even <Col N="2053" /> more satisfactory if some of the major posts filled by the Local Appointments Commission were filled by the committees.  For how long will we go on pretending that we cannot trust each other to do the work that should be done?  Will we merely use the county committees of agriculture as talking machines or will we share responsibility with them?  I think the time has come when we must look on these county committees of agriculture as county agricultural development committees.  I should like to see these committees taking over some of the work of the Land Commission.  I should like to see county committees of agriculture taking on some of the work of the Forestry Division; I should like to see them playing a more important part in advocating private forestry among small farmers so that through them smallholders could find ways and means of supplementing their incomes.</P>
    <P>When large holdings are being divided by the Land Commission the committees, the advisers, and the chief agricultural officer should be consulted about the suitability of applicants.  The county committees should have greater responsibilities and I am disappointed that in this Bill there is not even a section to cover the importance of the general council of committees of agriculture. At the moment funds available to the committees are restricted and this Bill is to remove that restriction considerably so that a higher rate can be struck and more funds will be available for expenditure by the committees.</P>
    <P>The general council have rendered outstanding service but they are restricted through the lack of a secretariat, proper offices and research workers.  The Department of Agriculture do not seem to be eager to place the emphasis on the statutory agricultural authorities, namely, the county committees of agriculture.  Does the Minister not agree that if the general council had a full secretariat staff they would be able to conduct research into the various branches of agriculture and the Minister would have to hand expert advice from practical farmers and elected representatives who are in the <Col N="2054" /> closest touch with people in all branches of agriculture?  It is all right to pay lip service to voluntary workers on the committees of agriculture but here we have a golden opportunity, now that changes are coming in every branch of our economy, to do something practical and worthwhile for those who believe in the activities of the county committees.</P>
    <P>The county committees were represented on the National Agricultural Council of which we have heard nothing of late.  Since the right of the county committees of agriculture to make a demand on the local authority is mentioned in the Bill, it is not too much to ask the Minister for Agriculture to allow these committees to play a greater part in the moulding of our agricultural policy.  Are we just going to allow them to seek the maximum rate as provided for under this Bill?  Are we going to leave it at that and allow them to draft schemes, whether it be the premium boar scheme, or the fox destruction scheme, or the noxious weeds regulations, or whatever it may be, or are we going to give them more solid and more effective work to do?  Every committee concentrates on its staff and wants to provide on its staff the best advisory services they can get for all farmers.  Is it not also correct to say that in recent years the farmers have been clamouring for the advice of the agricultural advisers and instructors in every county, something they were most reluctant to accept 25 years ago? They are doing it now because they have seen that by accepting the advice of these qualified people who are available for 24 hours a day to advise on fertilisers, on seeds, the rotation of crops and indeed on all branches of agriculture, they can improve their farms and so the services are being eagerly sought.  Should we not regard this as an occasion for complimenting the county committees of agriculture who have been responsible for creating such an atmosphere and such a spirit of co-operation between the men on the land and the advisers?</P>
    <P>It may be said that farmers do not need these advisory services, that they already know sufficient.  None of us <Col N="2055" /> knows sufficient.  I knew a man who lived to an extraordinary old age and his advice to young and old was that every day was a school day, that it was only when we left school that we started to learn all that we should know.  So it is with the farmers.  There was never greater need for the full acceptance of our advisory services in every agricultural home.  The barrier has been broken and thank God for that.  However, there may be still some of the older school, whom we respect, who may feel that they know enough and that they are not concerned with modern agricultural techniques, with modern agricultural machinery or with the various tests and sampling carried out by the Agricultural Institute, or with other information which can be given freely so that their incomes and profits may be increased at harvest time.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister will agree that when we have such an excellent service sponsored and fostered by the county committees of agriculture it is the duty of the committees to have at their disposal the best type of qualified personnel because the money we are providing under this Bill will be spent on these people?  I want to express my surprise in regard to the machinery which was set up recently to deal with the pay and remuneration of agricultural advisers, for whom the Minister has no responsibility.  It is only right to warn the Minister that young men who have graduated in agricultural science take up their first appointment at a rate of £950 per year whilst in other professions the starting point is usually £1,300 to £1,500.  Why should agriculture be ground down in this way to the lowest point?  Would one not expect in an agricultural country that when a man is qualified and takes on agriculture as his career we would put him into a position in which he could build up his future on a solid foundation?  There is little encouragement for anybody to concentrate on agriculture as other professions have a much more encouraging scale of pay than the scale paid by the county committees of agriculture.  I ask the Minister to intervene in this.</P>
    <P>I understand a certain committee <Col N="2056" /> have been dealing with this and that the representatives of the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture, an officer or two from the Department of Agricultural and Fisheries and representatives of the Agricultural Officers Association who sit on the committee have been dealing with this problem but the most recent report I have heard has been most unsatsfactory from the point of view of encouraging young men to take up agriculture as a career.</P>
    <P>I ask what better career can a young man adopt in this country than one devoted to agriculture?  However, the tendency is that he is attracted to the more remunerative professions.  We must stop that trend, not that we begrudge these other professions the high standards they have set as regards salaries.  Our aim is that those engaged in agriculture should be brought up to the same level.  With this in mind I ask the Minister seriously to intervene in this matter so that we will have a greater flow of young men, and girls, devoting their talents towards qualifying in agriculture in order to have them ready and available to county committees of agriculture as experts and advisers.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries examines closely the various schemes which must be undertaken by county committees. Is it not extraordinary that many county committees find themselves severely handicapped, because of lack of money, to realise their ambitions? It is correct to say that 50 per cent of expenditure on such schemes is recouped by the Department, in many instances more.  I strongly recommend that the Minister should accord national recognition to the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture by giving them a higher standing, the rank that they deserve, as advisers on national agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Minister to review the various schemes undertaken by county committees.  For instance, are we really satisfied with the operation of the pig premium scheme?  At every other meeting of the committee of which I am a member letters come in from those qualified to <Col N="2057" /> have what we describe as boar stations to the effect that the pigs supplied to them are suffering from different types of rheumatism peculiar to pigs, or that the pigs have proved to be infertile, and they request that the committee provide replacements.  I should like to know the type of supervisory system employed in these schemes.  Is it correct to say, for instance, that when a pig is supplied to a county committee, the animal has not been examined or certified by a veterinary surgeon as being in sound condition and excellent health?  I suggest pigs should be so certified.  I know cases where farmers cared well for the pigs, fed them well and housed them well, but they did not prove to be healthy. I suggest that in such schemes there should be more exactness.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the work of county committees of agriculture it might be appropriate to ask is it a fact that many counties have been disregarding the fox destruction scheme? If so, is it because they have no money?  The Minister stated that a number of counties had raised the maximum amount.  I regretfully have to tell the House that parts of the country are completely overrun by foxes. As a result of the vast increase in the fox population there is a big diminution in the poultry stocks throughout the country.  I know farmers who have been unable to continue large-scale poultry production because of invasion by foxes.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest that the Department take some steps to rid this country of the vast number of foxes that now threaten agricultural production. There have been complaints that numerous county committees of agriculture have disregarded the fox destruction scheme.  If you ask them about it they say that the bounties are payable to those who capture foxes provided the foxes' tails are produced in the local garda stations.  I do not know whether, having received the 5s for the tail, the person is allowed to take it away, and whether he might not take it back again and receive a second bounty.  There have been allegations that the same tail came in on numerous occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot indicate what becomes of a fox when he is captured but we ought to have sufficient organisation to ensure that when the bounty for the fox is paid no second bounty will be paid in respect of the same fox.  Seriously, I ask the Minister to investigate the extent to which fox destruction is being promoted in county committees. The matter is serious and the problem should be tackled.</P>
      <P>County committees of agriculture should be obliged to have a number of permanent sub-committees peculiar to the farming that prevails in the respective areas.  In tillage areas, there should be a grain sub-committee whose duty it would be to keep in the closest possible touch with the Irish Flour Millers' Association on the marketing of what and to keep in touch with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to ensure that harvesting problems connected with the tillage crop will be minimised.  There should be a dairying committee in dairying areas.  County committees of agriculture can do an enormous amount of valuable work because they are on the spot.</P>
      <P>Every county committee of agriculture has what can be described as an excellent advisory staff.  I am sure we have excellent chief agricultural officers in charge of these committees in all our counties.  The Minister should call these people to a meeting, ask for suggestions and guarantee that money will not stand in the way of the provision of proper agricultural advisory services.</P>
      <P>Ploughing matches should be encouraged. In the past, we had the horse plough.  Now we have our expert tractor ploughman.  The competition and the friendly rivalry engendered by ploughing matches were a notable feature of agricultural life here and such events should receive every encouragement. County committees of agriculture should not have to suffer financial embarrassment in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> Whilst livestock and the grass farmer may be very important to our economy at present, nevertheless, I am a believer in tillage&mdash;wheat, oats, beet and barley.  Our prospects as regards these commodities, particularly beet, do not seem to be very good so far as entry to EEC is concerned.  I shall not dwell on that topic now: there will be another occasion soon, I hope.  Some very important questions must be asked on that whole subject.</P>
    <P>I am a believer in producing as much food as we can from our land. Our county committees of agriculture should be encouraged to subsidise ploughing competitions and competitions organised by Macra na Feirme. We cannot be unmindful of the invaluable services rendered to this country by Macra na Feirme.  They made it easy for agricultural instructors and agricultural advisers to do their work by opening their committee room doors to the agricultural advisers and by telling the farmers that these people are their friends and are here to advise them free, gratis and for nothing.  The farmers were told that this service was provided by the State for the community and that they should avail of it.  It would be a great pity if the efforts of such an organisation went without mention.</P>
    <P>All functions sponsored by Macra na Feirme should be subsidised by the county committees of agriculture. Sufficient sums should be available to each committee for this purpose.  These agricultural events and lectures are of vital importance to our agricultural community.  We cannot close our eyes to the co-operation that has existed, and which I hope will continue to exist, between the Irish Countrywomen's Association and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash; again, through the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Agricultural shows in rural Ireland are not being encouraged to the extent to which they should be encouraged by the Department.  Every county committee of agriculture makes a substantial grant to the respective show committees but, because of the financial structure of county committees of <Col N="2060" /> agriculture, they are extremely limited in the amounts they may give.  I was always anxious that they would be generous to the maximum extent possible in the grant-in-aid for the continuance, particularly the survival, of the long-established agricultural shows which have been a source of so much pride and joy to our farming community. These shows include home-crafts. There are home-baking competitions, displays of good housekeeping and household management.  Through the Department, there should be a greater alertness on the part of our county committees for the revival of such shows.</P>
    <P>Our county committees of agriculture can play an even more important part than they are already playing in rendering advice, through their advisory services, in the formulation of various schemes, to be administered by the county committees of agriculture, in relation to achieving some measure of return from our cut-away boglands and poor quality, swampy land.</P>
    <P>There is no co-ordination between the various agricultural offices and the county committee of agriculture cannot do anything about this.  It is insanity to have land project offices at one end of a county, soil testing carried out at the other end and the offices of the county committee of agriculture somewhere else.  All the offices should be in one place.  The headquarters for the farm building and farm improvement schemes, administered directly by the Department, could also be in the offices of the county committee of agriculture.</P>

      <P>As we are giving county committees more money it is right that we should expect a better return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the wasteland in every county that is taken up by hedges and ditches were examined by the advisory staff of the county committees of agriculture <Col N="2061" /> a vast amount of good land would be discovered.  It is the duty of the advisory service to give advice on such matters.  If county committees of agriculture are being given more money we should know what they will spend it on.  We all know about the existing schemes, which are very worthwhile, but this is a time of change when we expect new ideas to develop.  Utilisation of waste bogland would be worthwhile and valuable.  County committees of agriculture could administer the necessary schemes.</P>
    <P>I would like to know when we will have a Minister for Agriculture who will ensure that every single acre of land is productive.  I know the present Minister is doing his best, in fact, we are all doing our best as members of county committees of agriculture but despite our best efforts we have not succeeded in making every acre productive.  I am told by reliable agricultural experts that the very worst land in this country is capable of producing something.  Who is going to do it?  The Department of Agriculture are involved in major agricultural problems and the problems which our possible entry into the EEC will create.  County committees of agriculture have an intimate knowledge of rural problems and could deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael agricultural policy provides for agricultural regional development committees.  Such regional committees would undertake greater responsibility in rural Ireland so that any new ideas could be developed and tested there.  County committees of agriculture will play a vital role in the future of this country.  Will the Minister say what he expects the county committees of agriculture to do?</P>
    <P>I have never known the Minister for Agriculture to refuse consultation with any county committee of agriculture. When the county committee of agriculture of which I am a member wanted to see the Minister we simply asked him if he would see us and he agreed to do so.  We walked in and discussed our problems with him; we did not come out with all we wanted, <Col N="2062" /> but at least we had an exchange of views which showed that the Minister was prepared to recognise the agricultural committees.  I hope the Minister will give new responsibilities to the committees.  There are small farmers and large farmers with mixed politics or no politics on these committees, who are all united in the one ambition and the one aim to improve the lot of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives county committees of agriculture, who are financially handicapped, the power to develop their existing schemes.  They cannot embark on new schemes unless they have sufficient funds.  There is no point in asking the committees to function without the necessary funds.  The best agricultural advisory service which the State can provide is available to these committees and they are all giving an excellent service.  It would be regrettable if their efforts were handicapped by lack of money.  Therefore, I believe the Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I hope the points raised by all the speakers will give the Minister food for thought.  County committees of agriculture, and in particular the general council of committees of agriculture, can play an important role in the furtherance of our agricultural policy by bringing about a greater measure of co-operation between all agricultural interests.  They can also play a great role in meeting the very serious challenge which will face the agricultural industry in the event of our entering the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a member of a county council for a long time and I was also a member of a committee of agriculture but I left because I felt at that time that it was an ineffective body.  I undertand some effort has been made in recent times to improve the efficiency of these committees.  If we were to have 27 committees of agriculture, as we have 27 county councils, it appears to me that we would have 27 completely different farming methods in operation.  I am prepared to support any Bill which will bring about better conditions for farmers.  It irritates me that we have so many overlapping organisations all <Col N="2063" /> going their own way as far as I can see.  Some of those organisations are doing nothing other than providing sinecure employment for certain people who know nothing at all about agriculture.</P>
      <P>If the qualifications of some members of committees of agriculture in certain counties are examined it will be found that they had not even a spade never mind a plough in their hands at any time.  If we are to continue the committees of agriculture we should make sure that the members possess some agricultural qualifications. My friend, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, hit the nail on the head.  I no longer agree that those committees should carry on as administrative bodies.  They should be development committees.  Up to now there has been practically no co-operation between the officials of the committees of agriculture in some areas and the ordinary officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and between the latter and the officials of the Land Commission and others interested in land.</P>
      <P>It is time some co-ordination took place so that there will not be a waste of personnel.  It would appear that agricultural science graduates will play a less important role in future because I think the universities frown on them. They do not like agriculture.  It appears to me that we will have great difficulty, especially in the west of Ireland, in finding agricultural instructors.  As Deputy Flanagan said some time ago a concerted effort should be made to have all our agricultural services operate in an area from a single base and not have any divergence in our opinions as to what should be for the local areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never held with county councils or committees of agriculture because they are absolutely outdated. In the context of modern development and in a small country like this if we are to have such a system at all we should have regional councils, and regional committees.  The sooner the change comes the better.  When the new regional health boards are set up and the changes which take place are seen a great many people will agree <Col N="2064" /> with what I have said.  In Connacht, which has 5 counties, Galway and Mayo are two big counties and Sligo and Leitrim are two small counties yet we have the same duplication in the latter as we have in Galway and Mayo.  I believe one committee could deal with the whole of Connacht and, perhaps, with Clare as well.  If we had something like that we would have a much better service.  It is about time people thought over this.</P>
    <P>I know certain people will say that this is not correct but if you asked them for their reasons I doubt if they could give any good reasons for continuing this position.  It is like the people who make excuses for the continuation of county councils.  The main reason why they do so and try to defend the existence of county councils and committees of agriculture is purely and simply because they use them in some cases for their own benefit and in other cases just for the sake of publicity.  It is time we had a look at this whole matter and that we changed our ideas towards this whole set-up in administration. After all, there is no such thing today as local government.  There is local administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to give examples.  My friend on the far side instanced a few good ones.  The point is that just like county councils county committees of agriculture are local bureaucracies controlled by a central bureaucracy in Dublin.  That is what obtains today.  The members have no power at all.  I admit that in many cases they have allowed the power to slip out of their hands.  They exist purely and simply to vote money.  They may be called administrative bodies but they can hardly be regarded as advisory bodies and they certainly cannot be held up as development bodies.  It is a pity those committees could not be used as development bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Deputy in this House and any man who has been involved in public <Col N="2065" /> affairs for any considerable time must realise that most of those committees do very little except hold meetings. They do not even have the slightest contact with the people they employ. It is a well-known fact that there are members of committees of agriculture who have not the slightest clue regarding the identity of the officials employed by them.  It is time some effort was made to alter that position.  Some kind of regional committee should be set up.  Two which would be efficient and outspoken could be set up in Connacht.  Members could be appointed to them and something would come out of it.  I really cannot understand why we should have five different committees of agriculture in Connacht.  As I said earlier, I am sure that when the health committees begin to operate I will be proved right. I left the Mayo committee some years ago but as far as I know it has about 20 members.</P>
    <P>There are a little less than 100 members on these committees in the five countries of Connacht.  In many cases there is a great conflict of opinion among them.  I went to a meeting on the health services in Athlone some months ago where I saw ten members from Galway, ten from Roscommon and ten from Mayo with the Minister for Health.  I thought there would have been grave differences of opinion expressed at that meeting but it ended up very amicably and rapidly.  The Minister should consider the question of regional committees rather than county committees.  I left county committees because I regarded them as ineffective.  I am not saying exactly that they were inefficient.  I hold the same view now as I held ten years ago when I left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small Bill. There is not very much we can say about it.  I was rather surprised at the complete condemnation which the last speaker visited upon county committees of agriculture.  Some of it may be merited.  Within the conditions under which these committees operate I believe they have done a fairly good job.  One can be unduly over-critical. The Minister is asking that power be <Col N="2066" /> given to provide the committees now with extra money.  In that context one is entitled to ask what value one is getting for the money.  There seems to be some objection to discussing the committees of agriculture in a wide context.  On the other hand, unless we discuss the functions and the activities of the committees for whom extra money is being provided there is very little we can say about this Bill.  We would merely become a rubber stamp to give democratic face to decisions already taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question of agricultural committees will probably come up for increasing discussion in the future in view of the fact that the notion of regionalisation, the whole question of local government and the various reports we have got at various times have caused public re-thinking along these lines.  The Minister himself referred to two important documents&mdash; the Jones/Davies Report and the Devlin Report.  He did not see fit at present to make any comment or to give his views on either report.  The Minister merely said that he is turning them over in his mind and will express his views later on.  We are also promised a White Paper on Local Government and a White Paper on the Common Market.  All these things are interlocked. They tie in with the future of local committees of agriculture.  It may be that before the Minister makes up his mind to give us any comments on the reports he mentioned he will wait for the White Paper and particularly the parts referring to agriculture and our future in the event of our entering the Common Market.  It seemed to a number of people for a long time, before these reports put the thing down in black and white, that there were overlapping functions.  The Department of Agriculture is an excellent Department.  It is the most important Department in this country. It covers a very wide field.  Anyone reading the annual reports and familiarising himself with the Department's activities&mdash;as I have to do in the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash; is only too familiar with the tremendous field it covers and the excellent service it gives.  It seems that committees <Col N="2067" /> of agriculture have not kept pace with the Department itself and have been left behind.  That is a pity. Even from a democratic point of view it is desirable that local committees of agriculture should be put on a better footing.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill the Minister is introducing here today in so far as it provides a little extra money for the committees of agriculture.  It is an enabling measure.  It will allow county councils to provide this extra money. There is an extraordinary degree of overlapping.  For example, we have the committees of agriculture dealing with agricultural matters.  Then we have the county council, which is the parent body, also delving into agricultural matters.  We had long, and sometimes very deep, discussions in my own county council on sheep-dipping schemes of various types and on the equipment used for the dipping.  Some of the members are experts on this subject while others are bored and object to a discussion on this subject at all.  Yet we provide money for sheep-dipping.  It seems ludicrous to have a committee of agriculture in one building and the county council next door discussing sheep-dipping tanks. One would feel that this was a job more appropriate for the committee of agriculture than for the county council.  The inspection of slaughterhouses has been discussed at county council meetings.  This is a matter which could be handled by committees of agriculture but it is being handled by a local body.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that these functions of the committees of agriculture could be more appropriately carried out locally by other bodies.</P>

The whole purpose of debate is the fermentation of human ideas.  The word &ldquo;debate&rdquo; implies some degree of flexibility.  This is not a questionnaire.  If the debate is to be so restricted as the Chair would suggest, then it will become merely &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, a questionnaire, and any worthwhile discussion ends, and the whole purpose of parliamentary discussion is debased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two previous speakers have already mentioned overlapping and duplication and have adverted to the desirability of having some rationalisation of the functions of the committees of agriculture.  My contribution so far has merely proceeded along these lines.  The second last speaker said that it seems to be ridiculous to have a TB scheme at one end of the county, a land project scheme at the other end of the county and the committee of agriculture in some other <Col N="2069" /> part of the county.  There is this duality at local level.</P>
      <P>For example, there are local instructors in the committees of agriculture. They report to the chief agricultural officer.  There are local inspectors and they report to the Department. Whether or not it is desirable to have this duality&mdash;and it seems to me to be questionable&mdash;there does not seem to be proper co-ordination between them. Grants are handled by both inspectors and instructors and advice can come from both inspectors and instructors. Some degree of rationalisation is desirable.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the Devlin Report.  At page 285 it summarises the principal defects of the present system:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Overlap of administrative and advisory functions between inspectors and instructors.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Conflict between advisory function and scheme administration function.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The lines of communication and command between agricultural inspectors, chief agricultural officers and inspectors can lead to difficulties.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The separation into two services affects career opportunities.</P>
      <P>These four points sum up what the Devlin Committee considered as defects in our local committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I mentioned a couple of points that came to mind at local administrative level: the question of sheep-dipping tanks and inspection of slaughterhouses. We also have a seeds subsidy scheme administered by the county council.  Surely these are more appropriate to these local committees of agriculture.  We had an agricultural plot subsidy administered by small urban bodies.  I do not know whether this scheme is still in operation.  In most places I think it has fallen through because it was not availed of. This kind of <i>ad hoc</i> development all over the place requires to be looked at again and rationalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that all this needs legislation and it does, but this is <Col N="2070" /> rather urgent.  The local committees of agriculture must be either upgraded or abolished.  We cannot leave them in their present position.  We are now negotiating our entry into the Common Market in which agriculture will be one of the most important matters that will arise and it is on agricultural exports that we will have to depend for our economic survival.  The Minister should urge his colleagues in the Government to issue a White Paper on the Common Market as soon as possible so that he may be able to rationalise his own Department in the context of what that White Paper will disclose.  The two things hang together and there are many improvements that could and should be made.  I am personally in favour of giving increased autonomy and authority to local committees of agriculture.  If anything is a grass roots job surely it is agriculture and it should go back to the local people who produce the raw materials so that they may be given the maximum interest in their own work.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable to consider whether it is proper to have advisory services administered by these committees and at the same time an overlapping advisory service administered centrally by the Department.  There is an analogous position in respect of local government&mdash;again please do not pull me up because I intend to say only a word or two about it.  The duality in respect of advisory services began some years ago when Mr. Dillon was Minister for Agriculture.  The same duality appears under local government in respect of group schemes. There are group schemes administered directly by the Department and regional schemes administered by the county councils.  An official in the county council acts as a liaison officer between the two but the inspector or the engineer dealing with the water scheme does not come to the county council.  This duality does not provide a good administrative system.</P>
    <P>The same thing could be said as regards our advisory services, two services competing or overlapping do not look administratively good.  I would suggest&mdash;and this suggestion was made <Col N="2071" /> in the Jones/Davies Report&mdash;that a unified advisory service should be set up under the general direction of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries utilising and expanding committees of agriculture on an agency basis.  That would be a better system than the looser system which obtains at the moment.  Secondly, I would suggest&mdash;and this was mentioned by Deputy Flanagan&mdash;that the local administrative service should be enlarged and should embrace some of the functions of the Forestry Division of the Land Commission and even of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. These bodies are very close to the land; they are grass roots organisations and could be locally administered by expanded and more efficient committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The third suggestion I would make is that there should be greater integration of the advisory and grants services. It would help, where grants are being given, if the advisory service could have a greater say in the allocation of grants.  If the rural community knew that the man who was telling them what way to do the job would have a say in giving them the grant they would be more willing to call on his services and to accept his advice. The integration of the advisory and grants or aids services should be provided for.</P>
    <P>The fourth suggestion I would make is that where the counties are small&mdash; and I am not being carried away by this wave of regionalism which is affecting everybody&mdash;they should be grouped together.  Counties on the western seaboard or a small county like Carlow could be included in a suitable grouping in order to secure the better financial and administrative structure for these local committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach promised that we would have a White Paper on the question of the Common Market, and I would urge the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to hasten the production of this White Paper, because anything as regards the future of committees of agriculture or any re-structuring of agriculture in general <Col N="2072" /> will have to be done in the context of what we face in the future.  Probably very few of us know what that is likely to be because none of us is sufficiently informed and none of us has the gift of prophecy.</P>
    <P>Apart from increasing agricultural efficiency, and enabling our farmers to produce more with greater profit for themselves, we must construct our agricultural committees as development committees on a regional basis, with greater autonomy, with the object of securing for our farmers a greater part in the processing and marketing of their raw materials.  That fundamental notion is accepted generally.  We can get the best out of our farming communities by developing these local committees, for which we are providing extra money, on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister is replying he will give us his present thinking on these matters.  No one will hold him up to ransom if he prefaces his remarks by saying: &ldquo;This is what I think at the moment.  I may have to change my mind.&rdquo;  Everybody has to change his mind from time to time.  We are moving into changing and challenging times and we must be prepared for change and it is desirable that the thinking of the Minister and his Department on these matters should be available at the earliest opportunity to the public, to us on this side of the House and particularly to the farmers.  That is why I have discussed this Bill in a rather wider context than the Chair seemed happy about.  I offer my apologies to the Chair for enlarging the scope of the discussion further than the Chair thought right or proper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seldom wandered further outside the scope of the matter before the House.  While sitting here I was thinking&mdash;that is while I was awake; half the time I was not&mdash;that, apart from a bull show, I have not heard anything like I heard on this matter this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, I should like to thank the House for their acceptance of what is in the Bill regardless of what they said about the things that are not in it.  There will, undoubtedly, be ample opportunity in the future to discuss the <Col N="2073" /> matters which were mentioned but were not relevant.  This legislation is for the purpose of making available to our committees of agriculture, through their county councils, the facility of getting more money to pay for what they are doing.  Extra demand has been brought about because the cost of providing the services they render is naturally going up and, in addition, the services have been expanded and are expanding.  For both reasons we have had a growing demand on local authority coffers.  It is to make it possible for local authorities to give committees of agriculture the necessary funds by way of local contribution that I brought this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>That this Bill is a further instalment of legislation enacted over the years is merely in keeping with the type of funding provided for in the legislation. Altered poundage rates will have to be provided for.  It is only right that this provision should be made in this House from time to time and that the limit should not be rigid.  It is for these reasons that we have these recurring Bills.  They are not unnecessary or irrelevant.  It is proper that they should come in this way in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>If the House will agree I suggest we should get this legislation through as quickly as possible so that it may also be dealt with by the Seanad and in that way brought into law as soon as possible.  The end of the financial year for local authorities is fast approaching and, as every local authority member appreciates, it is desirable or even necessary that the authorities that must provide more than 21d in the £ should have the authority to do so in the coming year and make the necessary provision before the final estimates meeting and the striking of the local rate.  I commend the relevant matter of this discussion to the House, namely the raising of the rate of 21d in the £ to a ceiling of 27d in the £ for contributions by councils on request by committees of agriculture.  It would facilitate local authorities if we could have this measure completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the Minister will give consideration to the question of providing the General Council of Committees of Agriculture with a secretariat and the necessary funds to enable certain research work to be carried out?  If committees are prepared to contribute, would the Department be prepared to give, say, 75 per cent against 25 per cent from the committees?  I think this would be most desirable and the Minister should seriously consider it in view of the importance of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was not discussed with any finality.  We dealt not so much with the question of a contribution from the Central Fund as the making of an enabling regulation to permit committees of agriculture to contribute to the General Council a sum greater than the £30 that was the limit heretofore.  In other words, there is a request that the limit should be raised to £100 per committee of agriculture. While the matter was not determined, we discussed it to the point where we arranged to set up a working group representative of the Council of the Committees of Agriculture and of my Department to go into the whole matter of the commodity groups that have been mentioned by the General Council and the method of funding them in regard to expertise, knowledge and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" /> All these matters are tied together. Until we have sorted things out and agreed between us as to what purpose the various committees can serve, the scope of their influence and jurisdiction within the General Council and then cost the services they will need by way of staff and research, it is too soon to talk about who will pay what or what amount should be provided.  There the matter rests at the moment, but it has progressed to the point that a working party has been agreed on this evening to discuss it further.  Beyond that, I cannot comment at the moment.</P>

I do so in full recognition of the outstanding service that has been given to this country by our Army personnel and by all those who have now retired from the service.  Since the establishment of the Army it has comprised men of outstanding ability and unquestionable integrity.  Particularly it has comprised men who joined with the sincere intention of serving their country with outstanding loyalty and of showing their devotion to and love for their <Col N="2076" /> country.  In many countries people make a career of the Army but the conditions in our Army have not been sufficiently attractive to cause large numbers to join our Defence Forces and make a career of it.</P>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by relating a conversation I had with a member of the Defence Forces who was walking along the road and to whom I offered a seat in my car one morning when coming to this House. It is customary for any public spirited citizen when driving, if he has a seat available, never to pass a person in uniform.  I asked this man: &ldquo;Do you like the Army?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Yes, I have served in the Army for a long time.&rdquo;  I then asked him what his purpose was as a soldier.  There was a long pause and I asked him what was the purpose of our Army and what was his purpose in life.  The man very politely said: &ldquo;To be honest with you, I do not exactly know what our purpose is.&rdquo;  Does the Minister feel it is a good thing to have people serving in the Army who really do not know the purpose for which they are there?  Is that a good and a healthy sign?  Every country must have its army.  We have a very great tradition of being good, honest and brave soldiers.  Our history testifies to our bravery.  When we talk to old ex-servicemen who participated in the 1914-18 world war we hear stories of the contribution which the Irish made in the defence of small nations and we hear of the courage displayed by them.  We Irish can certainly boast of the fact that it was the bravery and courage of the Irish regiments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Irish Army was not established at that time and these were our own men, inspired by bravery and they were not afraid in the trenches.  They were not afraid to face the enemy.  These men who displayed great courage by helping to win the 1914-18 war passed on that bravery to their sons.  If Deputy O'Malley had the manners to listen that is the point I was coming to.</P>

      <P>How many men have we serving in the Irish Defence Forces today who inherited their courage and bravery from their fathers and grandfathers?  Just as farming and other professions are traditional so also is the Army.  Many good soldiers serving in the Irish Defence Forces were inspired by the bravery of their fathers and grandfathers.  That is the point I have been making and it is one which I can stand over because in our Defence Forces today there are men of courage, ability and outstanding bravery.  If this has been passed down from their forefathers who served in wars and acquitted themselves with distinction I do not think Deputy O'Malley can make them any worse soldiers today than their ancestors were when they were fighting real wars with real enemies on dangerous battlefields in France, Belgium and elsewhere. Deputy O'Malley would not be inclined to salute these outstanding ex-servicemen but I do, every one of them.</P>

Our Irish Army comes first for us Irish people but there are Irishmen serving in other armies who display the same courage and determination and the same love of army life.</P>

      <P>I shall again advert to the question I put to the serving member of the Defence Forces a few weeks ago who was unable to tell me for what purpose he was serving in the Army.  I asked: &ldquo;What is the Army for?  What are your ambitions in the Army?&rdquo; He did not know who I was; he cared less.  The only thing I knew about him was that he was a serving member of the Defence Forces who could not tell me the purpose of the Irish Army.  I ask the Minister for Defence is it really good for morale that we should have such a lack of objective.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Defence place on the records of this House what is the objective and purpose of our Army so that we may have a headline we can quote, which can be used with authority, clearly outlining the purpose of the Army in this country?  Since the end of the Emergency this has not been clarified and it is difficult to know precisely for what the Army are training and re-equipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is not the purpose of an army, first, to aid the civil power&mdash;the Government&mdash;and to aid people who are in difficulty and, secondly, to take part in United Nations' peace-keeping operations?  Our greatest contribution to the cause of international peace is the impressive contribution of members of our Defence Forces who excelled themselves in the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations.  They have been a very great credit to themselves and to the country.  The members of our Defence Forces who are associated with the United Nations peace-keeping operations &mdash; and I would emphasise peace-keeping operations&mdash;have displayed to the forces of other countries associated with the UN a high degree of skill, efficiency, excellent training and, above all, loyalty to the ideals of peace-keeping. Our contribution has not been a small one.  It has not been without its sadness, its losses and its grief to many Irish homes, but we can look with pride on our Army, some of whose members gave their lives in the cause of freedom. <Col N="2079" /> Our Army displayed qualities of charity, of brotherly love and, above all, of law and order.</P>
    <P>Is it not part of the obligation of our Army to defend the country in time of war?  In my opinion that is the real purpose of an army.  Recently the Minister for Defence launched a recruiting drive and asked young people to join the Army as a career.  RTE showed a most attractive and very well-designed advertisement to direct attention to this recruiting drive, but has the response been satisfactory?  If it has not been satisfactory we must examine the reasons.  Is it perhaps that the Army has no future purpose or objective?</P>
    <P>Let us examine the accommodation available for members of our Defence Forces.  Since I am no longer a member of the front bench of my party I can speak with a greater measure of freedom. If we are going to have an Army let us pay the force well, house them in proper conditions and give them a purpose in life.  If we cannot do this we should stop tinkering about with the situation.  Let us have an Army of contented men, well housed and paid adequately.  The system of stationing our Defence Forces in old barracks throughout the country does not help in any way, apart from being a very costly and expensive exercise. The Minister for Health and members of the Government say: &ldquo;Let us get away from the old workhouse.  The gloom associated with the old poor house buildings should be removed because it is a symbol of imperialism and of the hard days of poverty and distress&rdquo;.  Most of our county institutions now called after the patron saint of the poor, St. Vincent, are disappearing as is the old appearance of the workhouses.  However, the Army barracks still have a dreary, dim look. We should remember that these buildings have been in use for generations. They are costly to maintain no matter how much we spend on them and they must be responsible for much of the fatigue of members of the Defence Forces who have to live and work in them.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that these old barracks <Col N="2080" /> have had their day and it would be most desirable if the Minister for Defence would undertake to have those properties cleared out and sold and in their place build two or three modern barracks, designed and equipped for this modern age.  Would it not be better to have two or three well-designed barracks rather than continue the vast expenditure every year on the maintenance of the existing buildings?  These buildings could never be modernised. I am sure the Minister has inspected some of these buildings.  With the exception of Kildare, I have seen them only from the road.  I do not like the look of them.  If we intend to have an army then we should have modern buildings in which to train that army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I shall not develop the point further.  I would like, however, to deal with the pay of members of the Defence Forces who were called up last autumn.  Those on the Reserve immediately responded and, as a result of their response, many of them suffered financial loss.  This sort of situation should not arise.  No doubt the Minister's attention has been drawn to certain problems which have arisen.  I am sure the officials of the Minister's Department can readily make available to him details of the incomes of those who were called up both before and after call-up.  I understand that in one case the loss was as much as £110 per month.  I do not know what motives would inspire a citizen to forfeit £110 per month in existing circumstances.  If the country were in danger, if the lives of our people were in jeopardy, if we were in the midst of a horrifying catastrophe, these men would quickly and voluntarily give their services without any thought of cost or expense but, when we do not know what the call-up is about, when it is a call-up merely for the sake of publicity and creating a certain image abroad, to expect any man to lose £110 per month is asking a little too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make up the losses of every member of the Reserve.  On production of evidence of income prior to call-up the Department should pay sufficient to each reservist to guarantee him against any financial loss even if it is only one penny piece, not to mention £100 per month.  Service should not be at the member's expense or the expense of the family for whom he must provide.  Many reservists have families who are at the expensive age from an educational point of view and with the soaring cost of living and commitments of one sort or another it is too much to expect that because the Army required their <Col N="2082" /> services &mdash; despite the fact that there was no evidence of war or of emergency with the exception of some international publicity &mdash; they should suffer financial loss.</P>
    <P>This is an occasion on which the Minister should make a statement on all the Reserve problems most of which, indeed, are concerned with pay. If you are to have a happy and contented Army then you must pay the members well.  They deserve to be well paid.  Many of them are men who are highly skilled in their various professions; some are from the engineering profession while others are in other walks of life.  Parliament cannot seriously consider that they should be asked to suffer financial loss.  I am sure the Minister has to hand details of all the problems associated with the Reserve.  The question of pay is vitally important more particularly when we hear the rumour that the annual training period this year has been cancelled and that there is a possibility that the grant will not be paid.  I should like to hear from the Minister, for the record and the information of all concerned, if it is a fact that the annual training period for the Reserve has been cancelled and that there is a possibility the grant will not be paid.  If this is so the Minister has probably based his decision on advice given to him by officers of his Department and it is the sort of advice that if acted upon will certainly destroy the morale of officers, NCOs and men.  It is the sort of advice that will ruin the morale of men who love to serve in the Army.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has adverted to the fact that the grant has been fixed for the last 30 years and that it must be increased by at least four times the present amount.  I cannot say exactly when the grant was fixed but I do not remember any alteration in it coming up in an Estimate here within the past 28 years.  Does the Minister not think it is high time the grant was substantially increased?  This House is prepared to vote the money and all the Minister has to do to ensure a high standard of morale in a contented force is to see that it is paid.  Is it that the Minister for Finance is exercising a credit squeeze on the Department of <Col N="2083" /> Defence to such an extent that an outstanding case such as this cannot be met?  The Minister may ask what will offset the cost.  It could very easily be offset by shortening to 14 days the annual training period for officers to bring it into line with that of the NCOs and men.  This is something I would recommend to the Minister.  All those who are interested in the Army should realise that this is the place and the time to stand up and be counted in their favour.</P>
    <P>In the case of junior officers on the Reserve First Line the grant should be increased to at least £300 per year. This is not a very extravagant sum but it is a sum to which they are entitled because of their ability, intelligence and qualifications.  In the case of senior officers of the Reserve First Line the grant should be increased to £400 a year at least.  These are recommendations which a Minister for Defence who is deeply concerned with the morale of his services should not reject.  I am putting them to him in the hope that he will accept them.  Such an increase would clearly indicate that a proper value is being placed on the services of the Reserve First Line.  The grant at present is of the order of £8 to £75 per year and everyone would agree that that is a ridiculously low figure. Is there any common sense or intelligence in offering a man that amount? Such a sum might have been worth collecting in the days of the Battle of Clontarf.</P>

      <P>If that is the encouragement the Minister for Defence is prepared to give I am surprised. I was talking about the 1014 Battle of Clontarf.  I was not referring to the present residents of that area.  I realise the Minister is more concerned tonight with the residents of Inchicore and Ballyfermot.  I am concerned about the people in the defence forces who are being paid the miserable sum of from £8 to £75 a year.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is trying to take on the role of Ceann Comhairle there is no point in having you, Sir, in the Chair.  I will not take directions from the Minister for Defence as to what is in order and what is not.  I am speaking of Army rates of pay and of sums of between £8 and £75 per annum being paid, which are so ridiculously low that they are disgraceful.  I am suggesting that the Minister do his best to have these rates increased so that a junior officer in the Reserve First Line will get £300 a year and a senior officer £400.  As I have said, the present rates are disgraceful.</P>
      <P>I know, Sir, that you will not permit me to speak of Army promotion even if I point out that promotion will affect an officer's pay.  I hope and trust that I shall be able to deal with all matters connected with the Army when the main Estimate comes before the House.  In the meantime I should like to ask the Minister if he has received representations in respect to the problems of the Reserve First Line and, if so, what he proposes to do about it.  I suggest that he should reduce the annual training period in the case of officers to two weeks to bring it into line with that of NCOs and men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Army pay I have often wondered from whom the Minister takes his headline.  Does he accept the views of senior Army personnel or does he make up his own mind?  If this function is solely the responsibility of the Minister, then let the Minister do the job and let it be seen that he is in charge and that he is prepared to pay men for work done.  The advice those in the Department will give him will be based on economy.  Any advice I ever saw in Government files was always based on economies.  Advice so <Col N="2085" /> based has too often led to discontent. There should be much more common sense and greater generosity.</P>
    <P>Men in the Reserve by their example have been an inspiration to younger members of the defence forces. Having served the country while in the Army, they have continued to serve it in civilian life and have given unstintingly in the matter of advice and defence lectures.  They deserve practical recognition in the form of Government aid.  It is all right for the Minister, like any other Deputy, to stand up and pay lip service to the reservists in respect of the services they have given.  It must however be appreciated that many of them have suffered serious financial loss because of this service.  It is for that reason that I have made this appeal on their behalf.  They are not looking for charity: all they want is justice and fair play.  They responded to the call when it was given and they gave good service of which they and the country can be proud.</P>
    <P>There are young men leaving school who would like to join the Army but the rate of pay is not attractive.  The Minister may ask where they will get better, having regard to the training they will receive.  I shall deal, on another Estimate, with the so-called comforts which will be available to them and I shall concentrate now on the fact that the rates of pay are not attractive to recruits.  I am convinced that if an improvement were made in that respect a greater number of young men would enlist.  It is difficult to say which is the worse for a starter today &mdash;farming or the Army.  I trust the Minister will see his way to bring about an all-round improvement in relation to Army pay.</P>
    <P>Let me stress again the plight of the many men who have suffered financial loss because of the call-up of the Reserve.  I appeal to the Minister to consult with the officers of his Department so that the first charge on the money voted for this Supplementary Estimate will be to ensure that no member of the Reserve First Line will suffer the loss of one penny as a result of being called up.  Reservists <Col N="2086" /> have been fair and honest with the country.  It is the duty of the country to be fair and honest with them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan asked that any person here interested in the welfare of the Army should stand up and be counted.  Just recently I completed 34 years service in the Army Reserve and I should like to thank Deputy Flanagan for his kind words of praise.</P>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on the quiet and efficient work he has done.  In my constituency of Clare-Galway nine children lost their lives in a drowning accident.  At 10 a.m. on the morning after the drowning I telephoned the Minister and asked him if he could make deep sea divers available to help the gardaí.  They arrived at 4 p.m. and immediately started work.  Subsequently, the leader of the Garda diving squad, an experienced man, said that he would like helicopters to search for the bodies.  I telephoned the Minister and, on the same day, two helicopters arrived.  The relatives and the people in that part of the country are very grateful to the Minister for his prompt action in helping to locate all the bodies on that very sad occasion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the pay of troops, would the Minister consider payment of a disturbance allowance to officers, NCOs and men on temporary duty who are awaiting home stations?  I understand that gardaí and civil servants get this allowance.</P>
      <P>When I became a Member of this House I lost my commission in the Reserve.  I should like some certificate for that service and, indeed, any man retiring from the Reserve would like a certificate to show that he had been on the Reserve.</P>

      <P>Almost £2 million is being sought in this Supplementary Estimate.  This demonstrates a certain underestimation of expenses. Circumstances confronting the Army in the past 12 months have, indeed, been somewhat unusual.  We are beginning to realise that the Army will have to carry out many functions that it did not formerly have to perform.  At one <Col N="2087" /> time the Army was considered a standing army which in case of emergency, attack on the country, and so on, could rapidly be brought into action.  The many charges placed upon the Army as a whole reflect the increase being sought in Army pay. There have been developments in Northern Ireland which the Government could not, perhaps, have foreseen although we must all have had a feeling that at some time or another a situation was bound to arise there.  It is very likely that the Minister will not be able to introduce a reduced Estimate for his Department for the coming year.  The cost of everything has gone up everywhere and the demands on the Army are greater now than they were and, indeed, are likely to continue at that level.  Apart from the pay increases that are actually necessary, most of the charges spring from the disturbances in the Six Counties during the past 12 months.  We probably all feel that they are by no means ended and that the Army may be called on for even greater service than they have so far been asked to contribute in this connection.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies referred to the camp established to deal with the refugees from the north.  This camp has, to a large extent, contributed towards this Supplementary Estimate.  When all the circumstances are considered the setting up of this camp was probably the best thing the Government could have done but adverse comment has been made upon the state of the camp itself. It appears to be obsolete and the facilities, such as toilet facilities, are inadequate to meet the situation.  I do not know why this particular camp was used because there are many other places which would have been more suitable.  The occasion which brought about the setting up of this camp is likely to arise again and the Minister ought to take these things into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to keep an army efficient, up-to-date and enthusiastic we have to provide the best services and facilities available to us.  People will not enlist merely because of the salary offered; they also want better conditions in <Col N="2088" /> which to work.  I am subject to correction but I believe the pay of a private soldier is in the neighbourhood of £8 a week.  Admittedly, that is not his entire pay because his uniform is free and he is also supplied with free meals in the canteen but a soldier's pay should be in keeping with wages outside the force.</P>
    <P>The Army used to be regarded as a training force in the event of this country having to participate in hostilities but it now has to carry out work of a different nature.  What has recently happened in this country seems to indicate the possibility of a greater strain and a greater test on the loyalty of our fighting forces in the future. They will probably have to deal with outside interference&mdash;by that I mean trouble from the Six Counties.  They will have to deal in an efficient and highly disciplined way, acting with restraint at some times, when guarding particular places.  They will be in the danger zone all the time and I am wondering if the standards of pay are sufficient to entice young people to serve in the Army.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that unless a soldier serves the full period of 21 years he gets nothing if he leaves after four or five years service.  This means he will leave the service almost totally unprotected on the labour market.  It should not be beyond the Minister for Defence to work out a scheme whereby young people could be encouraged to join the Army in greater numbers.  I am certain there are many vacancies in the Army today because of the numbers of troops we have serving with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate is that we had to call on our Defence Forces&mdash;although we were not actively engaged in hostilities&mdash;to engage in preventative action.  The Minister should devise a scheme for short-term service.  I do not know if I am correct in saying this&mdash;I know more about navies than armies&mdash;but I believe most countries have a system of short-term service which means when men leave the force they have a few pounds in their pockets.  I do not know if there is any such scheme here.  I have looked through the Estimate and the Supplementary <Col N="2089" /> Estimate and I have found no mention of it but I think such a scheme would meet the problem.  Certainly, the Minister would not be setting any precedent by introducing such a scheme because most other countries have one.</P>
    <P>Not so many years ago soldiers were paid practically nothing at all.  No attempt was made to equate their salaries with those paid in civilian life, but that was at a time when people made their career in the Army and they looked forward to drawing their pension but that position no longer exists. It is quite understandable that people were reluctant to make the Army their career because service used to be confined to our own territory but since the advent of the United Nations&mdash;in the service of which our Army have participated so favourably and have shown high standards of efficiency and morale &mdash;it has become easier to recruit personnel. Even with the Congo, Cyprus, the Near East and the various other places to which we have been called upon to supply troops, we are unable, in spite of the pay and conditions, to keep our Army up to proper strength.  If the Minister were to bear that in mind he would probably get far greater enlistment without having to give very high rates of pay.  Every country has to meet its requirements according to its resources.  We are not a great power, although at times I think the Government are under the impression that we are according to some of the actions they have taken.</P>
    <P>I see in this Estimate as well&mdash;and it is an old trouble&mdash;that the United Nations have not paid us.  I do not know who is responsible for impressing their obligations upon the United Nations.  It seems to me that we are getting a raw deal.  When asked to do so, we have provided troops for the United Nations.  We have acted very honourably towards them.  We have also paid the penalty with casualties in the Congo, in the Near East, in Cyprus.  Anything that has happened has been on a small scale.  The least the United Nations could do is to pay us.  I gather from the Minister's opening speech, and from reading this <Col N="2090" /> Estimate, that they have failed to to this.</P>
    <P>It is always said of the United Nations, or of any international organisation, that they will pay, but they do not pay in time.  I do not see why international organisations should be allowed to behave like this.  We have to carry the burden of those charges in this Supplementary Estimate.  I forget what the actual sum is.  It is considerable. I think they owe us about £250,000.  It is a feature of international organisations that they do not pay in time and it is also a feature of their relations with governments, that governments do not press them because of the feeling that, if an international organisation owes you money, you will get it because you have got more than one country to fall back on.  This is not good enough.  The Minister should make it quite clear to the United Nations that Ireland will not make her troops available any longer and will not facilitate them in any way unless they are prepared to honour their obligations in return.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time this has happened.  I do not know if it is the Minister or the Government who makes the representations to the Secretary General of the United Nations.  The Minister should give the House some information as to what their attitude is, if there has been any correspondence on the subject, if they have stated they will pay, when they will pay and, if they intend to pay but keep us out of our money for some time, they should pay the appropriate rate of interest.  Why should the Irish people have to pay interest because the United Nations fail to fulfil their obligations?</P>
    <P>I cannot say that I am an admirer of the United Nations.  When they want soldiers to fill a vacuum they wait generally until the last moment before they issue their fiat that such and such a country should provide troops.  So many countries have been involved in so many things such as colonialism and neo-colonialism and so forth, and are parties to an aggression or a nonaggression pact, that they are not suitable and they fall back on this country for troops in a great many <Col N="2091" /> instances.  I have a feeling that it was only by chance that the Minister did not get a request for troops for Nigeria.  Had the struggle there continued any longer I think that request would have been made and we would have been one of the few countries acceptable to the two sections fighting against each other in that country.</P>
    <P>In this Estimate £20,000 extra is provided for Nigeria.  I should like the Minister to clarify a point for me.  Some years ago the Red Cross organisations in the various countries decided, in their wisdom, or in what I consider to be their lack of wisdom, that the Red Cross funds must be paid directly to the governments concerned.  In other words, if there were a disaster in a country the money had to be paid over directly to the government of that country.  I want to say a word now about the money paid to Nigeria recently for the Red Cross effort there. Money poured in and it was allowed in by the Nigerian Government provided that it was channelled directly to them.  I was out there and I know they were not in a position to utilise the money they got.</P>
    <P>The British sent them £5 million. It must have been conscience money they sent to Nigeria because of the mess they had made of the situation. We sent £30,000, or whatever it was. It seems to me that we were forced to send that money although we may not have wished to do so.  We were forced to channel that money through the Nigerian Government.  I should like the Minister to let me and the House know if that is the position.  I know it was the position some years ago.  It was considered to be the correct international policy to channel the money through the government concerned.  To a certain extent that has been liberalised.</P>
    <P>We must remember that a country in receipt of Red Cross money has usually suffered a disaster of some sort and very often chaos prevails after an earthquake or something like that.  The Government of that country already have enough to do to deal with the emergency situation and very often the money sent in is wasted.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the position <Col N="2092" /> with regard to Red Cross money.  I am stressing this point because many people in all walks of life, subscribers big and small to Red Cross funds, have said to me that they have a feeling that these funds are not achieving the objects for which they were subscribed. Many of the subscribers have very small means and had to stint themselves in order to subscribe, and that money should go in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan dealt at considerable length with the FCA.  The FCA are the stand-by for an emergency army if it is ever needed.  I understand that the retaining fee they get is absolutely farcical.  I am not quite sure what it is. The FCA are active reservists.  They can be called up at short notice as, I believe, quite a few of them were during the Northern Ireland emergency. A person who is on a reserve list of any sort should have something to make it worth his while.  Apart from an army, the greatest stand-by for the defence of a country is a reservist force. Unless the reservist force are satisfied and contented the Army will not get the right type of personnel.  It must be made worth their while.</P>
    <P>The conditions of service in the Army have improved considerably.  As we see from this Estimate the pay will improve.  There are many things which the Minister should look into.  He should take a serious look at the position of the people who do not go to full-pension time and who do not intend to remain until full-pension time.  The Minister must see that these people are catered for.</P>
    <P>People who remain in the Army until full-pension time and then return to civilian life should be considered for some sort of housing facility.  A man who gives his full years of service in the Army is out of touch with civilian life.  He is out of touch with practically everything.  He suddenly finds himself disbanded on reaching the age limit.  The age limit is the axe. The man must return to civilian life. There does not seem to be any rehabilitation scheme or any preparation for civilian life.  There is no facility provided for housing.  A man who has served his full pensionable period and has reached the age limit, may be a married man whose family are grown <Col N="2093" /> up and have gone away.  Such a man has no chance whatever of getting a house.  I am suggesting to the Minister that something should be done for the protection of long-service personnel. A certain number of houses should be made available to them.  Perhaps this could be done in conjunction with the local authority.  This is only justice to those who have given long service and have devoted the whole of their professional lives to the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in what Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde had to say on the matter of short-term service in the Army.  When the main Estimate is being discussed in this House, I would like to hear the Deputy expanding somewhat on that idea.  I think it is a good idea.  Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde raised a couple of other points.  One was about the United Nations payment.  Another point was about the grant-in-aid for the Red Cross.  I call the Deputy's attention to my opening speech which is in the Official Report.  Both of these matters are dealt with in it.  I do not think Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde was with us the other night when this debate began.</P>
      <P>Rates of pay in the Army were mentioned by many Deputies.  Pay, allowances and conditions generally were discussed.  I would like to say straight away that there is a working party from the Departments of Defence and Finance examining all these matters with a view to their improvement in the near future.  I am awaiting the completion of their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully, among others, suggested that the rate of pay for a soldier at present is in or about £8.  I have a note here from my Department which sets out some sample rates of pay.  It would be a matter of guidance to the House if I read out this note.  It refers to the cost of the pay and allowances, in cash and in kind, of a married private, three-star, first-class, with two children.  His pay is £9 16s 11d.  His ration allowance is 5/5d per day which comes to £1 17s 11d per week.  His marriage allowance is £3 8s 7d.  His children's allowances for two children are £1 6s 10d.  That all comes to a total <Col N="2094" /> of £16 10s 3d.  There are service increments which go with that sum after three years.  The increment is 7/8d a week after three years, increasing to £1 2s 9d after nine years.  That could mean a further £1 2s 9d per week.</P>
    <P>Another sample payment would be the cost of pay and allowances, in cash and in kind, of a single private, three-star. His pay would be £9 16s 11d per week.  His ration allowance would be £1 18s 6d per week.  There are the other facilities which are available to soldiers which are not normally available to people in civilian life.  Deputy Tully spoke about £8 and Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde estimated that the pay was something similar to that.  This is the all-found rate for the young recruit joining the Army.  If he is good he will be out of his recruit training period in quite a short time.  I mention this in particular because, as the Deputies know, we are endeavouring to recruit new people into the Army at the present time.  I would not like the idea to go abroad that the rates of pay in the Army are as bad as some Deputies would suggest they are.</P>
    <P>It was suggested during the debate that there are no gratuities for soldiers but that there are gratuities for officers.  This is not accurate.  Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde conceded that he was not quite familiar with the arrangements.  He was anxious that a short-term soldier leaving the Army would not leave it without any provision for the future.  Such a soldier does not leave without some provision for the future.  He is eligible for a gratuity.  The long-serving soldiers qualify for pensions.  Deputy Liam Cosgrave said the other night that it looked rather anomalous that a civilian employee would get a gratunity leaving the Army and a long-serving soldier would not.  The difference is that the long-serving soldier has a pension and the civilian employee gets a gratuity when he is going out but he does not get a pension.  The Deputies talked about the purpose for which gratuities were paid.  This was expanded in the debate.  The real purpose of a gratuity is to facilitate a soldier's re-entry into civilian life after leaving the Army.</P>
    <P>It is right to say that the Army do <Col N="2095" /> not leave it at that.  There are a number of other facilities which are available for the retraining of soliders who are going out into civilian life.  At the present time there are soliders undergoing retraining courses in various trades with the AnCO in Galway.  I hope in the future there will be greater emphasis on this aspect of a soldier's life.  The fact that men have given long service or indeed, any good, loyal service, to the army of their country should be recognised in a practical way such as assistance in accommodating themselves to civilian life when they leave the Army.</P>
    <P>The question of housing soldiers when they leave the Army was also raised.  I do not think soliders are in any particular difficulty in this regard. We frequently make representations to local authorities on behalf of soldiers who are returning to civilian life and part of the responsibility of Army officers is to look after the general welfare of their men.  I am glad to say this aspect of their responsibility is usually, so far as I know, very well carried out.  Most local authorities are very co-operative.  I have heard complaints once or twice about soldiers appearing to be treated in a somewhat selective way but I am not satisfied that, in fact, any special difficulties are put in then soldier's way.  In fact, in the case of many local authorities I am glad to say the contrary is the case. They are most helpful and co-operate to the fullest degree with retired soldiers.</P>
    <P>The question of officers' gratuities was mentioned.  A somewhat misleading comparison I would suggest was made between them and civil servants. I do not suggest it was deliberately misleading but I would suggest it is hardly comparing like with like to compare an Army officer and a civil servant in this regard because an Army officer after 12 years service already qualifies for a quite substantial gratuity.  The present maximum after 20 years service is between 75 per cent and 85 per cent of a year's pay.  An unmarried officer does not get a gratuity when he retires on pension. This, like other related things, is being reviewed by the review body I have <Col N="2096" /> already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The question of widows' pensions was also mentioned.  Officers' windows and children qualify for pensions and have been so qualified for a long time now.  On the question of other ranks, since they subscribe, under the Social Welfare Acts, to contributory schemes, they are entitled to the full benefits of those schemes.  That like the other matters I have mentioned about pay, conditions and pensions, is under review at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested the other night, if I understand the Official Report correctly, that a soldier's pension only goes up by 1/- a year after 21 years.  That may not be quite what he meant to say.  The position anyway is that for each year of service between 21 and 31 years service, he gets an increase of 1/- a week on his pension. This again I am glad to say is being reviewed at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggested that a commission somewhat similar to the commission on Garda pay be established for the Army.  He went on to say in so many words that what was important was not the means but the end.  As I have said we are seeking, with a working party, to establish a better scheme of payments and pensions at the present time.</P>
    <P>A couple of Deputies mentioned the business of disturbance allowances.  A scheme is being introduced very shortly for all Army personnel who have to change their station permanently.  I am also having examined the position of married soldiers who are temporarily away from their families on service, to see if any improvement can be made in that field.</P>
    <P>There was a hardy annual.  Deputy Flanagan made some rather hair-raising suggestions in regard to Reserve grants. This matter comes up pretty regularly at Question Time in the House. People seem to forget or otherwise choose to forget that the actual annual grant has become increasingly an unimportant part of the overall payment of the reservist.  Deputy Flanagan suggested, I think, that junior officers should have their period of training reduced to two weeks and have their grant increased to £400.  I think that was the figure he suggested.  Incidentally, <Col N="2097" /> that £400 I presume would not include his Army pay as well.  It would not be very nice if the country were so dripping with wealth as to be able to attain such really magnificent Reserve grant payments but I do not think our present financial situation, even if it improved very radically in the future, would permit such exotic payments.  I do not think the Army would expect it either.  Anyway, that matter also is being reviewed by the review body I spoke of.</P>
    <P>The question of overseas allowances was referred to.  The idea seems to be abroad that these are in some way rather less than they ought to be.  It is a reversion to the Deputy Oliver Flanagan theme of however good they are they should be multiplied by about 20 and we would still say they are not too much for the solidiers he praised so unctuously some time ago when he was speaking in the House.  The best thing for me to do is to give the House the figures in order that they can decide for themselves whether the allowances are adequate or not.  The rates for troops serving in Cyprus are: a private soldier gets 24/3d a day; a married soldier gets 34/3d; a single corporal gets 26/9d per day; a married corporal gets 10/- more than that.  A sergeant to sergeant-major gets 29/3d a day single, or 39/3d a day married.  Married men in those three categories get 10/-a day more than the single men.  Second lieutenant to captain gets 35/6 a day single and 50/6 a day, married; commandant and upwards, 45/6 a day single, and £3 0s 6d, married.  This is in addition to their Army pay and, as all Deputies know, when a new contingent is going abroad there is always pretty keen interest on the part of the officers and men in going with the new unit. The amounts may not be satisfactory to Deputy Oliver Flanagan but I think they are adequate.</P>
    <P>The officers serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East are on a different basis.  They are paid a subsistence allowance of $12.50 per day as well as a clothing allowance of $200 American. They are not paid the overseas allowance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully, speaking of the call-up <Col N="2098" /> of the reserve last year, suggested that this should have been on a selective basis to avoid calling up reservists in jobs or business which might suffer as a result.  He also said that employers might more readily have made up reservists' wages if the Department supplied the men with weekly certificates of the amounts of their Army emoluments.  A selective call-up, I think, is in a way a negation of the idea behind the maintenance of an Army reserve at all.  Regardless of what Deputy Flanagan said, there was a dire emergency in the country at that time.  There was a steady stream, in fact at times there was a flood, of homeless, wretched people being driven out of the unhappy part of the country, the Six Counties, and we had to mobilise what resources we had to provide aid and comfort for them.  Neither could we say at the time what the proportions of this problem would be.  We may be grateful that the refugee problem was not even greater than it was, but it was quite a serious national emergency and we required to get all the assistance we could from the reserve.</P>
    <P>Naturally a great many men were displaced from civilian jobs which were paying far better than the rates of pay they would get in the Army. In any case where there was obvious hardship and an application was made for exemption, these cases were immediately and sympathetically dealt with, and the proportion of the problem of reservists who have suffered loss of any grievous kind is not great. However, as I said before in this House, I invite Deputies to submit the cases of individuals who have suffered financial loss in this regard and we shall have them investigated.  I do not recall having come across the case mentioned by Deputy Flanagan.  He alleged that some reservist was at a loss of £110 per months.  Frankly, I find it difficult to believe, because I am quite certain that, if a reservist was at that kind of loss and if he had applied to the Army authorities for exemption, he would have got it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the events in the Six Counties and the protection of vital installations here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> Again, Deputy Flanagan spoke at some considerable length somewhat on the lines of Captain Boyle in &ldquo;Juno and the Paycock&rdquo;.  He looked up at the Army and asked himself: &ldquo;What is the Army and what is the Army for?&rdquo; The Army have been fully extended in the matter of the protection of vital installations in this part of the country for quite some time now, and I do not think it should be necessary for me to elaborate on the gravity of the mission the Army are carrying out with their customary efficiency.</P>
    <P>It was suggested during the debate that the Dáil should have been recalled to discuss the general situation that arise out of the events in the Six Counties.  This has been dealt with very thoroughly by the Taoiseach in volume 241 of the Official Report of 23rd October, 1969, and I do not think I should say anything further about it, except that it was suggested that a duty devolved on the Army to prevent saboteurs from coming into this part of the country from the north.  The short answer to that is that it does not; happily, there is a very satisfactory working arrangement with the Garda Síochána in matters of security and it is working very well at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked for some statistical information about northern casualties and refugees.  The number of casualties was 68.  They were treated in the field hospitals that were set up by the Army at that time.  He also wanted a breakdown, into men, women and children, of the 54 refugees left. The breakdown is nine men, 12 women and 33 children.  Did they include people who were not refugees in the real sense but hangers-on who were not anxious for one reason or another to return to the Six Counties?  All the people who were dealt with in the refugee camp in Gormanston were refugees, and that was the purpose for which the camp was made available to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said there was a complaint in Gormanston because the Dublin Red Cross took over and crowded out the locals; the Civil Defence members were also slighted.  This, I think, is not correct.  If Deputies <Col N="2100" /> would cast their minds back to that period they would remember the great enthusiasm and readiness to help that was shown not only by the Army and the soldiers of the reserve but by voluntary organisations.  It reflected the complete unanimity of the people in the matter of providing aid for the unfortunate people who had been driven out of their homes in the Six Counties.  I do not think, in that context, the Civil Defence organisations would take it amiss if they recognised that the Government had decided that the Army who had facilities already in existence, would handle the first influx. If the numbers of refugees had been greatly in excess of what they were, the Civil Defence organisation would have had to become involved in major housing, feeding etc.  Happily, we did not have to call them all into action but we were happy in the knowledge that, if the refugees had continued to come in massive numbers, we had an efficient, reliable and steadfast organisation in the Civil Defence glad to co-operate in assisting refugees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave inquired about money collected for relief purposes in the Six Counties.  He said there was a doubt as to whether the money was distributed up there and asked if I had any information on that point.  The Government designated the Irish Red Cross Society as the official co-ordinating agency for the collection of funds, relief supplies, comforts etc. for northern refugees.  The society has donated upwards of £50,000 in goods and cash to distressed areas in the Six Counties. These include cash donations to church leaders and to the Belfast refugee reestablishment committee and supplies of clothing, bedding, footwear and medical supplies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised another matter and, I think, not for the first time. Perhaps it is because he lives near Gormanston and is familiar with conditions there that he mentions this. Soldiers in Gormanston are doing everything from gardening to babysitting, he says, from 7.30 in the morning until 11 p.m. and get no additional remuneration.  There is no doubt that the soldiers in Gormanston at the beginning of the emergency and since gave yeoman service.  They performed <Col N="2101" /> this difficult assignment excellently but I do not think they would suggest their duties are any more onerous than those of the soliders who are manning lonely security posts on these cold nights and whose praises are quite unsung by Deputies or by people outside the House.  They are on the job, on a 24-hour vigil over vital installations, as we know.  I do not think that Deputy Tully, apart from meaning to pay tribute to the men in Gormanston, was serious in suggesting there should be some extra payment for them.  The soldiers of the Army accept the duties of soldiers, whatever they may be, with the willingness and soldierly quality we have come to expect from them.  It is unnecessary for me to say more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton spoke about living conditions in the Army with, I think, particular reference to Gormanston camp.  During the debate a number of references were made to the quality of the accommodation at Gormanston. Deputies should remember that this camp is mainly used for summer training of the FCA and it was because of its position in relation to Northern Ireland that it was particularly convenient for use as a refugee centre. Nobody would look on it as suitable permanent accommodation or living quarters for families, especially where there would be a large number of children. This, I would remind the House, was a very dire emergency and fundamental things like shelter and food were what the people wanted when they fled from what had been their homes, before they were burned, in the north.  The Army corps of engineers did a very good job in making the accommodation at Gormanston comfortable and habitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton and Deputy Healy spoke in somewhat similar terms of the role of the Army in our society.  Deputy Clinton said the Army should be more closely integrated into our society and that it would be appreciated, especially in peacetime, if the Army assisted in more social and economic activities. Deputy Healy told us of the wide area of activities in which soldiers in Cork engage, that they are the backbone of choral and sporting societies and that they mix very satisfactorily in society <Col N="2102" /> generally.  To my knowledge also, in my constitutency in Kilkenny the habit has developed of looking to the Army for leadership in matters of this kind.  I do not think there is a real problem here.  Occasionally, one comes across some squalid incident such as that recorded in a press report recently of men of the Naval Service being refused admittance to some dance in, I think, Limerick.  This is so exceptional and so pathetic that I do not think it merits comment but it serves to show that there are some ignorant, loutish people who have some peculiar complex about the men of our Defence Forces.  I do not accept that this is at all common or that it is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Cosgrave mentioned recruitment.  The present recruiting campaign has been most successful.  Between 1st September, 1969, and 28th February, 1970, a total of 1,398 men applied for admission. Of these 885 were accepted.  The number enlisted in the corresponding period in 1968-69 was just 499.  They are still coming in at present.</P>
    <P>This reminds me to say that, from time to time, one sees press reports of young men in difficulty with the law being advised by the district justices to join the Army.  I do not know whether I should say this or whether it is the proper way to appeal to the Judiciary but the Army do not want young men who have been in difficulties with the law.  The Army is not a place for ne'er-do-wells or people with criminal tendencies.  We do not want that type in the Army and I wish people in district courts and elsewhere would get that finally into their heads and realise that the Irish Army is an organisation manned by decent, respectable young Irishment and we want to keep it that way.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,157,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment durring the year ending on 31st March, 1970, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Garda Síochána including pensions, etc., for payments of Compensation and other Expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Forces; and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The money sought in this Supplementary Estimate is required chiefly to meet the cost of pay increases for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The Garda pay increases fall into two separate parts.  The first part is commonly known as the second phase of the eleventh round of wage and salary increases, which was applied throughout the public sector generally with effect from the 1st June, 1969. This settlement consisted of a 4 per cent increase on salaries up to £1,800 and 3 per cent on the portion over £1,800, with a minimum increase of 25/- a week.  This was applied to the gardaí with effect from 1st June, 1969, and the cost of this increase in the present financial year is £340,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second pay increase for which provision is made in the Supplementary Estimate is that recommended in the Report of the Commission on Garda Remuneration and Conditions of Service.  As the House is aware, the Government have accepted in full the commission's recommendations in the matter of basis pay, both as regards the amounts and the effective date, which is 1st June, 1969.  The cost in the present financial year is £620,000.  Copies of the commission's <Col N="2104" /> report have been circulated to Deputies. The principal increases involved are £2 a week for a garda on the maximum of his scale, which is now £25 7s 3d per week together with a further £1 a week on completion of 15 years service in the rank of garda, and £4 a week for sergeants at the maximum of scale, which now becomed £29 16s 6d.  There are corresponding increases for other ranks.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £115,000 is required for subhead B of the Vote to cover increased subsistence and travelling expenses incurred mainly in connection with protection duties, particularly in border areas.  In addition, the rates of subsistence allowance were increased since the original estimate was framed.</P>
    <P>The extra £42,000 required for subhead G, the transport subhead, arises mainly from the purchase of additional cars and motor-cycles costing £29,000, which were required during the year to improve the mobility of the force. As well, a number of cars and motor-cycles, which were due to be supplied in 1968-69, were not delivered in that year so that the cost now falls to be paid in the current year.</P>
    <P>Finally, a sum of £90,000 is required to make good a deficiency in the payment from the Road Fund to subhead J, which is the Appropriations-in-Aid subhead.  This contribution from the Road Fund falls to be determined by the Minister for Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and the original provision of £645,000 was inserted in the Estimate, and the Book of Estimates published, before the final determination was made last year.  In the event, the amount which became payable was £90,000 short of the original provision, and this must now be provided.</P>
    <P>The gross amount required under the above headings is £1,207,000, but this amount is reduced by an expected saving of £50,000 in expenditure on pensions and gratuities, leaving the net amount required at £1,157,000.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate, as the Minister mentioned, is in the main for the purpose of implementing the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Garda <Col N="2105" /> Remuneration and Conditions of Service, known as the Conroy Commission. The commission's report was welcomed as an effort to meet the needs of the Garda Síochána and the commission carried out an important work in examining a number of matters some of which will, no doubt, be more appropriate for consideration on the main Estimate.  This Supplementary Estimate, however, does afford an opportunity of making reference, at the present time, to the high standard of the Garda Síochána and to reiterate what the vast majority of the people feel and recognise, that the Garda force is an excellent body of men who deserve well of this country.  I have recently spoken on this matter and I want to re-emphasise some of the points I made on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tendency in some quarters &mdash;even, possibly, by some Members of of the House; certainly by certain sections outside the House&mdash;to suggest that the gardaí or some of them in carrying out their duties exceed the limits which they should observe in quelling disturbances or preventing demonstrations getting out of hand and being used as an occasion to exploit grievances by people who have on occasion attached themselves to genuine groups who may be making a peaceful protest about a particular matter.  I want to restate some of the points I made in this connection so that it can be clearly seen that in a democratic society people are entitled to demonstrate peacefully or to protest. But what is intolerable and cannot be accepted is that small groups can arrogate to themselves the right to demonstrate or to protest or to exploit a grievance for the purpose of enforcing their views on other sections of the community or the community at large. The gardaí have, in my view, on every occasion, with microscopic exceptions, discharged their functions and duties in a manner that is typical of the high standard of the force and in a manner which reflects the very highest credit on the members of the force.  If people want to change the laws or to have changes made in policy this is the place to effect such changes and is the only way it can be done in accordance with <Col N="2106" /> our democratic system.</P>
    <P>There have been attempts made to destroy property and to intimidate people who have settled in this country and purchased property here.  That cannot be condoned and is contrary to the system of laws we have adopted.  This is not a very widespread campaign but for some people and their families it has been the source of great disturbance and hardship.  The more widespread attempts that have been made to use intimidation or force, either for criminal purposes or for the purpose of advancing particular lines of action by self-appointed groups, have on occasion reached proportions that impose an obligation on public representatives to speak out in condemnation of such action and to make it clear that so far as the overwhelming majority of the elected representatives are concerned they reject that approach as an intolerable invasion of the rights of the people and an unauthorised usurpation of the democratic authority vested in this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is important that a vigorous public opinion, reflecting all sections of the Community, should assert itself in defence of our basic rights and institutions and in support of the dedicated men of the Garda and the Army who have fearlessly and consistently defended those rights. There has been some misapprehension on this point, and I would ask the Minister to refer in his reply to the recent growth in the number of armed raids on banks and other bodies which have occurred not merely in this city but in many remote areas.  So far as the city and urban areas are concerned there is a need for larger numbers of gardaí.</P>
    <P>I note in the Supplementary Estimate that there is an additional sum of £42,000 required under subhead G for the purchase of vehicles.  It is absolutely essential in a modern society to have mobile patrols, both on cars and motor cycles, to deal with crime. It is also essential that the public should not only co-operate fully with the gardaí in securing wherever possible the property of individuals or firms but should also co-operate and <Col N="2107" /> assist them in the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    <P>In this country for historical reasons the duties which the police force have had to perform were often regarded &mdash;and rightly so&mdash;as being performed by an alien force.  That situation was changed with the establishment of the State but tradition in some cases and with some people dies hard.  It is vital that we give the fullest co-operation and assistance to the gardaí in the prevention and detection of crime and co-operate with them, through the crime detection section, to ensure that culprits are brought to justice.  In the built-up areas, particularly in the city of Dublin, but also in my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown, there is some concern regarding the reductions in the number of gardaí. In many of those areas the population has increased but frequently the strength of the gardaí has remained the same as it was when those areas were villages.  I would urge the Minister, the commissioner and the Garda authorities to ensure that sufficient gardaí are provided in Dublin and in the populous areas and that they are adequately equipped to deal with crime.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for concern&mdash;which has been expressed in this House&mdash; that, apart from raids that have taken place recently, the number of crimes involving physical violence, attacks with knives and so on, is such that in parts of this city people are genuinely afraid.  Old people and people living alone and those who, for one reason or another, are obliged to go out at night and to travel at night are apprehensive because of some cases that have occurred.  I think it is right that this House should, on every occassion that offers, re-assert the conviction that the vast majority of the people are opposed to criminal activities and to the unsurpation by any group of the authority that can vest only in the elected representatives of the people.  While every citizen or group of citizens has the right to demonstrate peacefully to promote his or their political views it, a peaceful and democratic fashion, no citizen or group of citizens has the right to impose views upon his or their fellow-citizens. <Col N="2108" /> It is essential that public opinion must express it self unequivocally against those who seek to deprive all our citizens of their rights, or any of them, and public opinion must at all times support whatever measures are necessary to prevent attacks on the very foundations of our society.</P>
    <P>In peacetime the burden of meeting such attacks devolves in the main on the gardaí and the gardaí themselves must be adequately protected and safeguarded and, from that point of view, they are entitled to the co-operation and support of the public whom they serve so well.  Public and private property is entitled to respect and protection and unauthorised or illegal attacks upon persons or property must be condemned. Indeed, there is an obligation on all who value freedom to resist all such attacks.  It is important that the gardaí should not only have overwhelming support but that the support should be expressed in a tangible fashion and I have always held the view that public servants, be they gardaí, army, civil servants or others, are entitled to the best pay and conditions the country can afford.</P>
    <P>The Conroy Commission inquired into the conditions of the gardaí and that commissions has made many recommendations.  The principal recommendation is made retrospective to last June in respect of pay and salary. It is only right that this should be implemented forthwith and I trust that the other recommendations will in due course be implemented also.  We support this Supplementary Estimate. The gardaí deserve well of the country. We cannot expect a contented force if their standards are in any way adversely affected, as they must be, by the continued rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Once again, I want to avail of this opportunity to restate our view that so far as crime and the stamping out or detection of crime are concerned we are wholeheartedly behind any measures designed to remedy the situtation.  The growth in crime is a blot on our society.  It is causing serious concern to many people.  The time to deal with the problem is before it gets any worse.  It can be dealt with only by enforcing the law and making sure that those responsible for enforcing <Col N="2109" /> the law have the equipment and the means to do so at their disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Deputy Cosgrave's sentiments.  My party will support the Minister in whatever measures he devises to combat the increasing rise in crime, particularly crimes of violance.  When we discussed the main Estimate here a few months back I spoke at length about the necessity for improving Garda pay and conditions and the importance of having a contented Garda force.  At the time of that debate we were awaiting the findings of the Conroy Commission. These findings have since been made public and this Supplementary Estimate is designed to give effect to the recommendation in relation to pay and salary adjustments.  While the Minister did say that the Government had accepted the Commission's recommendations in full, he did not give any indications as to when the other recommendations will be put into operation.  We would also like to hear from the Minister more about the acceptance of the recommendations by the Garda.  The manner in which the report was published may be described as unfortunate because of the anxiety and dissatisfaction to which initiarlly it gave rise.  That again highlighted the complete lack of communication which has existed between employer and employee in matters of wages and working conditions in the Garda Síochána.  The method of its publications and its communication to the rank and file of the Garda Síochána was just a continuation of the unfortunate conditions which have existed for a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally felt that the number of gardaí is not adequate having regard to the expansion, multiplicity and diversity of their duties at present and particularly the amount of time which members of the force must spend dealing with traffic problems, particularly in towns and cities outside of Dublin.  The appointment of traffic wardens in Dublin has made gardaí available for other duties but unfortunately elsewhere in towns and cities the work of the gardaí is to a <Col N="2110" /> great extent taken up with traffic problems.  I should like to emphasise again that it is necessary to have a contented police force.  It is necessary for the wellbeing of the community. Everyone knows that the best worker is a contented worker.  It is absolutely essential that the lines of communication&mdash;industrial communication, if you like&mdash;between members of the Garda and their superiors and the Department should be kept very clear at all times. Following on the commission's report there should be a much greater degree of industrial democracy within the force so that younger members particularly will not feel frustrated.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the main Estimate I dealt with the necessary for providing additional vehicles, particularly cars, and also the necessary for changing them more often.  Because of the nature of the work for which they are used these vehicles deteriorate much more rapidly than would a vehicle used for civilian purposes.  By and large, with some exceptions in Dublin, the cars used by the Garda are family type cars made to serve the family man or the business man.  This is a matter which should be looked into.  Most of the cars used by the Garda in Dublin have been specially constructed.  There are many other items affecting the recommendations of the commission but I understand that this Supplementary Estimate applies only to the salary adjustment aspects of that report.  I would welcome an opportunity to have a full debate on all aspects of that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Supplementary Estimates made it clear that the money sought was chiefly to meet pay increases in the Garda Síochána.  It is vital in a democratic state such as ours to have a good police force because it is to them that we often turn to preserve our democratic system.  It is vital that the force should attract some of the best brains available and that we should get the best type of young man to join the force.  This Supplementary Estimate covers the eleventh round salary increases and the implementation of certain sections of the Conroy Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> The force, as we know, is a well-disciplined force and it is the duty of each Member of the House to support them when we can.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other speakers in drawing attention to the fact that the public should help the gardaí more.  Often we read of cases where a garda tried to apprehend somebody, for instance, a burglar, and the public just stood idly by and did not go to his assistance.  In this House we should set a good example and show the country that we are behind this well-disciplined force.  It is sad to say that now and again we may have a case here where certain matters are brought up and an effort made to elicit information where it is alleged some garda misbehaved himself. There is always the danger when such a case is mentioned that the whole force would fall into disrepute.  There is no sense in asking those questions in this House because the allegations are always unfounded.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he is standing up for the force.  There are a lot of people who have a different view and are anxious to discredit the force at all times.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Supplementary Estimate a sum of £115,000 for increased subsistence and travelling allowances incurred mainly in doing protection duty particularly in border areas.  It is something new that we should have to make so much money available for this purpose.  It is something that arose within the last 12 months and we are all sorry to say it is likely to remain for some time.  I am sure the Minister has his eye on the matter but I should like to say to him that while at one time this may have seemed a temporary duty for guards that duty may continue for longer than was expected.  These men may be there for some time on a semi-permanent basis.  It is sad to have to say this but it is the truth. I see also that a sum is required for the purchase of cars, motor cycles and so on.  That is very welcome because it is very necessary, in these days when you have bank robberies and so on and when the whole idea is to make a quick getaway, that we should have <Col N="2112" /> high-powered vehicles for the Garda and that they should be driven by competent drivers.</P>
    <P>I understand that the whole force is being reorganised in that direction. This is only right because it is essential that our police force should advance as quickly as crime is advancing and, indeed, keep ahead of it in order to protect our citizens.  There is not much more I wish to say on this Supplementary Estimate as we had the debate on the main Estimate not long ago.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is the duty of Members of the House to set a good example and to ask the public to be more co-operative and to help the Garda in their duties.  No longer can the public stand idly by and see gardaí being attacked.  The example in this should come from here and I am glad to see all Deputies are in agreement on it.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for the force not only to have good public relations but to ensure that there is an excellent understanding between them and the public. If they have better public relations the people will understand their problems and will be more helpful, particularly in rural areas.  Anything young gardaí and older officers have got by way of increases in wages have been well deserved.  If we are to continue to get the proper type of recruits one must continue in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate provides for increased rates of pay for the Garda Síochána and undoubtedly it will be welcomed by all sides of the House.  I do not think there is any section of our community so deserving of our sincere expression of appreciation for their display of loyalty to their calling.  We all appreciate that the force is young, having been in existence only since the establishment of the State, and that they bear the very fine traditions of their founders in the matter of devotion to duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that changing times have ment that circumstances are very different from what they were when the force was founded.  Our people have come to know and to respect the rule of law but in the early days the Garda Síochána had an extremely difficult job endeavouring to establish law and <Col N="2113" /> order.  In this Estimate we are providing for improved rates of pay for them.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge on the officers of the Department the necessity to include an appreciation of the work done by the Garda in civics education. Teachers should spend some time in our schools, primary, secondary and vocational, lecturing on good citizenship and ensuring that children learn that the Garda Síochána are there to protect life and property, that they are the friends of the people, that they are the guarantors of liberty and freedom. Too often do we hear of children being told, for one reason or another, to run away at the approach of a garda.  It is wrong that any citizen should be brought up in this way.</P>
    <P>The majority of people in the country realise that we, though a small and a new country, have what we can describe as the best, the most efficient police force in the world.  The last speaker correctly suggested that not always do our people appreciate that. Far too often have we seen the gardaí suffer at the hands of vandals and others.  This, of course, is happening in every country, but we must realise that these opponents of law and order must be kept in their place and we must ensure that in the process gardaí do not fall victims to these mobs. It is a sad commentary on the citizenship of our people that occasionally they do not come to the assistance of the garda in such circumstances. Even the weakest person physically can go to the nearest telephone and call for help if that person is afraid, because of his physique, to participate in a mêlée.</P>
    <P>The gardaí carry out their duties in a highly efficient manner and the money being voted in this Estimate is being wisely spent.  The better we pay the gardaí the more independent we make them.  Our police force have a serious obligation on their shoulders in the administration of the law fairly and impartially.  This applies to the most humble garda in the country.  To be free from worry one must be free from want and one must not be under a compliment to any person in <Col N="2114" /> his district or sub-district.  The garda must be able to live independently and he and his family must have a high national standard of living.</P>
    <P>Difficult circumstances make temptation possible.  Our Garda force have an excellent record of integrity and it should be the aim of Parliament to preserve that record.  It is as important to keep the Garda Síochána independent as it is to keep a district justice independent: I do not suggest the garda should have the same remuneration as the district justice.  They must be paid a wage which will leave them independent and above temptation.  I am glad an effort is being made to improve the conditions of the members of the Garda Síochána.  Many more steps require to be taken.  In addition to improving the pay and conditions of members of the force the Minister should endeavour to introduce a comprehensive scheme for the widows of men who were members of the Garda.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister consider the strength of the Garda Síochána adequate for present requirements?  Would it have been possible for him to seek a larger sum on this occasion and to increase the numbers in the force?  It is deplorable that country stations seem to be understaffed.  Patrol cars <Col N="2115" /> and the cycle squad of the Garda Síochána seem to be replacing the permanent Garda stations.</P>

We are experiencing quite a number of robberies in banks, supermarkets and warehouses.  It is very important for the Garda Síochána to have a fast transport service at their disposal.  I have often wondered why the word &ldquo;Garda&rdquo; is prominently displayed on the squad cars&mdash;as we call them in the country.  The sign at least lets the general public know that the Garda are coming or going, as the case may be, but it also indicates to those engaging in any kind of crime that the Garda are coming and it may give them the opportunity of making a quick getaway.  On the other hand, the sign might serve a very useful purpose when the Garda are rushing to an accident or responding to a call where their services are urgently required.  I do not have any strong views about the displaying of the &ldquo;Garda&rdquo; sign; I suppose it must be justified.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make is that the Garda are very often involved in risky and dangerous duties, including dealing with explosives.</P>
      <P>I want to express gratitude and praise for what I consider to be the very high standard of our Garda force, especially the high standard amongst the young members of the force who, I am glad to say, have followed the example given by the old-timers.  I only hope that the high standard which has been set by example will be maintained. The Garda are a group of young men who have displayed outstanding qualities in the discharge of their duties.  Any efforts to improve their conditions and rates of pay will most gladly be supported by this House, because in these young men reposes the responsibility for the safeguarding of life and property.</P>
      <P>I do not like to think what kind of a country we would have if we had no Garda Síochána.  Thank God, we have such a force.  They discharge their duties without fear or favour.  It behoves all of us to keep this force contented.  I am glad that the Garda Representative Body have ironed out many problems but some still remain. I am convinced that, with co-operation between the Representative Body, the commissioners and the Minister for Justice, these problems can be solved and we will have the type of force the country desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel compelled to say a few words on the Supplementary Estimate because of a remark made by the Minister yesterday.  Like Deputy Flanagan, I have found the members of the force extremely courteous, even when they have felt they had a genuine grievance.  I do not think any sensible person would <Col N="2117" /> feel that they were other than extremely reasonable in the way they acted in relation to their case.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Government have brought in this Supplementary Estimate. I suppose it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances in which the Government find themselves.  A few years ago the force was losing enormous numbers of men shortly after they were trained because they were emigrating to countries like Australia where they could get better pay.  The men who have committed themselves to the force for a period of ten or 15 years and have made family arrangements do not want to emigrate and they have had, therefore, at times, to put up with unfair conditions.</P>
      <P>As we know, the Garda are by no means unanimous in their acceptance of the Conroy Report.  At the same time, the Government, having appointed the commission, acted perfectly correctly in accepting its recommendations. To that extent this Supplementary Estimate is also most welcome. Suggestions have been made on occasions about the Garda Síochána with which I do not agree.  Our police force behave in relation to ordinary citizens with exemplary courtesy and any person guilty of a peccadillo will not find himself in difficulties with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next point almost drifts into the main Estimate, and I do not want to do that; I want to confine myself to what is in the Supplementary Estimate, which is the improvement of rates of pay for the Garda Síochána.  The first part of it, that is the 4 per cent on the salaries with a minimum increase of 25/- a week, is about the only part that is good.  This eleventh round did not meet the increase in the cost of living at all, apart from the fact that anybody with more than £1,800 a year pays at least one-fourth of it back to the Government.  It is very useful for the Minister for Finance, but not very much use to anybody else.  Therefore, what is valuable about this Supplementary Estimate is not that part of it concerning the eleventh round increase, which would be quite inadequate to meet the increase in the cost of living, but the second part of it which relates <Col N="2118" /> to the implementation of the recommendations of the Conroy Commission. The Minister is to be congratulated on this Estimate.  The figures it contains, on the basis of the present value of money, is about the minimum any person would support.  I hope from now on that, when the cost of living goes up, members of the Garda Síochána will be fully compensated for the increase in the cost of living and not permitted to fall behind to the extent they were in the past when many members left the force.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Deputies on all sides of the House for the tributes they have paid to the Garda Síochána force as a whole.  This tribute is due in our circumstances to our Garda force.  The very fact that from every side of this House we have this unanimity of view about the integrity of our Garda force, the way the Garda behave themselves towards all citizens and keep the scales of justice evenly balanced between man and man, is significant.  It is certainly the answer to those who would try to denigrate our force and try to present a picture of our force which we all know is untrue.  Whatever about your generosity, Sir, to some of the Deputies who spoke, I want to keep strictly within the terms of Standing Order No. 126 and to confine my remarks to the matters contained in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main matter to be dealt with here is the provision implementing the recommendation of the Conroy Commission. Although I have already done this privately, I think I should publicly pay a tribute to Judge Conroy and the members of this commission for the excellent and meticulous job they did. First, I think I should place on record &mdash;I am sure this is accepted by the House; it is certainly accepted by the force and everybody outside&mdash;that this was a completely independent commission, completely independent of the Government and completely independent of my Department.  It was deliberately so constructed when it was set up.  There had been for many long years demands by the Representative Body of the Garda and the Garda force as a whole for some form of commission <Col N="2119" /> to inquire into their circumstances. This commission under Judge Conroy got the rather unenviable and difficult task of making an examination in depth of every aspect of the garda's life and duty, every aspect of his work.  This was the first examination in depth of the Garda Síochána which was attempted since its foundation.</P>
    <P>The commission's report is a very comprehensive document, as Deputies who have read it are aware.  The original ran to about 250 pages with about 1,300 paragraphs dealing with every aspect of the garda's life and work from his training to the day he retires.  The end result here today is the recommendation which is being implemented by the House in this Supplementary Estimate: that the young garda, the rookie as he is called, now earns during training £15 7s 6d.  He completes the initial training after approximately five months and he goes up to £17 10s 6d.  Then he goes ahead by nine yearly increments until he reaches his maximum of £25 7s 3d, which is now the basic weekly rate, in addition to which a further increment of £1 a week is paid after 15 years service.  The sergeant starts at £27 10s 0d and by three increments reaches a maximum of £29 16s. 6d. Those were recommendations of the Conroy Commission, with corresponding increases for the other ranks.</P>
    <P>I want to turn for a moment to some criticism which was implied by Deputy Pattison concerning the way this commission's report was dealt with.  It would be wise to remind the House of the facts in this connection.  I have referred to the size of this report. I got it on approximately 20th January and it was just a typed copy.  We had to try to reproduce as quickly as possible about 600 stencilled copies of this report, first for the Garda themselves and then for the Government to look at it.  Copies were distributed to all concerned within five days.  This report must have created a record, so far as the implementation of parts of it is concerned, in the whole history of commissions or reports since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to point out that immediately that report was <Col N="2120" /> stencilled, so that the Government and those concerned could study it, a statement was issued on the 27th January&mdash;within a week of this report being presented&mdash;which said:</P>
    <P>The Government wish to emphasise that their objective in setting up the Commission was to effect a fundamental review of the pay and conditions of the Garda Síochána by reference to modern conditions and circumstances.  The report is the first independent, comprehensive review of the Force's conditions since it was founded.  It has major financial and other implications and it would be unrealistic to expect immediate decisions on the very many matters covered.  The Government are giving urgent and sympathetic consideration to the recommendations with a view to the early implementation of those which they find acceptable and feasible.</P>
    <P>That was on the 27th January.  On the 3rd February, within another few days of this statement, a statement was issued by me which said:</P>
    <P>The Government have today decided to implement the recommendations of the Commission in relation to the basic pay of all ranks of the Force with effect from the 1st June, 1969.</P>
    <P>It then went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Government, at the request of the Garda Síochána Joint Representative Body, have also decided to set up the Consultative Council recommended by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Surely this implementation, almost as quickly as they could be looked at, of two of the major recommendations in the report is a record?  I think Deputy Pattison was quoting somebody who said communications in connection with this report were badly handled.</P>
    <P>The scribe who wrote that the Government should have set out, side by side with all these hundreds of recommendations of this report, Government decisions on them should be in Grangegorman.  It was the most irresponsible comment I have ever heard or read about any report issued by anybody.  I am asking the House for over £1 million.  I do not know how <Col N="2121" /> anyone who has gone to the trouble of reading all the different recommendations in this report could suggest that within 14 days one could have a Government decision side by side each of the recommendations.  I do not know where these fellows come from, how they think, or whether they have heads on them for the sole purpose of keeping their lugs apart.  It was an utterly irresponsible comment.</P>
    <P>I may also mention that on the 10th February I set up the Garda Síochána Consultative Council in accordance with the recommendations of the commission. It is part of the job of this council to discuss together aspects of the report for the purpose of the speedy examination of certain matters referred to in it.  The Consultative Council is chaired by the Assistant Commissioner James McDonagh and the other members are Garda John Marrinan, Sergeant Thomas O'Reilly, Chief Superintendent Patrick McLoughlin and two civil servants, John Griffin and P. Mac Guill.  The force and those who run it are in the majority on this Consultative Council.  The commission think by having this council communications will be vastly improved and misunderstandings will be avoided as between the force and those whose duty it is to look after them.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this report which are urgent.  The question of overtime is under examination and will be dealt with as quickly as possible.  There are a vast number of recommendations here.  Some of them are very far-reaching.  They need very considerable examination and certainly their implementation will cost considerable amounts of money.  From time to time I will be coming before the House&mdash;and particularly with my next Estimate&mdash;dealing with some of these matters when they are fully examined.  The commission has recommended the setting up of a planning and research unit which will have the function of examining different practices in the force.  We have examined major recommendations in so far as pay and other matters in this Estimate are concerned.  I assume by the end of the month the Garda will have got this money, which is retrospective to June <Col N="2122" /> last, just as is the other increase which they got.  This must be a record in so far as the recommendation has been accepted and also a record in the time in which it is being implemented.</P>
    <P>Any misunderstanding there was about the Conroy Commission Report in the first few days was due in the main to people with rumours.  The report was not actually available in sufficient quantity because it was not printed.  People, including some young gardaí, were told different stories. Rumours, as the Deputies know, are very dangerous and some people did not know accurately what was in the report at all.  They were taking different versions which were being conveyed to them.  I am glad to say that, so far as I can ascertain, the Representative Body of the Garda have accepted this report.  They accept that it is being implemented as far as we can examine it.  Every aspect of this report, immediately the necessary examinations are made by the Government, will be dealt with as quickly as we can possibly get round to it.  There is much spadework to be done.</P>
    <P>I want to endorse everything that Deputy Cosgrave has said about the unauthorised usurpation of people's rights.  I appreciate the apprehension that is being caused in the mind of the public about the recent bank raids. Some of these very serious crimes against property are carried out by organised criminals.  It is very necessary that public opinion should be firmly behind the law enforcement authorities in dealing with miscreants.  In so far as public opinion has been moulded by expressions of view in this House, I am grateful to all the Deputies who have spoken.  I am grateful for the solidarity with which they have expressed their views on this particular issue.  The fact of the matter is that people representing nobody and afraid to come out and ask for public suffrage are prepared to come out in the dead of the night and terrorise their neighbours at the point of a gun. Such people are prepared to throw petrol bombs at public property and let the public pay for the damage.</P>
    <P>I referred to how Garda time is being wasted by many of these irresponsible <Col N="2123" /> people.  The best protection we can have against that is informed public opinion.  The more our people realise the utter irresponsibility displayed by some of these criminal elements&mdash;and that is the only way to describe them&mdash; the sooner our people realise the price the taxpayer is paying to try to control these people, who are comparatively very small in numbers but who are a very expensive item on our national bill, the better for the peace of our community.  As has been said by some Deputies here, the co-operation of our people to put these people behind bars is what is urgently required at this time in our country.  If the Garda get the full co-operation of our people, which they should get because they are public servants, the sooner these miscreants will be behind bars and the sooner the terror of some people living in isolated areas will be ended.</P>
    <P>So far as the other aspect of this Supplementary Estimate is concerned, that is, the portion of it dealing with transport, I am very glad to say that Garda communications have been vastly improved and at this time are being vastly improved.  Some of the most modern equipment has been acquired for them or is, at this time, being acquired for them.  It is my hope that before very long, with radio communications and the modernisation of the communications generally throughout the force, this will give the Garda force teeth they did not have up to this time.  To deal with the widespread hit and run type of organised crime we now have, this is essential.  Some of these criminals are equipped with and have experience of the use of walkie-talkie equipment.  They have very modern equipment, too.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is now vital that our force should be fully equipped with the most modern equipment available. I am glad to tell the House that that is being done.  When the present reorganisation of the force has been completed, with radio equipment, with cars, with fully equipped motor cycles, I believe we will have a force with teeth that will make impossible some of these rather frightening organised crimes that are going on at present.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other <Col N="2124" /> matter that arises under this Supplementary Estimate to which I need to refer.  It is quite clear that Deputies on all sides of the House are prepared to advise the public to co-operate with the Garda to the fullest possible extent in putting down the latest organised crime wave.  I believe that being the situation inside here, in a short time it will be generally accepted by the public outside too.  The public are becoming more and more educated about some of the thugs and layabouts who are wasting the time of the Garda and costing the taxpayers a lot of money.  The public are getting wise to the carry-on we have had here. As some Deputies have said, the best way to kill this is by the weight of public opinion.  The way this Estimate has been received by the House is an indication that the House is playing its own part in moulding public opinion.</P>
    <P>I know I am speaking for all sides of the House when I say that it has been a pleasure for Members of the House and for me as Minister for Justice to implement this vital part of the Conroy Committee recommendation and that it is the wish of the House that in so far as our national resources can afford it we will ensure that our Garda force are reasonably remunerated for the job that is certainly being very well done.  They will continue to command the respect of this House and indeed of the public at large for their integrity and their impartiality in respect of which tributes have been paid by all Deputies who have spoken tonight on this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 1969: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes a financial reconstruction of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta but, before dealing with the provisions in it, I should like to say something about the company itself.  The manufacture <Col N="2125" /> of nitrogenous fertilisers was a field into which private industry had not ventured, and after a great deal of study it was decided in 1961 to establish a State company to undertake this work.  NET was incorporated under the Companies Act in October, 1961, with a share capital of £100, and under the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Act, 1963, it was given £6 million from the Exchequer by way of repayable advances with interest.</P>
    <P>Right away, it can be said that the company have been a success.  The factory, which is a complex of chemical plants, came into operation in 1965. There were difficulties, outside the company's control, in bringing some of the plant into operation as early as had been hoped, but by the end of the company's year to 30th June, 1966, the plants for making nitrogenous fertilisers were fully operating and the company made sales of more than £2¼ million in that year.</P>
    <P>The utilisation of nitrogenous fertilisers in the cultivation of grassland was increasing substantially, and, in addition, there was a demand for complete concentrated fertilisers that include nitrogen as well as other nutrients. With the approval of the Government, NET installed a plant for the manufacture of concentrated fertilisers, and later the company extended their plant for the manufacture of calcium ammonium nitrate from an original capacity of 65,000 tons to a rated capacity of 140,000 tons.  In the course of this operation the nitric acid capacity of the company was increased threefold. The company have also diversified into the manufacture of liquid carbon dioxide for the mineral water trade and solid carbon dioxide&mdash;dry ice&mdash;for refrigeration of fresh meat exports.  They now supply the entire market for dry ice and a substantial portion of the carbon dioxide needs of the mineral water business.</P>
    <P>These major additions were installed by 30th June, 1969, and it is worth looking at the company's balance sheet of that date.  The fixed assets at 30th June, 1969, are shown at a cost of £9 million, and after depreciation of £1.9 million, they show a net value of £7.1 <Col N="2126" /> million.  Current liabilities exceed current assets by £0.65 million, but trade investment, reserves and balances are in excess of that amount.  The gross value of the company's sales in that year was £5.9 million and, after charging depreciation of £672,000, a net profit of £582,000 was earned, leaving out the question of State interest to which I will return in a moment.</P>
    <P>The State finance given to provide the initial undertaking and the developments to the extent that I have outlined was £6 million issued on interest as repayable advances under the 1963 Act. Under that Act also, there was provision for the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to guarantee sums that might be borrowed by the company to the extent of £1 million. That was availed of, and particulars of the amount so borrowed and guaranteed are laid annually before the House.</P>
    <P>It has become clear that the method of financing the company provided for in the 1963 Act is not now an appropriate way of enabling the company to carry on this commercial undertaking. Possibly it should not have been done that way in the first instance.  In the first place, there had necessarily to be a considerable gap in time between the initial acquisition and development of site, design and ordering of plant and so on, and the actual time when manufacture could start and sales commence. In that period money was being advanced from the Exchequer for that purpose, and interest was accumulating. It is estimated that the amount of interest that had accrued by the time operations and sales could commence was £850,000.</P>
    <P>The nature of the fertiliser trade is also important when considering what the capital structure of this company should be.  The application of fertilisers to the land is seasonal; and purchases of fertilisers from the producer, through the intermediaries, down to the user, largely follow that seasonal pattern. But the factory, for efficient production, must keep going.  This in itself, apart from the question of extensions of plant, involves the company in matters of considerable financial credit. I think it will be sufficient to say that where credit has to be got for large amounts from overseas suppliers, in the <Col N="2127" /> normal way of trade, there can be difficulties for a company organised on a basis of £100 share capital.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, it is now proposed in the Bill before the House to change the capital structure of the company from one of loan capital entirely, to a combination of share and loan capital and to give the company a nominal share capital of £7½ million.  Involved in this is a capitalisation of the interest which had accrued on the advances made by the State up to 30th June, 1967 and which amounted at that date to £1.212 million.  It is appropriate that at this point I should say something about commitments and undertakings given in this House about this interest.</P>
    <P>Both my predecessors and myself have given the House assurances that the Exchequer advances made to the company and the interest accruing on them were repayable by the company and that there would be no waiver of interest due.  I made a statement to this effect on the Adjournment Debate on 9th March, 1967.  At that time the question was raised that the financial accounts of the company did not make any provision for the charging of this interest in the year covered by the accounts, nor give the figure for the interest that had accrued from the time of the first advances.  I made it clear at the time that a full and true picture of the company's financial position was given in the accounts submitted for the information of the Dáil. The balance sheet up to 30th June, 1966, showed the total advances that had been made and it carried a note that as the conditions of repayment of the advances had not yet been determined, interest had not been provided for in the accounts.  In subsequent years, this note to the balance sheet included a figure for the interest accrued to the end of the year concerned, at the rates of interest on which the advances had been made, but again, no determination had been made as to how the moneys due should be repaid.</P>
    <P>The reasons for not making a determination as to the manner of repaying the advances and interest I have given before.  It would obviously have been pointless to have required repayments <Col N="2128" /> during the period in which the company was engaged in setting up the plant for manufacture; and immediately after, as I have said, the company was involved, and properly so, in an extension of its nitrogenous plant, the introduction of complete concentrated fertilisers and the exploitation of by-products.  It would not have been in the national interest to require the company to make repayments out of its cash flow needed for the development of its business.</P>
    <P>I now come to the provisions of the present Bill.  In section 2, it is proposed that instead of being a £100 share company, the company will have a nominal share capital of £7½ million. Not all of this will be subscribed or issued at the present time, but it is there to take account of developments that may occur in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with the repayable advances that have been made from the Exchequer, namely £6 million, and also with the interest that had accrued, at the interest rates on which the advances were made, up to 30th June, 1967.  What is proposed is that, of the £6 million advanced, £3½ million should now be converted into share capital, leaving the remaining £2½ million as a repayable advance. In addition the interest that had accrued to 30th June, 1967, on the £6 million, namely, £1.212 million, will also be converted into share capital. Thus, on the enactment of this Bill, the company would issue to the Minister for Finance shares to the value of £4.712 million.  The £2½ million advances which are not being converted into share capital would, with the interest accruing on them from 1st July, 1967, be repayable.  The terms of repayment of this sum, with interest, will again be for the Minister for Finance to determine, but it may be taken that repayments will commence immediately.</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the House that this is a reasonable way of restructuring the company's capital and of meeting the undertakings that have been given in respect of the original advances and the interest on them.  The accrued interest to 30th June, 1967, and part of the advances will go to the <Col N="2129" /> Minister for Finance in the form of share capital that the company is confident it can remunerate by dividend. On the evidence of the company's achievements to date I share this confidence. In addition, the company will start to repay by annual instalments the remaining advances with the interest arising from 1st July, 1967.  I would like to revert here to the position shown by the company's balance sheet at 30th June, 1969, which showed assets substantially in excess of the capital to be held by the Minister for Finance and the advances that will be due to be repaid to him. And on the company's capacity to service these, I refer again to the profit shown by the company for that year.</P>
    <P>There were other undertakings given to the Dáil about this company when the 1963 Act was going through.  These were that there would be no grant or subsidy assistance for the industry or tariff or quota protection.  No grants have in fact been given to the industry, notwithstanding that grants have been given by An Foras Tionscal to firms in the private sector for the manufacture of concentrated fertilisers.  Furthermore, there is no customs duty or quota on the importation of nitrogenous fertilisers.  At one point, an anti-dumping duty had to be imposed against certain imports of calcium ammonium nitrate, but that was specifically to counter the importation of this fertiliser at prices proved to be dumping prices, and this duty was subsequently removed.  In relation to complete concentrated fertilisers there was already on the tariff list, for the protection of manufacturers of compound fertilisers in the private sector, a customs duty applicable only to countries outside Britain and the preferential areas.  This duty, imposed for the private sector, is the only element of protection from which the company might be said to get any benefit, and it is, as I have said, of limited application.</P>
    <P>The company has shown itself capable of supplying its lines of fertilisers at or below genuine world prices.  It has introduced manufacture of a high technology, and it gives employment to some 700 persons.  It has <Col N="2130" /> not been subvented in any way, and I trust that the measures that this Bill proposes will be seen by the House, not as any waiver of obligations, but as a reasonable and necessary reconstruction of the company's finances.</P>
    <P>There are some other amendments of the 1963 Act proposed in the Bill, but I think it is necessary to call attention to only two of them at this stage. Section 6 of the Bill proposes that the limit of £1 million to which the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may guarantee loans obtained by the company, should be increased to £2 million.  This takes account of the increased activities of the company beyond what was contemplated at the time of the 1963 Act. There will also have been an increase in the company's costs since that time. Some of this increased facility for guaranteed borrowing will be used for the purchase of plant for the treatment of pyrites from the Avoca mines. When NET was being planned originally, it was the intention to use pyrites as a basic ingredient in the production of nitrogenous fertilisers. On the closure of the mines, NET had to work on imported sulphur instead. The reopening of the mines has led to the happy position that NET can now revert to the original proposal, at a financial benefit to them and the elimination of that much sulphur from our import bill.</P>
    <P>In section 4 there is provision that the Minister for Finance may dispose of his shares.  This is in other legislation dealing with State companies, for example, the Industrial Credit Company Acts.  There is also an amendment proposed in the Schedule to the Bill relating to section 9 of the 1963 Act.  Under the 1963 provision, the Schedule to the 1963 Act, which in effect provides the machinery for the State's control of the company, operates as long as the Minister for Finance holds any shares in the company or any money is due to him by the company. The amendment requires that for this schedule to continue in operation the Minister for Finance must hold at least one half of the company's shares or that there be money due to him as repayable advances or <Col N="2131" /> that any loan guaranteed by the State be outstanding.  In drawing attention to this particular amendment I am not in any way implying that there is any proposal in sight to change this company from being a State company. In fact, as the repayable advances will be repaid by annuity over a fair period of time, State control would automatically be retained by the amendment while that was the situation.  It is simply that the amendment expresses the logic of relating control to a majority shareholding, and leaves all options open in the future.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As an indication of the view, which I have expressed as shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce on behalf of my party for many years that we on this side of the House are entirely behind the Arklow nitrogenous fertiliser factory, if the House wishes&mdash;each Member is on his own in this&mdash;this Bill will pass through all its Stages in the House tonight, so far as we are concerned. That is a serious decision of our party with the purpose of indicating our support for this project and our desire to see the factory at Arklow in full operation at all times.</P>
      <P>That brings us to the old question of whether or not there should be a nitrogen factory.  There were files on the production of nitrogenous fertiliser from turf and God knows what else and eventually files on its production from pyrites.  Eventually, some time prior to 1961 it was decided that it should be produced.  It was decided once and for all and we now have in Arklow an industry employing 700 people which will be supported by all sides of the House.  It would be, in my view, even better supported if we got the chance of being in Government than it is by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to discuss the position as far as it has developed with particular reference to the financial situation of Nítrigin Éireann because this is a financial Bill.  What we want in a new industry are security of jobs, preferably for men&mdash;and this industry provides employment for men&mdash;and permanency at the lowest possible cost to the State <Col N="2132" /> whether by way of grant or loan or encouragement in any other way of private enterprise or any other enterprise whether public, private or half-and-half. If one were to take the present cost per job in the nitrogen factory one would arrive at a figure of £12,857, I think, on the basis of an investment of £9 million either made or guaranteed by the State.  I do not wish it to be taken as criticism but merely as a fact.</P>
    <P>People outside might regard a figure like this as a fantastically large sum per worker.  When I came here 16 years ago they talked of investment of £1,000 per worker but one must consider that you can find in the street tonight a lorry costing £7,000 or £8,000 and realise that, while this figure we are discussing is very high and should be noted, it is not entirely wild.  Investment per worker at present, as the Minister knows, has reached a very high figure in some cases in relation to capital investment by the State and, in relation to available money from private enterprise within the State, a frightening figure, considering the number of jobs that we must provide or defend in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>We must now discuss this Bill in relation to the past.  There were recriminations and discussions as to who was for and against the nitrogen factory. The first question was: could nitrogen be produced without participation in the general fertiliser business?  That business has changed considerably in the past 15 years.  The farmer now wants granulated fertiliser, CCF, which is a different type of fertiliser.  He is using combine drills that sow and put down fertiliser at the same time.  He is not wasting fertiliser on ground that grows weeds but placing it directly under his own seed which he wants to grow more successfully.  The question of whether nitrogen could be produced economically here without going into the business generally was a crucial one because the policy then&mdash;it has been referred to by the Minister&mdash;was that the Irish farmer could buy fertiliser anywhere as long as it was not dumped.  This was the sort of thinking that was produced in this House by politicians on all sides for many years. Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agree-In <Col N="2133" /> fact the result of the practical production of nitrogenous fertiliser was to prove that it could not be done economically.  To find some economic base for the immense expenditure we are discussing tonight it was necessary to form Nítrigin Éireann to go into production of CCF, a compound fertiliser that the farmers want, including not only nitrogen but potash and phosphate. This decision was made but it is correct to say that before the factory was built the indication was that it could be economic without going into this other field.  The fact is that it was not economic without going into the other field and the right decision was made by the board of the company eventually to go into the production of general fertilisers.</P>
    <P>There are people on all sides of the House involved in the fertiliser business and they know the exact position at present.  The Minister dealt largely with financial matters, and with these I must also deal, but there is now a selling organisation embracing all fertiliser companies in the country and there is a rationalisation of costs of transport.  If you buy from one of the other companies&mdash;we must not advertise in the House&mdash;you might get, if you were near enough, a product of Nítrigin Éireann which would not be nitrogen but might be a general fertiliser in CCF form or you might get a product made by some other company which would include nitrogen produced by Nítrigin Éireann.</P>
    <P>The private enterprise side of the business now accept that Nítrigin Éireann exists even though they resisted the introduction of the production of nitrogenous fertiliser virtually by the State and even though they did not want it.  Now the general selling of fertiliser is done through a pool which is used quite properly to reduce transport, storage and other costs.  You may conclude that there is no competition. In fact, the procedure is to approach the Minister's Department and get the proper and fair price to the farmers.  This is not a criticism but a statement of fact that was not in the Minister's speech.  As well as that the Minister knows that under the <Col N="2134" /> ment a certain tonnage of fertiliser must be allowed in.  I suppose the easy way the Minister could describe it if he agrees with me&mdash;and I think he will&mdash; is that he must let it in until it hurts and that the amount, whether it is 20,000 tons or 60,000 tons coming into the country of this CCF fertiliser containing the same product as Nítrigin Éireann are producing, their main line being nitrogen, is a matter the Minister has to argue about every year in order to try to keep the British people from sending fertiliser here under the Agreement.</P>
    <P>We have a very complex selling arrangement, in which Nítrigin Éireann and the ordinary fertiliser companies are involved.  I want the Minister to realise that I am not producing all this here&mdash;things he did not say&mdash;as a criticism of his Ministry, his Department, Nítrigin Éireann or anybody else. I am merely producing these things as irrefutable facts so that people will know and it can be recorded what the actual position in the fertiliser industry is today.  We are in a position where the Minister must allow in a certain quantity of fertiliser, where Nítrigin Éireann is selling its products in compound form or in straight form, as we say in the trade, either directly or through private enterprise channels, where there is no competition and the question arising, as the Minister said, is merely (a) of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and (b) of definite and proved dumping and the Minister has pointed out that an Order has had to be made in relation to dumping.  In relation to (a) I am aware that generally there has been a gentlemen's agreement and that people sending fertiliser here from Britain have operated on the basis that they would stop at 20,000 or 60,000 tons or whatever the relevant figure was in the relevant year.</P>
    <P>Before moving to the financial matters in the Bill I want to discuss the question of dumping.  There have been moves to limit the importation of urea.  There are those who would say that urea is a complete substitute for nitrogen and is a more modern product, developed subsequent to the building of the nitrogen factory.  Urea is a liquid which if one were organised <Col N="2135" /> for it and had tanks on the farm is in fact more easily handled than the solid product.  This again produces a problem&mdash;whether or not urea should be allowed in, in what quantity it should be allowed in or whether it is in fact the perfect substitute.  I do not want to go into details.  Dumping does occur and is something that exercises the minds of the Minister and his advisers when a decision has to be made.  What we must accept now, ungrudgingly, is that, at a cost of £9 million either in guaranteed money or money supplied, there are 700 employed in Arklow, that the probability is that our cost of nitrogen is as competitive as anywhere else in the world, if one takes out dumping, and that on the private enterprise side two very big industries, if one talks about them as individual units, have made a sale arrangement with Nítrigin Éireann; that Nítrigin Éireann is here to stay, that it should be fully supported by the House and that the problem exercising our minds should be how the finance should properly be divided and how best to provide safeguards for the nation.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not shocked anybody by the figure in relation to capital expenditure that was produced.  The fact of these big figures must be faced.</P>
    <P>Financial reconstruction was mentioned in the first sentence of the Minister's speech.  Unfortunately anyone in business at present whether he is selling candy at the corner or in big business has been faced with financial reconstruction over the last five years. It looks to me from the stage of inflation at the moment that further financial reconstruction will occur all over the country from top to bottom. Rationalisation and financial reconstruction are marvellous things so long as one is not rationalising oneself. However, they are a fact of life.  We see various companies seeking more capital in times of scarcity for high capital industries.  It is not surprising that even though the colossal amount of £6 million was provided in Arklow more is needed.  The question that arises is whether it is being provided in the right way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2136" /> There are two ways of giving money to a company.  One is by way of loan or debenture and the other is by taking shares.  A shareholder, whether of preference or ordinary shares, whether it is the Government or a private individual or a company, is in the position that he may not get a distribution of the profits.  There are two kinds of debentures.  There is the kind where if one does not pay it this year one must pay if the situation improves and there is the ordinary debenture which involves a fixed payment of interest and principal.  There is the two-way procedure here: of the £6 million originally provided £3½ million is issued in shares and £2½ million is a continuing advance.  In the situation this is probably as good a balance as could be provided and the decision of the Minister and the Minister for Finance was the right one.  One would hope then that the £2½ million would be funded by the repayment of principal and interest to be fixed by the Minister.  I suppose one cannot object to that although I hope we will be told what the rate of interest and repayment will be.  In relation to the share capital our position is that at £3½ million there is no stricture on the company to repay to the Minister for Finance or the State one penny unless it is making money and that in respect of accumulated interest not repaid £1,212,000 shall again be included in the share capital now being taken up by the Minister or a total of £4,712,000.  That £4,712,000 is in and we hope it will give a return to the Government.</P>
    <P>I will say something now that I have noticed in the recent past and that may in fact reassure people and make them realise that it is not so easy to repay or to make money.  The Industrial Credit Company which is an institution we all revere and want to support has just produced the first dividend for 40 years.  The figure was 2½ per cent.  In the building up of industry here there were troubles and investments were made which did not come up to scratch.  Whether, in perspective, it was right or wrong to establish the nitrogen factory in Arklow the position now is that we have got quite a large company, that the factory is in operation, that we are now reconstructing the financial <Col N="2137" /> affairs of the company and that the question of a dividend must be considered. At this stage it would be too optimistic to hope for a large, if any, dividend for some years.  The company is in its formative years.  If people were naïve enough they might expect a company of that size to produce a profit in three to five years but if one studies the reports of such companies one finds that with the exception of absolutely gilt-edged production by a company like Imperial Chemicals which control sale and purchase, such has not occurred.  A very sage businessman here has said that it takes 25 years to make an ordinary business.  Therefore, in relation to this £4,712,000 if there is a balance sheet that indicates that things are going well and if there is a small payment of dividend or in fact no dividend but a good situation, this would be as much as I would ask for for a number of years.</P>
    <P>However, one would hope as the years pass, as this company takes its place with private enterprise in the fertiliser complex in this country, there would come from this investment as high a percentage dividend and return as from private enterprise concerns. That is the load the directors and executives of Nítrigin Éireann must bear.  That is the message that should go out to them from this House; that we want to see them on a level with private enterprise fertiliser companies in a reasonable period of time.  We are not demanding something that is going to mean they produce a paper profit, an operating surplus&mdash;which is what they have been operating on without depreciation up to the present&mdash;and having produced it, the Minister, or his successor, would be back here in five years time looking for more capital moneys because they had distributed too much by way of profits or because of loan repayments to the State.</P>
    <P>However, we must face up to the fact that the £6 million was not sufficient. If we wipe out the debts&mdash;and the sum of £1,212,000 has been a figure in our national debt up to the present&mdash;and if we write this in as share capital, it is going to move from one side to the other and will change <Col N="2138" /> our national debt to the extent of £2 million in the statistics.  If that happens we must say &ldquo;We want to see a return on this, to see a good economic commercial situation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The figure of £9 million includes the question of the guarantee by the Minister of the borrowing of the company. As I understand the company's balance sheet and profit and loss account, which I admit I have not with me at the moment, because with my labours in Dublin South-West&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In vain, I hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point the Minister and I will agree to disagree. However, I am afraid I have not the file with me now and I must speak from memory.  The last time I read the profit and loss account the position was that the company had borrowed far more than the £1 million guaranteed by the Minister and we are now regularising the situation to some extent. The figure in my mind was £1,689,000 borrowed as it appeared on the last balance sheet.  They borrowed the money and we are merely regularising the payment to ensure that the lenders of the money are safe because the Minister is guaranteeing it, which means it is gilt-edged. Therefore, the extra borrowings mean that an extra amount of capital money is being injected into the company&mdash; in fact the major part of it has already been injected.</P>
      <P>In relation to these advances one thing is certain: the first for payment of interest will be the lender and, on the terms of loan, the first for payment of principal will be the lender&mdash;he will come before the State in the payment of any dividend.  He is guaranteed payment by the Minister and I presume that will guarantee repayment on the terms on which the loan was issued. We must, therefore, realise that the lenders of the £2 million which is now needed will come first and the question of any dividend or repayment of loan or interest on the loan&mdash;that is, the other £2,500,000 which remains as a loan from the State&mdash;will be second. This is a matter that should be mentioned here in the general discussion on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2139" /> The question then arises as to what has been the performance of the company to date.  There is the question of the length of time it takes to set up a business of this sort.  In a ready-made business, such as the production of cement, the product is needed for building and we know that it will be made and sold and private enterprise is operating at the same time, but the position here is that it takes many years to get to that stage.  The figure given by the Minister on 30th June, 1969, was £582,000, not taking into account the interest repayment to the State.  I have not got the figure of what interest was paid to other people during the financial year but I take it that it would be the same as what used to be the operating surplus of other semi-State bodies.  The term &ldquo;operating surplus&rdquo; irritated people in this House to such an extent that many semi-State companies have taken it out. That was the right thing to do because there is no point in saying you made a profit if you did not pay the interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in comparison with a normal commercial undertaking, the capital structure of the company is such that it has been operating on an all loan capital, as distinct from investment capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I know it has been changed in relation to the £4.712 million into subscribed capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference being that it is capital subscribed by the State.  My view is that we face this situation with an existing complex employing 700 people, with the responsibility of providing our farmers with fertiliser at the lowest cost possible and of the best quality.  We do this in a situation where the Minister has price-fixing machinery and control and in the context of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and anti-dumping legislation.  This whole complex maelstrom of pulls and pushes will produce difficulty for the Minister, but if we can harness private enterprise and Nítrigin Éireann to <Col N="2140" /> produce fertiliser of good quality at the right price for our people we shall be doing a valuable job.  Reference to the financial structure and the history of the company must be made because it is an honest appraisal and one that should be recorded in this House and supported in every way and as far as I am concerned I am going to support it.</P>
      <P>Any restraints on imports the Minister may have to apply should be applied only when it is proved that the fertiliser here is being provided to farmers at genuine world prices.  The phrase &ldquo;genuine world prices&rdquo; is, as the Minister and I know, very difficult to apply.  I know that in the complex overall structure the Minister will make mistakes.  He may even be asked questions by me about the mistakes he makes.  But that does not deter me from saying that I do not see any other way of ensuring continuation of supply of fertiliser to the Irish farmer except with the full support of Nítrigin Éireann, with this House acting as a watchdog to ensure fertilisers are supplied at the cheapest possible rate while, at the same time, ensuring a good financial return to the Government which is, after all, the shareholder and principal guarantor. That is the way I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust I have clarified the position of my party on this matter.  If the Minister wishes, I want to say that we will give him all Stages of the Bill, subject to discussion on the amendments circulated today.  We hope to see more employment provided in Wicklow and a better service for the Irish people with, at the same time, no loss to the private enterprise sector which has been doing the job for the past hundred years.  I am glad of an opportunity to refer to the private enterprise sector.  I am not so stupid as to pretend they welcome the arrival of Nítrigin Éireann.  The fact is they do not.  They would be acting out of character if they did.  I would be less than honest if I did not admit that. But, now that Nítrigin Éireann is an established fact, it is only right to put on record the fact that the private sector enterprise is co-operating with Nítrigin Éireann in the sale of their <Col N="2141" /> products and the private sector is also subject to the price control exercised by the Minister.  Provided the private sector continues to develop side by side with Nítrigin Éireann, we will have done a good job.  That is the way I want it to be.</P>
    <P>The future looks very rosy as far as production is concerned because, in the future, everybody will be using more and more fertiliser.  Those already using fertiliser in large volume will increase their use.  Those who are not using fertilisers will go in for fertilisers. More land will be pressed into production because of increasing land values on the Continent and in Britain. It will become more economic to drain land and bring it into production and that will call for the use of more and more fertilisers.  Let us hope we will have a balanced expansion on both sides and that no action on the part of the Government will prejudice employment in the private sector which, if my figures are correct, is many times greater than the figure of employment in Wicklow.  Let us hope we will have a good balanced fertiliser industry giving the very best service possible to the farmer and, at the same time, giving a fair return to the State just as those who invest their capital in the private enterprise sector are entitled to a fair return on their investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remarks to make.  I used to do a good deal of work with State companies and this project was like King Charles' head.  There were only two men in the Oireachtas ten years ago who spoke publicly and frequently in favour of this project: one was Deputy Frank Aiken and the other was myself.  Anyone who cares to look at the Seanad Debates will find that I strongly favoured this project.  I will not now damn it with faint praise.  I am not going to come in here in sackcloth and ashes and calculate how much per worker it cost.  This is not that kind of proposition, with respect to Deputy Donegan.  I have not got the figures but the Minister can probably tell me what imports this saves.  That is the important thing.  I do not at the moment know&mdash;I will have the figures tomorrow&mdash;what will be the turnover of this company.  For all I know it may be 50 or 60 per cent per annum on the £6 million.  This is the real return.  I have objected at times to certain propositions but, if the Minister analyses my objections, he will notice that, when I object to huge figures invested per person employed, there is really no saving effected at the other end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have to come back again now to another remark of Deputy Donegan's.  He and I are old friends so he will, I know, take my remarks in good part.  He said the private enterprise sector has been doing this job for one hundred years.  They have like hell! The man who did the really worthwhile job for this country after the last war was Lieutenant-General Michael Joseph Costello.  It is only right that that should be acknowledged in this House.  I remember well when he did the job.  The Minister may have been too young to have the same interest in the event as I had at the time, but Lieutenant-General Michael Costello put a spanner in the works of the international fertiliser cartel.  The files on all this in the Department of Industry and Commerce must be <Col N="2143" /> simply massive.  The work done by Lieutenant-General Costello in 1947 or 1948 must be acknowledged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>The Minister could say he got 100 per cent on his capital. This kind of game is very intriguing. I take it the Minister understands the idea I am trying to convey.  A very interesting thing happened: Deputy Aiken was made Acting Minister for Finance; he demanded all the dusty files on the project in the Department <Col N="2144" /> and he re-activated the project.  That shows how interested he was in the project.  I think the year was 1952.  I had left the Civil Service.  Deputy Aiken re-activated the project.  The man who damned it with bell, book and candle was the erstwhile leader of the Fine Gael Party.  To hear him talk about how useless nitrogenous fertilisers were to the farmers and how the farmers had gone off them&mdash;I notice Deputy Donegan smiling, but this is true.</P>
