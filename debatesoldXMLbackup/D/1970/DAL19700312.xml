      <P>The Members of the House will have learned with profound sadness and deepest regret of the unexpected death of Deputy P. J. Lenihan&mdash;ar dheis Dé go raibh sé.</P>
      <P>Although a Member of Dáil Éireann for only five years the late Paddy Lenihan was actively involved in the public and commercial life of the country since his early years and was prominently identified with Irish industrial development for over thirty years.  He was widely recognised in this sphere as a man of outstanding talent and ability.</P>
      <P>His contributions to our debates here were always concise and wellinformed. Whatever the subject under discussion Paddy Lenihan brought to bear on it a wide knowledge, an extensive experience and a depth of sincerity which always commanded respect and attention.</P>
      <P>The loss of Paddy Lenihan to Dáil Éireann and to his constituents of Longford-Westmeath will be gravely felt.  There was no more conscientious Member of the House in his attendance here in the Chamber and in his attention to his duties as a Deputy.  A gay and colourful personality, nobody could wish for a more enjoyable companion or for a more loyal comrade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to Mrs. Lenihan, to our colleague the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and to the other members of the family so sadly bereaved the deepest sympathy of every Member of the House.  Solas <Col N="334" /> na bhFlathas d'anam dílis an té atá imithe uainn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £8,938,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1970, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The net amount of this Supplementary Estimate added to the original Estimate for 1969-70 represents a total net provision of £66,411,000.  This figure shows an increase of £9,587,500 on the final total Estimate for Agriculture, including the Supplementary Estimate, for 1968-69.  The sum of £66.4 million includes £36½ million for price support, of which milk accounts for £31 million.  It also includes £19 million for agricultural development grant schemes: £3 million for disease eradication; £3 million for agricultural education and advisory services and £2½ million for research.</P>
      <P>The additional sum now required includes £4 million for milk; over £1 million for lime and fertiliser subsidies; £1 million for payments to the Pigs and Bacon Commission; £900,000 for the beef cattle incentive scheme; £790,000 for the calved heifer scheme; £525,000 (net) for bovine tuberculosis scheme; £500,000 to meet losses on disposal of wheat; £350,000 for grants for the glasshouse industry; £224,000 for the land project and £177,000 for the farm building scheme.  A net saving of £250,000 is expected under the beef, mutton and lamb export guarantee schemes and a further net saving of £331,000 under the brucellosis eradication scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first item I shall deal with is support for creamery milk&mdash;the most costly item.  The original Estimate <Col N="336" /> provision was £27 million and a further £4.061 million is included in the Supplementary Estimate, making a total provision of £31.061 million.</P>
    <P>The amount provided by the Exchequer for creamery milk support has risen at a very sharp rate in recent years.  In the last financial year it was £25.4 million; in 1967-68 it was £19.3 million; in the year before that it was £13.7 million and in 1964-65 it was £8.2 million.  Thus, it has almost quadrupled in five years.  This shows what the Government have done and are doing for the dairying industry and those who are most vocal in their criticism of every new step taken by the Government to assist the industry should pause to reflect on the vast contribution being made by the Exchequer to the industry's total income.  They should note in particular that the Exchequer is paying an average of about 1s 2d on every gallon of milk delivered to creameries in the current year.</P>
    <P>Of the total provision of over £31 million, about £17¼ million is required for payment of milk price allowances to suppliers of milk to creameries and just over £3 million is needed to meet the cost of the special quality allowance on all creamery milk that passes the quality test.  These two allowances make up a total of over £20¼ million which is payable, through the creameries, direct to the farmers who supply creamery milk.  However, this is not the full picture.  About £10¾ million more is paid from the Exchequer to Bord Bainne towards the board's export losses, and this large sum is reflected in the prices paid by the board to creameries for butter and to manufacturers for cheese, whole milk powder, chocolate crumb and other dairy products.  While the allowances paid direct from my Department to the creameries are shown in the monthly returns to producers, the benefit of the £10¾ million paid through Bord Bainne is not readily apparent.  However, it is reflected in the butterfat price received by the producer.  The overall position is in fact that about half of the total cash received by creamery producers for their milk now comes from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> As the increasing costs of milk production have been bearing more heavily on the small and medium-scale producers than on the large producers, the Government decided in October last that the Exchequer support for the creamery milk price should be adjusted on a tiered basis.  A price increase on their entire production was given to the 80 per cent of producers who supply less than 7,000 gallons per year. Those supplying between 7,000 and 14,000 gallons received an increase on a gradually declining scale.  Those supplying between 14,000 and 20,000 gallons neither gained nor lost and only the 2½ per cent of producers supplying more than 20,000 gallons a year had to bear a phased reduction.  These latter producers have advantages of scale resulting in lower unit costs.  The advantage in production costs of a supplier of, say, 60,000 gallons compared with those of a 7,000 gallon supplier far outweighs the difference in the new rates of support.  There are, of course, other considerations also. The relative income position of the larger suppliers is much better than that of the smaller suppliers.  The cost of subsidising the larger suppliers has been mounting steadily.  All extra milk produced has practically to be given away in export markets; I shall say more about this in a moment.  The beef cattle incentive scheme is available to anyone who decides to switch from milk to beef.  Furthermore, if the adjustments had not been made, it would not have been possible to increase the price for the small and medium-scale suppliers who constitute the great majority.  As I have already stated publicly, I make no apology for giving special consideration to the smaller producers.  The principle of channelling a larger share of State support for milk to the traditional supplier is not new.  It has long been accepted by farm organisations.  It was very much NFA Council policy as long ago as 1962.  In that year the then president of that organisation had this to say in his message to readers of the NFA Year Book.  I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must attach special importance to the decision of Council ....that all future subventions to agriculture wherever practicable <Col N="338" /> must be applied so as to be of maximum benefit to the smaller farms, and must diminish progressively on a sliding scale as the size of the enterprise increases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of the support adjustments I might add that last autumn the Government also gave a retrospective increase of 1d per gallon to all suppliers on the first 1,000 gallons per month supplied in the period May to August.</P>
    <P>The total creamery intake in 1969 at 527 million gallons was 7 million gallons above 1968 and was an all-time record.  It would have been even higher were it not for the drought conditions experienced in the autumn. Deliveries in 1970, given reasonable weather conditions, may exceed the 550 million gallon target which we set for ourselves in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>The increasing level of milk production and the depressed state of world markets for dairy products are reflected in the cost of the Exchequer contributions towards meeting the export losses of An Bord Bainne.  The world market situation for dairy products is little short of chaotic.  Huge stocks in the EEC overhang the markets, and the outlook for the immediate future is anything but encouraging.  Most of our sales of butter in foreign markets in the current financial year have been made at little more than give-away prices.  For example, we have had to sell thousands of tons of butter at less than a shilling per lb. which, when allowance is made for manufacturing and other costs, represents only a few pence per gallon for the butterfat of the milk concerned.  In view, however, of the vital position of dairying in our agricultural industry and having regard to the importance of milk production to many thousands of our farmers, the Government continue to provide an increasingly high level of support for creamery milk.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of Exchequer support for creamery milk, I should like to refer to the milk which is surplus to the requirements of the liquid trade in the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards' areas.  A working surplus is necessary to ensure that consumer milk requirements are fully met <Col N="339" /> throughout the year despite the fluctuations which normally occur in supply and demand.  Heretofore, the cost of disposing of this surplus was financed mainly by the Exchequer.  However, as the surplus is an integral and essential part of the liquid trade operations I have arranged, as I announced in January, that the disposal of the surplus will in future be financed from funds derived by the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards from a levy on all sales of liquid milk in their respective areas. These new arrangements will have only a negligible effect on the Exchequer bill for creamery milk support in the current financial year but in a full year they should yield a saving to the Exchequer of the order of £300,000.  At present these new arrangements are being applied only to the surplus of the liquid trade in Dublin and Cork. The application of a somewhat similar arrangement to the surpluses of the liquid trade in other areas would present certain problems but these are being examined with a view to securing further relief for the Exchequer, if possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer here also to the need for reorganisation and rationalisation of the creamery industry if it is to meet the keen competition expected to continue in world markets in the years ahead and if our milk producers are to obtain the maximum returns.  The question of rationalisation has been receiving serious consideration by many co-operative creamery societies throughout the country and significant progress has already been made.  In order to assist further progress, I have approved of negotiations for the transfer of some of the interests of the Dairy Disposal Company to co-operative ownership in the context of overall reorganisation and rationalisation of the creamery structure in the areas concerned. Rationalisation proposals have, of course, to be most carefully examined by creamery societies from the social aspect as well as from the economic aspect.  In this connection I have already announced my intention to establish an independent group to evaluate any proposed scheme for creamery rationalisation from both aspects, where it is clear that some <Col N="340" /> of the interests involved have cogent reasons for objecting to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The calved heifer scheme terminated on 30th June, 1969.  A provision of £200,000 was made for it in the Estimate.  However, there was a remarkable surge of interest in the scheme in its final few months.  The number of applications received from January to June, 1969 was 26,530 compared with 16,005 in the corresponding period in 1968.  No doubt the greatly improved prospects for the cattle trade and the introduction of the beef cattle incentive scheme contributed to this.  The result is that the grants this year will amount to about £940,000.  Miscellaneous expenses bring the total provision to £990,000.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was announced as part of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, the target set was an increase in our cow numbers from 1,322,000 in 1963 to 1,700,000.  In June, 1969, with a cow population of about 1,655,000 we had practically achieved the target and there is potential for a further increase this year.</P>
    <P>In my speech on the 1968-69 Estimate I made a preliminary announcement on the introduction of the beef cattle incentive scheme which is aimed at encouraging beef production by providing grants to herdowners registered under the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme who do not sell milk or milk products.  Herdowners selling milk or milk products, who are prepared to switch over entirely to beef production, may, of course, apply to participate in the scheme.  A grant of £12 is paid each year under the scheme for each cow, in excess of two, which is present at two consecutive inspections and is matched by a calf.</P>
    <P>The scheme met with a ready response in its first year of operation. Around 36,000 herdowners had applied in time to have their herds inspected at the first round of inspections which took place in June.  These herds were again inspected in September and payment of grants to eligible herdowners has since taken place.</P>
    <P>The sum provided for this scheme in subhead K.29 of the main Estimate was £1,000,000.  When that Estimate was drawn up, the grant proposed was <Col N="341" /> £8 per cow.  Subsequently, however, following representations from farmers' organisations and committees of agriculture, I increased the grant to £12.  A a result of the impetus given to the scheme by the increased rate of grant it is estimated that grants to herdowners for the year 1969-70 will come to close on £1.9 million, the extra £900,000 to be provided for in the Supplementary Estimate.  A large proportion of the £1.9 million will go to the small men in the western areas.</P>
    <P>I referred at the outset to a saving on meat subsidy payments.  This saving reflects the higher level of market prices.  In 1969 the cattle trade continued buoyant.  Demand for cattle and beef was steady and prices generally were higher than in 1968 which was itself a very good year.  Our exports of store cattle to Britain and the Six Counties were at a rather lower level than in 1968.  However, in view of the record level of total cattle numbers in 1969, the somewhat lower level of exports was not due to any shortage of supplies.  The tightness and cost of credit in Britain seem to have been one of the major causes of the lower British demand for stores.  Export slaughterings of bullocks and heifers were well maintained.  Following the increase in the British guaranteed price for cattle for 1969-70, the Government decided to increase the level of support for our carcase beef exports to Britain by approximately 2d. per lb. deadweight.  Because of the good market price situation in Britain the level of the guarantee payments under the fatstock guarantee scheme there and, consequently, the level of our expenditure on the carcase beef export support payments will be lower in 1969-70 by about £500,000 than was originally estimated.  Exchequer expenditure will, nevertheless, be very substantially above what it would have been if the support level had not been increased in March last.  Because of the lower level of the British guarantee payments the amount payable by the British Government under the Free Trade Area Agreement on imports of Irish carcase meat up to 25,000 tons will also be down by £250,000.</P>
    <P>The carcase beef industry has, of <Col N="342" /> course, been making an important contribution to the national economy for many years.  The industry was developed without financial assistance from the State but in 1965 a temporary scheme of support for exports to Britain was introduced to assist the meat exporters who at the time were finding it difficult to obtain adequate supplies of fat cattle.  This scheme was put on a more permanent basis in July, 1966, when the Free Trade Area Agreement came into operation.  The agreement provided in effect that the British Government would pay us the British guarantee payment on 25,000 tons of Irish beef per annum.  The agreement did not specify how this money should be used but it was agreed between the two Governments that it could be applied in continuation of the previously existing beef export support.  The Irish Exchequer has, of course, been supporting a far larger quantity of beef than the 25,000 tons per annum supported from the funds provided by the British Government under the Free Trade Area Agreement. In the current financial year, for instance, exports of beef to Britain are likely to be in the region of about 75,000 tons and support for 50,000 tons of this will be provided by the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    <P>These support payments have greatly improved the competitive position of the meat factories whose only competitor now is the store cattle exporter whereas previously they had to compete against the shipper of live fat cattle also.  It has been suggested in certain quarters that our rate of support should always be the same as the guarantee payment in Britain.  However, while British feeders of Irish stores get the full guarantee payment from the British Exchequer and although the greater part of this money may come back to the Irish store cattle producer, some portion of it is retained by the British feeder.  The fact that our support here does not match exactly the British level of support has not had an adverse effect on the throughput of the meat factories. Indeed, in the ten months since the beginning of the current fatstock year in April last up to the end of January, the factories slaughtered 35,000 <Col N="343" /> bullocks and heifers more than in the corresponding period of 1968-69 whereas exports of store cattle were at a lower level.  In the nine months April to December, 1969, the number of store cattle exported was 67,600 head lower than in the same period in 1968.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that no cattle should be allowed to be exported alive.  This suggestion seems to me to ignore the interests of producers. I cannot see how the best interests of producers would be served by termination of the store cattle trade which earned over £45 million in 1968 and nearly £43 million in 1969.  As experience in 1966 and 1967 showed, the existence of competitive outlets is the producer's assurance of the best possible prices for his cattle.</P>
    <P>Late in 1968 the US Government introduced allocations arranged on a multilateral voluntary basis for imports of beef into the United States during 1969 from all the substantial supplying countries, including Ireland. Our beef exports to the US which consist almost entirely of frozen cow beef for manufacturing purposes, amounted to about 25,000 tons in 1968. Under the arrangements for 1969 Ireland was originally allocated 28,000 tons but this figure was subsequently increased to 28,800 tons as a result of the redistribution of a shortfall in imports into the US from another supplying country.  Similar arrangements will also apply in respect of imports of meat into the US during 1970 and our allocation for the year is 29,240 tons.</P>
    <P>The EEC market continues to remain closed for all practical purposes to our cattle and beef.  Throughout 1969 levies were in operation continuously and at times reached the equivalent of about £55 per head on top of which there is a duty of 16 per cent, as well as heavy transport and other costs.  In this kind of situation it is not surprising that our exports to the EEC have been at a virtual standstill.  Efforts to secure some concession from the Community and member States for Irish cattle and beef were continued but without success.  We have drawn particular attention to our concern <Col N="344" /> that any concession granted to a third country should be extended to us and we have not hesitated to press our case strongly in the Community and with member States.</P>
    <P>Coras Beostoic agus Feola, which was established by me at the beginning of 1969 to promote exports of cattle, sheep and lambs and meat, has been active in promoting exports.  The commission is now getting into its stride and I look forward to its achieving impressive results to the advantage of both producers and exporters.</P>
    <P>Despite incentives to increased production of sheep and lambs and despite the relatively good prices during recent years, sheep numbers have continued to decline. To a great extent this decline reflects the relative profitability of competing agricultural enterprises and it is significant that the decline seems to have occurred mainly in the lowlands.  Exports of carcase lamb to the Continent exceeded exports to Britain for the first time during 1968 and this was the position also in 1969.</P>
    <P>The mountain lamb subsidy scheme was continued in 1969 and again proved very successful.  In the current financial year approximately £424,000 has been paid in subsidy at the rate of £1 per lamb to mountain sheep farmers.  As Deputies are already aware, the same rate of subsidy was extended in 1969 to hogget ewes and payments amount to about £171,000 bringing total subsidy payments to about £595,000.  Miscellaneous expenses connected with the schemes bring the total outlay to £600,000 in round figures.</P>
    <P>As a means of stimulating production the extension of the subsidy to hogget ewes should have effects reaching beyond the mountain areas.  It should lead to younger more productive ewes being retained in mountain flocks and the older less productive ewes being removed to the lowlands where they can be profitably used for further breeding.</P>
    <P>I might mention here a development of interest to pony breeders&mdash;the holding by the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society of an international <Col N="345" /> conference in Galway next August. This is the first venture of its kind.  It will bring Connemara Pony Societies from all countries together and I am providing in the Supplementary Estimate for a grant of £1,000 towards the cost of the conference.</P>
    <P>The total provision for pigmeat support in the current financial year is £3.6 million, as compared with actual expenditure of £2.95 million in 1968-69.</P>
    <P>The year 1969 was a good one for pig producers.  Deliveries of pigs to bacon factories reached a new record level of 1,936,000 exceeding the previous record in 1965 by 139,000. Prices for both weaners and finished pigs were buoyant throughout the year.</P>
    <P>When it was announced in November, 1968, that the floor price for barley of the 1969 crop would be increased by 3/- per barrel, it was indicated that an appropriate adjustment would be made in the guaranteed minimum prices for pigs in the autumn of 1969.  This was done.  We also made some necessary grading changes, reducing the maximum weight for all grades and amalgamating two of the medium grades.  The reduction in the maximum weight of the export grades from 160 lb deadweight to 150 lb was necessary so as to bring the weight of Irish bacon sides into line with our competitors' bacon on the British market.  We had also in mind the desirability of lessening any incentive to smuggle pigs from the Six Counties where the maximum weight for good quality pigs for some time past has been 145 lbs.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a multilateral understanding governs the supply of bacon to the British market. Our quota for the 1970-71 quota year is 28,180 tons, the same as for 1969-70. With record pig slaughterings we were able to find export markets for substantial quantities of pork in the past year and the Pigs and Bacon Commission sent substantial supplies not only to the traditional British out-let, where the bulk of Irish pork is sold and where it commands a premium price, but to Italy, Hungary, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and Japan.  In many of those markets the returns were <Col N="346" /> appreciably better than those for pork and bacon exports to Britain.  However, while we welcome these marketing de-developments, it should not be assumed that we have unlimited and remunerative outlets abroad for our pigmeat production.  The fact is that there was a lower level of pig production on the Continent during the past year, apparently as part of the normal evolution of a pig cycle.  Production in many of the Continental countries is now increasing but I feel confident that the Pigs and Bacon Commission will be able to retain its footing in some of its new markets, particularly as Irish pork has met with ready acceptance as a high quality product in those markets.</P>
    <P>While testing under the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme continues on much the same pattern as in previous years, my Department has been making a big effort to stamp out the remaining sources of the disease. This, it is hoped, will lead to a substantial reduction in incidence in future years.  In the current financial year the provision in the main Estimate will be exceeded, due mainly to an increase in the number and cost of reactor animals to be purchased.  The Supplementary Estimate includes provision for the extra expenditure.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, County Donegal was declared a brucellosis-free area in June, 1968.  Four more counties, namely, Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo have now been added to the brucellosis-free area.  The further extension of the eradication scheme is at present under examination.  The Supplementary Estimate takes account of an expected net saving of over £300,000.</P>
    <P>It had been anticipated that the incidence of warble infestation in 1969 would have been at much the same level as in 1968 when approximately 160,000 cattle were treated.  In the event, the number treated was about 400,000.  The increase in incidence can be attributed to the fact that in 1968 the dressing campaign got off to a late start because of the foot and mouth precautions in the early part of that year.  As a result warbles had emerged in large numbers before the affected <Col N="347" /> animals could be treated.  It is to be hoped that the extensive dressing coverage provided in 1969 will have reduced warble infestation to an insignificant level again but this will not be known until later in the spring.  Should it transpire that pockets of infestation remain these will have to get special attention.  I would stress, however, that the fullest co-operation of all herdowners is needed if our efforts to eradicate this injurious pest are to succeed.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, there was a large surplus of wheat over the milling requirement from the 1968 harvest. This surplus had to be disposed of as animal feed and the Exchequer had to bear the cost as no wheat levy operated in that year.  In addition to a sum of £900,000 which was paid in 1968-69 to An Bord Gráin to meet part of the loss involved, there is a provision of £500,000 in the Supplementary Estimate to meet a further part of the loss involved.  Indeed this may not be the end of the Exchequer commitment for the 1968 crop.  These payments are, in fact, a bonus to wheat growers, because under normal circumstances they should have carried the loss themselves by way of a levy deducted from the price of wheat in 1968.</P>
    <P>Demand for the facilities provided under the Department's various development schemes continues at a high level.</P>
    <P>The amount paid out in 1968-69 by way of grants to farmers under the land project general scheme was £2,610,000 and the area of land improved was 97,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Grants available under the schemes for mountain fencing and grazings have been considerably improved and constitute a strong inducement to farmers to produce more and better &ldquo;keep&rdquo; for stocks in mountain areas during critical periods of the year.</P>
    <P>The fine summer and late autumn of 1969 resulted in an exceptionally large number of land project works being completed.  The number of cases submitted for grant payment in the nine-month period from 1st April to 31st December rose from 12,163 in 1968 to 13,792 in 1969, representing an increase in acreage reclaimed from <Col N="348" /> 85,282 acres to 98,134 acres and a consequential increase in grant payments from £2,103,000 to £2,513,000 in the respective nine-month periods. The amount provided for grant payments in the 1969-70 Vote is £2,530,000 but it is clear that this will be insufficient. Provision is being made under subhead K.9 in the Supplementary Estimate for a further £224,000.</P>
    <P>The farm buildings and water supply schemes are kept under review to ensure that the facilities provided are in line with the current needs of farmers.  In February, 1969, grants for unroofed silos were reintroduced.  In May, new grants were introduced for cow parlours, while increased rates of grants became payable in the case of dry stock housing, silos, silage bases and water supplies.</P>
    <P>The sum provided in subhead K.8 of the main Estimate for grant expenditure under these schemes was £2,593 million.  The increased grants will give rise to extra expenditure estimated at £117,000.  Provision for this is being made in the Supplementary Estimate.  In 1968-69 grants paid under these schemes amounted to £2,457 million.</P>
    <P>Silage making is of tremendous importance in our animal production economy.  The tonnage made increased from about 400,000 tons in 1963 to 2,400,000 tons in 1968.  A further significant increase to over 3 million tons is estimated to have taken place in 1969.  Grants for the purchase of new forage harvesters&mdash;equivalent to about one-third of the purchase price&mdash;are being continued.  Grants are paid at a flat rate to suitable persons who undertake to hire out the equipment on specified terms and to groups of farmers prepared to co-operate in silage making.</P>
    <P>The scheme is being operated through the committees of agriculture to whom the Department recoup the full amount of the grants paid.  In view of the popularity of the scheme, I am making provision in the Supplementary Estimate for an additional £40,000. To enable instructors in agriculture to give on-the-spot recommendations to farmers on the feeding value of their silage, in-service practical courses on <Col N="349" /> the analysis of silage have been given in the various counties.</P>
    <P>In 1968-69, there was a slight decline in deliveries of ground limestone due, in the main, to the adverse weather conditions in the early months of 1969, when the demand should have been reaching its peak.  Any decline in consumption would be unwelcome and I am glad to say that there has been an increase this season.  I would again urge farmers to order as much lime as possible during the summer months when they are assured of prompt deliveries and can take advantage of the lower prices generally prevailing at that time.</P>
    <P>The promotional measures in favour of fertiliser use initiated by my Department a few years ago in co-operation with the fertiliser industry and the advisory services have proved very successful.  Consumption of the three main nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, has increased remarkably over the last three years. The provision in the main Estimate for lime and fertiliser subsidies was £6,037,000 but, in view of the increased consumption, it is necessary to seek a supplementary sum of £1,022,000 making a total of £7,059,000.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants for glasshouse nurseries was introduced in 1967 to encourage the modernisation and expansion of existing commercial nurseries and the establishment of efficient new ones.  Progress under the scheme has been rapid and 130 acres of modern, fully equipped glasshouses have already been approved for grants. Growers have expanded their share of the home market for tomatoes and exports have increased from £180,000 in 1967 to about £430,000 in 1969.</P>
    <P>The response to the scheme and its cost to the Exchequer have been much greater than had originally been expected and provided for.  During the current financial year it became necessary, because of the very large number of applications on hands, to review the position generally from the financial aspect and, in the meantime, to suspend the further approval of applications. The amount in the main Estimate is not, in fact, sufficient to meet payments in many cases already approved before the review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> The approval of applications under the scheme has now been resumed. The scheme has now been modified by the introduction of a ceiling of £25,000 on the grant available to any new applicant.  In cases where applications were already on hands awaiting approval while the scheme was under review, a maximum grant of £40,000 will be allowed.  A suitable system of priorities for applications within the funds available is also being worked out in the case of future applications. The supplementary provision of £350,000 now proposed will enable most, if not all, the cases maturing for payment before the end of the financial year to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a development council for the glasshouse industry was recommended in the report of the survey team on that industry.  Consideration is being given by the industry and by my Department to the question of how a council or development body for the industry could best be established and financed.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,750,000 was provided under subhead I.5 of the main Estimate towards the non-capital expenses of An Foras Talúntais.  A further £96,000 will be required to meet the cost in the present year of applying national salary and wage increases to staffs of the institute.  Provision for this is being made in the Supplementary Estimate.  Under subhead I.6, £70,000 is being provided to finance capital expenditure by the institute.  The State's financial contribution to the institute in the current financial year will, thus, amount to something over £1,900,000. This compares with a contribution of £1,582,500 in the past financial year.</P>
    <P>Almost 70 per cent of the institute's current outlay is accounted for by salaries, wages and travelling expenses of the staff, and a substantial part of its increasing annual expenditure arises under this head.  It may be noted too that as the institute's expenditure increases so does its dependence on the State for funds to meet this expenditure. In the present financial year, it is estimated that at least 80 per cent of the institute's current expenditure, as well as the whole of its capital expenditure, will have to be met by the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> While there is expected to be a saving on grants under the small farm incentive bonus scheme, this is not indicative of a lack of interest in the scheme.  In fact, since its introduction in May, 1968, over 9,000 farmers have applied to participate in the scheme and over 6,000 of these have embarked on their farm development plans. Many of the participants have, indeed, already successfully completed stage one of their plans and have been paid the first instalment of £50 of the bonus grant.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the scheme is the fact that almost two-thirds of the participants are in the 12 western counties.  This represents a very satisfactory initial response to the scheme in the areas where the need to intensify employment, both on and off the farm, is greatest.</P>
    <P>The administration of this scheme is very largely in the hands of the chief agricultural officers and their advisory staffs throughout the country and I would like to express my appreciation of their efforts in getting the scheme under way and to thank them for their co-operation in the operation of the scheme at all times.</P>
    <P>As announced in the 1969 Budget statement, the total bonus grant offered under the scheme has been increased from £200 to £300.  This bonus grant is additional to all other grants and subsidies available to farmers and it should offer a very strong incentive to smaller farmers who come into the potentially viable category to take part in the scheme.  It is hoped, therefore, that many more farmers will be applying to participate in the scheme from now on.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a certain amount of misconception about the Government's policy on small farms though this policy has been set out clearly in successive economic programmes. The role of the part-time farmer has been fully recognised.  Part-time farming has long been a feature of our whole agricultural economy and particularly of the western areas.  On this point I need only refer Deputies to paragraph 18 of Chapter 5 of the <Col N="352" /> Third Programme from which I quote the following:</P>
    <P>Even with this special scheme&mdash; that is the Small Farm Incentive Bonus Scheme&mdash;and the wide range of other measures available to help farmers, there will inevitably remain a proportion of farms which cannot be brought up to a viable level.  On many of these the occupiers can provide themselves with a reasonable level of income through supplementary earnings from non-agricultural sources.  The opportunities for securing such earnings already exist in many instances and the aim is to expand them still further.  In the long run the only real solution to the problem of farms which cannot be made to provide a reasonable livelihood lies not in agriculture alone but in the comprehensive development of rural areas through the expansion of industry, tourism, afforestation, fisheries, etc.  This approach has the advantage of helping to maintain the rural population.</P>
    <P>Since we are dealing with the Supplementary Estimate only, my statement has not covered broad aspects of agricultural policy and developments. I would have welcomed an opportunity of giving the House a general outline of our assessment of what membership of the EEC will mean for Irish agriculture.  I may briefly say, however, that the main benefit for the farmer would be increased prices, especially for cattle and milk, higher output and income.  Our agricultural exports would have free access to a large market at remunerative prices but would encounter keen competition from other member States.  I hope to publish in the very near future a document setting out in detail the results of a study on Irish agriculture and fisheries in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I would like also to comment briefly on criticism of the Free Trade Area Agreement made by the chief spokesman on agriculture for the British Conservative Party, and on complaints by the chairman of the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales about the growth in imports of some Irish dairy products.  The Free Trade Area Agreement means a two-way traffic <Col N="353" /> between Britain and Ireland.  Special treatment for our agricultural exports to Britain is our right under the agreement and we are paying for it by way of concessions on imports of British industrial goods into Ireland.  Our ability to continue as a substantial importer of British goods is largely dependent on the development of our agricultural exports to the UK.  Unfortunately the persons in Britain to whom I have referred do not appear to see matters this way.  What they seem to be advocating is a situation in which British industrial goods would have free access to our market while the entry of Irish dairy and other agricultural products into the British market was restricted by governmental or other action.  We could not, of course, accept such a situation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would mention that, thanks to sound policies, agriculture has now had three consecutive good years marked by substantial increases in agricultural output, prices and incomes. Government policy, as is has evolved over the years, has resulted in farmers being increasingly well equipped to expand production on an efficient basis and to exploit opportunities for increased sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Supplementary Estimate for £8,938,000. While the Estimate is fairly wide it still does not afford Deputies an opportunity of discussing agriculture generally. However, as the Minister has said in the concluding paragraph of his speech that he would be making an announcement as to what our agricultural prospects will be on our entry into the EEC, it is important that this House should be given an opportunity of discussing the matter.  Undoubtedly adjustments and alterations will be necessary and some idea should be given as to what it will mean to the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the subheads in this Supplementary Estimate are concerned, the most important one, in my opinion, is the one dealing with the dairying industry, but I intend to reserve most of my comments for the main Estimate when it comes before us.  There is provision here of £1,000 in respect of agricultural society shows.  Coming from an area <Col N="354" /> which is interested in and has more agricultural shows than any other area in the country, I support this whole-heartedly. However, some of these grants are paid in accordance with the amount of prize money that is paid out at the shows and this militates against the smaller shows.  In County Cork there are small villages who hold their own shows through co-operative effort on the part of the local people.  These shows are an incentive to people to display their cattle and other animals and create competition which it is very necessary to encourage.  It is something in which the agricultural community, both farmers and their wives, take a very keen interest.  I would urge the Minister to examine this matter and to see that the small show gets fair play as against the bigger shows which have a greater amount of money at their disposal because they are in a more prosperous area or adjacent to a big town.</P>
    <P>In recent years great progress has been made in regard to farm building schemes.  Farmers are now well aware of the necessity for a modern layout and, with the aid of grants from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, great improvements have been made in farmyards throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Many farmers in my area find it difficult to get a supply of water from a public scheme particularly from a regional or group scheme because the powers-that-be are anxious to conserve the water supply for domestic purposes. As the Minister knows, it is impossible to produce quality milk without an adequate supply of running water.  This is something which is causing anxiety. There are group water schemes but some of them are on the shelf for a long time and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will not make a grant available for a private water supply where a group scheme is in the offing.  I hope the Minister will re-examine this question.</P>
    <P>In regard to the land project grant, some progress has been made but a lot of work remains to be done under this heading.  There is still much land in this country that could be reclaimed and brought back to fertility.  There is the problem that in many cases the <Col N="355" /> Department inspectors will not give grants where there is not sufficient outlet for the drainage of land.  This is not the fault of the farming community; it is because rivers and streams are choked and are flooding fertile land and farmers generally are most concerned about this matter.  Progress under this scheme is being held up.  There are acres of land in my constituency not qualifying for a land project grant because of this situation.  Whether it be by the Board of Works or by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, this problem must be tackled if we are to bring the maximum amount of land into production.  It could mean the difference between an economic and uneconomic holding in many areas if farmers were able to avail of the benefits of this scheme.  I am quite prepared to concede that progress has been made but much more progress could be made if the problem were seriously tackled.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend very highly the lime and fertiliser scheme and would be glad to add my voice to any other speaker who would encourage the farming community to avail of this scheme.  In recent years the farming community have become aware of the advantages of liming and fertilising their lands and the ground limestone scheme, which was introduced during the period of office of an inter-Party Government, has proved of much benefit. However, it is still difficult to get some farmers to realise the advantages of liming and fertilising their land and this should be pushed further by the agricultural advisory service.  I know this service is working at full stretch, but certainly in Cork we have not a sufficient number of agricultural instructors to do the work.  Macra na Feirme and other organisations are playing an important part in educating the young farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>My one complaint regarding the land project and the farm buildings scheme is that there seems to be much duplication.  When a farmer is availing of grants under both those schemes it should be possible to devise some method whereby one inspector in an area would be in charge of both <Col N="356" /> schemes combined as one service operated by one official.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate a sum is provided in relation to the eradication of disease in animals.  During the debate on the last annual Estimate for the Minister's Department, I remember bringing to the Minister's notice what I considered a most important aspect.  Throughout the country there are a number of firms who have made a good living out of the collection of dead animals.  This is quite legitimate, but there should be some control.  At the moment the dead animals are dumped in depots and the carcases are redistributed throughout the country as dog meat and in my opinion this is responsible in no small way for the spread of disease.  The situation exists where we have lorries touring the country collecting dead animals, which might have died from any kind of contagious disease.  They are dumped in the depots, the hides are removed and the carcases redistributed throughout the country.  I know of one case where the depot was, in fact, a field and the carcases were dumped and left there for a week or fortnight before being redistributed.  Strict control should be exercised and the Minister might perhaps seriously consider the situation, because it is doing much damage to the cattle industry here.</P>
    <P>So far as brucellosis is concerned, the position obtains that cattle suffering from this disease are being offered for sale in public marts throughout the country.  This practice is more prevalent at the moment than the Minister would accept.  When there is an outbreak in an area, unfortunately there is not any effort made to try to prevent the disease from spreading.  If we are to succeed in checking this disease the matter must be tackled with the utmost vigour.  It is causing an enormous loss to the farming community, particularly to the dairy farmers.  Having brought this to the attention of the Minister, I hope he will take some steps to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>The bovine tuberculosis scheme has been in operation for quite some time. Having regard to the amount of money provided by way of Supplementary Estimate &mdash; £1,685,000 &mdash; under this heading, it occurs to me to wonder whether this scheme is a success.  Is <Col N="357" /> the reason for the extra amount the fact that there have been a number of breakdowns in herds throughout the country?  I believe this is so and that, for some unknown reason, there has been in certain areas a serious breakdown in a number of herds.  I should like the Minister to comment on this. The compensation paid by the Department is not adequate, in my opinion, in the light of present day costs.  The Department pays market value only. It should be replacement value because, when there is a serious breakdown in some herds, it is almost impossible for the herdowner to replace the number of stock slaughtered.  The Minister should consider raising the ceiling.  I have known cases in which as many as 22 to 23 dairy cows went down.  It is impossible to replace that number without financial assistance of some kind.</P>
    <P>Money is provided for silage harvesting. This is a good scheme.  Because it is operated by the county committees of agriculture it has made great progress. The feeding value of silage is now being realised and I am not surprised that there is this increase this year. Silage can be made in almost any kind of weather and haymaking is now becoming obsolete because farmers are going into silage in a big way.  There is a big difference between good silage and bad silage.  This is an area in which the agricultural advisory services, Macra and other bodies can play a very big part.  There are classes and there are lectures.</P>
    <P>With regard to pigs and bacon, the rearing and fattening of pigs should be made more financially advantageous for the small farmer.  The trend today is towards pig production in big co-ops. Not so many years ago the small farmer played an important part in pig rearing and pig production was an important part of the income of the dairy farmer.  The small farmer today cannot compete with the big combines. I believe the small farmer is not getting his fair share of this industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the marketing of our bacon and pig products, there are international markets available to us, but our biggest market still remains Great Britain.  An intensification of progeny testing is most desirable in order to produce <Col N="358" /> the kind of pig that will command the best price and give the best return. Do we, I wonder, avail of the British market to its fullest extent?  I have spent some time in London and I have met a great many Irish people there; I suppose there is at least three-quarters of a million Irish people, or people with Irish backgrounds, living and working in and around London.  I have had complaints that these people can never get Irish bacon, Irish eggs and Irish butter.  Probably there is not enough advertising and not a sufficient display of Irish products.  The market is enormous but it has not been properly exploited.</P>
    <P>Will we have to produce a lighter type of pig for the European market? I am somewhat concerned about this. Progeny testing will ensure the best type of sow and boar, but very little progress is being made in this respect. People do not seem to appreciate how important and vital it is to the industry to have the best quality pig it is possible to produce.</P>
    <P>The sow subsidy scheme is excellent as far as it goes.  It provides an inducement to increased pig production. There is one pig problem.  This scheme extends over the 12 western counties and County Cork.  The latter is divided into two on the basis of district electoral divisions.  Whoever drew the boundary in Cork had no conception of the kind of farming that goes on there.  In one area the farmer included in the scheme has much better land than have other farmers who are excluded.  The area is divided by a road.  I should like the boundaries to be redrawn.  Indeed, the scheme should be extended to the entire county.  It is a necessary scheme which should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We are discussing a Supplementary Estimate which includes the sheep subsidy. We are all aware that there has been a serious decline over the past few years in the number of sheep in this country.  This problem should be tackled.  I have reason to doubt the statements made that the subsidy has increased the mountain-sheep population. The subsidy is a great help to sheep-farmers.  The value of sheep has dropped because of the fall in wool <Col N="359" /> prices.  The Minister could possibly consider the extension of this scheme to inland sheep.  The control of diseases, particularly liver fluke, should also be considered.  The Department of Agriculture circulated a very informative leaflet on this disease at one time.  This disease is causing a considerable amount of damage to sheep flocks throughout the country, particularly in southern areas.  People have not the necessary information on the treatment of this disease.  The Department of Agriculture should try to help sheep owners by giving them information on the control of this disease.</P>
    <P>The most important item in the Supplementary Estimate is that dealing with milk production allowances and marketing of dairy products, including grants-in-aid.  The sum of £4,061,000 is a big amount.  The dairying industry is the foundation stone of the agricultural industry.  It provides the cattle, the milk and the dairy products.  This industry is at a cross-roads at the moment.  I am glad to say that I see more co-operation and discussion now between the Minister and the various farming interests than there used to be.  This is a step in the right direction. The relationship between the Department and the farming community was not very satisfactory.  I hope there will be consultation and discussion in the future particularly in so far as the dairying industry is concerned because this industry plays a very important part in the economy of the country.  It was never more imperative than now that the farming organisations, the officials of the Department and the Minister should co-operate in an effort to encourage efficiency in every way possible in the dairying industry.  An effort must be made to gear the farming community to meet the challenge they will inevitably meet when we enter the EEC.  Great strides have been made in the past few years in the production of milk.  There are 110,000 farmers engaged in milk production.  In the 70s we must have top-quality milk at every level.  This presents a challenge. Every encouragement should be given to achieve this objective.  It should be the aim of the Department and of the 110,000 milk-producing farmers to <Col N="360" /> provide top-quality milk, whether it is to be used for butter or other products, and whether it is to be sold on the home market or on export markets. Bad quality production is bad for all markets.  Bad quality dairy products do not travel well.  All milk producers should aim at qualifying for the quality-bonus given by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on those who process dairy products&mdash;cheese manufacturers, milk powder manufacturers, chocolate crumb manufacturers&mdash;to present their products in a more sophisticated way than heretofore.  It is very important that products should be presented attractively, particularly in international markets.  The Minister said that the intake of milk for this year will be approximately 550 million gallons.  Every pint of milk over 250 million gallons will be for the export market.  It will, therefore, be appreciated that the aim must be at top-quality production.  The milk producer, the creamery, the processor, the manufacturer, all have a very important part to play.  I hope there will be the fullest co-operation by all concerned from the Minister down to the most humble milk producer.  This is the only way in which we can sell in competition with countries that are ahead of us in marketing and production techniques. There must be full co-operation and top-quality production.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the scaled increases in the price of milk. We are urging on everyone in the farming community at the present time the necessity for more efficient production. The Minister has agreed that this is necessary.  Modern farmyard layout and top-quality milk production are necessary. I believe the scaled increases in the price of milk are a retrograde step. I have mentioned this by way of supplementary question to a question that I put down to the Minister.  The Minister has made the case that it is necessary to give an increase to the small farmers and the small milk producers.  I agree this is necessary.  On 45 acres of land, by specialising in milk production, one could produce over 20,000 gallons of milk per year.  This would result in a reduction in price even though a man had become very efficient.  This is a <Col N="361" /> retrograde step in respect of which I wish to condemn the Minister.  There was no prior consultation or discussion with the farming community or with the people who were to administer the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am informed that officials of his Department received a deputation from the ICMSA, the NFA, the IAOS, the Creamery Managers Association and the Cream Exporters Association and every one of them objected to the phased increase in the price of milk because it was bound to militate against efficiency.  This also was my objection to it.</P>
    <P>All along the line milk producers were encouraged to become efficient. Some of them not only became very efficient but became experts.  It was a specialisation job where, first of all, the basic requirement was the liming and fertilising of the land at considerable cost as well as the improvement of the farmyard and the introduction of the milking parlour, at a cost of thousands of pounds.  When they became efficient in the production of quality and quantity milk this phased increase penalised them.  I do not accept the Minister's figure that only 2½ per cent of the milk producers are affected by this increase.  The Minister is confused between the big farmer and the big milk producer because the big milk producer is not necessarily the big farmer.  The big milk producer could well be the man who has specialised completely, who has gone out of every other line in agricultural production and specialised in milk. As a result of becoming efficient he has been penalised.  Every one of the people I have mentioned has stated publicly that they are in disagreement with the phased increase.  It is a shame that the Minister did not have the courtesy to discuss this with the people concerned before introducing it.  It is a pity that there were no discussions with the Irish Creamery Managers Association. Indeed, a certain amount of confusion still exists as far as this increase is concerned.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of the creamery structure, to which the Minister referred, is necessary but I cannot understand how it takes so long before a <Col N="362" /> decision can be made as to whether a certain creamery will be accepted or amalgamated with a group of creameries.  I have seen this in my own area.  Recently, in reply to a Parliamentary question, the Minister said&mdash; if I am misquoting him he can correct me&mdash;that he is to set up a study group to examine rationalisation from the social aspect.  This may be all right but we have seen so many reports on this aspect of the dairying industry that the people are sick to death of them.  We had the American experts who cost the taxpayer an enormous amount, who devoted months to examining the creamery structure, and then reported back but no action was taken.  Whatever the reason for the stalling tactics, the Minister has now decided to set up this other study group.  This is ludicrous.  I should like to ask him, if there is an increase of twopence to threepence a gallon on milk in an area where there will be amalgamation, what value does he put on the social aspect of that?  I can see, as a result of vested interests, pressure being put on public representatives, on Deputies and on the Minister.  There are some people who might be disturbed in their soft jobs if amalgamation takes place.  These are the vested interests who are using influence to stop this amalgamation.</P>
    <P>Amalgamation and rationalisation should proceed where the benefit can be clearly shown to go to the farming community, the milk producers, so that they will get a better price for their milk.  If the Minister was satisfied with this he would have the full backing of the farming community.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to speak.  This is a very important matter and it is something that will play an important part in the dairying industry.  As I was saying before I was interrupted, where it can be clearly shown that the benefits will go to the creamery managers and the creamery workers, rationalisation is something that should proceed without delay.  The Department, and particularly the Minister, should not be stalled by vested interests.</P>

      <P>This is something with which the Minister should concern himself. The small creameries in the outlying areas can no longer provide the services which the bigger co-ops and the bigger creameries can provide for the farming community.  For that reason the matter should be examined and more progress made.  Earlier I was dealing with marketing and the management of dairying produce and I pointed out how imperative it is to produce top-quality milk.  I am informed by a concern in Cork county that in the United States there is an unlimited market for cheese if we can produce quality skim milk.  I am told that the market is such that even one of the biggest creameries in the south, with all their skim milk, could not supply it.  It has to be top-quality skim milk.</P>
      <P>Recently I read an article by the managing director of An Bord Bainne and I was very impressed by it.  He claimed that in Japan there is a market for cheese.  This is something we should be doing our utmost to get&mdash;our share in any available market.  If we have to export approximately 47,000 tons of butter in the coming year we will be exporting a commodity that in my opinion is overproduced, particularly in the EEC countries.  We should be giving every encouragement to diversification from milk production.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the beef scheme. There is a strong case for increasing the grants in the scheme.  Our farmers are very slow to change, particularly when they have invested in a big way in one line of production, and the inducement must be very attractive before they will change.  If milk is being overproduced, particularly in the EEC, it is an indication that it is necessary to give a greater inducement to change from milk to beef production.</P>
      <P>A recent report from the Agricultural Institute appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> of Thursday, November 6th.  It states that the average income of the Irish farmer is £465 and that this is not enough to pay a decent wage to an agricultural worker.  It goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report shows that the average <Col N="364" /> family income from farms which fall into the category 5-15 acres is £127 a year; the income from those of 15-30 acres is £202; from 30-50 acres, £408, ...</P>
    <P>This is an alarming situation in the 1970s.  The average income of a farmer is £465, which is not sufficient to pay an agricultural worker.  Where milk production is not economic, particularly in remote areas and in the case of small farmers who are not geared for it, encouragement should be given to diversify and go into some other line of production and get away from milk production if it is not paying.</P>
    <P>I said I would be brief.  I will reserve my comments for the main Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate covers a wide variety of headings and consequently it is quite in order for any Deputy to address himself to many aspects of farming activity.  I was impressed by the concluding paragraph of the Minister's statement.  The first sentence of his last paragraph was:</P>
      <P>Finally, I would mention that, thanks to sound policies, agriculture has now had three consecutive good years marked by substantial increases in agricultural output, prices and incomes.</P>
      <P>My view is that we are very fortunate at present that cattle prices are so good.  Let us hope that this continues in the future.  Some people may say that prices are far below the prices obtaining in EEC countries but, by our standards, we must all agree that the good prices obtaining for cattle are helpful not only to the farming community but also to the general economy of the country.  I suppose it is natural for a Government or a Minister to take credit for such a position obtaining but I am sure the Irish people are not so gullible that they will swallow that statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> The Minister in his statement has given pride of place to milk prices and subsidies.  I think he was correct in doing so.  Milk prices are exceptionally important to the vast majority of Irish farmers because down through the years we have encouraged a system of dairy farming here and as a result, particularly in the province of Munster or the southern half of the country, the monthly milk cheque is the main source of income.  We have acknowledged in the past and we continue to acknowledge that the farming community are entitled to a fair return for their work. It is acknowledged by the Government that the farming community have not been getting that fair return in recent years, particularly the small farmers, many of whom have uneconomic holdings. Much play has been made here in debates about the income level of such farmers.  The Government recognised the justification for the pleas made by those of us who speak on behalf of the small farmers when, in order to help them and tide them over their difficulties, they brought in that commendable scheme of allowing small farmers social welfare benefit to help them to attain a reasonable standard of living.  In so doing they acknowledged the fact that it was impossible for such people to live on the incomes from their farms alone.  This scheme enables a number of farmers, who otherwise would have difficulty in continuing on in their holdings and who would possibly have to emigrate, to remain in them, even if it is at a low standard of living, as it is for some of them.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the scheme is not applicable to the congested districts only because in its amended form it now operates throughout the year and helps the small farmer with limited valuation, particularly the man with the young family.  I have stressed again and again the need for such schemes.</P>
    <P>Most small farmers should be part-time farmers only and there should be ways and means of supplementing their farm income with employment, even on a seasonal basis, in some industrial concern located in their own area. This is now agreed by everybody.  It applies particularly to the west coast. <Col N="367" /> Somebody may say after me, and possibly with some justification, that handouts are no remedy, but we must face the situation as it is.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on facing up to the situation that the small farmers were not able to continue in existence without something like this scheme I have referred to. They have as much right to strike as some of the other people who strike. It was essential to formulate this policy which enables those people to supplement their incomes with help directly from central funds.</P>
    <P>My reason for stressing this is to indicate to the House that the Government have accepted the contention made here in the 1960s that something should be done to help those people. The Minister told us of the helps and supports given to milk in the 1960s. He told us that the sum available from the Exchequer this year, directly and indirectly, will be in the region of £31 million of which more than £20 million will be paid directly to the creameries. He also told us that every gallon of milk which reaches the creameries costs the taxpayer 1s 2d.  A sum of 1s 2d a gallon is a formidable figure.  If we start calculating at 600 gallons per cow, which is the figure now deemed to be the national average, at 1s 2d per gallon we will get something in the region of £35 per cow received from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We have to examine both sides of this case properly.  It is quite evident to us that the number of cows supplying creameries must be reduced by one means or another because it is impossible to continue to have that heavy load on our public funds in a country with a limited population and limited resources.  Some alternative system must be devised.  Here, we are told, is the reason we want cows: without cows you cannot have calves, and without calves you cannot have stores and beef to help in the export market and to help our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>This booklet, <i>Bainne,</i> came into my hands this morning.  There is a very interesting article in it by Mr. McGough.  I am taking up the time of the House with this article because <Col N="368" /> I maintain the Government were very shortsighted in their policy in past years: in 1960 they had no idea in what position we would find ourselves in 1965, never mind 1970.  It is one of the qualifications required of Government to try to see as far as possible into the future.  Mark you, during the past ten years there was no major disturbance of an unforeseen nature in this country.  Here was our position, as stated by Mr. McGough:</P>
    <P>In the first half of the decade the main concern was to ensure that there was sufficient milk to keep the supplies of butter available for the newly-launched &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; national brand in Britain.  Milk for dairy products other than butter was carefully allocated, and the expanding aspects of the industry had to be catered for milk-wise.</P>
    <P>He goes on further to state:</P>
    <P>In the second half of the decade, with the vastly increased quantities of milk, the whole pattern of production, processing and marketing changed.  In this period of achievement, many of our factories expanded capacity and many new factories were opened, particularly for cheese milk powder.  The impressive lists of awards for Irish dairy produce at the Royal International Dairy Shows of 1968 and 1969 are proof of the success of the programme of expansion.</P>
    <P>The Minister may smile at this.  I am not taking patches out of it.  I want to set it all on the records.  The article also states:</P>
    <P>1966 marked the end of the honeymoon.</P>
    <P>Apparently we all thought the honeymoon was going to last a good deal longer, but in 1966 the marriage appeared to break up so far as the export of Irish dairy produce was concerned.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>Once we reached the limit of market availability for dairy products other than butter, our surplus of milk had to go into butter for which there was no ready market.</P>
    <P>We reached a stage then in 1966, according to Mr. McGough, and I am sure he had more time to look up <Col N="369" /> details than I have, when there was no ready market.  When there was no ready market, we had to sell it abroad.</P>
    <P>Further down in the statement we are told that the only market where the price improved in 1969 was the British market where we got, according to the figures of the Bord Bainne managing director, 3s 3½d per lb for butter.  One-third of our total milk subvention included in this Estimate goes to this organisation for export.</P>
    <P>It is further stated in the article that there are mountains of butter available in the EEC.  I should like an explanation from the Minister about how he can be so positive that milk prices will be higher in the EEC in the late seventies and early eighties when, according to this statement, they have mountains of butter at their disposal, which they are trying to sell to any market at what is termed giveaway prices.  That expression is the very same as that used in the Minister's statement.  Apparently, we are trying to get markets in places like the West Indies and we are giving them butter at what is termed, by both the Minister and the managing director of An Bord Bainne, giveaway prices because it is inadvisable to store it and storage costs £75 per ton per year.</P>
    <P>I realise that we require money to flow into this country to help our balance of payments position but I cannot see why we should give butter away for next to nothing to the West Indies or, indeed, any other country. We are travelling the world to sell our butter at giveaway prices but I cannot see why we do not give it to our own people.  Many people in this country could eat more butter than they are eating at the present time.  The price of butter is high in this country because it is based on the price paid by the State for milk.  Many families would be only too pleased to get a reduction of 1s 6d or 2s 6d per lb in the price of butter.  Such a reduction would help the farming community and it would also stop large stocks of butter accumulating which, according to all the reports, including the Minister's, have to be given away to foreign markets.</P>
    <P>It is quite all right to give butter <Col N="370" /> for nothing to a country which has difficulties such as Nigeria but to transport it across the world and give it to people for next to nothing is ridiculous.  The surplus which we now have should bring about the re-introduction of a subsidy for home consumption.  I think we should help ourselves for a change. People in the lower income group would welcome the opportunity to eat more butter.  The only objection to the re-introduction of the subsidy would be that the higher income group would also be able to get butter at a reduced price but, unfortunately, we are told that that type of person is no longer eating much butter.  According to Mr. Maher, president of the NFA, the affluent people in this country are watching their figures so much that they are no longer eating butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There cannot be much affluence between the Deputy and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case then these people would not make a great impact on this type of subsidy.  The surplus milk question is a very difficult one for the Minister.  No matter what the milk is turned into, whether it is butter or any kind of by-product, markets are no longer available at any kind of an economic price and the position is likely to get worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note, as I am sure every Deputy is, that 36,000 herdowners have applied for subvention under the beef incentive bonus scheme. At present it is £12 per cow, but the Cork County Committee of Agriculture has recommended that it be increased to £20 per cow.  I think that suggestion is justified because we found earlier in our calculations that the subvention at an average yield of 600 gallons is at least £35 per cow whose milk is taken to the creamery.  That would mean a saving of £15 per cow according to my way of calculating it.  As well as that, the calves would be under the cows and everyone knows that calves under cows are much better than calves fed from the bucket and then out in the field on grass.  This would result in a double advantage.  It is accepted that the meat from calves fed on new milk in their early days is better and more saleable <Col N="371" /> than the meat from calves fed in the traditional style.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we close shop in faraway places such as the West Indies and Japan.  We must recognise that for some time to come we are going to have a butter surplus.  The fact must be accepted that it is inadvisable to store that butter in the hope that prices will increase in Britain or in any other country.  We must admit the fact that we are in a difficult position.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I am suggesting that we should reduce the price of butter here.  That will take a share of the surplus and our own people will benefit.  Taxation will be necessary to meet that, but money will have to be found&mdash;and is included in the £31 million&mdash;to send butter to the West Indies or any other place.  I am not casting any aspersions on any of these people.  They are quite entitled to buy their butter as cheaply as possible. When there is a surplus, they are quite entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very enterprising Cork farmer who went out to the West Indies and created a market for Irish butter there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told by the managing director of Bord Bainne and by the Minister that you can do no better, irrespective of your qualifications as a salesman, than to get what are termed giveaway prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in the Minister's part of the country, Ulster, and in Connaught and North Leinster, possibly as a result of the calved heifer scheme, became creamery-orientated.  We must try to redirect them towards dry cattle.  I understand that was the general pattern in Ulster, Connaught and North Leinster.  We must try to get them back to the position they were in before the calved heifer scheme came into operation. There were buyers in West Cork fairs from the midlands and they were very helpful.  They bought a great many stores and created competition but, of late, the pattern has changed and too many of these people have gone into milk production.  This is a free country and every farmer is entitled to stay in milk production if he so wishes, or to <Col N="372" /> leave it if he thinks he can do better by adopting another course.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to accept this recommendation, which had the unanimous approval of all parties in the Cork Committee of Agriculture, to increase the subsidy of £12 to £20 per cow.  If he does.  I am sure when he comes back to the House this figure of £36,000 will be greatly increased and will, therefore, be helpful in regard to cattle exports and also to the Exchequer.  If that happens, and if we get back to a position where the butter surplus is considerably reduced, it will be quite in order for the Minister to say: &ldquo;We have rectified the position.  We are back to normal again. We can find markets at reasonable prices for any surplus we have and consequently the subsidisation of butter can be reviewed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that for ever more we should be asked to subsidise butter prices.  I am putting this forward as a temporary measure, while this difficulty continues and, when the difficulty is resolved, or when the position has eased, it would be quite in order for whatever Government are in power to come to the House and say: &ldquo;We now have to change back again.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am quite serious about this.  I do not accept what Deputy Creed had to say a while ago about the scaled milk prices.  I think this is a good idea and I claim that I mentioned it in the House years and years ago.  The idea was to help the small farmers and having milk prices phased as they are at present does that. There is no doubt about that.  If we are to accept the figure here, and I readily accept it, of a subvention of 1s 2d, the man with the big number of cows, with modern equipment and with a high output of milk to my mind would be rather too costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the difficulty.  We are trying to cut down the production of milk.  Of course, if prices are attractive to the big man whose output is <Col N="373" /> well over three figures per day, this creates a difficulty.  There is no use in talking about mistakes which were made in the past.  I am trying to settle the milk question.  I am trying to be fair to everybody.  This is a formidable problem for any man in charge of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am satisfied that the scale up to 7,000 gallons per year will be generally beneficial to the small farmer. We must accept the Minister's stateon that scale is 80.  Producers supplying between 7,000 to 14,000 gallons receive a reduced rate.  I think the reduction is 2d.</P>
      <P>In the local creameries at home, for milk with a three per cent butter fat content, the man with less than 7,000 gallons, not counting the quality bonus, gets ls 10.9d, almost 1s 11d, a gallon. Costs have increased and 1s 11d, even with the addition of the quality bonus, is not a high price to give such a man for milk.  His costs must be much higher than those of the man who is geared to produce 150, 200 or 250 gallons per day.  We like to see all sections of our people getting justice.  The fact that 2½ per cent of our farmers are producing milk to an extent greater than 20,000 gallons per year may be a justification for giving them a smaller share per gallon of the funds available.</P>

      <P>Money does not grow on trees.  It is not picked up off the ground.  It has to come from people's pockets.  I have had phased milk prices in mind down through the years.  I mentioned it here time and again.  Since the Minister introduced it, and since I first read of it, I have been in agreement that it helps to give the smaller man a bigger slice of the national cake.  I do not accept Deputy Creed's contention that it hinders the progressive farmer. It certainly does not.  If a farmer is producing 6,000 or 7,000 gallons and then produces a few thousand more &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he will gain from it.  I do not think there is any drawback <Col N="374" /> in increasing output.  There is no necessity to comment further on pages 1 to 4 of this report.  There is a problem. We have to meet people who tell us they were advised to improve their stalls, to change the name to cowbyres, then to milk parlours, and that they have gone to a great deal of expense to provide equipment to gear themselves for dairy farming and milk production.  Some of them undoubtedly have grounds for disappointment, but the other side of the picture must be examined.  I should like to see some further improvement in milk prices, particularly for those producing under 14,000 gallons.  At the present time there are other groups and organisations all stretching out their hands and some of them forcibly looking for more from the public purse.  If it is right for them to stretch out their hands and demand more, it is equally right for the farming community to stretch out their hands and demand an increase in their standards.  The only way they can get an increase in their standards is by getting improvements in milk prices, in the beef incentive bonus and other schemes.  If you do not do that in this country you will be forgotten. There are other small sections who are not organised and who are being wiped out.  Take the small shopkeeper; he is being trampled on at the present time. I hope the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, and his very capable assistant, Deputy Gerry Cronin, who is sitting behind him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I must say the Parliamentary Secretary does that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Creed referred to the rationalisation of creameries.  I do not intend to dwell on that, but undoubtedly there must be rationalisation in the seventies.  I hope this commission or board will report on this aspect at <Col N="375" /> an early date.  I can see difficulties for creameries in this way, that the small units are mainly economic ones because of the shops that go with them. To have customers coming along every morning is very helpful, but the position must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the pig and bacon industry, and if I were not so interested I do not think I would have the privilege of addressing the House today.  In our part of the country, West Cork, we have been mindful of the advantages of pig rearing and pig production. I am surprised that, despite our agricultural advisory service, despite so many leaflets from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries we have not got across to our small farmers the advantage of keeping sows and bonhams and rearing as many pigs as possible.  We must continue our efforts.  I mentioned in previous debates the undesirability of having big pig fattening units and big sow stations.  I found just a while ago in reading this that our factories are only turning over with 60 per cent of output and they may make the case: &ldquo;We are not getting our supply of pigs regularly and we should change over and do with pigs what we did with the hens some eight or nine years ago.&rdquo; Everyone knows what happened to the hens since that change occurred.  Grants should not be made available that will entice big concerns such as co-operative or independent groups or big farmers to go in for pig rearing on a four-figure scale.  If that happens in time to come&mdash; and we must all try to look ahead&mdash;the market will be glutted and it is possible that the pigs and bacon industry will be in the same position as the milk industry.  An effort must be made to keep that industry to the small man, the farmer around the country, to advise him that it is in his own interest to keep more sows and bonhams and rear more pigs.  I am hoping that the £300 bonus scheme will improve the position, that more and more farmers will avail of that scheme and, in availing of it, that they will indicate their intentions of increasing their sow or pig numbers.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to read that the <Col N="376" /> Minister is quite satisfied with the number of applicants for the scheme which I think he sets down at 6,000.  We were also surprised to learn at the County Cork Committee of Agriculture that many farmers were not too anxious to avail of the scheme.  I do not know whether this was due to lack of explanation or some other reason.  In South-West Cork we have been agitating and fighting for a bacon processing plant for many years.  In making that plea again today, I am well aware that the bacon industry has 40 factories widely dispersed throughout the country&mdash;this is quoted in the 1963 report on page one.  South-West Cork provides 11 per cent of pig production.  If we had 11 per cent of the factories there would be at least four situated in that area. Surely, therefore, we are entitled to one factory?  It could not be said that this claim is in any way narrow or parochial.</P>
    <P>The desirability of part-time farming is mentioned in the Minister's statement. In Skibbereen seasonal work is available for farmers which helps to supplement their incomes.  We are not accepting the statement that there are four factories in Cork and that they cannot get enough pigs or that there is a decrease in the number of pigs.  If rural Ireland is to survive, rural Deputies must fight for their own areas.</P>
    <P>It is an accepted fact that the number of persons engaged in agriculture will decrease and it has been mentioned frequently that the decrease will be of the order of from 9,000 to 10,000 persons annually.  Will those people move to some other part of the country or to Birmingham or London?  There must be more industrialisation in rural Ireland and we must continue to fight for this, irrespective of what Government are in power.  This is not a political matter; it is a question of the survival of the people of rural Ireland.  No matter what political affiliations one has, when elected by a rural constituency, particularly in the west of Ireland, one has an obligation to speak out boldly and firmly.</P>
    <P>My two colleagues are listening to me now and I know they agree with me that this is not a political matter <Col N="377" /> nor one from which any of us wish to get personal kudos.  It is a matter of conviction that West Cork is entitled to this pig processing factory and I have no doubt if we get this factory the number of sows, bonhams and pigs will steadily increase.  That is our plea. It must be recognised that the Berehaven Peninsula, the area in which I live, the Mizenhead Peninsula, Kilcrohane Peninsula, Drimoleague, Dunmanway and other parts have suffered extensively through emigration and lack of industrial development.  This was regarded as the forlorn and forsaken part of Ireland.  There were many local groups antagonistic to us, feeling possibly that we were not firm enough in our demands and indicating that we were incapable, as public representatives, of putting forward their view-points in Dáil Éireann and, quite possibly, there was some justification for this.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the present Minister is a reasonable man and I have never said otherwise.  I realise the difficulty he encounters in getting money from the Exchequer.  We all make mistakes: I charged the Minister and his Department with mistakes today but others in the same position might make the same mistakes.  I make a special plea to the Minister because a factory cannot be located in West Cork without his help and assistance.</P>

      <P>The Minister comes from County Donegal which is somewhat similar to West Cork.  He understands farmers and the problems of small farms and in fairness to him I must say he has initiated schemes beneficial to such people.  I know the four Cork factories will try to knife us; they will say: &ldquo;If you give West Cork a factory that is our main channel of supply and we will go out of business&rdquo;. Let them get business elsewhere.  Urban areas are growing rapidly, particularly Dublin, Cork and the larger towns, whereas the reverse is happening in the country districts.  If South-West Cork had this factory, plus the processing factory at Skibbereen, with what is being provided in Deputy Crowley's <Col N="378" /> town and what we expect will be established at Clonakilty, in addition to the tourism we already have, we could build up our community.  We could look forward to the time when the young boys and girls leaving vocational and secondary schools who opt for a skilled trade or local work would have the opportunity of earning their livelihood at home.</P>
      <P>One could ask how can more factories be erected.  I have given the answer and do not want to repeat myself other than to say to the Government and to the Minister: &ldquo;Go easy on grants to large combines for pig production&rdquo;.  If we offer incentives to people who may avail of them with a view to taking over the bacon industry, the position of that industry in the future may be similar to that of the poultry industry today.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about trading with other countries.  We have a bigger trade with Great Britain than we have with anywhere else.  Our cattle trade, both live and dead, together with the 28,000 tons of bacon we export to Britain is very valuable from the point of view of the economy generally.  We all hope this market will continue.  I cannot quite follow the Minister's statement with regard to the EEC.  He says the main benefit for the farmers will be increased prices, especially for cattle and milk, higher output and income. Now we cannot sell to the EEC countries because the tariffs are as high as £55.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any great future for us in the EEC from the point of view of milk and milk products. Bord Bainne have literally mountains of butter and one reads of schemes promoted in the EEC countries to pension off farmers and to slaughter dairy cows in order to reduce milk products.  We will need much more information about the EEC.  I am all in favour of entry provided we benefit.  If Britain enters we will have to enter.  We cannot go on living in isolation in this modern world; we must form some sort of federation with our neighbours.  I hope the Minister will, as he has promised, <Col N="379" /> make a detailed statement on the EEC later.  Many people are looking forward to such a statement because of all the conflicting views.  Some of those who express these views may have quite marked ability but it is evident from the conflict that some of these views must, to put it mildly, be incorrect.</P>
      <P>There is agitation for an extension of the pilot areas and I should like the Minister to make some announcement on the future of these pilot areas.  Is he satisfied with the progress made?  So far as Cork is concerned the prospects are very bright.  I should like an extension of the farm building grants to the 12 western counties.  Proper farm buildings are essential to a healthy agriculture.</P>
      <P>I hope the brucellosis scheme will become more comprehensive and that it will in time be extended to southern Ireland.  I believe, too, that more consideration should be given to the civicspirited farmers who publicise the fact that their cattle have developed brucellosis. We are aware&mdash;it is unfortunate that this should happen&mdash;that some farmers try to dispose of their cows in the public market, or elsewhere, as quickly as possible and we know the dire consequences that can result from that practice.  The co-operative farmers, certainly in Cork, get very little thanks for being co-operative.  The conscienceless farmer must be prevented from disposing of his aborted cattle to prevent other herds being endangered.  We had a figure some years ago of £25 million lost annually because of animal diseases.  We must ensure that every effective step is taken to ensure these losses will not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will the bovine tuberculosis scheme finish?  Big sums are spent testing herds.  There was a general belief that bovine tuberculosis could be wiped out in eight or ten years.  But these tests continue.  When will this expenditure stop?  Is the Minister satisfied effective steps are being taken to bring the scheme to an end?  So much has been expended and so many people have been employed on the scheme that they should be able to tell the Minister now they have finished the job and that all that is necessary is <Col N="380" /> to ensure there will be no contamination from outside sources.  At the moment the scheme seems to be going around in a circle.  It is too costly.  I should like some definite information as to when it is expected the work will be completed or is it to continue <i>in secula seculorum</i>?</P>
    <P>We had a visit from the Parliamentary Secretary to Cork.  We were annoyed with the Minister's lack of attention so we by-passed him and got his Parliamentary Secretary down.  We managed to iron out our difficulties.  I appreciate this is a very important Estimate.  I agree that subventions to agriculture are costing more and more from year to year.  Agriculture is our most important industry.  The income derived from it helps our balance of payments.  It is claimed that almost one-third of our population are working directly in this industry.</P>
    <P>Appreciating the difficulties that arise in arriving at agreements between the Department and the parties represented in this House and the bodies representing agriculture, I think we should have an agricultural sub-committee of this House on which members of different parties could consult together to try to reach agreement on policy formulation for agricultural development. This could apply to other fields as well.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is too important an industry, and the amount it is receiving from the central funds is too much, for it to be thrown in here and tossed about.  Public representatives have no opportunity of discussing agriculture except on this Estimate, and by way of Parliamentary Questions.  While I agree that Deputies are heavily burdened, whether they represent the towns or rural areas, I think we should set up a sub-committee and I am putting that proposal forward for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have covered a very wide field discussing this Supplementary Estimate.  Everything, except fisheries, has been discussed.  When preparing his Estimate for the year the Minister must be guided by the amount of money available to him.  It is common practice now to subsidise various farm produce.  The Minister must decide the best way to divide these subsidies among the farming community. I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the decision to give a greater share of the subsidies to those who work small and medium-sized farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These farmers have a hard job to exist and to face competition at the present time.  I am glad the spokesman on the Labour benches agreed with the Minister's views on that point.  I am surprised my colleague on the Fine Gael benches did not agree with it. The Minister is quite right in channelling greater subsidies to help the small-and medium-sized farms.  It is the duty of every politician to recommend that as many people as possible be employed on the land.  It is well known that cattle prices are buoyant now as we come into the seventies.  Sheep are making great prices.  The prices for pigs are good also.  Many people will tell you that this would have happened anyway.  I do not agree with that opinion.  It has been said that the last three good years brought about this situation.  We have to face fierce competition in world markets now.  We must build up a quota on the British market or elsewhere.  This is not easy to do.  We have to sell the right product and face competition with other countries.  We must congratulate An Bord Bainne and the Pigs and Bacon Commission on the job they have done.  Our agricultural products are commanding very high prices in world <Col N="382" /> markets.  It is the duty of every Deputy to press for the employment of as many as possible on the land.  That is the view of the two major farming organisations.  I am glad the Minister, in the course of his speech, quoted the NFA Year Book, 1962, in which it is stated:</P>
    <P>... all future subventions to agriculture wherever practicable must be applied so as to be of maximum benefit to the smaller farms.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the ICMSA, and especially the late Mr. John Feeley, have always believed in the preservation of the family farm.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked for various amounts.  In discussing these matters I will follow the sequence the Minister followed in his speech.  It is stated here that the milk price support is costing more and more each year.  We all agree on that.  Many people seem to think that that subsidy has increased each year and that it goes directly into the farmers' pockets.  That is not so.  Anybody with any knowledge of the dairying industry will know that the price being paid to the farmers by the processing plants has not increased except by very little over the last 11 years despite the fact that the Government each year are providing more subsidies to keep up the price of milk.  It is obvious that they are also subsidising industry.  They are subsidising the management and the workers in the creameries and in the processing plants. That should not be overlooked in discussing milk prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Exchequer is paying an average of 1s 2d on every gallon of milk delivered to creameries in the current year.  That is a very high price to pay.  It is sad to see so many people turning over to the use of margarine.  This matter must be tackled.  I would appeal to the Minister and his Department to carry out a publicity campaign throughout the country, using the press, radio and television, to bring the facts home to the people.  Many housewives think they are saving money by buying margarine. Do they think of what they are costing the country?  It takes approximately two and a half gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  For every pound of <Col N="383" /> butter the Exchequer is paying 2s 10d or 2s 11d.  If a pound of margarine is bought it means that a pound of butter must be exported at a bad price.  Instead of saving money every pound of margarine bought in the shops is costing the Irish taxpayer 2s 10d or 2s 11d. The Department should pursue a vigorous campaign to bring that point home to everybody in the country.</P>

      <P>So far as prizes in respect of prize bonds are concerned there is no tax liability except where the bonds are in the beneficial ownership of a person or persons carrying on a trade consisting wholly or partly of dealing in securities.

      <P>In the normal case of an individual holding bonds, the prizes would not be chargeable to tax.  If, however, a question is raised by an inspector as to the source of accumulated moneys and he is informed that these are prizes from prize bonds, he is entitled to ask that evidence of this be produced.  This is to ensure that moneys so accumulated are not the result of undisclosed profits or understated income.</P>

      <P>Staff of my Department engaged in telephone engineering work who enter the premises of a firm involved in a trade dispute do so in order to install or maintain apparatus which is the property of the Department, and part of the public telephone service network.

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he is suggesting in his reply that it is the practice as regards pickets in Ireland that they are passed by everybody other than workers who would engage in the work which itself is in dispute?  It is my understanding that attempts to deliver material to a firm are normally a matter for picketing and the normal practice is that the picket is not passed. Is the Minister suggesting that a picket should keep out only those who would do the work of the men on strike and that everybody else should normally pass the picket?  That seems to be what the Minister is implying.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was advocating that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the National Dairying Council should carry out a more aggressive publicity campaign to popularise <Col N="399" /> the consumption of milk, butter and cheese on the home market.  It is my contention that there is a lot of leeway to be made up here and I am very disappointed there has not been better progress made.  It is a sad commentary indeed that you can travel to most of the towns in Ireland and you cannot get a good, clean pint of milk.  In my opinion there is nothing more nutritious than a drink of clean milk.  Long ago milk bars should have been established in all our towns.</P>
      <P>We have to realise that there is in this country at the moment a large number of hotels, most of which have been built in the last ten or 15 years with very considerable State aid.  They should be encouraged to play their part in popularising the drinking of milk and the eating of cheese in their hotels. There are very few hotels which present cheese on the table.  There is no apology to be made for asking them to do that, because thousands of pounds of State money were poured into them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been under fire of late in regard to the proposed changes in the milk price structure.  It is obvious to anybody connected with the industry that the Minister is working in the right direction.  As I said at the outset, he is working to help the small and the medium sized farms.  It is ridiculous to say that the milk producers are victimised.  I know it can be said that perhaps a small farmer with 35 to 50 acres can now produce 20,000 or 25,000 gallons of milk and that the price will be cut as his production increases. In the main those farmers carry their calves to the mart and sell them straight away when they are no more than a day or two old.  They are in a position to pull back a bit if they want to gain the full price and they are also in the position that they can rear some of their own stock.  The Minister, in my opinion, is working in the right direction and the thanks of the small farmers of this country are due to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the beef incentive bonus.  This is something I consider very welcome.  At the outset <Col N="400" /> £8 was allowed for each animal, but this has since been increased to £12. As time goes on, further increases will be called for.  As a result of this scheme it is obvious that many people who would otherwise have gone into milk production stayed as they were and continued producing beef.  The incentive of £8 was considered very low at the start but, as I said, it has now been increased to £12.  I would recommend to the Minister that he would think of increasing that further to £16 or £20. After all, is it not better value to have a cow or a heifer producing under the beef incentive scheme than to have them producing milk for creameries at the subsidy of 1s 2d per gallon?  Cows producing 600 gallons will be costing the Exchequer £35 each per annum. Even if the Minister increased the beef incentive bonus to £20, there is still a saving of approximately £15 per animal.</P>
    <P>This is a great scheme because the bigger man will be inclined to produce more beef.  There are people with up to 100 cows who are still complaining about the price of milk.  Of course, they will complain more now with the sliding scale; but surely to goodness the time has come to make some effort to stop people going on increasing their herds?  If you take the man with a 100-cow herd, each cow producing 600 gallons, he was getting in subsidy alone approximately £3,500 per annum.  That could not continue in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is now the sow incentive scheme which applies throughout the country but mainly in the west.  Strange to note, it takes in only a portion of County Cork.  I do not know who drew the line in regard to Cork.  I have been informed that it was not the Department of Agriculture, but another Government Department for another purpose in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it was the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the case.  There are people with land valuations of £8 to £15 and there is no <Col N="401" /> £10 sow subsidy to support them.  If the Minister were to extend the scheme to valuations of £40 and £50, and maybe to a larger number of sows, he would probably be working in a better direction. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that suggestion because as I see it our pig numbers are on the increase.  Previously we were working on what was known as the four-year cycle.  The number of pigs was allowed to build up for three or four years and then there was a drop and the cycle had to start again.  We are living in a different world now and when the farmers have built up their sow herds and pig herds I am sure the Pigs and Bacon Commission will be able to sell the produce on the world market at a remunerative price.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Dairy Disposal Company moving into the western counties.  There would be nothing wrong in their moving in and erecting fattening stations.  They could then lease the slips and the gilts to the farmers and buy the bonhams at a very good price and fatten them.  Such a scheme would help greatly to popularise rearing of bonhams and pig fattening in the west.  When describing the size of a farm we say that it is 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 or 80 acres but we should not forget that with every farm there is a yard which could be used for rearing bonhams.  When considering what it would take to maintain a farmer the farmyard should be reckoned.  There are grants for everything that one might wish to do around the farmyard.  The Dairy Disposal Company could play a great part in advising on the type of animal that should be bred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Supplementary Estimate of £47,000 for the prevention of disease in livestock. There are many schemes such as the brucellosis eradication scheme, but we all know the set-up in marts throughout the country.  It is ridiculous to bring calf heifers to marts in the same lorry or sell them in the same ring as cattle which have aborted have been brought or sold only a couple of hours previously.  The Department should discuss this problem with mart owners.  It is not an easy problem to solve but an incentive should be given to the marts to solve the problem.  It <Col N="402" /> is a waste to vote money for the prevention of disease when elementary precautions are not being taken.</P>
    <P>The BTE scheme has been in operation for a long time.  Deputy Murphy asked the Minister when it would end. It is obvious that there are fewer herds affected now than there were three or four years ago.  It must be remembered that a herd which was cleared a few years ago has no immunity.  Once a carrier is present in that herd the disease goes through the whole herd like wild-fire. It is not uncommon to see a farmer having to sell 40 to 50 of his cows because they are reactors.  This is a strong reason why the price of reactors should be increased because everyone knows that farmers are doing their best to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the sow incentive scheme I forgot to mention one matter. It used to be the case that an inspector who called to a farm and saw only one or two bonhams with the sow was inclined to turn his head and walk away but I believe it is now the policy of the Department to allow all claims in such cases.  It was bad enough that the sow had only one or two bonhams but to deny the farmer the grant made matters worse.  The farmer will keep the sow and maybe next time it will produce ten, 11 or 12 bonhams.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which I should like to discuss on this Supplementary Estimate but which I will leave until the main Estimate is before us.  I would, however, like to say how glad I am to see that the Minister is having pre-Budget discussions with the various farming organisations.  That is the way it should be.  We are living in an age in which everyone has to respect the next man's point of view.  I hope the good relations now being established between the Minister and the farming organisations will continue to improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to continue the Cork accent which appears to be prevalent here today.  I suppose that is only right and proper because Cork is the largest county in Ireland and the best agriculturalists come from there. The Department of Agriculture is the most important Government Department as it represents our most important <Col N="403" /> industry.  I should like to pay tribute to the officials of the Department who down through the years have worked with various Governments and have had to cut their cloth according to the measure provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Department should be able to give a long-range forecast of what the farming community should produce.  It is very important that farmers should know what will be in demand next year and in five years.  A team should be set up in the Department of Agriculture to forecast for the benefit of farmers market trends, not only in this country but in the countries to which we export.  We have in the Department people with the ability to forecast market trends.  We have in the Department men of experience whose sole duty it should be to forecast for the producing farmers what will be in demand not only next year but in the years to come.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this.  It is very important.  We realise its importance when we consider that a few years ago stock raisers in the west of Ireland who had no milk production tradition were asked to produce milk at a time when the farmers knew that, not only in Ireland but in the Continent of Europe and in America, there was a surplus of dairy products.  This was money thrown down the drain.  We are now trying to retrieve the position with this beef incentive grant.  We are trying to get these people to go back to what they produced traditionally.  It is our duty in this Parliament to look for subsidies if we think they are needed, but it is also our duty to curtail any wasteful expenditure.  We recognise that fact.  The agricultural community recognise the fact that, while we want subsidies to help us to compete, we must also keep costs down as far as we possibly can.  We want to cut out wasteful and extravagant expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear to everybody that we are now producing a surplus of milk and milk products and that when we started to diversify, we were a bit too late.  We should have started years <Col N="404" /> ago.  We were a butter producing country and the creameries went on producing it even when it was quite apparent that there was no market for it.  Other speakers have referred to the fact that we export butter not only to Europe but to Africa and the Middle East. I have been informed that we are sending butter to North Africa at 1/-per lb. and that that butter is tested in laboratories over there and, if it has more than a specified bacteria level, it is sent back again.  I think that is true.  If it is not, it can be refuted.</P>
    <P>We are importing millions of pounds worth of vegetable oils and fats, and other ingredients used in the manufacture of margarines, and nothing is being done about it.  It is time that the Department woke up and did something about it.  The price of butter should be brought down to the price of margarine.  We are losing 3/6d per lb. if we are exporting butter to North Africa at 1/- per lb.  Look at what we would save, and look at the extra amount of butter that would be consumed in this country.</P>
    <P>The principal sources of our income are our flocks and our herds and their health is very important.  We must expend a big amount of money to get rid of the various diseases that affect our herds and flocks.  It took us a long time to start the warble fly scheme, but look at the good it did.  If we had continued that scheme for another year it would have been very beneficial, and we would have got rid of the pockets of that disease that still exist.  We must keep up the fight with the warble fly scheme and the TB eradication scheme.  Even though they cost money, these schemes are vital.</P>
    <P>The benefit that accrued from the warble fly scheme can be attributed mostly to the farming community who co-operated very well.  There may have been some people who did not but, generally speaking, the farming community co-operated to a very large extent. We also had the TB eradication scheme.  It was a costly scheme but it was worth the money and it is almost completed.  There were some big out-breaks last year but that is to be expected. We must keep up the fight <Col N="405" /> against that disease.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the veterinary people who worked so hard to get rid of those diseases in our cattle and sheep.</P>
    <P>The most important of all is the brucellosis eradication scheme.  That disease has been eradicated in one county.  I want to impress on the Minister and the Department the extreme urgency for the provision of money for this scheme.  It is the last of the cattle diseases that we have to eradicate.  It is very important that we throw extra money into this fight to rid our herds of brucellosis.  I appeal to the Minister to provide extra money to get rid of this virulent disease which is affecting our herds.  It is probably worse in the north of the country than in the dairying counties and it will be harder to eradicate it there but, with extra money and extra research, we can get rid of it in a few years.  I am sorry that the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary is not here, but we have Deputy Geoghegan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare and I am sure he will look after us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next matter with which I want to deal is the improvement in the breeds of cattle. A lot of work has been done but a lot remains to be done: progeny testing, improvement of breeds, the crossing of the different breeds, the best type of animals that can be got; all these things are very important.  There has been a big improvement in our herds and, with able direction from the Agricultural Institute, the Department and the agricultural advisers, much work has been done.  I would ask the Minister to continue with that work to improve the breeds of our cattle. At times since the economic war the price of cattle was not good and it did not matter very much whether they were pure bred or half bred; the skin was the same price.  Now cattle is our main industry and I am glad to say that the dead meat export trade is flourishing at the moment.  I hope the <Col N="406" /> demand continues.  We should also continue with the improvement of the export of store cattle which have been the source of great income to the small farmer.  I would like to see the small farmer holding his calves until they would be at least a year or two old.  It is a pity to see farmers selling their calves at a young age instead of keeping them until they would get better prices for them.  Somebody else reaps the benefit instead of the breeder who should get the profits.</P>
      <P>This is not a matter on which the Department of Agriculture could intervene, but in a country where there is so little raw material for industry the hides and wool that are being exported should be utilised for the manufacture of goods in factories here.  Our vocational people should look into this. There is a need to train craftsmen to produce goods from the excellent leather and wool that are being exported at very small prices.</P>
      <P>In the summer months in certain parts of the country the water supply is insufficient.  Many of our regional water supply schemes which are in blueprint will not be implemented in the near future.  The Department of Agriculture should take over all rural water schemes and operate them in the interest of the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>The land project has certainly transformed the rural areas.  Travelling through the country now one sees farms that were derelict years ago producing excellent grass and feed for our livestock.  It is certainly a tribute to the land project people and the agricultural community who brought that land back to cultivation.</P>
      <P>Due to the land project, land that some years ago people thought would never be reclaimed is now growing crops, even barley.  Although the gentleman who initiated it is not in the House now, the land project and the lime subsidy scheme will be a monument to him when he is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Murphy, spoke about bacon factories.  Certainly we in West Cork have been agitating for a factory for a long number of years.  Money and machinery were available but commercial interests and others saw to it that we did not succeed. <Col N="407" /> There should be a bacon factory in a county that is producing more pigs than any other area of comparable size in the country.  To take pigs to the market from 50 miles out costs about 15/- a head.  If there was a bacon factory at home within easy reach of these people they would save most of that 15/- a head.  They would also save on pig feed.  It is not a barley-growing district and every bit of feed has to be imported at extra cost.  If these things were rectified West Cork would have a good claim to a bacon factory.</P>
    <P>The beef subsidy scheme started last year and it was a success.  It enabled people who were in the milk business to switch over to beef for which there is a demand at the moment and for which there is likely to be a good trade in the future.  It has been suggested that the subsidy should be increased to £16.  I think it should be doubled, that it should be at least £24.  When it is considered that the dairy farmer has to be subsidised to the extent of something like £35 a head, it can be seen that a switch to beef would be in the interests of the country as well as in the interests of the farmer.  The small farmer, the three, four or five-cow man, even if he switches to beef, only gets a subsidy for the number over two, and there is no real incentive in that.  The subsidy should start from the first one.  Anybody who produces quality milk must have at least a dozen cows.  The cost of equipment, the cost of putting up various sheds and stalls and maintaining them in proper condition and producing quality milk is very high and the man with the three or four cows cannot pay that kind of money. Therefore I would ask the Minister and the Department to look into this matter.  It might involve a lot of money in the beginning but it would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his officials will consider the few points I have raised.  I would like to be able to praise the Minister like his friend, Deputy Meaney, behind him.  Of course, whatever a Fianna Fáil Minister will say the Fianna Fáil Party will praise him. That is only natural; it could happen over here although I do not think it <Col N="408" /> would sometimes.  The Government should get it into their heads that they are not governing for the Fianna Fáil Party but for the whole country.  While Fianna Fáil are in a majority here they have a minority of votes in the country. The Government should get this fact into their heads and realise that they must act in the best interests of all sections rather than merely in the interests of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of previous Supplementary Estimates, here again we have a remarkable example of the Government coming into the House towards the end of the financial year with a Supplementary Estimate amounting to £8,938,000.  There must be some explanation for this but the one given in the Minister's speech does not seem to me to be reasonable.  It appears as if the Government, when framing their Budget last year, deliberately omitted to include a number of matters for which they should have made provision or, alternatively, they made a very bad guess of what it would cost to run the country for 12 months.  Possibly the fact that a general election was in the offing had a bearing on the manner in which they then allocated the amount of money to be collected and spent.</P>
      <P>During the past few weeks we have had before the House Supplementary Estimates amounting to £25-£30 million.  This is an extraordinary amount of money and there must be an explanation for dealing with it in this way.  We were threatened last June with a mini-budget, which did not materialise for a reason we all know is now in the past.  Is what should have been covered in that mini-budget now to be added on to taxes for the coming year or will the Government say that the buoyancy of the revenue has been so great they are able to absorb this extra stupendous amount of money without extra taxation?  In his reply the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries might perhaps explain this point; if he does not, I hope to get the answers from the Minister for Finance.  The Supplementary Estimates will be passed here in a few hours, but I do not think the people of the country realise what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> We must never forget that when dealing with agriculture we are concerned with our primary industry. First, it is the largest money spinner and, secondly, it employs, directly or indirectly, the greatest number of people.  I can never understand how we continue to talk about the wonderful things that will happen to Irish agriculture when&mdash;or rather if&mdash; we get into the Common Market. Having regard to the whole story of agriculture in this country, including our debate here today, it is evident to anyone who wants to see that if Ireland goes into the Common Market we are walking our farmers into something for which they are totally unprepared.</P>
    <P>During the years, and particularly in the last couple of years, it has been the practice to encourage increases in various types of output.  As soon as the farmers are geared to that and when a substantial amount of money has been spent on a particular project, the Government decide they have had enough and try to switch to something else.  This has happened both in regard to beef and milk products.  According to the figures given to us today by the Minister, and to the figures in the winter issue of <i>Bainne</i>, in a statement from the managing director of Bord Bainne, Mr. Joseph C. McGough, the position is that we are selling a substantial amount of butter at 1/- per lb.  If we go into the Common Market the alternative to competing with these countries&mdash;Morocco, Algeria <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;is to have increased stocks of butter in cold storage at home.</P>
    <P>The Common Market butter mountain, which will be almost 500,000 tons by the 31st March, 1970, is a constant threat to all markets.  Is it seriously suggested that the Government are facing up to their responsibilities when, knowing that the Common Market are having the greatest difficulty in dealing with the milk products problem, we continue to encourage an increase in milk and butter production?  Surely it is accepted, if Dr. Hallstein has only one solution for excess production of milk and butter in the Common Market, namely, a subsidy for the slaughter of cows, the Irish farmer will never be prepared to accept such a <Col N="410" /> solution.  I know that many years ago Fianna Fáil found a solution to one of their problems in the slaughter of calves but even they would find it difficult to sell this new idea to the dairy farmers or even to the backbenchers of their own party.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have no better policy than to continue to subsidise and encourage the production of something which can only be given away for 1/- per lb, they are not doing their job.  Like everybody else in this country, the farmers are entitled to a decent living.  Some of them are perhaps getting a lot more than they are entitled to.  I have very little sympathy with the larger farmers who have been squealing a lot about the system of subsidy.  I do not consider they have any legitimate grievance. If the Government are serious about going into the Common Market it is unfair to continue to encourage the small farmers to increase the amount of milk and milk products knowing, if we ever get into the Common Market&mdash;which I hope we will not &mdash;we shall be badly caught and the income of the small farmers will drop to nil overnight.</P>
    <P>I consider the Department are failing in their job in regard to the handling of milk products on hand at the present time.  I heard Deputies here&mdash; one from Fine Gael in the last few days and a Fianna Fáil Deputy today &mdash;complain about the large amount of margarine being purchased here.  Let me put two points before the House, because it appears some people do not understand plain facts.  Margarine is bought by two types of people: it is bought by the health-conscious because doctors say butter, in certain cases, causes, or helps to cause, heart disease. This statement, as we all know, has been made again and again.  It has not been challenged by those who would be in a position to challenge it.  It has been challenged only by people like ourselves, non-medical people, who are not competent to say whether or not the statements made are technically correct.</P>
    <P>The second type buying margarine is composed of those who cannot afford to buy butter.  By far the greatest <Col N="411" /> amount of margarine is bought by people who cannot afford to buy butter because the price of butter is too high and, while they can buy margarine at half the price of butter, they will continue to buy it.  It is ridiculous for anyone to suggest that the solution is to put a high levy on the production of margarine.  This would simply result in putting up the price to the price of butter, making it dearer for those who are now compelled to consume it.  The inevitable result would be that these people would revert to the old &ldquo;bread-and-scrape&rdquo; diet, a slice of bread with a microscopic film of butter or margarine over it.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, when the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party had an embarrassing amount of beef on his hands, he found a solution with which many people did not agree, for the disposal of the surplus beef.  Is there any reason why the present Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party should not have a discussion with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and decide that one way to dispose of the stocks of butter would be to dispose of them to the lower income groups at the same price as, or a little cheaper, than they pay for margarine? If we can sell butter abroad at 1/- per lb surely it is not unfair to ask that the same butter should be made available to those who are now compelled to eat margarine.  Up to 12 months ago it might have been argued that something like this would seriously affect the sale of butter at an economic price but, since it is now a proven fact that a very high proportion of the lower income groups, apart altogether from the health faddists, are purchasing and eating margarine, there should be no reason why the Government could not make butter available to these people at quite a low price.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not think we are dealing with milk in the right way.  If someone goes into a hospital he finds that there is a certain amount of milk made available to the patients.  The amount made available is conditioned by the price paid for the milk.  With a surplus of milk, coupled with the fact that there will be no substantial loss if the milk is supplied in larger quantities, could <Col N="412" /> arrangements not be made to enable local authorities to make an abundant supply of milk available to hospital patients?  I assure the House that the poor would appreciate a pint of fresh milk, for which they did not have to pay, every day.  There are many people who buy half a pint of milk per day and, if they are living on their own, they find it extremely difficult at the end of the week to find the money to pay for those half pints of milk.  We are told that there is such a surplus of milk it would pay the Government to throw it away rather than process it into some kind of milk product.  Is there any reason why there should not be some arrangement whereby milk could be made freely available to school children?  In a country like ours, with an abundant supply of milk, it is deplorable to see so many puny little children who get a drop of milk in their tea, and no more, because the price is prohibitive.  The price is purely and simply an artificial price and, because it is, there is no reason why milk should continue to be such a scarce commodity for some.</P>
    <P>The experts in agriculture have had a field day here today.  It was very interesting to listen to people like Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, Deputy Meaney and Deputy O'Sullivan, who all come from the same county, and who all have the finer points in relation to agriculture at their finger tips. I speak about agriculture simply as one coming from an agricultural county.  I have not got the expert insight into agriculture that they have but, at the same time, what I am trying to put across is the ordinary man's point of view.</P>
    <P>There are one or two figures in this issue of <i>Bainne</i> worth bringing to the notice of the House.  They may make some people think.  I should like to compliment those who produced this issue of <i>Bainne</i>.  It is an excellent production with this splendid article by Mr. McGough and also the article on land reform.  The numbers engaged in milk production in the country seem to be rocketing.  Even though everybody is losing money on milk production everybody seems to want to go into milk.  There is a moral in this <Col N="413" /> somewhere.  This should be taken into account by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries when changes in subsidies are being considered.  It says here in this article in <i>Bainne</i> that, over a ten year period, the intake of milk to creameries more than doubled from 250 gallons ten years ago to 520 gallons last year.  The number of dairy farmers increased by 15,000.  Cow numbers increased by a quarter of a million and the average yield per cow increased from 372 to 534 gallons. Taking all this into account and remembering that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, even with those figures in front of them, are still encouraging the further production of milk, with no outlet for that milk except at give-away prices, proves to me anyway that the Department are just not doing their job.</P>
    <P>The change over to the beef subsidy scheme recently made me smile.  I am old enough, though I was only a small boy when Fianna Fáil took office, to remember Fianna Fáil fulminating against grass.  One of the counties that got it heavily was County Meath; we heard all about the man and the dog walking around the wide acres.  The man engaged in beef production was regarded almost as a sinner.  Now there is a complete change round, very rightly so in this case, and the figures show that beef production is on the up and up.  Even Fianna Fáil, apparently, can change their mind.</P>
    <P>There is another item in this Estimate in regard to which there would seem to be no set policy.  I do not mean a policy now for 1970 or 1971, but a policy for the future.  If we go into the Common Market farmers will find themselves in dire trouble.  There is the old cliché about not being able to plough the rocks of Bawn.  I am afraid the Irish farmer, who has been ploughing anything and everything and producing wheat on it, will find when he goes into the Common Market ploughing the rocks of Bawn very simple as compared with what he will meet there.  The loss last year, according to the figures given here, was very substantial.  That was only one year.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £500,000 is required in respect of losses arising <Col N="414" /> on the purchase and resale of the 1968 wheat crop.  Would the Minister say what is the policy of the Department of Agriculture with regard to wheat?</P>
    <P>I would also like to get information with regard to farm buildings.  Difficulty has been experienced with regard to the payment of grants for such buildings.  One sometimes finds that having had the work inspected a man is given the impression that the grant will be paid when the job is finished but then does not get the grant until the builders suppliers are threatening to bring him to court.  Sometimes a man is told by the Department that the job does not qualify for a grant.  Delays in payment of grants are very great.</P>
    <P>Any one looking through the Official Report since 1954 will find that I have been saying that a man with a job and a few acres of land is the most comfortable man in the country.  According to the Department of Agriculture a man living in a small cottage, with perhaps one acre, may be refused a grant for some necessary stabling.  This is a new arrangement and perhaps the Minister would comment on it.</P>
    <P>A further £96,000 is provided for An Foras Talúntais.  This body are doing a wonderful job.  They are always short of money.  The amounts provided are not sufficient to meet the cost of what they are allowed to do.  It is impossible for An Foras Talúntais to plan ahead.  At the beginning of the financial year they do not know whether they will have enough money to complete the jobs on hands.  There should be a more liberal approach to this matter.  We are an agricultural country.  It is the duty of the Department of Agriculture to see that the experts they have employed are given the requisite amount of money to carry out their work properly.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful to the Minister if he would let us know whether the Department of Agriculture have anything else in mind with regard to milk and milk production <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Common Market application other than what is contained in the document circulated this morning.  If the Minister gives only certain small increases, and if the day comes when the Irish farmer has to go into the Common Market, <Col N="415" /> he will find he is going into a group where everybody else is better equipped and able to supply what he had hoped to sell in the Common Market.  This is a very serious matter on which we should have a clear statement from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a remarkable thing that the people who cause the most agitation with regard to lands and farming are generally those who know the least about these matters. They are often teachers, shopkeepers, publicans, doctors or priests.  These people speak about agriculture, fisheries and such matters to a far greater extent than do those engaged in this work. They do this not for the benefit of the unfortunate farmers but for the sake of publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nonsensical for the Department to try to operate a one-storey agricultural policy throughout the country.  It is useless to try to operate in Mayo, Galway and Leitrim the same type of policy as in Meath, Kildare, Westmeath and Limerick.  Such a policy cannot work.  It is unfortunate that the people who deserve and require it are not getting the money. The bigger farmers are getting the money.  The Parliamentatry Secretary, who has travelled all over the country, knows that a different policy should be formulated for the west.  It has been said that milk suppliers in the west should not have gone into milk production.  I do not agree with that. These are the people who should go in for milk production.  The people in the better lands of the midlands should concentrate on beef cattle production. The small farmers in the west would not be able to use their tiny uneconomic holdings in the same way as people in counties like Meath, who can use their land like ranchers. A farmer in the west who tries to follow the example given to him by the landlords 100 years ago has failed to change.  Incentives to milk production must be given to the smaller farmers of the west and not to the people living on the lush grassland of Tipperary and Limerick who have their cows milked by machine and deliver it to the town, and then spend the rest <Col N="416" /> of the day in that town doing nothing. That does not happen in the west.  I ask that any special incentive which can be given should be given to the small farmers.  Small milk suppliers should get the greater incentives.</P>
    <P>There was a discussion on butter and margarine.  Various excuses have been given for the sale of margarine. We have heard about poor people buying it.  There is much political propaganda on this subject.  The huge oil companies who manufacture margarine are in a position to use tremendous advertising power.  They have convinced some people in this country that butter is harmful and will lead them to an early grave because of heart trouble which may follow its use.  In countries which have the highest <i>per capita</i> rate of butter consumption there is the lowest <i>per capita</i> rate of coronary thrombosis so that that story does not hold water.  During the war their theme song used to be &ldquo;Lilli Marlene&rdquo; now it seems to be &ldquo;Lily Margarine&rdquo;.  They have achieved the position in which they are because tremendous advertising power was brought to bear on margarine.</P>
    <P>It is despicable that in an agricultural country where butter should be obtainable at a reasonable price it is not being purchased more extensively. I am not at all sure that the price is the controlling factor.  Indeed, I am convinced that it is by no means the controlling factor.  It is the advertising capacity of the oil companies who produce this cart grease and sell it as something that tastes better than butter rather than the fact that people are not able to buy butter.</P>
    <P>The question of pig production was raised and I think it was Deputy Meaney who said that the number of pigs is increasing.  The number of pigs may be increasing but the number of pigs in the west has been declining. Anywhere you have an increase in the number of dancehalls you are bound to have a decrease in the number of pigs because no farmer's daughter who has to look after pigs will go into the dancehall afterwards.  In many places where people are so vocal about agricultural production and so vocal in <Col N="417" /> their attacks on the Government we find they are the same people who put up the dancehalls often in the guise of alleged social centres.  This induces those people away from their work with the result that often on a Monday morning, or, indeed, any other day, boys and girls are not able to go out on the farms to help their unfortunate fathers and mothers.  Some of the people who express criticisms here today should remember the days of the Russian and Canadian bacon and it was only when this Government got into power that that eventually disappeared off the market.  It was sold here as bacon and I do not forget it.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the beef incentive scheme extended generally.  The reduction in the number of sheep is due mainly to the tremendous export market for carcase mutton which has been developed and which gives tremendous employment.  I should like to see an increase in the foreign sales of mutton, beef and pigmeat rather than the sending out of live animals which provides very little employment. Anything that can be done to develop this industry should be done.  We have not yet had time to find out whether the incentive scheme has been really successful in the west but I believe it has.  It is not sufficiently flexible and some inspectors have been too rigid in their decisions and I would ask the Minister to take cognisance of that.</P>
    <P>One of the most valuable animals that could be produced has practically disappeared from the Irish scene and that is the donkey.  Some scheme for the propagation of these animals should be introduced because there is no question about their selling for tremendous prices but, unfortunately, they are unobtainable. It is possible, of course, that there is no scarcity of asses but there is an absolute scarcity of donkeys.</P>

      <P>I should like also to refer to the mountain fencing and grazing scheme.  A great deal of work has been wasted here because the people who have done the fencing have done nothing else.  They should be <Col N="418" /> induced to seed and manure the land which, generally speaking, they have not and as a result they are only like pounds for putting sheep and pigs into. They have not improved the land. Greater incentives should be offered to them to do so.  Despite Deputy Tully's allegations about smoke signals in Mayo and that we are out of contact with the world, there are two Departments between which I should like to see much greater contact, the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  They are not showing the co-operation that we would all like to see between them. I must say I take a dim view of a man like Deputy Tully who deprecates on the one hand the fact that the Minister is giving an extra £9 million to the farmers and on the other hand tries to maintain he is not giving enough.  That does not make sense.  I am not saying he is giving enough but he is giving three times as much to the farmers as it took to run this State in 1931.  I would ask Deputies to remember that and to remember that any worthwhile scheme which was introduced was introduced by the people on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate covers a wide field and it is for a considerable sum.  While I welcome the opportunity for a debate on our major industry, nevertheless, it is strange that it is about two years since we had a full-scale debate on agriculture.  The last time we had a debate on agriculture was December twelve months when a Supplementary Estimate for a considerable sum was rushed in on the final day of the Christmas term.  Apparently the tendency on the part of the Government is to give the Dáil no opportunity of having a detailed discussion on this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood, and I expected, that when this Supplementary Estimate was being introduced a token Estimate in respect of the main Estimate would have been introduced first as has been done in the case of other Estimates and as has been done in the case of the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, the debate on which lasted four weeks.  I hope we will not <Col N="419" /> have to wait another two years before Deputies on all sides of this House have an opportunity of saying all they want to say and all the farmers of this country expect them to say about the problems which confront this important industry now as we are about to enter the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend now to look at this Supplementary Estimate, the main item of which is the subvention for the dairying industry.  We had the Minister in his introductory speech again trotting out his old argument, which he has trotted out on many occasions here at Question Time, about State assistance to the dairying industry.  I want to avail myself of this opportunity to put this important industry in its proper perspective.  I, no more than any other Member of this House, do not attempt and I have never attempted to justify unnecessary State expenditure.  I want to examine this industry and its place in the national economy.  The Minister, from his brief, would certainly appear to be deliberately trying to convey the impression of massive support for the dairying industry.  He says that the amount provided by the Exchequer for milk support has risen at a very sharp rate in recent years.  He says it had quadrupled in five years.  He then goes on, as only Deputy Blaney could, to tell us what the Government have done and are doing for the dairying industry.  It is well that we should examine the situation.  It is vitally important that not merely the Members of this House but the public at large should be aware of the role which the dairying industry plays in the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have an industry which is giving full-time employment to 110,000 dairy farmers and their families. According to recent official figures, 110,000 dairy farmers are employed directly.  Taking into account farmers and their families, it is reckoned that the number of people directly employed <Col N="420" /> on the land in connection with the dairying industry is 350,000. Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 8,000 to 10,000 people are in full-time employment in the various creameries and milk processing plants throughout the country and, of course, there are many more in indirect employment in ancillary activities&mdash;transport and so on.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry nets approximately £30 million per annum in direct exports and it goes without saying that it is the basis and foundation of our cattle export industry.  We cannot have cattle exports unless we have the cows to produce the cattle so it probably is contributing £70 million or £80 million more in cattle exports. I do not want to argue here that this House and the country should continue to subsidise the dairying industry because of its high employment content, because of the social implications or for any such reasons.  I believe that this industry must be examined also from the standpoint of its performance and its efficiency.  How is this sector of our economy performing <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other sectors and particularly in relation to competitive products being produced by other dairying countries particularly in Western Europe and in the EEC?  The dairying industry is the only sector of our economy which has reached the target of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries here this morning, having presented a deliberately false picture of this whole thing, acknowledged the fact that the dairying industry has reached the targets of the Second Programme.  I say it is the only sector of our economy that has done so.  He attributes this to good Government policy.  He has not got it in him to pay tribute to the thousands of farmers throughout the country, through whose hard work and efficiency, this healthy state of the dairying industry is largely due.</P>
    <P>Since the Second Programme was introduced it has been deliberate Government policy to increase milk production in this country and I defy any Deputy or the Minister to contradict me on this.  I also challenge the Minister, when he is replying to this <Col N="421" /> debate, to produce the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and to quote from it any sentence which, even indirectly, indicated that there would be a stage reached where we would have to limit milk production. All the resources at the disposal of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, all the advisory services, the Agricultural Institute, for which there is a subvention here, all the media of propaganda since the Second Programme was introduced, have been directed to one purpose and that was to increase milk production.  The greatest credit is due to the dairy farmers, to their advisers and to everybody responsible for the fact that, despite tremendous obstacles&mdash;particularly the elimination of bovine TB&mdash;they have been able to reach a stage where milk production now just about reaches the figure projected in the Second Programme. Agricultural advisers, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Agricultural Institute were persuading and advising and doing everything possible to get dairy farmers to increase the number of cows, to improve the grass output, to improve their efficiency in every way and, at the same time, certain incentives were given for the production of quality milk.  Small farmers have responded magnificently to the appeal for the production of quality milk.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning made no mention of the tremendous expense incurred by many dairy farmers throughout the country in complying with what was deliberate Government policies.  Farmers have modernised their farmyards.  They have introduced new systems of grass preservation. They have changed from hay to silage. They have changed from milking with buckets to modern streamlined parlours. They have changed from leanto sheds to cubicles for cows and so forth.  They were encouraged to do this by deliberate Government policy.  They received grants to do so but, of course, they had to put their hands in their own pockets and they spent a large sum of money in doing so.</P>
    <P>I am now charging the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;I said this before at Question Time and I am repeating <Col N="422" /> it&mdash;with having played a deliberate and dirty confidence trick on the dairy farmers because he encouraged them in recent years to increase milk production and their efficiency. Out of the blue some months ago there was a panic announcement. We had too much milk and there would have to be a reduction in the amount of milk produced.  Then the Minister in a most insidious and irresponsible manner attempts to drive a wedge between the small and the large dairy farmers saying that his policy and the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government now and always was to help the small farmers.  He announces that this year certain categories of small farmers will get an increase of 1d per gallon.  This is a graduated scale now.  Who in heaven's name does the Minister think he is codding?  If he says the miserable increase he is announcing for the small dairy farmer, the man producing up to 7,000 gallons, will make it possible for him to live and survive on a small dairy farm he is certainly trying to cod us.</P>
    <P>The Minister even quoted statements this morning made by the National Farmers' Association at the time the Second Programme was being introduced and he now poses as the great advocate and defender of the small farmers.  At the same time, a colleague of his, Deputy Seán Flanagan, Minister for Lands, announced publicly some months ago that there was no future for anybody with under 70 acres. We have another Minister administering an abominable plan for small farmers in dishing out dole.  We now have three policies.  It is time we put an end to the kind of codology where the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries says one thing, another Minister says another thing and a third Minister advocates a still different policy.</P>
    <P>Not for one moment do I accept the new price structure introduced by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in which on the surface it would appear he will help the small dairy farmers while, at the same time, he will prevent the big fellow from becoming a millionaire. If there was a case for limiting milk production and if there were social, economic or other arguments <Col N="423" /> in favour of concentrating milk production on the small holdings, why was it not announced when the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was introduced?  Why was no indication given even two or three years ago? Even as late as four months ago dairy farmers in the south of Ireland were invited to a two-day conference at the Dairy Research Institute in Fermoy.  I have said hard things in the past about the Agricultural Institute but let me say this now.  The Dairy Research Institute has made a wonderful contribution to the growth of the dairying industry in recent years.</P>
    <P>What was the purpose of the conference held three or four months ago?  Its purpose was to show dairy farmers how they could gear their production and how they could improve their grassland to the stage at which they could keep one cow to every .9 of an acre.  Experiments had been carried out at Fermoy.  There was no question of only small farmers being invited there.  Medium sized farmers and large sized farmers were also invited.  They were shown how to increase their cow carrying capacity and their grassland.  Apart from the fact that the Minister seems to be deliberately attempting to introduce class distinction and drive a wedge between the small and large farmers, the tragedy is that now we are on the eve of entry into the European Economic Community&mdash;at least we presume we are&mdash;the dairying industry is the one sector of our economy about which it can be said with any kind of reasonable accuracy which is in a position to compete with the other agricultural nations in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>I say this despite the fact that some weeks ago I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he could give me some indication as to what the likely prospects would be for the dairying industry in the event of our entering the European Economic Community. Despite the fact that we are talking about the EEC since God knows when all the Minister could say was: &ldquo;The situation is being examined and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement about it some time <Col N="424" /> soon&rdquo;.  Surely to heavens the Minister should be able to give some indication about what our prospects would be.  I have no access to official advice or anything else but I can stand over a forecast I will now make in relation to the prospects of the dairying industry in the EEC.  I have already said that our dairy farmers have achieved the targets of the Second Programme in the amount of milk they have produced but, more important still, they have put up a magnificent performance in improving the quality of milk.  I understand that 70 per cent or more of the milk that goes to creameries qualifies for the quality bonus.  They have produced what they were asked to produce when the Second Programme was introduced. They have improved the quality of their milk.</P>
    <P>What about the dairy produce? There is not much use producing milk of top quality unless we examine the end product.  What about the product? Here, again, a very satisfactory situation emerges.  We find that the total export figure for the dairying industry is around £30 million.  In other words, we are exporting approximately £30 million worth of dairy products every year.  When we analyse this further and get a breakdown in the figure, in the quantities and the prices, we find a rather remarkable situation.  In 1968 Irish butter on the British market, according to the latest figures available to me, commanded a price second only to that of the Danes.  I shall give the figures: Danish butter was making £337 per ton, Irish butter £328 per ton, British butter £320 per ton, Dutch butter £307 per ton, Australian and New Zealand butter £300 per ton and butter from other countries is also making £300 per ton.  These figures show that Irish butter is commanding premium prices on the British market.  Bord Bainne advertises in the <i>Sunday Times</i> and I saw recently an excellent, although most unusual, advertisement for &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo;, which said, &ldquo;Do not use Kerrygold for cooking&rdquo;.  The only thing that prevents an expansion of sales on the British market is the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. Irish butter is making only £9 less than Danish butter on the British market and there is considerable <Col N="425" /> demand for it.  All the information that I have leads me to believe that we could sell far greater quantities of &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; on the British market but for the fact that the British Government will not allow us to do so.</P>
    <P>I shall return to the question of butter later on but I now want to deal with another important product, namely, cheese.  In 1968, British cheese &mdash;I have extracted these figures from official records&mdash;was selling at £270 per ton, Irish cheese at £245 per ton, New Zealand cheese at £240 per ton, Australian cheese at £225 per ton and others at £200 per ton, which means that of the countries exporting cheese to the British market Irish cheese commands the highest price.  It is second only to British cheese.  I shall not deal with other products, but according to the information I have obtained from trips to Britain and discussions which I have had with consumers and people in the trade there is considerable scope for expansion of cheese sales on the British market but again, there are quantitative restrictions.</P>
    <P>Another interesting figure illustrating the competitiveness of the Irish dairy industry is the cost of butter production.  In 1967, butter production costs in this country ran at £470 per ton whereas in the EEC countries they ran at £800 a ton.  It is important to note that the butter which cost £800 to produce in the EEC was sold for £100 a ton.  If the EEC and free trade means what it is supposed to mean, we shall have a wonderful competitive advantage in relation to our butter and cheese prices in the EEC.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about the British market for agricultural products. Is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that our butter exports to Britain constitute only 6.1 per cent of the total imports of butter into Britain? In other words, we have only 6.1 per cent of the butter market, 9.4 per cent of the cheese market, 24.6 per cent of the skimmed milk market, 15.5 per cent of the whole milk powder market, 99.9 per cent of the chocolate crumb market, 15.1 per cent of the condensed milk market and our share of other dairy commodities on the British market is only 7.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> Discussions have been held both here and in Britain in recent times and I understand that dairy produce was one of the matters under consideration. In view of the fact that this country is amongst Britain's best customers for industrial products surely there is a cast iron case for getting tough and demanding a fairer share of the British dairy produce market than the present 6.1 per cent for butter and 9.4 per cent for cheese?</P>
    <P>When the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was introduced the Government started out by saying that milk was the main line of production. In fact, farmers in parts of Ireland which had never produced milk were encouraged to go into milk production and creameries have sprung up in places where milk was never produced before.  In places like Wexford, the midlands, Mullingar and even in Athenry we now have creameries. As a result of Government policy to encourage milk production traditional lines of production in those areas were dropped.  That was a ridiculous policy.  It is even more ridiculous to say now, &ldquo;We are sorry; milk is over-produced; you will have to cut down on this&rdquo;.  The unfortunate farmers who have spent thousands of pounds increasing the number of cows, improving their land and installing the most modern equipment are now left in a very serious position.  Many farmers who were able to launch into milk production only by borrowing heavily from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, now find that their income is being reduced.</P>

That will not keep any small farmer on the land. What has the Minister for Lands to say about that?  What has the Minister for Social Welfare to say about that?

      <P>It cannot be denied that 10,000 small farmers are leaving the land every year.  That is a statement of fact.  In view of the fact that it is a year and a half since we had the last pronouncement from the Minister in the Dáil, and that it is over two years since we had a full scale debate on agriculture, I am surprised the Minister did not avail of the opportunity today to throw some light on the facts and the likely prospects, not for the whole of agriculture because he could not do so in this debate, but for the dairying industry if we go into the EEC.</P>
      <P>Look at the performance of the dairying industry in recent years, at the high output per acre and per cow achieved by our dairy farmers, at the high quality of the milk they produce, the tremendous efficiency of our milk processing plants and the success of our dairy products on the British and other markets.  Bear in mind the most important fact that our dairy farmers have the lowest costs of any farmers in western Europe; yet the price received for milk delivered at creameries by our dairy farmers is the lowest in any country in western Europe.  When we look at the prospect of entering the Common Market and find that we can produce milk at a lower cost, top quality milk and top quality dairy products, surely we realise that, if we are to enter the EEC&mdash;and Government policy seems to assume that we are&mdash;rather than throwing the whole dairying industry into chaos and confusion as the Minister has done in recent months, every encouragement should be given to the dairying industry. There is no doubt, and I have not got access to official advisers, that the dairying industry has nothing to fear from the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>I will go further and say that I believe our dairying industry <Col N="429" /> will be able to compete very well with the dairying industry in the EEC, even if it is expanded to include all of western Europe.  As I have already said, the costs of milk production in the EEC are very much higher than the costs here.  Our products are just as good.  If there is to be free trade we must obviously sell more milk products.  For this reason I repeat that I deplore the change of policy on the part of the Minister and the Government towards the dairying industry.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it will have disastrous results by reason of the fact that it has had a very bad effect psychologically on everybody in the dairying industry.  The saddest feature of all is that it has lessened, and in many cases destroyed, the tremendous confidence the Irish dairy farmers had in their agricultural advisers.  Having accepted the advice of those advisers down through the years, and the encouragement that was given to them, they are now told that this policy was wrong and they are back to where they started.  They do not know where they are going.  There is a lot more that could be said about the dairying industry and the Minister dealt with it at length this morning.</P>
      <P>I have referred to butter and cheese. There is another product which was a problem product and about which we heard a lot in recent years.  The Minister did not mention it today although it comes under subhead N.1&mdash;Milk Production Allowances, Marketing of Dairy Produce, etc.  A year or two ago there was a tremendous crisis in the milk powder industry.  Milk was poured away and the price for milk powder crashed.  The question of a milk powder market was examined in detail by the two American gentlemen who were here a year or two ago, Messrs.  Cooke and Sprague.  Like the reports of other American consultants who came in here, their report is now gathering dust and we will probably hear no more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not accept that American consultants can come into this country to examine the agricultural industry, or sectors of it, and that we <Col N="430" /> must accept their findings as being the only solution, nevertheless, these two consultants came up with very important findings.  One in particular in relation to milk powder was based on the thesis that the world market for milk powder is subject to fluctuations, that it goes in cycles, that for a couple of years the price will be at a high level and then go down into a valley period again.  I have referred to this before speaking on the dairying industry but I want to refer to it again.  Recommendation No. 6 of their report advocated the introduction of what is known as a floor price for milk powder on a stock loss level basis.  In other words, a floor price would be fixed at £65 per ton.  I suppose another name for that would be a break-even price.</P>
    <P>They recommended that this should be the floor price and that, in a year in which this would be reviewed, no matter what the price was, the milk processing plant would be assured of a minimum of £65 a ton for milk powder.  When the price would exceed the £65 a ton, perhaps go away above it to £140 a ton as it did a few years ago, the levy would be charged on the additional price and this money would go into a pool to bring the price up to the floor price of £65 a ton when the price would fall below £65.  This was an excellent suggestion and I know that discussions took place between the Department&mdash;whether the Minister was personally involved I do not know &mdash;and representatives of the milk processing plants.  The Minister makes no reference to it at all today and I do not know what the situation is now or what the situation will be.  Perhaps when the Minister has time he will tell us what he intends to do about this.</P>
    <P>There is no use in advocating an additional State subvention to the dairying industry unless, as I pointed out already, there is a top quality product which is produced efficiently and which is saleable.  These conditions are certainly fulfilled in respect of butter and cheese.  Deputy Gerard Collins, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was widely quoted in the newspapers as stating that butter was being exported and selling in many countries at 1/- a lb. <Col N="431" /> I admit that if this production were to continue the annual output would increase, and judging by the trend in recent years it would continue to increase but for the Minister doing what he has done and messing up the whole thing.</P>
    <P>I am not competent nor have I the information to talk about the prospects for increasing the sales of Irish dairy products on markets other than Britain. I have just taken the trouble to investigate the market for two products in Britain only.  I do not know what the prospects are elsewhere.  There was a great deal of talk a couple of years ago about plans for building milk reconstitution plants in Manila and in the Far East.  I hear no talk about that now and I do not know what has happened. There was a whole lot of hush-hush about it at the time.  I was advised it would not be in the interests of this project to make the details public because it might give some competitor an advantage over us, that some one might jump the gun and get in there before us.  At least we should be given some information about it now: how it is doing, what amount of milk is being absorbed in these milk reconstitution plants.  The idea as far as I am aware was that due to climatic and other problems in these Far Eastern countries, particularly the high humidity, dairy products and particularly milk powder manufactured here would deteriorate in condition very rapidly due to the long journey and so forth.  I understand this was a new process whereby the powder would be exported in concentrated form and would then go into a factory and be reconstituted into whole milk.</P>
    <P>While I am not competent to analyse in detail the entire world market for dairy products, I agree with Deputy Tully that the excellent publication <i>Bainne</i> gives us a very good picture of the market promotion and the successes of Bord Bainne abroad.  However, there is one outlet for milk which I believe has got tremendous potential, and that is the home market.  We have a National Dairy Publicity Council whose function it is to encourage the increased consumption of milk at home. <Col N="432" /> I have referred to this in previous debates. It is my considered opinion that this National Dairy Publicity Council is not doing its job.  It is not the type of organisation that can do this job and certainly it is not doing it.  There is tremendous scope for increasing the consumption of milk here at home and milk products as well if there was an imaginative programme, a dynamic policy and an efficient organisation to push it.</P>
    <P>As late as yesterday I had a question down to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries asking if he would allow Bord Bainne to undertake this work on the home market.  For example, there must be scope for the introduction of milk bars into schools.  Surely there is scope for an increase in the number of vending machines, for the development of flavoured drinks based on milk?  Surely there is room for much more imaginative publicity on the home market?  We have not been able to come up with anything even remotely equivalent to the advertising campaign that is conducted in Britain in the public press and under the famous slogan &ldquo;Drinka pinta milka day&rdquo;.  We are high consumers of butter, in fact among the highest in Western Europe, but our consumption of cheese <i>per capita</i> is one of the lowest.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the National Dairy Publicity Council should be abolished.  I suggested yesterday to the Minister that perhaps Bord Bainne was the proper organisation to undertake the formulation and direction of a butter campaign at home such as the outstanding campaign they undertook in Britain in promoting Kerrygold butter.</P>

      <P>I hate being unfairly critical.  It is easy to say here the National Dairy Publicity Council <Col N="433" /> is a dead loss, but I am going on the fact that the results are bad and that the farmers' organisations have commented on this question on numerous occasions.  Again on this question of the consumption of milk there is a problem in regard to the exorbitant prices being charged for it in Irish hotels and restaurants.  Apart from the fact that, coming from a dairying area, I like to give good example and make my contribution to the increase in the consumption of milk by drinking it, I like a glass or two of milk every day.  However, the price being charged for a glass of milk is absolutely outrageous.  Someone told me recently that, assuming milk is brought down to the minimum legal requirement of three per cent butter fat, the price being charged for milk in hotels is the equivalent of 10/- or 12/- a gallon.  As I say, from a health and nutritional point of view and everything else, the time is now ripe for a new organisation, a new approach and a dynamic drive towards increasing the consumption of milk and milk products on the home market.  I believe it can be done and it is one big problem the Minister will have to solve.</P>
      <P>The next point with which I want to deal is perhaps the most controversial of all in recent years in relation to the dairying industry.  The Minister stated in his introductory speech:</P>
      <P>I should like to refer here also to the need for reorganisation and rationalisation of the creamery industry.</P>
      <P>This question of amalgation, rationalisation and reorganisation has been much bandied about in recent years. I do not like using the word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; because I was once misquoted: it appeared in the press that I was advocating the &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo; of the dairying industry and I was then in real trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1962 a survey team was set up by the Department to conduct an examination of the milk and dairy products industry.  This survey team consisted of three people, one of whom was Mr. Byrne, but I cannot recall the names of the others.  This report was published <Col N="434" /> in 1963 and was an excellent document. There was clear evidence of a thorough examination having been made of the dairy industry and the report put forward many practical suggestions for the reorganisation and improvement of the creamery industry in particular.  This was circulated and there followed considerable discussion.  The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the National Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Managers' Association and perhaps one or two other bodies studied the report and each in turn published reports of their own.  Some of the organisations agreed with certain of the recommendations in the Department's report and others they rejected.</P>
    <P>When the various farming organisations had examined the Department's proposals in 1963 or 1964 the door was wide open for the Minister to proceed with a gradual programme of reorganisation and rationalisation.  However, for some extraordinary reason a clash of interests arose and the next step taken was to get Dr. Knapp from the United States to come here and examine the dairy industry.  I understand he spent six weeks in this country and did a flying tour of the creameries. He published what has come to be known as the famous Knapp Report and this was, on the whole, favourably received.</P>
    <P>The IAOS put forward their proposals for rationalisation, in which the creameries were to be grouped into nineteen groupings, with the closure of a considerable number of separating stations and smaller creameries.  This was submitted to the creamery societies and it gave rise to considerable argument because if the majority of the creameries accepted this 19-centre proposal they would lose their individual identity and this they were not prepared to do in one stage.  As I have stated previously, I think it was a great pity that the IAOS put forward their plan at that time.  What should have been done, and what the Minister whose responsibility it was should have seen was done, was that a gradual, wellphased out programme of reorganisation and amalgamation, where necessary, was carried out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> Subsequent to the IAOS proposals, two other American gentlemen, Messrs. Cooke and Sprague, were involved in this matter.  I said in another context in relation to powdered milk that those two gentlemen examined the dairy industry and made certain recommendations. However, from my study of this report, Messrs. Cooke and Sprague merely confirmed most of the findings of the original survey team of the Department.  I could not find anything revolutionary in their report, nor was there anything in Dr. Knapp's report not already known to people who had spent their lives in the co-operative movement in this country.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister announced in the Dáil&mdash;in reply to a question from either Deputy Creed of myself&mdash;that he had set up another committee to examine the question of amalgamation and rationalisation and that this committee was charged with the job of setting out the social and other implications of such a programme.  In fact, we are now back to square one: we started with the Department's survey team and, having been reported on by all the various organisations I have mentioned, the matter is now back to the Minister, whose responsibility it is, and whose responsibility it was in 1962.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major topic of discussion in the rural part of my constituency.  Unfortunately, the idea of rationalisation and amalgamation was badly presented to the creamery societies by the IAOS.  A very bad public relations job was carried out. Surely, having studied the reports and the social and economic implications of amalgamation, the Minister is in the best position to say whether or not amalgamation would be a good job. At a time when an attempt was made to amalgamate the creameries into 19 groups nobody was able to tell the creamery societies what the advantages would be.  The ordinary dairy farmer is a sensible, logical man and when a new scheme is presented to him he asks a sensible question: &ldquo;If the little creamery down the road is closed and we are directed to send our milk five <Col N="436" /> or ten miles away to the larger centre, will that put more money into my pocket?  How much per gallon more will it mean for me?&rdquo; Despite all these reports that have been produced no one up to the present time has been able to answer that question.  If there is an answer I do not know it and there are many others who do not know it.</P>
      <P>It has been stated in this American consultants' report that the centralisation of butter manufacture and of other dairy products would give rise to economies and the cost of production per lb. of butter in the larger central manufacturing unit would be much less than if the same amount of butter were produced in five or six different centres. There would also be advantages in having a common standard of quality. These are the advantages.  County Limerick has the highest density of creameries of any county in Ireland. The farmer loads his milk and delivers it to the creamery down the road. Under amalgamation this would not happen.  A huge truck would come and load the churns at the farmer's gate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So-called rural sociologists, who pretend to know a great deal about rural Ireland and who think the farmers are fools, have said that the great saving here would be in the farmer's time, that he could put the time spent going to and from the creamery to better use on the farm and, even if the cost of bulk collection were greater, the saving in time would offset this.  I do not agree.  One does not have to be a pseudo rural sociologist to know that the farmer going down the road to the creamery is not wasting his time; he may have to make the journey.  The farmer is entitled to collect his morning newspaper.  His wife is entitled to go along with him to do her shopping. It is more than likely that the farmer would make this journey in any case. The farmer may take his children part of the way to school.  There is nothing wrong with the farmer having a bit of a discussion with his neighbours on the topics of the day.  There are social implications.  I have attacked the Minister and have said hard things about him but the Minister has acknowledged that there are serious social implications <Col N="437" /> involved in this.  My recommendation, for what it is worth, with regard to amalgamation, reorganisation and so forth is that the Minister should now proceed to draw up a rational scheme of amalgamation.  There are many uneconomic creamery units. There are many little creameries in my constituency which have only 70 or 80 milk suppliers and, a mile down the road, there is another little creamery with the same number of suppliers. The process of amalgamation should proceed on a gradual basis and the most uneconomic units should be closed down.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech this morning:</P>
    <P>In order to assist further progress, I have approved of negotiations for the transfer of some of the interests of the Dairy Disposal Company to co-operative ownership in the context of overall reorganisation and rationalisation of the creamery structure in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, one of the problems. My colleague, Deputy Creed, is more familiar with it than I am.  We have one Dairy Disposal Company creamery at Knocklong with six or seven branches.  If amalgamation and reorganisation are desirable why does the Department not start with its own creameries?  Knocklong is an outstanding example of the necessity for rationalisation.  There are actually three intake points at Gormanstown, Knockaney and Bulgaden, all practically in the same parish.  Two of these could be closed down.  The farmers would not object.  Why does the Department not do pilot schemes of reorganisation in which costings could be carried out and the possible advantages and disadvantages scientifically assessed?</P>
    <P>The dairying industry is the most important aspect of this Supplementary Estimate as far as I am concerned. There is a subvention here for An Foras Talúntais, a grant-in-aid for general purposes.  The sum required is £96,000.  I have been critical on many occasions of the Agricultural Institute and of the fact that the benefits of the research done were not getting across <Col N="438" /> to the ordinary farmer.  I am glad there has been a tremendous improvement in liaison between the Agricultural Institute, the advisory services and the farmers' organisations in recent years.  The institute's practice of having open days in Moorepark and elsewhere to give farmers practical evidence of the value of the research done is an excellent one.  The farmers can benefit from demonstrations and lectures on the application of a particular line of research.  I want to pay tribute in particular to the tremendous work being done by the Dairy Institute at Fermoy. In the unfortunate plane crash, when the <i>St. Phelim</i> was lost off the coast, three of their outstanding dairy scientists, who had done tremendous work in the institute, were killed.  I refer particularly to the head of the milking machine section of that institute, Mr. Michael Colley.  Judging from recent seminars and open days and from comments of farmers who attended these events, I am pleased to put on record that the Agricultural Institute have devised a way of passing on to the ordinary farmers the results of their research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to one particular aspect of the Supplementary Estimate, namely, the question of dairy production generally. I intend to leave, until the principal Estimate comes before us, the other aspects of creamery rationalisation and organisation, even though I have strong feelings on these points.  I will deal also at that stage with the Pigs and Bacon Commission and An Foras Talúntais.</P>
      <P>If the 1960s have been described by some people as the dairying decade, listening to the Minister's speech one might not be unduly off the mark in suggesting that it could happen that the 1970s could end up being described as the dairying debacle.  There is a great need for more political honesty and objectivity in dealing with the financial subventions involved. The Minister over the past six months particularly, and this morning, in introducing this Estimate, reminds me of a punch-drunk boxer.  Deputy Blaney has retained a good deal of his defensive ability and of rather natty footwork.</P>

      <P>The Minister has become a rather punch-drunk Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Regrettably, he seems to be devoid of imagination or a sense of policy innovation in bringing to the Irish people a sharp, much-needed reappraisal of agricultural policy, notably in the milk production sphere.  We are moving into an extremely urgent and critical situation in respect of price supports for milk.  Whether the 110,000 dairy farmers in this country like it or not, we are moving into a situation when almost one-half of the total Estimate of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries goes towards milk support.  The enormity, significance and true relativity of this particular fact of life must be appreciated. I will not go into the semantics of dissecting the £31 million, as many critics have done.  I would stress, and repeatedly emphasise, the grave national policy implications of the situation where milk support has risen from £8 million in 1965 to £31 million in 1970.  It has not risen from any conscious agricultural policy, philosophy or attitude on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are a pragmatic party.  They respond to pressures and hope, year by year, to get out of the difficulties into which they tend to work themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy which has been followed has been a pragmatic one.  Milk price support has risen greatly.  There has been an increase of £23 million over five years.  I suggest that this elementary statistic contains implications of the utmost gravity both for the dairy farmers themselves and for the tax-payers of the nation as a whole.  There are even more serious implications for the very future of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries himself, who <Col N="440" /> is attempting to do a mild about-turn in the hope that the trend will not tend to escalate in the seventies to impossible proportions.</P>
    <P>I admire the aggressive, competent and imaginative marketing techniques of Bord Bainne.  The reality of the situation is that the board themselves got from the State about £11 million a year in order to process, manufacture and export one of the most unprofitable and unexportable commodities: butter and other dairy products.  No amount of pleading in this House or of denunciation of the Government&mdash; much as the Government might deserve castigation for trying to defend the indefensible&mdash;can obscure the fact that in the EEC stores there are half-a-million tons of butter.  I recall Deputy Cronin, the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, writing in glowing terms about the Common Market in the Farming Supplement to the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Deputy Crowley goes into a spiritual frenzy when one mentions the Common Market.  I feel the people of Ireland should be aware that this huge store of butter exists in the EEC.  It is about time that that fact dawned on Deputy Crowley and then he might be less ardent in his attitude about our entry into the Common Market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I make that point to the Government benches just as much as I make it to the Opposition or to anyone else.  While we can congratulate An Bord Bainne for increasing our butter exports to Britain and throughout the world from £24 million in 1966 to £32 million in 1970, an increase of about 33? per cent or about eight per cent per annum, which is a rather creditable performance, nevertheless the senior executives of the board would be the first to admit that bearing in mind the glut on the European scene for dairy products generally, and bearing in mind that the general world dairy market situation has become even further depressed in the last two years, I am not being unduly gloomy or pessimistic in my comments. I am simply stating facts to the House <Col N="441" /> because the dairy farmers as of now having built up their herds and invested a massive amount in cattle and in the industry generally may be working in cow stalls which in many respects may be built on the quicksands of a European butter surplus of exceptionally large proportions.  For political reasons I do not think the Minister is prepared to face these facts.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which reference has been made here is margarine consumption. We should be honest with ourselves about this.  I watched many Deputies consuming butter in the Dáil restaurant and I only wish that all Irish families could consume it in relative proportions but there is the hard fact, as has been stated time and again, that this country in terms of butter consumption is one of the world's leaders.  The figure is 34 lbs per head of population per annum and I do not think that the consumption of 20,000 or 25,000 tons of margarine consumption is going to lead to a catastrophe or cause redundancy among dairy farmers.  There is another fact of life and it is about time we came to grips with it and that is that the margarine manufacturers have produced a rather attractive and certainly an edible butter substitute which is increasingly capturing a share&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>God be with the days of the school of commerce in Cork.  That is all I say.  I would suggest that no efforts should be made <Col N="442" /> to whip up hysteria over the consumption of margarine.  Because of the tremendous consumption of butter by our people I cannot see butter being supplanted that easily.  Of course, there is the elementary price factor.  Far be it from me to suggest that the price of butter should be reduced but there is the cold fact that the vast majority of families, even families of small farmers, cannot afford to buy butter at its current price.  I would be as loath to suggest a reduction in the price of butter as I would be to suggest a reduction in the price of milk for domestic consumption in urban areas.  There are many families who have to limit their consumption because of the price factor.  This is something we should bear in mind in regard to a lot of the hyprocisy expressed in relation to our consumption of butter and milk.</P>
      <P>These are the main points which I wish to make but I intend to speak at much greater length on the main Estimate.  Speaking in principle rather than in general the proposal to rationalise the structure of the industry must receive support.  In general, nobody would be opposed in principle to this rationalisation and restructuring of the creameries, particularly in Munster.  The proposal has an inherent logic and commonsense.  However, I am appalled by what I can only describe as the political playacting indulged in by successive Ministers. Frankly, I want to draw a distinction here; as one who was a servant of the trade union movement I always distinguished between the servants of the Minister so-called and the Minister himself.  The gyrations of successive Ministers for Agriculture in regard to rationalisation proposals have destroyed the elementary logic and commonsense in these proposals just as they have done in regard to the rationalisation of pig production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of ground has to be made up and I am perturbed to note that once again the Minister says he is going to set up another group to study the rationalisation proposals.  I hope the present impasse between the Government and the IAOS as regards who precisely has responsibility ultimately, <Col N="443" /> will be resolved.  It is a rather sorry picture generally and one which does not reflect very much credit all round. I would support, by and large, the Minister's attempt, belated in many respects, to introduce and develop more effectively the beef cattle incentive scheme.  I certainly hope that in the two years ahead we will have even greater emphasis by the Minister on that.  Under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement there should be an increase in the Irish beef export quota now at 25,000 tons.  I hope the Minister's negotiations will be successful in that regard.  I certainly assure him of our support.  I feel that we can get slightly better terms, but from the discussions I have had with Members of the British Government I am not entirely hopeful.  I make that as a purely personal comment.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note from the Minister's speech that in the past ten months the factories slaughtered some 35,000 bullocks and heifers more than in the corresponding period of 1968-69. This substantial decline in the store cattle export trade of something in the region of 67,000 and the change-over to the meat export business is welcome in terms of the growth of through-put employment and in exports from the meat exporting plants themselves.  In terms of change-over these are hopeful indicators for the future.  I have made these comments in passing in an attempt to introduce some air of reality about the policy implications of the milk subsidy itself.  It is about time this House began to sit down and examine it.  I would even suggest that there might usefully be, as we have repeatedly suggested, an all-party committee on, say, agricultural price support. I feel it would be somewhat more enlightening than the kinds of across-the-floor debates we have and, much as I would not welcome sitting with Deputy Crowley on such a committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I feel it would not be terribly enlightening for either of us&mdash;I would suggest that an all-party <Col N="444" /> committee might be quite useful. I hesitate to call it a crisis at present but, in the early seventies it could become a major policy crisis.  But however intractable the problems may appear to be, nevertheless they must be approached in a spirit of general co-operation. Although the Minister is a man of very considerable ability and competence, I am afraid he has outlived his usefulness and he has not made the contribution which he could have made if he had been less personally involved, less emotional and less vindictive&mdash;I do not use these terms lightly&mdash;in his relations with the farming organisations, and if he had been less prone to play party politics in their crudest form with the farming community for narrow party advantage. The Minister has an opportunity in the remaining months or years, before we have the next Cabinet change, to redeem himself by working in a more constructive way.</P>
      <P>These are my views.  I have deliberately confined them to the question of milk production.</P>

      <P>We have listened to Deputy Desmond utilising this Supplementary Estimate not to speak about agriculture but, by the juggling of figures, to try to mislead and dismay the farmers with a false image and to make them believe that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries do very little about the matters for which they are responsible.  I realise the relevance so far as the Labour Party are concerned of Deputy Desmond's suggestion for an all-party committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> One matter that concerns me is glasshouse grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Not again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the glasshouse grants was more than welcome by the small farmers in the Rush, Lusk and Skerries areas and generally in County Dublin.  However, I feel that the Department, when they introduced these grants, made a bad mistake by not putting a maximum ceiling on the grant any individual could get.  That led to a drastic situation, which revealed itself only afterwards. I deplore the attitude of the Department in having allowed that to continue for over a year and a half without taking any steps to stop the big combines from putting up four and five acres of glass and obtaining a grant which they did not deserve, a grant which did not benefit the small farmers but merely increased the acreage of glass in existence.  It was specified, when this scheme was introduced, that one must erect more than an acre of glass to qualify.  I am glad to see that in this Supplementary Estimate the Minister has introduced a ceiling of £25,000 as a maximum grant.  I should like to see him specifying here and now that no big combines can come in and avail of this grant.  The small farmers in County Dublin, and in other areas where glasshouse culture is a means of living, are being deprived.  How can they compete against a man who erects five acres of glass or against a combine of six or seven people?  How can we ask them to compete in the same market?  I realise that, when we enter the Common Market, all will be fish in the same pool.  But the benefits being provided by the Department should be mainly for the small man.  I would ask the Minister to specify that no big combines will be given a grant under the glasshouse scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see the reduction to a ceiling of £25,000, but I regret to see that the ceiling of £40,000 is to stand for current applicants.  This means even the big fellows can still obtain the £40,000 grant.  I realise the Minister's dilemma here and I want to say this particular Minister for Agriculture who comes under so much criticism in this <Col N="446" /> House was not responsible for the introduction of this scheme but he is responsible for the amendment.  The £40,000 maximum which has been granted to the present applicants, I understand from my inquiries, means that we have to maintain that ceiling. Let us hope it will be diminished very shortly.  I ask the Minister to take cognisance of the fact that the small man will have to be facilitated here.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is very interested in the small man irrespective of what Deputy Desmond and Deputy Tom O'Donnell have to say about his betrayal of the small farmer.  The Minister, in all his incentive schemes, has introduced them solely for the benefit of the small farmers.  I would like to see a compulsory grading system introduced with regard to produce grown in glasshouse.  This is necessary if we are to maintain stability in the sale of our produce abroad and compete for the English market.  I would ask the Minister to have this done in the case of tomatoes.  I asked a question about this not so long ago and the answer I was given was that the matter was under consideration.  I hope that as a result of that consideration a compulsory grading system will be introduced this year in order to maintain quality of production.</P>
    <P>The advisory service for horticulture comes under An Foras Talúntais. I would like to say that up to now personnel have been used for the purpose of glasshouse grants, which meant that producers were deprived of the specialist advice they needed.  The Minister should now designate personnel to look after this work exclusively. Such personnel would be of great benefit to tomato growers who need advice and help with regard to plant diseases, of which there are a growing number.  Field specialists do tremendous work.  I should like to see more of them appointed and to see them having no obligation other then to inspect glasshouses.  They should be employed for the sole purpose of helping tomato growers.</P>
    <P>We waste a lot of money in this industry and quite recently we had an example of this.  I am not sure who was responsible for it but I would like <Col N="447" /> the Minister to let us know in his reply exactly who was responsible.  There was an economist from England brought over here, a Dr. Folly, to review the situation regarding our prospects in the tomato industry.  This man paid two visits to Ireland.  I do not know exactly how much he was paid but whatever it was it was too much because it came out of the pockets of the farmers.  He revealed nothing.  I have asked for his report but we have not got it.  He was unaware of the export figures for tomatoes from the Republic in 1969 on his first visit. This individual, who was probably very well versed, a well-educated man and capable of doing his job, came over here but revealed nothing.  Why should we ask an Englishman to come over here and tell us what we should be doing to compete with his own country?  Surely we have qualified people here and should utilise them? There are people in the Department of Agriculture quite capable of instructing people in the growing of tomatoes and reviewing the possibilities of exports.</P>
    <P>While I am on this point I would like to say that we are encouraging people to grow more tomatoes and to erect more glasshouses but we are not doing enough in regard to exportation. It is only for one or two months in the year, when there is a scarcity on the English market, that we can export our produce.  Some groups have started up on their own very successfully and have exported quite large quantities.  There is one group known as the Sunripe group who are very successful but are getting no assistance.  They have to compete with people who do not grade.  Everybody should be asked to grade.  If the produce is exactly matched, growers can compete successfully.  When some non-graded Irish tomatoes appear on the English market they are classified as seconds.  That should not be the case because our tomatoes are as good as those produced in Guernsey or any other of the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words regarding wheat productions.  I do not regard myself as an expert on this subject but I do regard myself as better than Deputy Desmond who <Col N="448" /> spoke about it a few minutes ago. The principal problem here is that we have a completely wrong system in regard to which we are, so to speak, nailing our own colours to the mast. Last year we introduced a levy which was costly to introduce and costly to implement, which is not completely accurate and very difficult to administer. A farmer should know what he will get for his wheat crop.  I realise that the farmers have had it very good for the past three years and a certain amount of money has to be returned to the Exchequer.  That is quite acceptable, particularly to those growing wheat, but there must be a different system for administering the industry. There is too much instability.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that we should accept the contract system for wheat growing.  Under that system the small farmer would be facilitated.  If we are giving contracts we should give them to the small farmer because the big fellow can stand on his own. As well as a contract system there should be a system for growing soft wheat for which our climate is suitable. We all know that there are grave difficulties regarding harvesting of wheat.  We got away with it for the last three years because we had good harvests but we will not get away with it for another three years.</P>
    <P>We were lucky last year, we had a surplus of wheat because of the good weather which resulted in high yields. In order to avoid having a surplus of unmillable wheat we should encourage farmers to grow soft wheats.  Prices should be stabilised at, say, £3 or £3 5s. a barrel for soft wheat, with 35 barrels to the Irish acre.  The Department of Agriculture and An Foras Talúntais are working on soft wheats.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is considering the levy next year&mdash;it is too late for this year&mdash;he should take the question of instability into account.  The farmers are never certain as to what they will get for a barrel of wheat.  The farmer will be satisfied if he knows that he will get 85/- or 90/- for a barrel of millable wheat or 65/- for a barrel of soft wheat. There is no reason why land that yielded wheat last year cannot <Col N="449" /> do so this year.  The possibilities of eyespot and other diseases are being carefully watched by farmers and they are knowledgeable enough now, with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, about the necessity for rotating crops in order to avoid these hazards.  This would eliminate the necessity for a supplementary sum for wheat growing.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed that the Minister did not give an increase of 2/- per barrel to barley growers.  An increase of 2/- would bring the price per barrel to 50/-.  I realise if this were done the cost of pig feed would automatically be increased.  However, barley growers deserve an increase.</P>
    <P>A supplementary sum has been provided for the beef incentive bonus scheme.  I would like to see the bonus increased to £20 per head because I do not think £12 per head is enough to encourage dairy farmers to change over to beef.  We asked dairy farmers to produce a certain amount of milk and we could alleviate the problem which has arisen in the dairy industry by the introduction of £20 per head bonus for beef.  Dairy producers have spent so much money on modernisation in order to increase milk production that it is difficult to get them back into beef production, but this is what we must do.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the land project section for the immense amount of work they have done in all areas, particularly my own area.  I have always received the greatest co-operation from them.  The increased provision for this purpose is warranted because of the restoration of barren wasteland.  A land project was carried out for a group of farmers adjacent to my place and no less than 43 acres of land which had grown nothing but rushes are now growing wheat, barley, cabbage and potatoes.  Credit is due not only to the farmers but to the land project section of the Department who have shown that bad land can be made into good land.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais is a section of the Department which is out on a limb.  They work on their own initiative although they receive their money from the Department.  They warrant every penny they are getting.  I remember <Col N="450" /> Deputy T. O'Donnell, on a previous Estimate, criticising An Foras Talúntais for lack of co-operation with farmers.  We must realise that the principal task of An Foras Talúntais is not co-operating with the farmers but co-operating with the Department's officials and agricultural instructors, whose job it is to communicate with the farmers.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais in Kinsealy does a tremendous amount of research in horticulture.  Dr. Woods, who works there, is capable of carrying out any experiment and then giving lectures and instructing farmers as to his discoveries. The success of this institute is built around people like Dr. Woods and Dr. Spain.  I do not like to see this institute or the work it carries out being criticised.  They have been waiting for a long time for money to complete projects.  If occasion arises again, as I know it will because they are an expanding organisation, I hope the Minister will see to it that there is not undue delay in providing the necessary money.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has come under a barrage of criticism in regard to his agricultural policy.  The introduction of this Supplementary Estimate shows, at least, that the Minister is responding to the wants of the farmers.</P>
    <P>The relative knowledge about the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries of Deputies in the Labour Party who have spoken so far, and who have criticised the Minister, with the exception of Deputy Tully, is so small that they would need to combine with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to learn something about agriculture.  I compliment the Minister wholeheartedly on his approach and on bringing in this Supplementary Estimate.  Criticism has been hurled at him as an individual, irrespective of his capacity as Minister, but no one can criticise him for his handling of the affairs of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone should recognise that the money the House is being asked to vote is necessary if we are to support an expanding agricultural economy.  It is vital in that expanding economy that the necessary financial <Col N="451" /> injection should be forthcoming.  One can detect here and there in some statements that there are some doubts about the necessity for and the advantage of providing this money.  We all depend on agricultural expansion directly or indirectly, those of us who are engaged in agriculture more so than those outside it.  The purchasing power of the agricultural community is very important to those in trade and business in our cities, towns and villages.  It should be accepted that in an agricultural country we must maintain that impetus and continue to expand our economy.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the future, the rationalisation, the diversification and the present trends of the dairying industry.  As the Minister has said, all over the world the dairying industry seems to be in a pretty precarious position due to over-production in most countries.  Since we expanded and increased our cow population to about 1,700,000 we must accept our obligation to make provision for the milk from those herds.  Having introduced the heifer scheme to encourage the purchase of cows, and people having made those purchases, it would be unrealistic to change our economy and not to go ahead now and maintain that expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital for our cattle export trade that we maintain the herd at in or about the present figure.  It will be fully realised that the necessary subsidisation of our milk supplies must continue, although some people may have some doubts about the wisdom of that policy. Over a long period of years other countries have, per acre, injected greater sums of money into this than we have.  If and when we go into the European Economic Community, it can be assumed that we will have to continue with that policy.  Therefore, we must face the facts as they are and continue the policies that have been in operation.  Because of reports issued by different gentlemen from different countries with different ideas of how rationalisation will benefit this country, there seems to be some confusion.  In any policy of rationalisation for our dairying industry we cannot divorce <Col N="452" /> the social from the economic problems. They are interlocked.  Any Government which would ignore the social problems in any area would be ignoring the needs of the people, and no Government can afford to do that.</P>
    <P>In the western counties, in areas not blessed with fertile land, over a period of years the Dairy Disposal Board has been in operation and has built up a rather sound economy.  This was very important for the farmers in rather difficult times and with low prices in the cattle trade.  It would be well to consider seriously whether any rationalisation should be undertaken without preserving the security of the farmers, small or big, who reside in those areas. That is very important long-term policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the two-tier milk price, I have known many people who, with extensive manuring, the employment of family labour, and long hard hours of work, increased the capacity and output of their herds.  They now find that they are not as fully rewarded as they deserve to be.  I would ask the Minister to consider the people in the pilot areas and in the western counties &mdash;areas to which we claim to be anxious to give particular attention&mdash;and, when there is expansion on a small farm, the people should not be penalised for the additional milk output.  If we argue that a man who produces more should be penalised, then we should say to the pig producer who keeps a big number of pigs that he should take a smaller price, or to the man who produces more cattle that he should take a smaller price.  That would be very unsound reasoning.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of grants for forage harvesters and other machinery like that.  Hay balers are becoming increasingly popular in many areas where the youth are not content to remain on the land.  People in the older age group find this hay baling system most helpful and easy to use to feed stock. I would recommend that the Minister would seriously consider giving to committees of agriculture a grant to encourage the purchase of hay balers.  We must face the fact that some of the youth are not inclined to stay on the <Col N="453" /> land and the older people find these machines very helpful.</P>
    <P>Since the Local Authorities (Works) Act was suspended, there is nothing really to take its place which would give an opportunity to farmers to drain small rivers from which there is much flooding.  Everyone knows that if there is not good drainage you cannot fertilise properly or have good output. Neither the Land Commission, the Board of Works, nor any other Government Department will accept responsibility for this type of drainage.  Some years ago when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, was Minister for Agriculture he consulted with the representatives from the western counties and he recommended and encouraged the doing of this work by the land project.  Previous to that there were restrictions to certain widths of waterways which prevented the Board of Works undertaking work on narrow little streams.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has the initiative to deal with demands and complaints from committees of agriculture and local authorities about drainage by enabling work to be done under the land project.  It would then be possible to undertake field drainage.  I have been listening to complaints for years particularly in Clare from county councillors and urban councillors, and I hope the Minister will agree this work should be done under the land project.</P>
    <P>Every encouragement should be given to farmers to avail of the farm incentive bonus scheme.  The bonus should be increased in respect of farmers who have undertaken this work because in each case there has been an increase in production.</P>
    <P>On the question of brucellosis, in any county where there is a breakdown, the Minister's veterinary staff should track down as fast as possible the source of the breakdown.  I have seen rapid progress made by that bug which causes injury to a herd whereupon ten or twelve cows have to be destroyed.  Many farmers cannot afford the loss of a whole herd and they cannot meet their obligations and come back to production without some assistance.  Therefore, I would ask the <Col N="454" /> Minister to consider giving replacements to such farmers.  They are isolated cases but when they occur the farmers concerned are in real trouble.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also consider increasing the grant under the single suckled cow scheme?  He could afford to give much more money and it would still be a saving to the Exchequer if he did.</P>

While all of us recognise the valuable work done by Bord Bainne and those who promote the sales of Irish dairy produce it is difficult to understand why we have not done much better.  I would ask the Minister to examine closely the reason for that.  The British are our nearest customers.  Our goods arrive there fresh and in good condition, and a more intensive sales promotion drive might achieve better results.  The people on the job probably know how to do their work but we would like to see this country getting a greater share in that market, particularly as we are very good customers of theirs.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has his finger on the pulse of the community he should realise it is necessary to have regular negotiations with various bodies such as the youth movement, the NFA, the ICMSA and the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  Their views represent the grass roots, the thoughts of the people, and by keeping in contact with those organisations the Minister would be in a position to understand and to meet the needs of the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the farm buildings scheme and water supplies, on a <Col N="455" /> few occasions there has been some slowness in arriving at an apportionment of grants as between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Local Government. I would ask the Minister to look into this matter and see what can be done to speed up payment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he would consider the extension of pilot areas where there has been an outstanding improvement in every aspect of farming.  It is necessary to ensure that, in areas in which there are smallholdings, where the soil is of poor quality and where there is congestion, these people get priority.  They have remained on the land through thick and thin and until the time comes when we have industries that will absorb the population in those congested districts we should give them all the necessary help.</P>
    <P>This is not an occasion for discussing all the different headings in agriculture but I should like to express my appreciation to the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary for the help they have often given me. They have always found time to attend to problems brought to their notice by people in my county and I hope this will continue.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister speak this morning and left the House as I did not intend to speak on this Supplementary Estimate.  However, the fact that many years ago as a young man I studied the economics of agriculture has inevitably drawn me back into the House.</P>
      <P>When I heard the Minister speak this morning my sympathies were with him and I shall not end on a different note.  However, I have one note of criticism of the Minister.  On page 13 of the Minister's brief it is stated:</P>
      <P>The fine summer and late autumn of 1969 resulted in an exceptionally large number of Land Project works being completed.</P>
      <P>In the last paragraph it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thanks to sound policies, agriculture has now had three consecutive good years marked by substantial <Col N="456" /> increases in agricultural cutput, prices and incomes.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not think Government policy had much to do with the better prices for cattle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the weather had a lot more to do with it.  However, that is my last real criticism of the Minister.  We are now discussing a Supplementary Estimate of £9 million which I certainly consider a large sum of money.  Of this sum there is an extra £4 million in respect of subsidies for the dairy industry.  All my forebears have been dairy farmers; I did not come from County Meath or Dublin or even from County Donegal. The Minister was very fair today because my information is that 80 per cent of the total of £31 million for milk goes to seven counties.  In essence this is a subsidy to the Golden Vale, or is it the &ldquo;Golden Vein&rdquo;?  Deputy Crowley might be able to help me on this as there are differences of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>If 80 per cent goes to the &ldquo;Golden Vein&rdquo;, the fact is that County Limerick, North Cork and part of County Tipperary take a large part of this money.  I must speak the truth as I see it regarding this Supplementary Estimate.  There is no question but that this £31 million is a very substantial part of gross Government expenditure for a year that will end in a few weeks time.  The Minister quite honestly told us that it is going to go up another £4 or £5 million next year and he was being conservative on this point.  I have every sympathy with the Minister because I do not believe one penny of this money goes to the Minister's own county.  I do not think that worries the Minister unduly; he has other methods of looking after his political survival.  If the Minister would like to say something on this I am prepared to listen.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in an awkward spot in this matter.  If 80 per cent of this money goes to seven counties, the great bulk of farmers in this country do not benefit from this enormous subsidy.  A year ago the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries at long last&mdash;and I say this deliberately&mdash;decided to subsidise nurse herds, and this was a great improvement. It will save a great deal of money and put the taxpayers' money into a project that is worthwhile.  However, there is a snag and I should like the Minister to deal with this point.  My information is that a subsidy is not given for the first two cows in a nurse herd.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to these things in his speech.  I have sympathy with the Minister in a very awkward situation.  If one wants to distribute this subsidy fairly and squarely throughout the agricultural community then one must distribute it fairly and squarely.  There is the inclination not to give it for the first cow; after the first cow it should be given for every other cow.  Why was it decided not to give it for the first two cows?  I am a city Deputy but my forebears came from the dairying area of Munster and I think it is wrong not to give this subsidy for the second cow.  Probably the reason governing the decision not to give the subsidy for the first two cows in a nurse herd was because the local veterinary surgeon, the local doctor, or someone else, might have two cows to ensure that there would be one cow always to provide butter and milk for the family.  But this is not fair. Here I should like to quote a little bit of medieval Irish:</P>
      <P>Go réidh a bheann na dtrí mbó</P>
      <P>As do bólacht ná bí teann</P>
      <P>Do bhonnacais bean gan gó</P>
      <P>Agus ba dhá mhó a beann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Take it easy, O woman of three cows. I met a woman once and she had twice as many cows.&rdquo;  I could understand the first cow being excluded and I approve wholeheartedly of such exclusion. I thought, indeed, that the Department was extremely slow in getting on to this.  Dr. Crotty of Aberystwith pointed out that this was the way out of this awkward and difficult <Col N="458" /> situation.  Eventually, the Department did get on to it.  I still believe the Department should give a subsidy for every cow after the first where these nurse herds are concerned.  I have seen farms on which there was only one cow and yet there was a calf suckling that cow after she had been milked. My friend, Deputy O'Sullivan, could tell me what happens when you finally want to get milk off that cow.  It is a somewhat difficult job physically, but a calf can do it quite easily.  I have seen a cow provide milk for the household and suckle a calf at the same time.</P>
    <P>I have not a great deal of sympathy with certain parts of the Golden Vale.  First of all, the dairy farmers there do not pay any income tax and, secondly, 50 per cent of the population of County Limerick have medical cards, whereas only 15 per cent of the population of the city of Dublin have medical cards.  To my way of thinking this is not a fair distribution of the resources available in the affluent society.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite truthful this morning when he said that the subsidy to dairy farmers is now four times what it was in 1963-64.  I remember when I contested an election in 1965 and attacked this subsidy during my campaign, hook, line and sinker.  The subsidy was then £15 million.  I heard one Deputy say here that a man with 45 acres of land might produce 20,000 gallons of milk and would, therefore, be mulcted by the Minister.  I do not think this is a rational interpretation of what happens.  One of the main difficulties is that so much of our land is owned by old people and, while it is, we will not get increased production. We will never improve agriculture if we do not remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's decision to have this two-tier price system for milk.  I know it has been stated publicly that there are people in certain parts of the country who go in motor cars to draw the dole.  But we cannot deal with exceptions.  We cannot legislate for exceptions.  The Minister and his Department were quite right in introducing this two-tier price system for milk.  I disagree with those who say you should subsidise people who do <Col N="459" /> not pay any income tax and who have, in fact, very substantial incomes.  Compare those with the unfortunate man who has £1,000 a year and two or three children here in the city of Dublin; he has £20 a week and he has to pay income tax.  Side by side with that you have this enormous subsidy for the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>We have a good deal of propaganda from the managing director of An Bord Bainne.  We have had a number of statements from him as to what should be done for the dairying industry. He has gone so far as to suggest, I think, that we should prohibit the import of vegetable oils used in the manufacture of margarine.  I have no medical qualifications and I do not know whether margarine is better than butter from the point of view of preventing heart attacks.  There was a time when I despised margarine; I even hated to think of it.  Since I had a little physical trouble last year now, when I am given a choice between butter and margarine, I use margarine.  This may well be due to propaganda, but I do not think it is altogether that.  It is entirely wrong to subsidise the comparatively wealthy farmers of the Golden Vale.  They are engaged in milk production.  Deputy Crowley understands this situation.</P>

During the campaign to eliminate bovine TB it was found that 40 per cent of the cows in the Golden Vale had this disease.  The campaign was moved to County Sligo where only 6 per cent of the cows had bovine TB.  Nobody need tell me that the Golden Vale is not more salubrious for cattle than County Sligo.  The Sligoman is much tougher.</P>

      <P>There has been a long tradition on the British market of low prices for food.  One of our difficulties is that the British market is our main market. We have to rely on the British market for an export outlet for our dairy products. We may only get 3/- a lb for butter but that is better than 1/- a lb elsewhere.  From a world social point of view there is something to be said for the affluent people of the Republic of Ireland supporting these underdeveloped countries.

      <P>In a leading article in <i>The Economist</i> it was stated that the majority of those who voted for all three parties in Britain were against going into the EEC.  I was told by one of my colleagues that it was a political gimmick on my part to be against going into the EEC.  It was conviction of my colleagues that it was a political gimmick on my part to be against were in a common market for 120 years and this country did extremely badly in that big common market. The EEC would be worse.  I know the difficulties.  I read the documents and so on but I think the euphoria in this country at the time was extraordinary. To be fair to the NFA&mdash; they would not say it publicly&mdash;they tumbled to it a few years ago that if we went into the EEC, agriculture would not do nearly as well as the academics were telling them in 1960 and 1961.  The example that has always stayed in my mind was the occasion when the French wanted to sell 10,000 old cows to Germany and it took them six months to do so.  We have 10,000 old cows every fortnight.</P>

      <P>This is a very large Supplementary Estimate.  I think there is a grave difficulty in regard to the dairy produce business which is a very ancient one here.  Going back into the economic history of Munster it was a major industry.  It was included by a writer in the &ldquo;maritime part&rdquo; of the country, that being the progressive part of the country and there was the old <Col N="462" /> Cork butter market and so on.

As regards his remarks about the Common Market and the euphoric feeling he seems to think we have about going into the Common Market I can assure him that nobody feels euphoric about it.  We know that if we do go into EEC we shall have a tough battle and that we shall get nothing easily.  Our argument is that if Britain go into the Common Market we have no alternative but to go in also.  The best indication available to us at present is the impossibility for us of exporting our cattle to the EEC.  We cannot do it because there is a threshold levy of £80 per beast going into the EEC.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very important decision for us and Deputy O'Donovan is rightly concerned about the realities and consequences of going into Europe.  Personally, I do not look forward to it <Col N="463" /> with any delight.  We shall have the toughest possible battle on the industrial side but we shall have certain benefits on the agricultural side which are pretty obvious which we shall not get if we are inefficient.  I think it was Deputy O'Donnell who spoke about the necessity for improving the quality of our milk and the necessity for improving all our produce which is available for export.  It was coincidental that Deputy Dr. O'Donovan should ask me about dumping because his colleague Deputy Thornley asked me the same question on television one night. Having waded through the Rome Treaty and tried to absorb as much as possible from it, I would not be complacent about the possibility of dumping which could have disastrous effects on the industrial and agricultural side. I said my mind was made up that if Britain went in we had no alternative but to do likewise because otherwise we would be isolated with no outlet for our agricultural produce.  It is a reasonably simple decision.</P>

This may not be the view of everybody in the party but it is my view that we have no alternative and we should be making all the necessary preparations in the meantime to ensure that we are viable and efficient when we go in.  No Minister for Agriculture to my knowledge has done more than the present Minister for Agriculture to press forward this idea. He has fulfilled the most important function any Minister can undertake in that he has improved the lot of the less well-off members of the agricultural community.  All future developments I think should be directed solely to those who find it hard to make a decent living in agriculture.</P>

      <P>Deputy Meaney and myself always work in co-operation <Col N="467" /> with each other.  We have represented mid-Cork for four years and we have made it thrive.</P>
      <P>Let me come now to the question of the rationalisation of creameries.  I do not often disagree with Deputy Creed who criticised the setting-up by the Minister of the committee to look into this whole question.  I imagine that the types of men the Minister would ask to consider the matter would be economists and accountants who can judge the advantages to the people in the various areas where amalgamation would take place&mdash;or maybe where it should not take place.  I do not think that anybody knows for certain whether amalgamation in this context is good or bad.  I agree with Deputy Taylor that we must consider not only the economic but also the social factors involved.  The Minister said the social, economic and national considerations had to be investigated.</P>
      <P>This brings to my mind the people of the Coachford area who have to go into the Ballyclough creamery.  That is fair enough, but there are people involved in the proposed rationalisation of creameries who are prejudiced. There is a certain amount of political chicanery and of coercion on farmers to make decisions one way or another, and the matter is so vital that the Minister was right to set up a committee to investigate the whole idea of rationalisation.  I suppose the easy answer is that rationalisation would work in some cases and that in others it would not.</P>
      <P>When a farmer is told he will get 3d a gallon more for his milk he should have available to him information to enable him to calculate how much per annum net this would mean to him.  There are many factors that should be pointed out to the producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had not intended to speak at length on the Estimate but there is still one more matter I should like to discuss. I addressed some Parliamentary questions to the Minister last week in reference to the Bord Bainne visit to Japan. I asked for the reasons for the visit, the duration of the visit and the results of the visit.  Although many people <Col N="468" /> maintain that Bord Bainne are doing a reasonably good job, there is another volume of opinion that they are getting a bit stale in doing their job, that they are not as efficient as they might be.</P>
    <P>In any case, the answer to my question was that five officers of Bord Bainne visited Japan for durations of four days, four days, four days, eight days and 15 days respectively.  These visits were, one, to discuss and to investigate various aspects of markets in Japan for dairy produce, two, to establish contact with the principal users and importers of dairy produce, three, to open an office of the board in Osaka and four, to arrange for the board's participation in Expo 70 in Osaka.  The Minister's reply gave the result of this visit as the arrangement for the first shipping of Irish cheddar cheese and the first order since 1965 for skim milk.  The long-term results, the reply stated, could not be evaluated yet.</P>
    <P>We all welcome any sales we can make anywhere, but I wonder how economic is it to send out five officers for a total of 31 days in all to Japan for this sort of immediate meagre return.  I know there may be long-term returns but I should like to know that there will be more positive immediate results.  I wonder about the five officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 43 people Bord Fáilte sent out recently? I got the information from a reply to a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was right to ask the question because there is need for close examination of the reasons why any State body should send 43 people out of the State.  The same can be said about Bord Bainne. There may be logical explanations for this and I hope the Minister in his reply will inform us why it was necessary to send five people to Japan on four different occasions and whether he thinks the journeys were worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a question on the same day about the sales of butter in the Six Counties because I have been informed that in the Nationalist areas there, in <Col N="469" /> Derry and in Belfast, Irish butter cannot be bought because the agents appointed by Bord Bainne are afraid to go into the Nationalist areas.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of that.  If he is not, I hope he will investigate it.  If that is the case we have either appointed the wrong agents or possibly appointed people for the wrong reasons, and it is time we appointed the right agents for the right reasons.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate the Minister's views on the functions of Bord Bainne in Japan and, indeed, in other countries. For the record, Bord Bainne on the whole have been doing a reasonably good job.  However, it is our duty as Deputies elected by the people to represent them to ensure that no matter how good a job they are doing that there is always room for improvement. In my view they are doing a good job but I hope the Minister will see where improvements can be made.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly, particularly because we shall be discussing the main Estimate later in the year and there are many aspects of agriculture that I will discuss.  Any rural Deputy if he is honest will admit that the people in his constituency, the farming community I mean, have been doing reasonably well during the past three years.  Please God they will do even better.  However, there are still a number of people involved in agriculture&mdash;I know Deputy O'Donovan will not agree&mdash;who need still more assistance.  There are people involved in farming, as I have said on more than one occasion, whose units are so small that they cannot possibly make a living at farming and they have not the ability or the talents to do anything else. These people need more assistance.</P>
    <P>I suggest that any further assistance to agriculture by way of subvention be paid to the smaller farmers.  The big ranchers have no worry whatever. They are the elite, the wealthiest in my community, with more than 200, 300 or 400 acres.  They are doing very well and I do not think anything extra should go to them.  However, there is a very strong case for further subvention to the smaller farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan spoke about a <Col N="470" /> £31 million subsidy to the dairying industry.  That is undoubtedly a considerable sum of money.  There is a lot of tax collecting in that amount. Nevertheless, it is vital for our economy that our agricultural industry be subsidised so that we can export and get in much-needed foreign capital. As an economist, he will appreciate the necessity to subsidise at times in order to provide this much-needed revenue to establish industries in locations convenient to these farmers to enable them to make a decent living by part-time farming and part-time industrial employment.  This would be a good move on the part of any industrialist because the young fellow from the farm would be much more used to hard work than his counterpart from the city.  The industrialist who would do this would have fewer labour problems. We all know how bedevilled we are with those problems at present but this is not the occasion on which to talk about such problems.</P>

      <P>I certainly read that passage in the Minister's speech in which he quoted the message of the NFA in their Year Book.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must attach special importance to the decision of Council ... that all future subventions to agriculture wherever practicable must be applied so as to be of maximum benefit to the smaller farms, and <Col N="471" /> must diminish progressively on a sliding scale as the size of the enterprise increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. Perhaps the NFA did not mean it to be interpreted literally but I would urge the Minister to interpret it literally and only apply it to the small farms.</P>
      <P>I consider the future bright for agriculture. We have come a long way in this regard and we are gradually reaching the state of efficiency we would wish so that when we enter the EEC we will be able to take our place there and get our share of the market.  I think everybody on all sides of the House will agree that there is no better man or no more knowledgeable man than the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to lead us into Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are at a slight disadvantage in approaching this Estimate in so far as some of us did not realise that it would cover such a wide field since it was billed merely as a Supplementary Estimate.  Therefore, this debate on agriculture may be completed in one day and this would appear to be out of proportion to the importance of agriculture to the community.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to consider the position with regard to liquid milk producers and I quote from the Minister's speech in this regard where he refers to the disposal of surplus milk:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the surplus is an integral and essential part of the liquid trade operations I have arranged, as I announced in January, that the disposal of the surplus will in future be financed from funds derived by the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards from a levy on all sales of liquid milk in their respective areas.  These new arrangements will have only a negligible effect on the Exchequer bill for creamery milk support in the current financial year but in a full year <Col N="472" /> they should yield a saving to the Exchequer of the order of £300,000.</P>
    <P>I understand that the levy which is to be put on liquid milk producers in the Dublin Milk Board area will bring in approximately £260,000 to the Exchequer.  I understand also that the actual cost of disposing of the surplus in the same area in a year is in the region of £130,000 so that a sum of £130,000 will be collected but which will not be needed to meet the cost of the disposal.  In other words, it would appear that the levy of twopence per gallon is twice as much as is necessary.  The Minister should consider the advisability of reducing this levy and thereby relieving liquid milk producers of this extra burden.  I must point out, however, that I am putting this suggestion forward in a tentative manner as my figures may not be absolutely watertight but from the figures and information available to me it would appear that the levy is greater than is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is an almost unanswerable case for a substantial increase in the price paid to liquid milk producers for their products.  As the House is aware, the last increase they received became operative on the 1st May, 1967, but in the years since then the cost of milk production has increased considerably. As a result of these increased costs and the price of milk remaining static, milk producers have suffered a serious depletion in their standard of living. Agricultural wages have increased by about £4 10/- per week since then &mdash;an increase that was long overdue. Also, the cost of feedingstuffs has gone up by about 10 or 12 per cent since May of 1967 and feedingstuffs comprise an increasingly large percentage of the outlay of the liquid milk producer. In addition to these increased costs, fertilisers have gone up by about 10 per cent and rates have increased on an average by 33 per cent.  It should, therefore, be obvious that an increase in milk prices is long overdue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the £12 beef cattle incentive scheme it appears to be declared Government policy that this scheme should have the effect of encouraging farmers to transfer from milk production to beef cattle production. <Col N="473" /> If this subsidy were doubled it would be a saving for the State in an odd way.  At the moment it costs the Exchequer £30 per annum in price support to keep a cow in creamery milk supply.  If you were to increase this grant from £12 to £24 per year you would effect a much greater rate of transfer of cows out of creamery milk production into single suckling.  The cost to the State of their being in single suckling would come to about £24, as I am proposing, but you would be effecting a saving of £30 in the price support which otherwise you would be paying if the cow stayed in creamery milk supply.  Therefore, although you would be increasing the State subsidy in one way, you would be decreasing another form of State support to a great extent.  Therefore, as it is wise Government policy to encourage a transfer from milk to beef production in view of the prospects in the EEC and the wider world market, an increase in this grant should be given careful consideration.</P>
    <P>At present, as far as I understand it, herd owners selling milk or milk products who are prepared to switch over entirely to beef production may apply to participate in the scheme.  Many farmers with high overheads in creamery milk production find it difficult suddenly to change over entirely and therefore they are hesitant about taking this step.  It would be helpful if we could devise a way of giving this incentive scheme to people who are remaining in creamery milk supply at a reduced level on an undertaking that they would gradually phase out the creamery milk element of their operations. In other words, if we could pay them this grant while allowing them to phase out this element we would encourage more of them to enter the scheme and ultimately leave creamery milk production.  At the moment they have to go out completely or not at all.  This is discouraging many of them from planning to go out.  I understand there are serious technical difficulties which the Government would encounter in the administration of such a scheme but I hope they will consider operating it in this way.  It is rather impracticable to expect them to leave all at once when <Col N="474" /> one bears in mind that the creamery milk supply industry is a highly intensive capital enterprise and farmers just cannot write off all the capital they have invested in buildings and so on all at once.  If they were allowed to let it run down on a phased basis there would be a much greater saving.</P>
    <P>To return to the point I was making about increasing the grant under the beef cattle incentive scheme, we must realise that the enterprise to which we are asking them to transfer, namely the production of beef cattle, is by comparison with the arrangements for creamery milk supplies, a very risky business in that there are much greater fluctuations in price levels and farmers' incomes in the beef enterprise than there are in milk supply at the moment. If you are going to ask people to transfer from an existing safe and relatively non-fluctuating enterprise to one which has considerable risks and considerable fluctuations you must give them substantial monetary incentives to do so.</P>
    <P>In regard to the carcase beef position, one of the main items of contention here is that our payments under the export guarantee scheme have not maintained parity with those being paid in Britain.  The Minister argues that the fact that our support does not exactly match the British level of support has not had an adverse affect on the throughput of the meat factories. He said today:</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the ten months since the beginning of the current fatstock year in April last up to the end of January, the factories slaughtered 35,000 bullocks and heifers more than in the corresponding period of 1968-69 whereas exports of store cattle were at a lower level.  In the nine months April to December, 1969, the number of store cattle exported was 67,600 head lower than in the same period in 1968.</P>
    <P>First of all, the Minister is in effect arguing that the fact that we have not kept our rate of support under the export guarantee scheme on a par with the British scheme has not had an adverse effect on our factories and in particular on the export of the products of these factories to Britain.  I contend that the figures he quotes conceal <Col N="475" /> an underlying trend, conceal the fact that this adverse effect is in fact there. There are other factors apart from the attractive terms being paid by our meat factories which have led to a relative decrease in the store trade as against the carcase beef trade.  In fact this is admitted by the Minister when he says: &ldquo;The tightness and cost of credit in Britain seem to have been one of the major causes of the lower British demand for stores.&rdquo;  In other words, the increase of carcase beef relative to stores is not as a result of generous payments being made by the Government through the export guarantee scheme to the factories.  In fact, the reason why stores have declined relative to carcase beef is because there has not been a demand in Britain for stores because of this tightness and cost of credit. The British farmers, most of whom buy our stores on credit, have not had the credit under the Jenkins squeeze. This is why they are not buying our stores; it is not because the prices offered by the meat factories are particularly attractive.  The cattle are there and the people just have to sell them to the factories because the store trade is not on.  The Minister pointed out that the total slaughterings have increased.</P>
    <P>I concede that this point is valid. However, I understand that in the 1969 calendar year slaughterings for the British market&mdash;and this is where the export guarantee scheme is effective&mdash; have actually fallen even though total slaughterings have increased.  It would appear, therefore, that despite the figure of increased slaughterings as a whole the failure to keep par with the British rate is having effect.  What has happened I understand is that there has been this chance opening in the Common Market wall and we have succeeded in getting some carcase meat into Italy at the back end of 1969 and this is why there has been an overall increase in slaughterings.  One sees, when one examines the factor of the exceptionally poor demand for our store cattle in Britain which artificially inflated our killings at home and also the factor that there has been this exceptional opening in the market in Italy for our carcase meat, that these <Col N="476" /> factors have somewhat inflated artificially the size of the carcase meat slaughterings relative to stores and that if these chance factors were removed the true effect of the Minister's failure to keep parity with the British rate would be seen in a decrease in the slaughterings in Irish meat factories. However, I may be wrong.  In fact the Minister may get away with it. Time will tell.  I feel that the complacency which he is showing is not entirely justified.</P>

      <P>A big difficulty about CBF is that the board of CBF is not selected so as to give representation to the producer interests.  The Minister himself has selected people, whom he feels he can work with well, to sit on the board of CBF.  It may be warranted from the Minister's point of view as regards achieving efficiency that he puts in people with whom he can have harmonious political relations.  However as CBF purports to act on behalf of the whole farming community in the interests of democracy and simple fair play the farming organisations and the various organisations involved in the meat trade should have the right themselves to choose their representatives on CBF and they should not have the Minister selecting people who suit him. I do not wish to cast any aspersions on those who are on CBF.  I am sure most of them are very able men.  However I do quibble with the method by which they were selected.  They should have been selected on the basis that the producer interest nominated somebody whom they wanted to represent them on CBF.  This is a bad precedent.  It is <Col N="477" /> undemocratic and does not lead to the goodwill and co-operation of all interests involved which are necessary for a healthy meat industry.  I realise too that CBF are on a very sticky wicket&mdash;if I may use a cricket metaphor&mdash;in that they must reconcile the conflicting interests of the live and dead cattle trade.  Both trades come under the umbrella of CBF.  They will have difficulty in avoiding the appearance of favouring one or other.  However, they may overcome this.  It remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>I have a little to say on sheep.  One of the significant things that we have seen in recent years is the remarkable decline in sheep numbers.  Total exports of live sheep from Ireland in 1966 were 165,000 approximately and total imports were 109,000&mdash;in other words there were more exports than imports of live sheep.  In 1967, there were 129,000 exported and 143,000 imported, more imported than exported, and again in 1968 imports exceeded exports to an even greater extent in that exports were 117,000 roughly and imports were 166,000.  This trend has been marked also by a remarkable decline in sheep numbers at home.  I suppose the Minister can say that this is because all other forms of activity have become very attractive but of course there has been Government intervention in the other spheres on a scale which there has not been in the sheep trade.  I feel that the sheep trade has a good case for improved State support if we believe that it should be maintained in proportion to other forms of agricultural activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated somewhere that the main decline has taken place in lowland areas.  He indicated his belief that this is because of a relative improvement in other forms of activity in these lowland areas.  There are other factors involved here and one is the damaging activities of stray dogs on sheep herds in the lowlands.  Dogs do not operate to the same degree in highland areas.  This menace has been increasing in recent years and there is a strong case for much more control over stray dogs.  I understand that in New Zealand which is a very important sheep producing country a farmer has a right to shoot out of hand <Col N="478" /> any dog who is seen five or ten yards inside the boundary of his land.  I would not like to come out firmly in favour of adopting such a procedure here but I suggest that this matter should be carefully investigated and consideration should be given to the position in New Zealand.  I would not like to go further than that and make a firm recommendation because I have not studied all the aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>We pass on now to the brucellosis eradication scheme.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware County Donegal was declared a brucellosis-free area in June, 1968.  Four more counties, namely, Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo have now been added to the brucellosis-free area. The further extension of the Eradication Scheme is at present under examination.</P>
    <P>Surely this could be proceeding at a faster rate than that?  The extension of the scheme is merely under examination at the moment.  The Minister needs to step up activities in brucellosis eradication not only in those five counties but over the whole country.  I should like to have some concrete indication from him when replying as to when he expects the brucellosis eradication scheme will be effectively extended to counties other than the five counties mentioned by the Minister. There is a lot to be done here.  Later, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It had been anticipated that the incidence of warble infestation in 1969 would have been at much the same level as in 1968 when approximately 160,000 cattle were treated. In the event, the number treated was about 400,000.  The increase in incidence can be attributed to the fact that in 1968 the dressing campaign got off to a late start because of the foot and mouth precautions in the early part of that year.</P>
    <P>This may be part of the reason for this increase in the incidence of warble fly infestation but I certainly do not think it is the whole story.  The Minister is glossing over something here.  He seems to be neglecting to mention that up to 1966 there was a general autumn <Col N="479" /> dressing of all cattle as a preventive measure to wipe out warble fly.  Up to 1966 everything was going well and warble fly were being eradicated.  We ceased the general autumn dressing then and had a spring dressing which was applied only to cattle which showed signs of having warble fly. This has meant that many warble infested cattle have got through the net, so to speak.  There is no general dressing.  If we are really serious about eradicating warble fly we should reintroduce the general autumn dressing of all cattle for a few more years and then we could really be sure of eradicating the warble fly.  Even at the level of 400,000 cattle having warble infestation, I understand that, if those infested cattle were spread evenly over the whole country, there would not be enough warbles in any given area to allow mating and they would quickly die out.</P>
    <P>It is evident that there is a heavy concentration of warble fly in some areas and they are at a relatively low level in other areas.  We should have the information from the Minister's Department as to where the heaviest concentration of warble fly is.  I believe that, if we were to concentrate warble fly eradication in those areas where there is the heaviest concentration of warble fly, we could, while expending less money, go very far in achieving eradication.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the farm buildings grants.  As I said, it is apparently Government policy to encourage transfer from milk production to beef production.  It therefore seems somewhat anomalous that there is a £200 per farm limit on grants for farm buildings in respect of dry stock, whereas there can be unlimited grants in respect of milk production.  It appears to me that the system of farm buildings grants has not kept pace with the emphasis change in Government policy from milk to beef production, and that what is needed here is a removal of the limit on grants for farm buildings to be used in dry stock production.  I can see no reason why this limit should continue to exist. Surely buildings are an important component <Col N="480" /> in any sort of enterprise and surely our system of grants in relation to farm buildings should not discriminate against that form of production which we are pretending to encourage? I trust the Minister will review this in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would now like to take a look at the small farm incentive bonus scheme. I asked a question about this on 3rd March, 1970.  This is at column 1878, Volume 244 of the Official Report, from which I quote:</P>
    <P>Mr. Bruton asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the number of (a) applications and (b) acceptances for each county under the Small Farm Incentive Bonus Schemes during the periods 1st September 1968 to 31st December 1968 and 1st September 1969 to 31st December 1969.</P>
    <P>In other words, I asked for figures for the last four months in each of those two years 1968 and 1969.  The Minister replied by means of a tabular statement.</P>
    <P>There are some very significant facts which can be drawn from this tabular reply.  The first point is that there has been between 1968 and 1969 a remarkable drop in both the number of applications and the number of acceptances under the small farm incentive scheme.  Obviously, this scheme is to some extent not maintaining its attraction for farmers.  I should like to quote from the figures which were given.  In 1968, the last four months of that year, the number of applications was 1,260 and in the corresponding period of 1969 the figure was 669. There was a significant drop here.  This was despite the fact that, as of 1st September, 1969 the bonuses which were given under this scheme were increased by £100.  In other words, as of 1st September, 1969, the terms under which this scheme was being administered had become more attractive financially for farmers.  Surely, therefore, it is very surprising that in the period following this increase there should have been such a big drop in the applications relative to the corresponding period of the previous year? This requires explanation on the part of the Government.  Certainly, it would <Col N="481" /> give one reason to suspect that this scheme has certain inadequacies.  However, I am not in a position to pinpoint them.  Those figures should give definite cause for concern.  Incidentally, in relation to the figures for acceptances, they are even more startling in that in the last four months of 1968 the acceptances under the scheme were 1,646 and in the last four months of 1969 they were down to 621.</P>

      <P>Two paragraphs in the Minister's brief is a fairly substantial reference.  Under this scheme farmers who are earning £700 a year or over are not allowed enter the scheme.  This should be brought up to £1,000, particularly in view of the fact that the figure of £700 was set in 1968 and the purchasing power of that figure has since declined.  Therefore, I would suggest that in order to maintain the attractiveness of the scheme farmers earning up to £1,000 a year should be allowed enter it.  This whole farm planning is something which can be used beneficially by all farmers.  Therefore, in order to increase farm efficiency on the basis of plans, records and regular consultations with agricultural advisers, careful consideration should be given to extending the scheme maybe not to all farmers but to farmers in a slightly larger range than that at present covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder, in passing, if our agricultural <Col N="482" /> advisory services are pushing this scheme to the extent they should.  The figures would indicate that on a county basis there have been certain counties which have definitely lagged behind, counties which on the relative importance of their small farm enterprises on their economy one would have thought would have been to the forefront of this scheme.  Taking the Minister's own county of Donegal, in the last four months of 1969 there were only 13 acceptances under the scheme. This would appear in a small farm county like the Minister's own to be a very low figure.  In Longford, another small farm county, there were only 11 acceptances under the scheme, whereas the national average of acceptances for that period was 23 per county.  Meath had only one acceptance, and it is a fallacy, as the chairman will realise, to think that Meath is a big farm county; there are many small farmers in Meath, and it is a cause for some concern that these small farmers are not availing of the scheme and apparently not being given sufficient encouragement to avail of it.  Roscommon, another small farm county, had only four acceptances in that period; West-meath, another small farm county, only five acceptances; Wicklow, another small farm area, only five acceptances. Acceptances have been very good in places like Mayo and other counties on the western seaboard, but it is a cause for concern that the small farms scheme has apparently not been pushed with the same enthusiasm as it should be in other areas.</P>
    <P>Unless farmers are properly advised they will not avail of all these schemes. The advisory services are being played down, in that the salaries given to agricultural graduates going into the advisory service are not at all comparable with those paid to people with the same qualifications by commercial firms.  I have figures which would indicate that where a commercial firm like Erin Foods would be paying a graduate a starting salary of £1,300 a year plus a car allowance and a house allowance, the county committees of agriculture are paying a starting salary of only £972 and no house or car allowance. It would appear to me that, as this <Col N="483" /> figure of £972 is based on a recent arbitration award, we are trying to have our agricultural advisory service on the cheap.  We will not get the best people into our agricultural advisory service and our farmers will suffer unless we pay our agricultural advisers adequately.</P>

      <P>This somewhat big Supplementary Estimate for agriculture is an indication of the chaotic situation of agriculture not alone in this country but in practically every country in the world.  Countries such as Ireland are forced to subsidise heavily in order to counteract the subsidisation in the wealthier countries like Britain and the Federal Republic of Germany.  The fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in an agricultural exporting country such as this has to pay a subsidy of £31 million annually to the dairying industry is an indication that chaos exists in that industry throughout the agricultural producing countries.  Such subsidisation would be unnecessary if other countries which should be buying produce from us and buying it at a reasonable price, were not subsidising their own produce and overproducing.  Practically every facet of our agricultural production is subsidised.  It is an unfortunate thing that if farmers produce in good measure what they are asked to produce they always find themselves in great difficulty in regard to marketing and disposing of it. That poses a question as to whether the Estimate which is now before us is the correct measure to deal with the somewhat tenuous and difficult situation that agriculture faces here as well as everywhere else.  We have expended a lot of money on certain things which I am inclined to query.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to start with the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  Although the country has been a total clearance area for quite a considerable time, it is a known fact that here and there there is a constant recurrence of reactor cattle.  With all the skills which the Department and their advisors concentrated on it, and with all the skills of the farmers themselves&mdash;and the <Col N="484" /> provision of better housing for cattle and so forth&mdash;in an effort to eradicate it, it seems to be creeping back again. That is not peculiar to this country. No modern agricultural country in western Europe has been able to eradicate bovine tuberculosis completely.</P>
    <P>I have said before in this House, and I say again, that the system of the eradication of bovine TB is psychologically unsound.  A clear herd is very ripe for infection and the least bit of infection, a bird dropping a piece of infected dung even, is enough to start an epidemic again.  As a result, the Minister has to come back here with a Supplementary Estimate for £1 million. I should like to hazard a guess that he will be back next year looking for more money.  That is why the scheme is not really a success.  I am wondering if it is advisable for us to spend such a sum on this, which might perhaps be put to better use.  After all, almost £5 million is being spent on something which was supposed to have been eradicated seven, eight or ten years ago.  Due consideration should be given to this.</P>
    <P>We were told that, unless we eradicated bovine tuberculosis, the British would not buy our cattle.  We have been told that for many years.  Of course they will continue to buy our cattle because we are the only people in the world who sell store cattle. We are the only people in the world from whom the British can get store cattle because we are selling what is not really our finished product.</P>
    <P>I should like to move from that to the question of the processing of meat which comes under this Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister discussed it at some length.  I have always advocated that our economy should be based on trying to turn over as far as we can to the finished product.  By doing that we would give a greater measure of employment than we give by selling the unfinished product or the raw material.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed said today that we are restricted in the amount of processed beef we can sell by the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  This extra money is now being sought because of the fact that our quota is limited. <Col N="485" /> It is limited to 250,000 tons, I think, by the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement. The Minister has to come to the House for extra money because we have to subsidise this beef to get it into the markets.  We are selling a product which is in short supply everywhere&mdash;beef is one of the things that has not yet been overproduced&mdash;and we have to subsidise it.  Therefore something is wrong with our overall arrangements and our overall disposal of the money available to us for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>The heifer scheme, which is now being wound up, was introduced by a previous Minister some years ago for the purpose of getting greater production, and endeavouring to get greater exports of beef.  It failed completely in what it was intended to do.  It is now being wound up and that is an acknowledgment by the Government that the scheme was a failure.  It did not benefit those whom it was really intended to benefit.  It was intended to benefit the small and middle grade farmers.  One does not deny his rights to the big farmer either.  I happen to be a big farmer and I should hate to be denied my rights.  To have a sound economy you must try to subsidise the smaller farmers. I think there are about 120,000 small farmers in the country.  This scheme was a failure but it is never too late to mend.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that the Minister has introduced his beef incentive scheme.  This has been suggested to him by many Deputies from time to time.  It is a good scheme, a satisfactory scheme. I am glad to see an increase in the amount of money in the Estimate for that purpose.  I do not think he is increasing the amount payable under the beef incentive scheme.  It is really a calf subsidy and an encouragement to people to breed cattle.</P>
    <P>To go back to the dairying industry for a moment, it is necessary to have a sound and viable dairying industry and I suppose for that reason it is quite inevitable that we must have some form of subsidisation.  If you have not got a sound basic dairying industry you cannot have livestock.  There is, apparently a recognition by the Government, belatedly I would say, that they have to <Col N="486" /> try to change their policy from an all out drive in the dairying industry to the beef industry, and the sooner they do that the better.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the basic foundation of an agricultural country is the agricultural community.  Even in a bigger and more powerful economy it is absolutely fundamental to have a sound agricultural economy.  You can only have a sound agricultural economy if you press with whatever funds you have at your disposal to make your produce as marketable as possible.  Therefore, the beef incentive scheme is probably one sound scheme which the Minister has introduced.</P>
    <P>Of course, already a lot of damage has been done to our agricultural economy by pushing dairying as much as possible and encouraging people to go in for dairy produce with the heifer subsidy scheme.  That has produced a tremendous increase in dairy products. The people who benefited from that were the big farmers.  What happened to that scheme was that people who were not actually farmers at all benefited. I know one person who was not a farmer at all but as he had 300 heifers he received subsidies for them.  I want to stress as clearly as I can that the money is going into the wrong pockets.</P>
    <P>The EEC is not particularly relevant to this debate but in order to establish an agricultural policy it is necessary to look at least four years ahead. It has been stated by several Ministers that we will be in the EEC by 1972, which is only two years away.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan is looking somewhat sceptical about that.  I agree with his scepticism but we have to make our statements on the basis of what Ministers suggest.  If we will be in the EEC by 1972 we have to base our entire agricultural policy accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is in this Supplementary Estimate provision for an additional sum for An Foras Talúntais.  An Foras Talúntais is a self-sufficient body which runs its own affairs.  I understand its work does not come under direct control of the Department of Agriculture. It is a very important body which deals with two main facets of agriculture: first, it instructs and does that very efficiently; secondly, it is concerned with the horticultural drive. <Col N="487" /> Some years ago horticulture was the cinderella of the Department of Agriculture. In the past, for one reason or another we did not concentrate on horticulture, but having regard to our climate and the fact that we have a large number of very small farms and a high degree of unemployment in outlying districts horticulture is an ideal industry for this country.  One of the things which we can hope to export to the EEC as well as beef&mdash;after 1972 of course&mdash;is horticultural produce.</P>
    <P>I know a good deal about An Foras Talúntais.  I have had considerable contact with it and have been to many of its institutions.  It has been of immeasureable benefit to the agricultural industry as a whole.  I know it is short of funds and the amount given in this Supplementary Estimate, when compared with the other sums mentioned here, is really out of all proportion. I would far prefer to see half of the £1 million being given to the TB scheme being given instead to An Foras Talúntais, because, given the opportunity An Foras will revolutionise agriculture in this country.  The area from which the Parliamentary Secretary comes will probably benefit more than anywhere else, because the farms are smaller, the land is poorer and the climate is milder in that part of the country than it is here.  Horticulture will increase our exports and will also help a considerable number of small farmers to produce more and get a richer return on a small acreage.  It will also provide employment, although perhaps not as much as in the richer counties.</P>

      <P>One cannot hope to build up such an industry in a day.  It will take several years to develop a horticultural industry.  As with everything else in agriculture, we must project for the future.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £9 million is a desperate attempt, on the part of the Minister and those who advise him.  They have realised that we are going in the wrong direction, and are now trying to close the gaps which exist in agricultural policy.  They are trying to restore agriculture to the sphere in which it belongs so that it may be strong and viable because we shall have to face modern conditions whether or not we join the EEC.  I know very well that countries which have tried to bolster up with subsidies the weak points in their agricultural industry have failed to do so.  I think the French&mdash;all credit to them&mdash;were the first to get rid of subsidies.  It probably suited them to get rid of subsidies because they are an agricultural exporting country and it would suit us as well, but, unfortunately, we cannot get rid of subsidies until other countries begin to do so.</P>
      <P>In his long opening speech today the Minister did not tell us anything about the industry.  All he told us was that he was giving huge sums of money to the dairy industry, but he did not tell us if any of these sums would be converted into profitable exports.  I do not call butter a profitable export when it costs so much to produce and is exported at something like 1s per lb.  It is a subsidised product which is uneconomic in every sense of the word.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate shows, if nothing else, that the Minister and those who advise him have realised there is no future profit in the dairying industry.  It must be sound and viable because it has to produce the livestock by which we live.  If we did not have livestock products for export the bottom would fall out of the economy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our sheep population has been falling for the reason that the price of cattle in the better and richer land, has been reasonably good on account of the heavy mortality suffered in <Col N="489" /> Britain as a result of the foot and mouth epidemic and the improvement in living standards causing greater consumption of beef.  It has reached a dangerously low proportion.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for introducing the mountain lamb subsidy scheme, and I would suggest that he be more liberal in the application of this scheme.  First, it is very difficult to get payment&mdash;I have had continuous complaints and letters and from people who have been awaiting payment&mdash;and secondly, a more liberal attitude should be adopted.  Unless the sheep looks almost like a mountain goat a subsidy is not given.  There are certain areas in this country, including my own constituency, where sheep-rearing is the only possible thing on high, mountainous land.  In many cases people live on half-a-dozen acres in the lowlands and have large stretches of mountain land which is only suitable for sheep-rearing.  The subsidy is a help to them but to lay down hard and fast rules is defeating its own end. Why not pay the subsidy as a whole to mountain sheep farmers and let them go in for greater production of sheep?  That might bring our sheep production up to the previous figure and it would leave good land available for the rearing of livestock.</P>
    <P>It is easy to talk on agriculture and to make suggestions.  I am trying to suggest to the Minister and the Department that they have been going in the wrong direction but they are making an effort to come back to the areas of production which are so essential for us.  In the next two or three years agriculture is going to face a crisis&mdash; and, in fact, this is happening at the moment&mdash;of over-production of milk and milk products.  Deputy T. O'Donnell made a speech here this afternoon which I thought most informative.  He maintained we could hold our own by producing the right product and the best product.  He showed we could produce better and cheaper cheese and butter than some of the other countries. However, that is of no value to us at the moment because those countries are maintained in production by a high rate of subsidy.  Being great industrial nations they are able to pay that subsidisation <Col N="490" /><i>ad lib</i>; the rate of subsidisation in Britain and in the Federal Republic of Germany is tremendous. However, a crisis is going to come because these countries have overshot their mark.  They have over-produced and are in surplus.  In some European countries they are, in fact, cutting down dairy products.  In agriculture the swing goes very easily one way or the other and we may well be in a position in the next few years to sell our dairy products at a much cheaper price than anyone else.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I would suggest to the Minister that he should concentrate on beef because there will not be any shortage of beef in the foreseeable future.  Beef consumption is stable everywhere&mdash;in Britain it may even be rising.  If in our future agricultural policy we concentrate as much as possible on the production of processed beef we shall be able to build a sound economy and give real employment in rural Ireland where it is needed.  We should also concentrate on our horticultural production because this is one area where me may be able to undersell.</P>
    <P>The store trade is always something that arouses a certain amount of indignation. If you mention processed beef people sometimes feel this is inimical to the store trade which is so essential to our exports.  The Minister might pay close attention to the following point.  Difficulty has been experienced by many of my constituents who have found that under the BTE scheme they are forced to sell reactors to the factories at prices not in keeping with those paid on the open market.  In many cases they have had to sell at a dead loss and, in fact, they are being exploited.  The policy of the Department is obviously to continue with the BTE scheme.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary probably knows of many people in his constituency who have been &ldquo;locked up&rdquo; for months on end and are not able to sell on the open market because they have reactors.  I know of one man who, because he could not sell on the open market for 18 months, reckoned he had lost thousands of pounds.  I myself had to sell cattle under the reactor scheme and <Col N="491" /> I worked out that I lost £14 per head as compared with cattle sold on the open market.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot expect co-operation from farmers unless he protects them.  If he wishes to go ahead with this scheme he should give immediate attention to this matter. There is no redress for the farmer who owns a reactor; he has no alternative but to place himself in the hands of the factories.  A grave injustice is being done; it has been responsible for untold hardship and is causing unemployment because it wrecks the economy of many farmers who are employing labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long.  The debate here is on our most important industry&mdash;the agricultural industry.  It is on our agricultural industry that the country depends and anything spent on agricultural will always pay a dividend.  At the moment, and for some time past, because of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England, our cattle have been doing very well.  That has given the farmers great encouragement because, when they go out to sell their stock, they really get paid for their work.  That is the one thing that will encourage the farmers to work on the land and keep the land in good heart.</P>
      <P>The subsidy of £1 per head for sheep and lambs has given great encouragement to those who engage in sheep farming.  It helps to provide a reasonable return; the farmer gets the £1 per head subsidy, the cheque for his wool and the cheque for the sale of his lambs and he still has his original investment left.  That is a tremendous inducement to farmers to look after their sheep.  It encourages the farmer to increase numbers.  The county committees of agriculture could be used in the implementation of this scheme. These county committees are widespread in the country and communication with them is easy, much easier than it is with the Department, and I think the Minister should consider implementing this scheme through the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> The housewife in the past had one important money earner.  I refer to the turkey industry.  In the past the housewife looked forward at Christmas to having the money she would get for the turkeys she had reared.  She regarded that money as her own and she worked hard to rear her turkeys. Now the situation is very unsatisfactory. There may be no buyer for her turkeys.  This problem has been discussed by the county committees of agriculture but so far nothing has been done.  If the industry is to be saved then the sooner the Department moves the better it will be.  Turkeys are very difficult to rear and it is hard to expect people to go into turkey production when they do not know what return they will get, if they get any return. The Minister should have a look at this and I can assure him that if steps are taken to remedy the present unsatisfactory situation the response will be beyond expectation.  One cannot expect people to continue in a state of uncertainty with no recompense for hard work.</P>
    <P>I have been discussing the price of milk with farmers and the general reaction is one of disappointment. Some farmers are paid at the rate of 1s 3d or 1s 4d and some are paid at the rate of 2s.  Most of those to whom I have been speaking have told me they were paid at the rate of 1s 3d and 1s. 4d.  If this continues these people will go into the production of beef.  A large number of people availed of the scheme last year.  A greater number will avail of it next year, particularly if the grant is increased. Farmers will not go on keeping cows, handfeeding them, and then finding in the month of December that all they get is 1s 3d, 1s 4d and sometimes 2s. I am not exaggerating when I tell the Minister these were the figures given to me.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to reduce milk production the incentive towards the production of beef will have to be greater.  Installing milking machines costs money.  A good deal of planning is involved in getting together a herd of 20 or 30 cows.  Going into beef will be a big change and it will take a substantial grant to induce the farmer to <Col N="493" /> change over.  If the grant is sufficiently attractive I have no doubt the Minister will get a generous response, which will result in easing the milk situation.</P>
    <P>The Department is certainly very generous in grants for farm buildings. Farmers generally are taking full advantage of these grants and the buildings erected under this scheme are a credit to the farmers because, if they are not satisfactory, they will not get the grant.  The people are getting very generous grants under this scheme. It is no harm to remind the Minister that we have still thousands of acres of very valuable farmland in this country which is almost useless because of flooding.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Office of Public Works should work together with a view to relieving serious flooding all over the country.  We have drains which are doing great damage.  Co-operation between the Department, the Office of Public Works and the local authority could relieve much of this flooding and could bring considerable profit to the farmers.  I would ask the Minister to look into this question of drainage. An increase in the grant might encourage the people to carry out more drainage.</P>
    <P>Many people wonder why people are leaving the small farms.  Sometimes they leave because they are not able to eke out an existence on a small, uneconomic holding.  They are not prepared just to eke out an existence.  If they are not able to get a reasonable livelihood from the land they will go elsewhere and get a weekly pay packet. Farmers have left the land because for years they have been waiting in the hope that a bit of land convenient to them would be taken over by the Land Commission and given to them.  They became tired of waiting and decided not to continue farming.  I would ask the Minister if it would be possible for him or his Department to work in co-operation with the Land Commission with a view to speeding up the division&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The people are leaving the land.  This is a loss to the country.  It is due to the fact that thousands of holdings are not taken over.  If such holdings were divided we would have more people on the land.</P>
      <P>Many people are yet to be paid their £12 grant.  I would ask the Minister to see that these people are paid.  Once the second inspection is over they expect to get their money.  I know it is not easy to deal with thousands of these claims, but it would be helpful if it could be done.  The people who had not calves with their cows in June seem to be at a disadvantage.  The first inspection was over.  The second inspection was not until October.  If a calf was born a week after the first inspection, would the subsidy be paid for it? Some people told me an inspection can be carried out in March and a grant paid.  I should like to have the Minister's view on this.</P>
      <P>We should have more pilot areas in the west.  Sligo and Leitrim should be made pilot areas.  We have a large number of small, uneconomic holdings in those counties.  If they became pilot areas increased grants could be given to many farmers which would encourage them to stay on the land.</P>
      <P>I have known of reactors which were bought in January.  I know of people who sold these cows.  Some people would not be able to buy in a heifer at the price paid by the Department. Buyers going out from the Department throughout the country should be authorised to give top prices for those cattle.  For bullocks and dry heifers the prices are quite generous. But in the case of a milch cow due to drop a calf in April or May the loss is very serious.  The loss to the farmer who sells her is difficult to calculate. Cattle prices have soared.  Some of these people will find it difficult to buy replacements.</P>

      <P>The main emphasis in the Minister's speech today was on milk. The Minister emphasised the cost of subsidising milk and milk products. The figures which were produced may cause confusion throughout the country. They may cause city dwellers to think that the dairy farmers are robbing the taxpayers.  The figures may lead the urban dwellers to believe that the dairy farmers are rolling in money at the expense of the taxpayer.  Any statement which would cause the non-farming community to believe this was the case would be entirely misleading and would also have serious disadvantage in many ways.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out to taxpayers and urban dwellers and the non-farming community that farmers themselves contribute in no small way to the subsidisation of milk and milk products; that on every pound of butter there is a levy to subsidise milk and on every gallon of milk which a farmer sells to a creamery there is a levy to subsidise the export of milk products.  A large section of the non-farming community believe the farmer contributes nothing towards the subsidisation of his own products.  There is every reason for non-farmers to have this view because after every Budget there is usually a newspaper heading saying: &ldquo;Farmers receive so many million pounds&rdquo;.  In the small print we may see that industry also receives a substantial amount from the Exchequer but the bulk of publicity goes to what the farmers receive and I do not blame the non-farming community for thinking the farmers are parasites living on the taxpayers.  All the publicity seems directed to making the non-farming community believe that they subsidise the farmers and that without them the farmers could no longer survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trouble should be taken to point out that farming is one of our major industries and, I believe, it is still the main industry.  Only a few years ago, during the 1965 credit squeeze, the Minister for Finance said he looked forward to the autumn for the export of cattle to relieve the balance of payments position.  The importance of the industry to those not directly concerned with farming should be emphasised. <Col N="496" /> The farming community bear more than their fair share of hardship. Such a considerable section of the community as the farmers represent is entitled to be recognised by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. The Minister may say that he does recognise them.  There are various ways of doing this.  I believe the Taoiseach is sincere in many of the sentiments he expresses in regard to mutual co-operation between the Government and the NFA but I regret that the person designated by the Taoiseach to be responsible for agricultural affairs cannot see eye to eye with his leader on this important issue.</P>

      <P>This publicity as regards the dairy farmer, while it is correct, can reflect a different situation as far as the non-farming community is concerned. I believe that, with mutual co-operation between the Minister and the farming organisations this might not be the position.  The amounts shown here in relation to the subsidisation of milk and milk products could be used in some instances to better advantage. Everybody knows that our livestock industry is very important. To a large extent, this country is dependent upon it.  Without a cow there cannot be a calf and without calves there cannot be any livestock industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider the possibility of increasing the beef incentive scheme subsidy.  The £12 paid in respect of a cow suckling a calf or calves is not a sufficient incentive to entice farmers into that line of agriculture.  I believe that, by and large, only those people who were in that line of agriculture have reaped any benefit from that scheme.  I also believe that the ban on the first two animals for subsidy purposes should be reduced to one animal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Any farmer with a herd of cows suckling should be allowed to draw subsidy for every animal after the first animal: the first animal should be left to provide milk for the farmer and his household.  Furthermore, the subsidy should be increased from £12 to at least £20.  It should be pointed out to people not familiar with agriculture that this might not seriously affect the amount being paid to the dairy industry because, if the subsidy were substantially increased, many people at present supplying milk would stop doing so and concentrate on suckling and store cattle.  Apart from the incentive aspect, there are considerations in relation to the problem of procuring labour, as well as the fact that milk production is a seven days a week line of farming.  The Minister might find a saving in milk subsidisation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the beef cattle incentive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> Where a farmer with a herd of cows is anxious to divide his herd&mdash;to suckle half and put the other half into milk production&mdash;the Minister might consider allowing a farmer in those circumstances to participate in the beef incentive scheme.  I know many farmers who would divide their herd, because for many reasons it would suit them to do so.  Without purchasing any calves to suckle, they could have half of their own, the half from the cows being milked, and that would make up double suckling from the other half of the herd.  I urge the Minister seriously to consider this aspect of the matter.  In a county such as the one I have the pleasure to represent, this would be a big incentive because a farmer could divide his herd&mdash;milk half and draw the beef incentive scheme bonus on the other half.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a certain figure to meet losses in disposal of wheat.  If the Minister increased the number of intake points for wheat and, not only increased the number but increased their capacity to receive the grain, the losses in wheat might not be as great as they are.  While the past two seasons may not have been too bad for the cereal grower I believe it was not due entirely to increased effort by the Minister but was due partly to the good weather at harvesting. The Minister should also consider the possibility of providing grants for grain-drying and grain handling equipment for farmers interested in installing such a plant.  While not perhaps very large in comparison with some other figures here, the figure mentioned is nevertheless pretty large.  If the whole scheme were re-examined, some of the money might, if spent, be used to improve handling facilities with a consequent reduction of loss to the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to turkeys in the context of the county which I have the pleasure to represent.  Some time ago, turkey production played a very important part in the income especially of small farmers.  In the past number of seasons, the turkey population has declined very sharply.  In Monaghan, it has dropped by 20,000 or 30,000 <Col N="500" /> birds.  Despite the fact that many people in turkey production had erected houses of large capacity to carry large numbers of birds, the turkey population dropped.  That indicates that the number of birds kept by the traditional producer is practically negligible.  Consider the effect a reduction of 20,000 turkeys would have on the economy. At £3 per head, which is what they used to fetch at Christmas, that represents a loss of £60,000 which was the housewives' bonus for Christmas.  That affects the small producer.  At this stage I do not know what the Minister could do to restore that line of industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good work has been done under the headings of farm buildings and water supplies.  In many rural homesteads such work has provided an amenity which for a long time was seriously lacking.  I suggest that in certain instances the amount of grant paid in respect of these works should be increased to keep in line with the increased cost of supplies, of labour and of other things.</P>
      <P>Great work has been done under the land project but much remains to be done and I wonder, with this in view, if the Minister would consider running the land project grants in the same way as those under the scheme for reconstruction of dwelling houses. In that case portion of the grant is paid on completion of part of the work and the remainder when the project is finished.  It should not be difficult to devise a similar method of payment under the land project.  There are many farmers with large tracts of land and some farmers with small lots of land who could carry out land project work if, for instance, 50 per cent of the money was available on completion of a certain section of the work and the balance when the scheme was completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the importance of the <Col N="501" /> lime and fertiliser subsidy scheme I suggest the amounts should be increased. It is vitally important that ground limestone be spread in greater quantities than at present.  This may not be the case in every county but it applies to several.  I submit also that an improved scheme of subsidies for fertilisers should be devised.  If farmers are being asked to compete with farmers not only in other countries but in other parts of this country, they should be enabled to get fertilisers at the same price.  Therefore, the Minister should have a serious look at the possibility of increasing subsidies for lime and fertilisers.</P>
    <P>One of the major defects I find with the operation of the bovine tuberculosis scheme is not with the scheme itself but with the BTB offices.  Great hardship has been imposed on many farmers by the losing of their blue cards when sent out of these offices. This is not a reference to an isolated case or cases.  It is quite common for these cards to be lost and I suggest the least that could be done is to have them enclosed in registered envelopes. This may seem a simple matter but to a small farmer with ten or fifteen cattle which he wants to sell there is serious hardship because his card has been mislaid or lost and there is a delay in replacement.  The Minister should re-examine the system.</P>
    <P>He should consider seriously the points I have been making and their effects not only on small farmers but on large farmers as well.  Everybody knows that small farmers are becoming fewer and fewer and some action is needed immediately if they are to be protected, I will not say preserved, and allowed to exist.  The present milk producing system under which the small farmer supplying certain quantities of milk receives an incentive which the larger producer does not get may make it appear that the small producer gets something which the other man does not get.  One must take into account, however, the fact that many of the creameries at present accept milk from small and large producers and that when some of the large producers opt out for one reason or another, all the overhead costs lie on the small farmers, the traditional suppliers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> While the small farmer is led to believe he is receiving something over and above what the large supplier gets, that may not be correct.  To a certain extent he is depending on the milk supply to the creamery by the large supplier.  If that large supplier, for some reason best known to himself, discontinues milk production, the overhead costs of the creamery and such items as depreciation must still be met and must then be carried by the small farmer.  It is important to consider this point before talking about giving something to the small farmer that will not be given to the large farmer.  This is a sort of two-edged sword: it could possibly cut both ways.  I would suggest to the Minister that he would seriously consider this point because it could rebound on the small producers, the people who are becoming fewer and fewer and, in many parts of the country, are becoming virtually extinct.  I do not propose to deal further with the Estimate at this stage but I ask the Minister to consider the few points I have made.</P>

      <P>The Opposition have been trying for a considerable length of time to create the impression that there is disunity between the Minister and the farmers when, in fact, there is no disunity whatsoever, nor is there any difference between the thinking of the Taoiseach and that of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries because Fianna Fáil do everything in a united manner.  I can assure the Opposition that their attempts to create a rift between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or between Fianna Fáil and the farmers will not be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite understandable that the farming community should be pressing for better incomes when they know <Col N="503" /> that the Fianna Fáil Government will look after their interests in the best possible way.  I welcome the extra money that is being made available for the beef incentive scheme.  This scheme, which is still very much in its infancy, is proving successful.  Again, an effort is being made to create the impression that this scheme is to the advantage of the larger farmers, but this is not so because it is to the advantage of the entire farming community.</P>
    <P>It has been very rightly stressed here that there is surplus of milk and, of course, this is a problem.  Milk is heavily subsidised but it must also be realised that the small and medium-sized farmer depends for his existence on milk production because, if he were not engaged in milk production it would not be possible for him to make any worthwhile living for himself and his family.  If we could encourage the man on the broader acres who, because of his large acreage, has a choice of different types of farming, to avail of this beef incentive scheme it would be possible to reduce the amount of money that is spent on subsidising milk production.  This would also mean that more money would be available for the small and medium-sized farmer who must depend on milk production for his livelihood.</P>
    <P>We would like to see a better beef incentive scheme than that which we have at present, but we must remember that a large amount of money was paid by way of subsidy last year although this scheme is only yet in its infancy.  There would be no possibility of a Fianna Fáil Minister changing his mind with regard to the supply of milk.  Small and medium-sized farmers are still being encouraged to continue in milk production.  It is not they who are causing the milk surplus because this is being caused by the bigger farmers, and it must be admitted that the latter type of farmer is not in need of the same amount by way of subsidy as is the smaller farmer.  Any man producing 60,000 gallons of milk per year and receiving a subsidy of 10d a gallon is not doing too badly, and apart from the subsidy he is receiving for milk he is also receiving subsidies for <Col N="504" /> fertilisers, land projects and so on. Surely the man in the lower production range is entitled to a greater subsidy per gallon?  The agricultural organisations have been asking for this two-tier price system for milk about which we have heard so much.  There is no truth whatever in the allegation that through Fianna Fáil encouragement the farmers were misled in this respect.  They have not been misled because the policy has been clearly stated all down the line.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of grants for water supplies for agricultural purposes, this is a great incentive to the farming community.  However, I would like to see additional inspectors being employed for these schemes because in my experience there is often a long delay between the time a farmer makes application for participation in such a scheme and the time the inspector visits him.  I should like to see things speeded up in this direction.  I should also like to see more inspectors being made available so that each inspector could devote more time to each farmer dealing with the formation of these schemes and getting them off the ground because very often difficulties can be encountered.  I should like to see the advisory services playing a bigger part in this regard.  We know that we have not got sufficient instructors to do all the work we would like to see undertaken.  We should try to increase their numbers because it is not just good enough to have an instructor going to a farmer and advising him about what he should do and what he should use; that is all very good work, but the numbers which an agricultural adviser must cater for should be reduced drastically in order to give continuity of service.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want again to say that the Minister has the confidence of the farmers, regardless of what impression the Opposition are trying to create, and he will continue to have that confidence, especially of the small and medium size farmer for whom we have always catered and for whom we will continue to cater.</P>

I must say we were received with very great courtesy and we talked at length about the various problems confronting farmers.  The Minister gave us the impression that he was anxious to do everything possible to meet the wishes of the farmers representatives on that body but I cannot remember getting anything from him.  That is one thing I will say about the Minister, he is an expert in discussing agriculture and talking about the problems of agriculture but I have yet to see him doing something.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of his opening speech today he said:</P>
      <P>Finally, I would mention that, thanks to sound policies, agriculture has now had three consecutive good years.....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He referred to increased incomes and all the rest.  Fianna Fáil are now taking credit even for the good weather.  There is no doubt any little windfall helps them, but my opinion is that Fianna Fáil never had an agricultural policy and they are making policy from day to day.  I must refer briefly to policy, Sir.  I know you are going to stop me but I have to refer to it in passing because the Minister referred to it.  It is quite obvious that they are prepared to cling to any straw to pretend that they have a policy.  The Minister referred to the fact that they had reached the target set out in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, or at least they would reach it in the present year &mdash;550 million gallons of milk.  This is the first time any of us has heard the Second Programme mentioned for a very long time.  We used to be fed on this programme in the early days when it looked like succeeding but, when it collapsed completely and all the targets and forecasts fell down, the programme died.  Just because one target has been <Col N="506" /> reached the Minister has the temerity to mention it again.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary, in the absence of the Minister, that when this target was mentioned in the Second Programme there was no question of telling the farmers that when they reached 7,000 gallons that after that it was &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;, that when they reached 14,000 gallons there would be no more increase and if they reached 20,000 gallons the price must be reduced.  They were not told that there was a policy or programme to reduce the prices once they reached&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I did not hear what the Deputy said.  I would have liked to have heard him because I am sure I could reply to him.  The fact is that we now have 22,000 people producing milk who have really got no increase or suffered a loss in price. That is on the Minister's own figures and on the Minister's own admissions. Of course he did not give those figures; he spoke about percentages but he did not give us this stark fact that there are 22,000 producers who are told &ldquo;You cannot get any more for your milk; you cannot get any increase&rdquo;, or &ldquo;You must take a lower price&rdquo;.  At the same time the costs of production are soaring and they are expected to stay in business.  This is agricultural policy and this is the preparation for the EEC about which we are told very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, it is hard to see where exactly the EEC fitted into the general picture in this Supplementary Estimate. There might have been an inference, although it was not stated, that if or when we are lucky enough to get into the EEC certain subsidies which are now required would not be necessary. What the Minister did say was that he would like to give the farmers an assessment of what they could expect if we were admitted to the EEC. Having said that, he inferred at least that he knew what the effect of EEC membership was going to be on Irish agriculture.  He did not tell the House, <Col N="507" /> as one would have expected him to do, what steps he was going to take to prepare the industry for the competition it is going to meet, or for taking the fullest possible advantage of the bigger and wider market that is going to open up if and when we get into the EEC. This is the sort of information that Deputies and the people would like to get.  A passing reference of the kind made by the Minister is quite worthless and very disappointing.  He says that he will produce a document very soon.  We were told by the Minister five or six years ago that there was a booklet in course of preparation in the Department warning farmers about the future position in relation to entry into the EEC.  That booklet never emerged and I am sure it was prepared at that time.  I do not think there is an enormous difference between the situation then and now but the booklet has not emerged and the farmers are being fed on more promises.</P>
    <P>I said that there were 22,000 farmers in all who are getting nothing or suffering a loss and that is on the Minister's figure.  If we go into the EEC one of the things we will want is efficiency.  I should like to ask the Minister what he regards as an efficient unit in milk production.  Is it 7,000 gallons?  Is 14,000 gallons an efficient unit?  Is it 20,000 gallons?  Is a man when he comes to 14,000 gallons then to suffer as a result?  That is approximately 20 reasonably good cows.  He must stop there and be told that from then on although his costs of production will rocket he will get less. Is there any other section of the community in industry or in the services that meet that sort of position?  They look for increases in salary and if they do not get them they go on strike and then they get them.  Unfortunately, the same power does not rest with the farmers.</P>
    <P>The position we will arrive at if we get this production, which the Minister referred to, of 550 million gallons in the present year is that we will have 250 million gallons approximately for export.  I think that this is almost regarded as a very serious situation because some of the milk must be sold <Col N="508" /> at a very poor price.  That is so, but I would like to hear the Minister say that it is worth this and that it is worth continuing to produce milk in this quantity and, in fact, in increased quantities in anticipation of our entry into the EEC because it is quite on the cards that the amount of exports we will have at the point of entry will be an important matter if and when quotas are set up, as they may be set up in these commodities.  It is well worth the subsidy the Irish people will have to pay because I believe that agriculture will have to play a very important role when we get in as difficulties will be created in this country. Everybody knows there will be difficulties and very big ones in industry, particularly in some industries.  It is fashionable to down-grade agriculture by telling people that for the first year in the history of the country industrial exports have exceeded agricultural exports. This is a way of diminishing the importance of Irish agriculture.  I believe that the people who make such an announcement in this tone and with this attitude lose sight of the fact that agricultural exports are something special. Is the question: &ldquo;What is the import content of industrial exports&rdquo; ever asked and a comparison made with agricultural exports?  This is a very important aspect which is overlooked by these people.  I am delighted to see industrial exports rising and I appreciate that employment opportunities will have to be found in industry other than agriculture but it is a pity that it should be described in this way because we all know that the policies pursued by the Government over the years are driving people off the land in very large numbers.</P>

The last thing the Minister should do is to come in here today and cry about the size of the subsidy that must be provided for the dairying industry because if there is any hope for employment continuing in rural Ireland in farming it is in dairy farming.</P>
      <P>There is just a passing reference in the Minister's statement to the fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has taken away £300,000 from the liquid milk producers of the country, those milk producers who are supplying Dublin city, Deputy Dowling.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from all the various moves made in relation to the reduction in price for milk produced over 20,000 gallons and the static price of milk produced between 14,000 and 20,000 gallons and the position where £300,000 subsidy has been taken away from the milk producers in the Cork and Dublin areas that Fianna Fáil want and that their policy is to reduce the price of milk.  This is a shocking policy and it would not be accepted by any section of the community. We gave them in our policy document before the last elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only thing he did not tell us was who they were, but the indications are he is going to do it in the same way the Minister does everything.  He is going to handpick those two, three, four or whatever the number is.

      <P>That is what you call political cowardice.  This is a bit of a problem in the south of Ireland and the Minister does not want to take a step he can be blamed for in case somebody might say he did the wrong thing.  This is party politics and Fianna Fáil.  It comes far before the interests of the Irish people.  Party politics are being played in the setting-up of this group.  If we are ever going to know what is good for the dairying industry, we should know it by now.  We have had so many reports, so many investigations and so many well-qualified people indicating what should be done about the dairying industry, but here we are going to have another group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said we gave the remedy for this over-production of milk Fianna Fáil are crying about.  I do not think it is over-production.  We want still more production, and I think the Irish people should bear the subsidy because of the benefits it will have later on.  We guaranteed the farmers we would give them a £24 beef calf subsidy.  Fianna Fáil gave them £8 and increased it to £12.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister <Col N="512" /> how many farmers switched from milk production to beef production because, first, of this £8 and now £12?  Has it been sufficient?  I forecast at the time they would not switch because it was not sufficiently attractive and I said that, if the Minister doubled it, he would save money.  I am still convinced that, if he doubles it, he will save money.</P>
    <P>Yesterday at Question Time I was giving friendly advice to the Minister for Local Government on the B scale rent.  Today we have the evening papers full of the fact that 15 Fianna Fáil Deputies have been permanently in session since considering this because they are worried.  It would not surprise me if I heard that 30 Fianna Fáil Deputies are going into session tomorrow and for the weekend to consider what on earth can be done to overcome the difficulties in which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries finds himself in relation to milk subsidies and beef calf subsidies because, sooner or later, he will have to accept the advice we offer.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary is a reasonable man and I know that all along he was in favour of doubling this, but the Minister said, &ldquo;No, that is what Clinton said.  We cannot do it.&rdquo; They will be driven to it eventually.  I know it is the only way to induce the large farmers to give up milk production. I agree with those who say that small farmers must remain in milk production and they must be assisted to do so.</P>
