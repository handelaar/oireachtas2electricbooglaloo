      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider the advisability of requesting news media and RTE to refrain voluntarily from presenting features or interviews during the coming two weeks which might have the effect of creating or increasing tension in the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that all the media referred to are already fully aware of the heavy responsibilities that rest on them at the present time and that they will be concerned to avoid publication of any matter that might tend to affect adversely the situation in the north.  Accordingly I do not consider that any request by me on the lines suggested is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number on the live register (a) on 27th June, 1969, and (b) on 19th June, 1970; the reasons for the increase; and what action the Government intend to take to provide employment for these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons registered on the live register at local employment offices was (a) on the 27th June, 1969&mdash;51,473 and (b) on the 26th June, 1970, the corresponding date this year, 67,845. The increase in unemployment was due primarily to the effect of the trade dispute in the cement industry and, following settlement of that dispute, opportunities for work should become increasingly available.</P>
      <P>The Third Programme for Economic Expansion sets out the Government's plans to provide increased employment in the period up to 1972 in the context of the long-term aim to achieve full employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are 16,254 more people out of work today than there were this time 12 months? Further, is he aware that figures we got recently showed that there were almost 60,000 fewer at work now compared with 12 years ago?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary not admit, therefore, that the Government's plan for providing employment for our people at home is a failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Government's plans for providing employment for our people are a failure.  The Deputy must agree, if he is fair-minded, that the figures for 1970 were caused by the cement dispute. The Deputy knows that the Third <Col N="949" /> Programme for Economic Expansion provides for an increase of 2.5 per cent, or 31,000 people, in industrial employment by 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not admit that the cement strike accounts for no more than 3,000 to 4,000 on this list and does he agree then, that on that basis there are 64,000 people unemployed today despite the fact that eight years ago the Government stated that they should be judged on their record in regard to employment and unemployment, providing jobs for our own people?

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>At 31st March, 1970 there were 869 mentally handicapped children, under 16 years of age, awaiting admission to residential centres.  This figure includes children who are mildly, moderately and severely handicapped.  It must be borne in mind that with the development of services on a day basis many children, especially the mildly handicapped, are being catered for in the community.  When presenting the Estimates for my Department for the present financial year on 8th April last, I outlined the steps which are being taken to provide additional places for the mentally handicapped who need residential care.  When these additional places are available, the waiting period for admission to residential care should no longer be a significant problem.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Can the Minister say, in terms of time, when he thinks the waiting list, which at the moment is quite unreasonable, will be reduced to a reasonable level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given particulars of that on several occasions in the House but let me repeat once more that there are 1,500 places being provided which will cater for 869 <Col N="951" /> mentally handicapped here, less those who are mildly handicapped, in institutions for the severely and moderately handicapped, where children require residential care.  We will also provide for persons who although they have reached the age of 16 years are incapable of working and are in need of care in institutions.  I have said that the plans are going ahead as rapidly as possible.  There is no hindrance in any way by my Department to the completion of plans which involve plans for buildings or extensions and for the training of teachers and it will take two or three years to complete the programme.</P>

      <P>The position is that the terms of our bilateral trade agreements have in general been observed by the other Governments concerned.  Apart from the difficulties involved in determining what constitutes a breach of such an agreement, on which the parties concerned could have differing opinions, it would take a disproportionate amount of time and effort to examine the position in regard to all the agreements concerned, which number over 100, over a period of 25 years.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to talk to Deputies about this matter. What one party would regard as a breach of an agreement might not be so regarded by the other party.  We have had over 100 bilateral trade agreements in the last 25 years.  I agree that bilateral agreements are not the way to conduct trade and this is why we are so keen on the Common Market, in which Community we would have a multilateral agreement.</P>

I agree with the Minister that a very thin line can be drawn between violation and acceptance but at least we could be given some minimum information on this matter.  As Deputy O'Donovan has correctly pointed out there is an important debate proceeding at the moment and the Minister should be in a position to give us more satisfactory information than he has given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission to take Questions Nos. 20, 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the registers of many Government stocks are kept by the Bank of Ireland which also has the function of making the interest payments. The bank is remunerated for this service.  I regret that it is not practicable to have payments of interest on those stocks made during the currency of the bank dispute.  Payment of all such outstanding interest will be made by the bank as soon as possible on its reopening.  Interest payments on stock registered in the Central Bank continue to be made in the usual way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Having regard to the fact that the Government have found ways and means of paying civil servants and other people during the bank strike, would the Minister not consider finding some way of paying this interest to people who are depending on it for their existence and who are suffering great hardship as a result of its being with-held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that hardship is being caused in some cases.  This is an inevitable consequence of disputes of this kind.  I have examined closely the possibility of finding some way of making payments, but it has not been found to be practicable. One of the difficulties is that the registers on which the payments are based are in the bank.  From this the Deputy will realise something of the dimensions of the problem.  Any attempt to remove the registers could be deemed to be an interference in the dispute.  This is only one of the difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <P>There is no question of expending public funds on a converted barn for the purpose of providing accommodation for the School of Retail Distribution. What is involved is the purchase <Col N="972" /> of a suitable site for the erection of such accommodation.  The terms on which the accommodation to which the Deputy refers was offered were entirely prohibitive.

      <P>I am aware that some frustration has been caused in certain estates which have not been completed. These have in the main been constructed before the enactment of the 1963 Planning and Development Act which gives adequate powers to control development and to ensure that development is completed.  I would suggest to the Deputy this is a matter for the local authorities and that they should press as far as possible with the developers to ensure that they complete their estates.  In some cases where the local authority have taken whatever action they can and have not been successful, I would suggest that they adopt a more realistic attitude and take over the estates themselves.  I fully agree with the Deputy that in some cases this has gone on continuously for a long number of years.  If the local authorities will take over estates that have been left unfinished for a long period this situation can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter on which I should like some clarification. Farmers who are entitled to special grants may now, if they happen to live in or near a town, build their houses in a town and qualify for the special grants.  Paragraph 9 of the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>Under the Housing Act, 1966, the Minister may pay grants at a higher rate to farmers and certain other persons providing houses in rural areas.  It is proposed to enable these to be paid to farmers providing houses in urban areas.  Power will also be given to housing authorities to pay a supplementary grant where the Minister has paid a &ldquo;further&rdquo; grant for reconstruction.  It is intended that both provisions should have retrospective effects (sections 3, 8 and 12).</P>
      <P>Does this new concession apply to farmers only?  That is what appears to be stated in the explanatory memorandum. I gathered from the Minister's speech that the concession is being applied to all, farmers and others, covered under section 3.  Farm workers, if they happened to be in a position to build their own houses, qualified for these special grants.  There should be no curtailment of these grants and, if a special concession is now being given to farmers, it should also be given to the others who were covered previously. I should like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice section 5 provides for an extension of grants to houses provided for industrial workers.  The Minister envisages these houses being provided by the National Building Agency.  One takes no objection to that.  The only comment I should like to make on that concerns the grants themselves.  I regret the Minister did not see fit to advance them.  In 1948 their limit was <Col N="988" /> £1,650.  Now, in 1970, it is £1,850.  This small advance is not keeping pace with the falling value of money and the increase in the cost of building.  It is the same grant which presumably would now apply to houses being built for key industrial workers.  Failure to advance these grants puts an increasing load upon local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the ten year period 1949-50 to 1958-59, covering roughly the period of office of the two inter-Party Governments, 100,000 houses were built of which 50.5 per cent were local authority houses.  In the eleven year period 1959-60 to 1969-70, 95,000 houses were built of which 28.6 per cent were local authority houses.  I accept that this is Government policy but I suggest we have, perhaps, moved too far and that the decline in local authority housing is doing less than social justice to the less privileged sections of our community. Several minor concessions have been given in the interval to those who provide their own houses but I consider that the key to the fall in the percentage of local authority housing is the failure to advance the subsidy level to local authorities for such housing. The Minister will probably say that the change is due to the increasing affluence of our society.  That stereotyped answer is not much good to the person looking for a house who is unable to provide it from his own resources.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to two points under section 7.  A county council may now pay urban bodies supplementary grants.  This is a good thing because some small urban bodies were not doing so.  I do not know whether they have been doing it in recent years but they were not paying supplementary grants for a long period in my own town of Cashel.  From now out, supplementary grants will be universal.</P>
    <P>The income limit for a supplementary grant is £1,049 and the valuation £60.  With that, there is provision for family allowances up to I think £400.  That is statutory under the 1966 Act.  On the other hand, the income limit for a loan is quite different-£1,200 with a valuation of £50.  One would think a person entitled to a supplementary grant would be entitled <Col N="989" /> to a loan and that he would be treated at practically the same income and valuation levels.  It seems anomalous to have two different systems here.  Furthermore, no family allowance provision is built into the loan: it is fixed by regulation.  Would it not be better for the Minister to fix some figure&mdash;say £1,500 and a valuation of £60, with family allowances? Surely it would be much more reasonable, administratively, to have the income level for both supplementary grant and loan the same?  I fail to understand why they are dissimilar apart altogether from the fact that I consider they are on the low side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dealt with by regulation.  The Minister has changed the system of measurement of houses from the number of rooms to square footage and then, after an interval, there will be a change to the metric system.  There is an in between period which will be based upon square footage. Why was it deemed necessary to have that awkward interval?  Would it not be more sensible to wait for a direct switch to the metric system? This unnecessary complication will tend to create confusion.</P>
      <P>This is a very disappointing Bill from the point of view of getting more houses built.  It does not face up to increasing expenses in the provision of houses.  The housing grant is now applicable to a smaller type of house and many people will thereby lose the grant.  There will also be a loss of stamp duty exemption.  Under another Bill before the House, there will be a loss of rates remission, whether it be the one-tenth/nine-tenths remission or the seven year remission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As reported at column 1325, volume 245, of the Official Report the Minister for Finance said that this will mean a <Col N="990" /> loss of £1,000, roughly, per person.  He also stated that, under the present regulations, 82 per cent of the applicants will qualify.  This means that about 20 per cent will not qualify, and another 20 per cent will be at a loss of £1,000 per person.  This means that 1,500 or 1,600 prospective homemakers, if they still desire to build houses of a certain size, will be penalised individually to the tune of £1,000.  This is based on the statement made by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In view of the statement made by Deputy Boland, I think, that a £6,000 limit for grants will be put into operation&mdash;and it appears that this can be done under the 1966 Act, presumably by regulation&mdash;I should like to ask the Minister if he intends to implement that or if he has already done so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I will detain the House for a few moments only on this matter.  I rise principally to deal with the reduction in the floor area of the houses that are to qualify for grants.  This is a retrograde step. The proposal is that the floor area is to be reduced from 1,500 square feet to 1,250 square feet.  The effect of that will be to encourage a great number of people to build smaller houses in order to qualify for a State grant and for remission of rates.  The really serious aspect of this, as I see it, is that the probability is that the bedrooms of the houses will suffer; that people will build smaller bedrooms.  That is probably not in the interests of the health of the community in general.  People building houses should be encouraged to have decent sized bedrooms, well ventilated and airy and with a decent floor space.  It is not necessary to speak about this at any great length in order to make the point I rise to make.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why the Minister decided to reduce the floor area as he has done.  I could understand him putting an upper price limit on houses to prevent luxury buildings from qualifying for grants, but I cannot see why he has set out&mdash; as this Bill definitely does&mdash;to encourage people to reduce substantially the floor area of the house.  Fewer useful houses will be built.  As I say, there will be a temptation to economise on</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has decided to postpone the coming into operation of the Act or some portions of it until the end of the year to give people an opportunity to catch up with the delays caused by the cement strike.  I do not think the grants provided are in line with the increased cost of building.  For a great number of years there was no increase in the grants for reconstruction of houses.  I am sorry the Minister did not avail of the opportunity in this measure to increase these grants which have not been increased for many years.  If they were increased, many houses could be brought up to a reasonable standard.  I particularly want to protest against the reduction in the floor area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to apologise to Deputy Hogan because, when the Committee Stage of the Bill came before the House, there was some misunderstanding among the Fine Gael Deputies and I do not think we had the full and useful discussion we might have wished to have.  As Deputy Hogan knows, that was mostly his own fault and I do not think he holds it against anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a very important measure.  I was disappointed, to a certain extent, by the attitude of the Opposition parties in not accepting the Bill wholeheartedly, and at the efforts they made to create the impression that because of the new scheme for house grants, we would be encouraging the building of houses which would be too small.  In actual fact, this is not the case.  On Second Stage it was set out quite clearly that, through the proposals in the Bill, we are directing the moneys which are available to the State for housing to those who are in the greatest need.  Our whole purpose is to ensure that the most help is given where it is most needed and that, by encouraging the provision of reasonable sized houses, the grants system, which affects about two out of every three <Col N="992" /> houses, will ensure that for any given volume of capital the greatest possible unit output of houses of a reasonable standard will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise again that the floor space of the average local authority house is about 800 square feet.  We must keep that figure in mind. On average this is the size of house that local authorities have been building in recent years.  This is a substantial improvement on the standard of house which was being built up to some years ago.  The average size of a house built with the aid of a loan from a local authority is about 1,000 square feet. When we talk about a house with a floor space of 1,000 or 1,100 square feet I think it would be no harm to remind the House that the floor space of the house which was commercially sponsored as the &ldquo;house of the year&rdquo; this year, was 1,100 square feet.  The floor area proposed for grant aided houses exceeds that figures and goes to 1,249 square feet.  It is only reasonable to expect that a person who can afford to build a luxury or semi-luxury type house should do so without State aid. In many of these cases the grant has no great bearing on the building of the house at all and is of little assistance to the person who can afford to build a house of that size.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the size of house in Ireland is in excess of the average in European countries so our standards in this regard are quite good.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to grants being paid to farmers who, when this Bill is enacted, will qualify for the higher rate of grant although building the house in an urban area.  That concession will apply only to farmers and not to any other classes who would have qualified for the higher grant in rural areas.  It applies only to those deriving their livelihood solely or mainly from farming.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned increasing the income limit for supplementary grants. I intend introducing an amendment in the Seanad to increase to £1,250 the income limit, which at present stands at £1,045.</P>

Taking into account the additional £400 for dependants&mdash;up to four dependants at £100 each&mdash;this would mean that a person with four dependants and with an income under £1,650 would qualify for the supplementary grants available from local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the change to the metric system and said that we should have made a direct change from the number of rooms to square metres. I think he will agree that it was necessary to give some time to those involved in house building to adjust themselves to the new measurements. That is why it was done in this fashion. The Deputy seemed to imply that the Bill was disappointing as regards getting more houses built, but it is estimated that the Bill will enable a further 1,000 houses to be built each year.  In the quarter just ended more new house grants were allocated by the Department than in any other quarter for which there are statistics.</P>

The House was made aware of that on a previous occasion.  I am doing this to facilitate persons who might have had plans made and were unable to proceed because of the cement strike, which has now happily ended.  I hope we shall be able to get our house building programme under way as quickly as possible.  I have made a special request to local authorities throughout the country asking them to cut corners wherever they can and to ensure that the minimum amount of red tape is involved.  These special measures should ensure that the house building programme will get moving as quickly as possible and thus make up whatever <Col N="994" /> ground was lost during the period of the strike.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill has three main purposes. The first is to give legislative effect to the proposals to extend the social insurance system so as to include schemes of death grants, invalidity pension and retirement pension.  The second purpose is to provide the legislative basis for the two new social assistance schemes of allowances for deserted wives and for incapacitated old people.  The third purpose is to implement the proposals announced in the Budget for improvements in the existing social insurance and the social assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>As is usual in relation to social welfare legislation, the Bill is based largely on the extension of the existing social insurance and social assistance schemes and consists mainly of amendments of the existing legislation.  Some provisions of the Bill may, therefore, appear obscure and, in order to clarify them, I have had a very full explanatory memorandum circulated which I hope Deputies will find useful in their examination of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will observe the Bill is divided into three parts, the first of which deals with general matters common to the Bill as a whole.  Part II of the Bill deals with the new schemes of both social insurance and social assistance while Part III deals with the Budget improvements in both social insurance and social assistance schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of the new schemes on the social insurance side in Part II of the Bill is the scheme of death grants. This scheme will make a grant of £25 payable on the death of an insured person or the husband, wife, widow or widower of an insured person, £15 on the death of an insured person's qualified child aged between five and 18 years, and £5 on the death of a younger qualified child.  The contribution conditions <Col N="995" /> for the grant are that the insured person had paid not less than 26 employment contributions and had 48 contributions paid or credited either in the last contribution year before the death or as a yearly average over his insurance life time.  Only one grant will be paid on any one death, regardless of the number of insurances on which title could be established&mdash;for example where a man and his wife are both insured and one of them dies.</P>
    <P>Insurance for death grant will apply to all those employments which are insurable for disability benefit and old age, contributory, pensions purposes at present.  The scheme will commence on 1st October next and, being a completely new development in the social insurance system, it cannot be linked with any of the existing schemes in that system, and it does not supersede any of them in any way.  The only contributions, therefore, which will contain an element towards death grant will be those paid after the scheme commences and it is only those contributions that will be accepted towards satisfying the contribution condition requiring 26 contributions to have been paid.  It will not be possible, therefore, to satisfy the conditions in respect of any death occurring before the end of March, 1971, when 26 weeks will have elapsed from the commencement of the schemes.</P>
    <P>Invalidity pension is being provided from 1st October also under the second new social insurance scheme.  This pension will be payable to insured persons who are or become permanently incapable of work and whose insurance satisfies the contribution conditions. These conditions are that not less than 156 contributions have been paid and not less than 48 contributions have been paid or credited in the most recent contribution year.  Insurance for invalidity pension will apply in the same types of employment as insurance for disability benefit does at present.  Insured persons with the necessary insurance may under existing conditions continue to receive disability benefit as long as they are incapable of work, but they are required to submit medical evidence periodically and they are paid by cheques <Col N="996" /> issued from the head office of the Department.</P>
    <P>Under the pension scheme, it will be possible to dispense with medical certification or examination, except on rare occasions, and to pay pension at the post office of the pensioner's choice by weekly orders in pension order books.  The insurance conditions for the pension will be the same as those now required to qualify for disability benefit on a long duration basis while the rates of pension £4 10s for the pensioner, £3 3s for an adult dependant, 18s for each of the first two qualified children and 13s for each additional qualified child, will be the same as the rates of disability benefit.</P>
    <P>As the pension scheme is a development of disability benefit and indeed a replacement of it for certain categories, it is intended that any insurance under the Social Welfare Acts since 1953 which is reckonable for disability benefit purposes will count for invalidity pension.  If that were not done, it would be at least three years from the commencement of the scheme before any person could have the 156 paid contributions necessary to satisfy the first condition for pension.  Some persons have been receiving disability benefit for many years on foot of paid insurance which was wholly or partly under the former National Health Insurance Acts prior to 1953.  Arrangements will be made to allow that insurance be used also to qualify for invalidity pension if necessary.</P>
    <P>Regulations which I will make will define what constitutes being permanently incapable of work.  These regulations have not yet been drafted but what I have in mind is that permanent incapacity would involve being totally incapable of work and the likelihood of being so incapable for an indefinite period and certainly for one of not less than 12 months.</P>
    <P>The third new social insurance scheme is the retirement pension scheme also to be effective from 1st October next.  This will provide pensions for insured persons aged 65 and over who have retired and whose insurance satisfies the contribution conditions laid down.  These conditions are similar to those for old age, contributory, <Col N="997" /> pension but are applicable at an age five years younger&mdash;the person must have entered insurance before reaching the age of 55 years, have not less than 156 employment contributions paid and have an average of 48 contributions paid or credited per contribution year up to age 65.  The rates of pension will be basically the same as the rates of unemployment benefit&mdash; personal rate £4 10s, and additional £3 3s for a wife or dependent husband with 18s each for the first two qualified children and 13s for each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>The new pension will to a large extent replace disability and unemployment benefit for insured persons in the age group 65 to 70.  It will be payable on pension conditions&mdash;by means of a pension order book payable weekly at a post office without the necessity of attending at an employment exchange to sign the unemployed register and without the necessity of submitting medical evidence of unfitness for work. Insurance for the new pension will apply to the same employments as for old age, contributory, pension and contributions under the Social Welfare Acts since 1953 which count for the purposes of the latter pension will be taken into account for the purposes of the new pension.  This will enable retirement pensions to be payable immediately the scheme commences to persons who have retired.  Regulations will define what is meant by retired. The drafting of these regulations has not yet been completed but the intention is that the definition will require a person to show that he has ceased permanently to be employed in insurable employment or work which, if not insurable, is of that nature and that he does not intend to resume such employment.  It will, of course, be open to a person to withdraw his retirement and surrender his pension if he should wish to resume employment at any time between 65 and 70.</P>
    <P>There are a few general points I should like to mention in connection with these new schemes.  Firstly, persons drawing invalidity pension will be credited with contributions for each week of incapacity and these contributions will count for the purposes of <Col N="998" /> the other pensions in the social insurance system.  Similarly, persons drawing retirement pensions will be credited with contributions for each week of retirement and these contributions will count for old age and widow's, contributory, pension purposes.  Next, arrangements will ensure that there will be no duplication of payment of pensions either as between the new pensions or with the existing pensions-a person may draw invalidity pension up to age 65 and may then draw either invalidity or retirement pension but not both.  At age 70, a person must choose between old age, contributory, pension and whichever of the other pensions has been in payment.  In very rare circumstances, a person will wish to draw either retirement pension or invalidity pension after reaching the age of 70 because he will not be entitled to old age, contributory, pension or the rate of that pension which would be payable to him would be less than the rate of retirement pension or invalidity pension payable.</P>
    <P>Finally, the new schemes of death grant and retirement pension will be among the long term schemes in our social insurance system with the old age and widows', contributory, pensions schemes.  I think that it is only proper, therefore, that persons should be allowed to maintain their rights to these new long term benefits also if they should cease to be compulsorily insured.  Accordingly, the scope of the category of voluntary contributorship which at present covers old age and widows', contributory, pensions is being extended to cover death grant and retirement pension also not only for persons becoming voluntary contributors in future but also for existing voluntary contributors in that category.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the new social assistance schemes the first of these in Part II of the Bill is the old age, care, allowance scheme.  This will be an extension to persons outside the present field of pensioners under the various schemes of the Department, of the arrangement made two years ago and extended last year by which £2 15s a week is paid with pension to an incapacitated old age or widow pensioner, aged 70 years and over, who <Col N="999" /> requires full-time care and attention which is given by a prescribed female relative and who would otherwise be living alone.  The new scheme is designed to cover persons aged 70 and over who are similarly situated but whose means are too high to permit them to qualify for non-contributory old age pension.  There will be an upper means limit for the allowance, £299 15s which has been fixed by adding the maximum means which a person with one qualified child could have and still qualify for old age pension to the yearly amount of the pension that will be payable in such a case.  Means will be assessed for the purpose of this limit in the same way as for non-contributory old age pension.  The conditions of the new scheme generally, for example, who will be prescribed as a female relative or what will constitute living alone, will be the same as those applicable in the existing schemes and like them will be set out in regulations. As Deputies will recall, the definition of female relative for this purpose was extended last year to cover not only daughters and step-daughters but also sisters, half-sisters, grand-daughters, daughters-in-law and nieces.</P>
    <P>The new social assistance scheme of allowances for deserted wives is designed to deal with one aspect of the problem of deserted wives. Deputies are no doubt aware that this problem has aroused much interest during the past few years and the aspect of it which this Department is attempting to deal with is that of the hardship caused in the long term to the wife and children where the husband has deserted them and has failed to contribute to their maintenance.  At present, cases of hardship may be taken care of by the home assistance authorities which can help meet the immediate needs but it is felt that the long-term situation should be dealt with on a more permanent basis.  Under the new scheme of allowances it is proposed broadly to treat deserted wives as if they were widows claiming non-contributory pension.  The same conditions as to the rates of payment, the calculation of means, the conditions of <Col N="1000" /> qualification of children, the methods of claiming and paying, will apply.</P>
    <P>There is one point at which the conditions for a widow's pension are not adhered to and that is where the allowance will not be paid if the deserted wife is under the age of 50 years and has no qualified children.  It was originally intended that the new allowance would cover only mothers of families which had been deserted, but it was then decided that it should also cover elderly deserted wives without dependent children or whose dependent children have grown up and who may find it difficult because of their age and other factors to obtain employment. The minimum age limit of 50 years has been imposed to meet this situation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that it is proposed to specify by regulation the circumstances in which a woman will be regarded as deserted.  These regulations have not yet been finalised and I have a fairly open mind at this stage as to what the definition of desertion should be for the purposes of the scheme.  It is clear to me, however, that the term &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; is emotive and that it has different meanings for different people.</P>
    <P>There are some basic factors which I must bear in mind when dealing with this question of the definition of desertion. The first of these is that the allowance scheme is of the nature of a pension scheme and the governing consideration, that is, desertion, should be firmly established and be more or less permanent as, for example, widowhood is in the case of widow's pension. Secondly, I feel that desertion is primarily a domestic problem and that the allowance scheme should not be a possible factor inhibiting a reconciliation. For that reason, I am of the opinion that before title to the allowance could arise, the wife should have availed in so far as is possible for her, of whatever processes, legal or otherwise, are open to her, to effect a reconciliation or to oblige the husband to meet his responsibilities to support her and the family.  I do not think that there can be desertion in the sense we are seeking to deal with, if the husband is contributing in any way towards the maintenance of the family.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> These are considerations which I will have to take into account in defining desertion, and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on this difficult and delicate question.  I am convinced, however, that it is essential at this stage to adopt a pragmatic approach and to get a reasonable scheme into operation as soon as possible. Accordingly, the legislation has been framed to permit the definition of desertion to be specified by regulations so as to give a certain flexibility to the scheme and allow it to be readily modified, where necessary, to effect improvements which experience may show are desirable.  One final point I would like to mention in connection with the scheme is that payment of the allowance will be made by way of an allowance order book at the post office of the claimant's choice.  However, arrangements have been made so that the order books will not be generally identifiable as being in respect of deserted wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals mainly with the improvements in the existing schemes of social insurance and social assistance announced in the Budget Statement on 22nd April, 1970.  The increases then announced in the field of social assistance will give an extra 10s a week to all existing non-contributory old age and blind pensioners making the maximum personal rate of old age and blind pension, £4 5s a week.  The increase of 11s 6d in the weekly rate of widows non-contributory pension will eliminate the existing differential between that pension and the non-contributory old age pension thus making the maximum personal rate of widow's pension £4 5s a week also orphan's non-contributory pension will be increased by 7s 6d to £2 5s a week.  The increases in the maximum rates of these pensions will enable the scale of means and rates of pension to be extended in each case so as to give additional rates at the bottom of the scales and thus make pensions payable to persons whose means are at present outside the limit for any pension.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for persons in urban and rural areas are being increased by 10s 6d a week for the recipient making the maximum rate £3 12s for a single <Col N="1002" /> person and £6 8s for a married couple living in an urban area.  Outside urban areas the corresponding rates will be £3 6s for a single person and £6 for a married couple.  These increases of unemployment assistance at the maximum will have the effect of automatically extending the means limit for qualifications for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The upper age limit for orphans and qualified children under the social assistance schemes which I have mentioned is being raised to 18 years.  The rates of payment for qualified children are also being increased by 2s 6d in each case making the overall payment 15s for each of the first and second child and 10s for each additional child. Thus a widow with four children will get an overall increase of £1 1s 6d in her non-contributory pension making it £6 15s.  These improvements will all come into operation on the first pay day for the particular scheme next August.</P>
    <P>Under the Budget proposals the rate of children's allowance for the third and each subsequent qualified child in each family under the general scheme of children's allowances will be increased from £2 to £2 5s a month.  The rate for the first and second qualified child will remain unchanged.  As announced in the Budget Statement, adjustments of the tax free allowances under the income tax code in respect of the third and subsequent child in families will offset the increases in the rates of children's allowances for families which are liable for income tax.  These adjustments are designed to ensure that it is the larger families not liable for income tax which will gain from the increases in children's allowances&mdash;a four child family in such circumstances will get £6 10s a month as against £6 at present and a six child family will get £11 a month as against £10 at present.  These increased rates will be effective from October next.</P>
    <P>The Budget improvements in the various social insurance benefits and pensions will come into operation at the beginning of October also.  They will provide an extra 17s 6d a week for recipients of old age contributory pension thus making the maximum rate £5 a week for a pensioner personally and £8 10s in all for a married couple. <Col N="1003" /> Recipients of disability benefit and unemployment benefit will get an additional 15s a week.  There will also be a slight adjustment in the payment for an adult dependant to facilitate decimalisation and the new rates of unemployment and disability benefit will be £4 10s a week for a single person and £7 13s for a married couple.  The rate of maternity allowance is also being brought up to £4 10s a week.  The basic rate of widow's contributory pension will be increased to £4 10s a week also regardless of whether or not the widow has any qualified children.  The orphan's contributory allowance is being raised to £3.  The rates of payment in respect of qualified children are being raised by 2s 6d a week in each case while the upper age limit for orphans and qualified children is being raised to 18 years.</P>
    <P>Certain rates of unemployment benefit which are payable where unemployment continues for more than 156 days are the same as the maximum rates of unemployment assistance in urban areas.  As unemployment assistance rates are being increased from the beginning of August next, these particular rates of unemployment benefit are also being increased from then.</P>
    <P>To meet the extra expenditure on the increased rates of benefits and pensions and the cost of the new social insurance schemes dealt with in Part II of the Bill, an increase in the social insurance contributions payable by employers and employees is necessary. The increase proposed from the beginning of October next in the rates of social insurance contributions is 5s 5d where all the insurance benefits including the new schemes are covered, with lesser increases where the benefits covered are restricted.  The various rates of contribution are also set out in decimal currency terms to be effective from 15th February, 1971.  The overall weekly employment contribution payable in respect of men in ordinary industrial or commercial employment from October will be 33s 8d made up of 30s 6d in respect of social insurance, 2s 2d in respect of occupational injuries insurance and 1s in respect of redundancy payments.  Of this, the employer will pay 18s 3d and the employee <Col N="1004" /> 15s 5d.  In the case of women in such employment, the overall weekly contribution will be 31s 5d made up of 29s 1d for social insurance, 1s 7d for occupational injuries insurance and 9d for redundancy.  Of this the employer will pay 17s 1d and the employee 14s 4d.  The increase in the lower rate of voluntary contribution covering widow's pensions only will be 1s 1d making it 6s 4d.  The increase in the higher rates of voluntary contribution which at present covers old age and widows contributory pensions and, in future, will cover also death grant and retirement pension will be 5s 5d making it 16s 3d.  A table showing the present and proposed rates of contribution appears in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the social insurance system generally in the Bill, the benefits payable under the occupational injuries benefits scheme are also being improved.  The increases proposed are 15s in the rates of the main weekly benefits and allowances with proportionate increases of other payments.  These changes will not involve any charge on the Exchequer as all benefits under the scheme are met out of the Occupational Injuries Fund which is financed by contributions paid by employers only.  A minor adjustment of the contribution necessary on conversion of the contribution to decimal currency terms in February, 1971, is all that is required to meet the extra cost of the increased benefits.</P>
    <P>Due to improved facilities for printing insurance stamps and pension order books, it is possible this year to bring the improvements in the social insurance schemes into operation from the beginning of October, which is three months earlier than in previous years. The time lag between the increases in rates of payment on the social assistance and social insurance sides is, therefore, reduced to two months&mdash; August and September.  During that period however cases will still arise where non-contributory pension would temporarily be more favourable than the corresponding contributory pension. It was never the intention that the statutory provisions permitting a person to opt for non-contributory pension, if it were more favourable than the <Col N="1005" /> contributory pension should operate where the advantage would only be temporary, as the Departmental machinery is not geared for short-term switching from one pension to the other and back again.  There is a provision in the Bill therefore to prevent such switching during the two months period in cases where the advantage would be a temporary one only.  The right of a pensioner to switch where the advantage would be permanent will not be affected, and this is of importance in relation to the present Bill where the allowance for adult dependants of old age contributory pensioners is not being increased and any advantage that might accrue to such an adult dependant by opting for non-contributory pension would not be limited to the period August/September.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a provision to make a minor modification of the means test for non-contributory old age and widows' pensions.  At present a person who is paying rent for a labourer's cottage is not assessed with any means from the cottage for pension purposes but a person who is paying an annuity in respect of the purchase of a labourer's cottage has the value of the cottage assessed against him although the annuity payment may be the same amount as the rent would be.  To remove this anomaly, the Bill proposes to have the value of the cottage disregarded while it is being purchased by way of an annuity.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary at this stage to go into the Bill in any greater detail as I feel sure that the explanatory memorandum will have given Deputies a good picture of the effects of the provisions of the Bill. To assist Deputies further, however, I will summarise the yearly cost of the various proposals in the Bill.  There is £2,982,000 for non-contributory old age and blind pension, £645,000 for widows and orphans pension, £1,284,000 for unemployment assistance and £1,188,00 for children's allowance together with £310,000 for the new scheme of deserted wife's allowance and old age, care, allowance. The total cost on the social assistance side is, therefore, £6,409,000 in a full year, all of which will fall on the <Col N="1006" /> Exchequer.  Against this there will be an offset of some £100,000 by way of increased income tax due to the adjustment of tax free allowances for children in that code.  The gross cost to the social insurance fund of the new schemes and the improvements in existing schemes on the social insurance side will be £9,815,000 in a full year.  Allowing for increased contribution income to the fund of £7,698,000 from the increases in contribution rates, the amount of the cost to be borne by the Exchequer will be £2,117,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>These are very substantial amounts but they arise out of very substantial improvements in the services administered by my Department.  I have much pleasure, therefore, in recommending the Bill to Dáil Éireann and I ask for speedy and favourable consideration of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to say that I am pleased with the Minister's brief which he has had handed out to us.  On previous occasions I have expressed the view, and I do not intend any disrespect to the people who draft social welfare legislation, that ordinary people and even specialists in the field found it difficult to understand the way the legislation is presented.  I often wonder if social welfare legislation could not be presented in a form somewhat similar to what the Minister has just read out. Over the weekend I went through this Bill, and, indeed, through the pretty full explanatory memorandum, but, quite frankly, I felt rather at a loss to understand many of its provisions because there were so many references to other Acts and other sections and other paragraphs.  One would want to be an expert to derive any satisfaction from that exercise.  However, the Minister's speech makes it easier for us to understand what is involved.  In the second paragraph the Minister states:</P>
      <P>As is usual in relation to social welfare legislation, the Bill is based largely on the extension of the existing social insurance and social assistance schemes and consists mainly of amendments of the existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That makes the position clear especially <Col N="1007" /> in so far as I and other people felt that new social welfare schemes were presented in the Budget and in this Bill.  What we have, therefore, are some improvements to existing schemes as well as some extensions of existing schemes.  No one on this side of the House or, indeed, on any side of the House, can oppose the proposals in the Bill.  My only criticism is that the improvements in the Bill do not go nearly as far as we would like them to go to help the unfortunate section who are to benefit under the Bill.  Our entry into the EEC may help these social welfare recipients because we may copy some of the schemes which member states have.  Some of those countries have a much higher regard for social welfare recipients and spend a much greater part of their wealth assisting them.</P>
    <P>The modest increases here vary from 10s to 15s a week but since those figures were announced in the Budget on 29th April last the value of that 10s and 15s has greatly depreciated. Indeed, its value has been halved since then as has the value of the 10s or 15s which they received last October or January.  In all sincerity I wish to say that the provisions of this Bill do not adequately meet the needs of those in our community who have to depend for their survival on the State.  I think the innovations to which the Minister referred was the death grant.  I think the Minister did say that nobody could benefit from this provision before March, 1971.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>Yes.  There is provision for an increase in children's allowances but I consider the increase far too meagre.  The children's allowances paid in this country are among the lowest in Europe.  In Belgium an allowance of 80s is paid for the first child; in France, it is 99s 8d; in Italy, 65s 4d; in Luxembourg, 77s 9d and in the Netherlands 59s 6d.  In Italy the standard of living is the same as in Ireland but the allowances for children are 2½ to six times greater than here, depending on the size of family.</P>

      <P>It must be clear to all that it would be a good thing for any Minister for Social Welfare and for this House to agree that the allowances in this case should be increased at least twofold.  I attended this morning a meeting of the Old Age Pensions Committee in Fermoy and I can state that one of the most embarrassing and annoying points at those meetings is the question of the means test for old age pensioners.  While the argument can be made that the means test cannot be abolished, there should be some extension of the present limit.  Many Deputies know of cases where, for instance, a small farmer may be undecided about the member of his family to whom he will transfer his holding, and the farmer is debarred from obtaining a pension because of this rigid means test.  I should like to see this situation remedied because it is causing much hardship.</P>

Most Deputies will agree that the differential caused more annoyance and trouble than many other matters and I am glad to see it is now removed. There is, of course, the other side to the coin, that the money will have to be found somewhere.  I notice that the contributions will be substantially increased as from 1st October and an industrial employer will have to pay 18s 3d and the employee 15s 5d.  I have often wondered if we could not have a graduated system of contribution whereby the lower-paid worker would have to pay less than his more fortunate brother who would receive a higher weekly wage.  I hope that some day some Minister, perhaps, the present Minister, will look into the matter and see if a graduated system could not be introduced.  From the point of view of the employer as well as the employee it would appear to be a far better way of doing it provided that it can be worked out without too much book work.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied knowing that something is being done.  I do not intend to delay the House with any more discussion on this Bill.  I mentioned some of the allowances which I think should be increased.  Our whole social welfare code is inadequate. Those of us who are better off have no objection&mdash;I believe this is the feeling throughout the country&mdash;of paying a little more to help the less privileged. Increases of 7s 6d and 10s a week do not really help matters.  These people <Col N="1012" /> are still the victims of the British poor law system which I believe should be completely changed.  The allowances are inadequate because the value of money is depreciating weekly.  We should devise a system so that these people, whether they have contributory or non-contributory pensions, can get greater benefits.  Many of these people have given great service to the country. I do not think the taxpayers would begrudge giving them an increase.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour Party naturally welcome improvements in social welfare benefits.  The Government are saying here that they are introducing a new benefit, namely a death grant.  I would remind the Government that in the 1952 Social Welfare Act they eliminated the death grant introduced by the late Deputy Norton in the inter-Party Government. The Government are now bringing in this death grant and boasting about it. When the death grant was first brought in it amounted to £20 for a husband or wife and £6 for a child.  Twenty years later the Fianna Fáil Government are introducing a death grant of £25.  I presume the money is intended for funeral expenses.  On 9th July, 1968, the Minister for Social Welfare said that £25 would be inadequate at that time for funeral expenses.  If that was said two years ago by a member of the Government, how far will £25 go towards funeral expenses today?  I do not believe it would even open the grave, as they say.  I wonder why the Minister chose the figure of £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the introduction of the death grant it appears as though the Government have resisted the pressure of the insurance companies who did not want a death grant to be provided.  Poor people were being fleeced by weekly contributions to the insurance companies. It would be appropriate at this time to have an inquiry into the costs of funerals because they are prohibitive. People have to go into debt for many years to pay the costs of the funeral.  I heard recently of the case of a poor widow whose child had died The Dublin Health Authority provided a hearse for the coffin but nothing for the mother.  When I inquired about the matter I was told <Col N="1013" /> that the hearse could bring the coffin to Glasnevin but the mother would have to get the bus to Glasnevin in order to see the remains of her child. This is the sort of arrangement provided under the poor law relief.</P>
    <P>I do not think a £25 death grant means that the Government are providing benefits under the Social Welfare Act because they threw the death grant out in the 1952 Act.  I hope the industrial workers, who after all are the people paying the contributions, realise that it is they who are making them and not the general public.  Each year amendments and changes are made to the Act.</P>
    <P>As we are talking about making application to join the European Economic Community, we should consider a completely new social welfare code.  Deputies should be provided with information about the social welfare benefits payable in Common Market countries in order that we can make comparisons between what is paid in the EEC and what is paid here.  As far as I know, our social welfare benefits are the lowest in Europe.  When I asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he would state what it would cost to provide the benefits payable to people in Northern Ireland here, he said that he could not ascertain this. If we are to enter the Common Market we must provide the same social welfare benefits.  In the past 20 years we have had over a sevenfold increase in insurance contributions and less than a fourfold increase in benefits.</P>
    <P>Social welfare benefits are not keeping pace with the spiralling cost of living.  We should look at the subsistence level and find out how many people are living below that level.  Certainly the Minister for Social Welfare is not concerned with the subsistence level or what constitutes poverty.  It is one further justification for having a full-time Minister for Social Welfare and not a part-time Minister.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the Minister for Social Welfare said that it would be wrong to have an amalgamation of the Department of Social Welfare with the Department of Health.  The Minister said that the workings of the Department of Social Welfare were complex <Col N="1014" /> and warranted a separate Minister.  The present Minister for Social Welfare is also Minister for Labour.  The Department are concerned with persons who are ill, unemployed or invalids.  The Department must be dynamic and watchful of the affairs of the people. Hundreds of letters are received about payments due to persons in need.  The Department must have their own Minister and must seek to improve the social welfare code.  The officers in that Department must be concerned with what constitutes subsistence level and must endeavour to carry out surveys which would show the number of persons living below subsistence level. They must be concerned with persons suffering from malnutrition, who are living on bread and tea because they cannot afford proteins.  A flexible system of help is necessary for persons in need.</P>
    <P>The new benefit for deserted wives is long overdue.  Members of the Opposition Parties have been calling for it for many years.  We have seen the problems and have been asked to make representations on behalf of deserted wives. Ireland may be unique in having so many husbands who refuse to face up to their responsibilities.  When I first started practising medicine I met many deserted wives.  They never knew where their husbands had gone.  The men went out to work but never returned.  There is an alarming rate of such desertion.  At first it stunned me to think of husbands disappearing and leaving their children unprovided for. The wives had to go out to work and the children were not being properly provided for at home.  Home assistance was provided for deserted wives but it operated for only one month and then ceased.  The deserted wives had frequently to renew their applications for assistance.  There is a problem in deciding what is a &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo;.  I do not think that what the Minister has said will solve the problem.  The Minister said that if a husband makes any contribution to the home the wife should not be considered a &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo;.  I know from experience that such husbands send home £1 infrequently but the remittance is not accompanied by his address.  The husbands sends £1 perhaps once a month or <Col N="1015" /> once every few months.  I hate to think that the deserted wife is deprived of an allowance by virtue of the fact that £1 will come in an envelope.  These wives are scrupulous about telling the truth and the £1 they receive debars them from receiving social welfare benefit. Where there is a possibility of reconciliation the allowance might prove to be an inhibiting factor.  I appreciate this.  Would it not be better to err on the wrong side and to ensure that the wife got payment?  Reconciliation may take place but the husband may leave home again and the unfortunate woman then has to renew her application for home assistance.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how we should operate the scheme at the age of 50 years where the woman is living alone.  This would be wrong.  We must be flexible about this scheme.  The Minister should not apply it too rigidly.  What the Minister has in mind might be altered by civil servants and regulations might be made which could not be altered. There must be flexibility.  I am glad to see that the children of deserted wives are to be treated as orphans and will be entitled to benefit as such.</P>

      <P>In 1968, the Minister for Social Welfare said that the home assistance payments were unsatisfactory, that home assistance was the weakest link in the whole social welfare field and he promised to look into the matter and to consult with other Members of the Government in order to have something done about it.  I do not see anything being done about it here.  I was wondering how much progress the Minister is making towards improving the home assistance scheme. It is a most unsatisfactory scheme.  It does not operate in the manner in which it was intended to operate.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would give us details of what he proposes to do in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated some time ago, in reply to a question by Deputy Corish, that he was hoping to arrange a system whereby children's allowances would benefit those most in need.  This <Col N="1016" /> Bill does not make any such provision. We must ensure that there is a means test so that those for whom this scheme was originally intended will benefit most.  Our rate of children's allowances is really farcical when compared with the rates payable in the EEC countries. Deputy Barry enlightened us by referring to the rates in those countries. We cannot be proud of our social welfare code or about the children's allowances paid here.  Our allowances look ridiculous when compared with those paid within the EEC.  If we are seriously considering going into the EEC I would hope we might be successful because those who most need help might benefit. We would have to provide proper social welfare benefits for our people. The Minister stated that he would provide a means test.  I do not see any provision for a means test in this Bill. I note that retirement pensions are to be paid at an earlier age.  This is important because a person should be able to look forward to a period of retirement in normal health and 65 is considered a good age for retirement. We lag far behind other progressive countries in this matter.  If I read the Minister's speech correctly, it would appear that the retirement age applies only to contributory pensions.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me if that is so?</P>

    <P>While I do not advocate anything revolutionary, I would like to see the Minister considering some way of contributing towards rent in the case of recipients of social welfare assistance.

      <P>I should like to see some form of liaison between the Departments of Social Welfare and Health, so that the Department of Social Welfare might help those in receipt of social welfare assistance or allowances, and who would qualify for medical cards, to obtain this extra benefit.  It would be good if there were special consultation rooms in the Department of Social Welfare where people could discuss their problems with social welfare officers. Very often people who take their problems to the Department of Social Welfare are told that the particular problems are not for the Department and they are sent to the labour exchange.  There should be officers in the Department with sociological training to deal with problems. I have no doubt that the Department are inundated with people seeking benefits and asking what happened to their cheques which went astray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is that of the changing over from a widow's to an old age pension.  When such change is about to take place, a person is asked to surrender her pension book and the result is that she may be without benefit for some weeks until the new book is <Col N="1019" /> issued.  This is ludicrous.  I wrote to the Department about this matter some eight weeks ago but so far I have had no reply.  There must be some way of streamlining the procedure so as to ensure continually of benefit.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that serious consideration has been given to graded contributions.  It is ridiculous that a person with an income of £13 or £14 a week or, perhaps, less will be paying 15s 5d, while a person earning £20 or £22  a week will pay the same amount. I should like to see graded contributions introduced.  This is something which is long overdue.  Will the 14s 4d apply to a girl earning £6 a week and to a girl earning £12  a week?  It seems ridiculous that they should both pay the same contribution.</P>
    <P>I always understood that the State paid one-third of the benefits into the Social Welfare Fund.  The increased contribution income to the Fund will be of the order of £7,700,000 and the amount to be borne by the Exchequer will be £2 million which is very much less than one-third.  I would like to know what happens in a case like this? The Government have always maintained that the State should pay one-third into this fund.  Would this not indicate a trend now that the State will not pay one-third?  Does this mean that from now on the people who contribute to the social welfae scheme will alone provide the improved benefits? It would  seen more just that the Excheaquer should provide one-half and that the balance be obtained by  an increase in income tax.</P>
    <P>Tis contribution from the working-class people is a major means of financing social welfare benefits.  Persons above the social welfare contribution limit are not contributing to the improvements in social welfare benefits. It is glaringly obvious to me that it is the poor who are helping the poor.  It is the lower income group alone who are providing those benefits for the poor.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal very briefly with the old age care allowance scheme. The allowance given to the female relatives concerned is a pittance compared <Col N="1020" /> with their earnings in the jobs they were obliged to give up in order to provide this care. There was a report out yesterday in Britain about this problem of children providing care for their parents.  It showed a situation where single girls in so many cases sacrifices jobs, promotion, pensions and service benefits in order to provide this care for their parents but received a miserable pittance for doint so. When girls do this they save the State considerable expense and keep the old person out of institutions.  If the parents should die within ten years or so the people who have been looking after them find themselves at the age of 55 without any job and with no allowance at all.  This is a terrible injustice towards persons who have sacrificed so much to help their parents and who have relieved the State of its obligation to those people.  Could the Minister see some way of providing for those persons who look after their parents?  As more and more people realise that some allowance is provided they will leave their jobs and look after their parents but we should not victimise them for doing this.  If they have to provide this care for a number of years it is not right that on the death of their parents they should be left without any allowance or benefit, deproved of a job and with no promotion prospects or pension.  Would such persons qualify for social welfare benefits on the death of their parents? Could they be credited with social welfare contributions durng the period they provide this care?</P>
    <P>This is a very serious problem and is one which needs to be looked into very urgently.  Many people have decided to care for their relatives.  For the most part, it is females who do this. I often wonder why it is insisted that the person who provides the care must be a female.  In many cases care is provided by a son or a nephew.  The word &ldquo;female&rdquo; should not be inserted here. I know of a few cases where sons came home from England to care for their parents.  There should be some arrangement whereby they would receive the allowance.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset we in the Labour Party welcome any improvement <Col N="1021" /> in the social welfare service.  We are glad to see that something is done for the people who are most in need but it should not be a stop-gap arrangement. It should not barely cover increases in the cost of living. Our aim should  be to improve the benefits as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will seriously consider some of the suggestions I made about a survey of the degree of malnutrition and the number of people in poverty so that we could consider a new social welfare code.  The Act of 1952 in relation to social welfare benefis is outmoded in the 1970s.  It would be to the credit of the Minister if he were to produce a White Paper on social welfare services.  We should at least try to give social welfare recipients a higher percentage of the gross national product.</P>
    <P>There are a few people in the community who work but who do not pay stamps but who draw unemployment assistance.  Such persons are parasites who are not helping the State.  I should like to see this unjust system eliminated.  I should like to see these people face up to their responsibilities and I should like that they would play their part and not be parasites on the rest of the community.</P>

This evening, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, he tells us we should have better services.  As far as the resources of the nation permit, we are improving the services.  But the Deputy and his party voted against these increases.  I do not know why.  The Deputy is a decent, God-fearing man.  This evening he tried to justify his opposition to the Budget under which these increases were given.  He tried to justify that opposition by saying we are not giving enough.  But he voted against what we are giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases in social welfare this year amount to £2,982,000 for non-contributory, old age and blind pensions. <Col N="1022" /> The Deputy voted against these increases. There is £645,000 for widow's and orphans' pensions.  There is £1,284,000 for unemployment assistance. There is £1,188,000 for children's allowances and £310,000, a new scheme, for the benefit of deserted wives and provision for old age, care, allowances.  All of us have the interests of our people at heart.  As far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we are a Christian socialist society.  We are most anxious to ensure that nobody in our society goes hungry or in want.</P>
    <P>I have always taken a keen interest, as a member of the Dublin Health Authority for nine years, in home assistance.  Under the auspices of the Dublin Health Authority we set up a welfare department for the benefit of our citizens. Last year the sum provided was increased from £50,000 to £500,000.  The idea was that those living alone and those who had difficulty in meeting rent should have the rent paid for them and get between £3 and £4 per week, plus other amenities, such as meals on wheels and so on. The welfare department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health.  I should be delighted to get from Deputy Dr. O'Connell particulars of the case to which he referred.  The social welfare officers visit the old in their homes.  They are most anxious to ensure that they are properly housed and properly fed.  We all know that the aged are not always capable of looking after themselves.  I shall be very brief because I have to go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was never intended that social welfare should pay for everything.  I know Dublin and the people of Dublin for many years and I know that the poorest of them make provision through insurance policies for their burials.  They look after their relatives. It is only the isolated case which has to be looked after or buried by the local authority.</P>
      <P>Children's allowances are increased under this measure.  Contributory and non-contributory pensions are increased. Unemployment assistance is increased.  So are blind pensions.  All of these things are social advantages. If the resources of our nation would permit it, I should like every old age pensioner to receice twice as much as is being given at the moment.  We are and always have been deeply concerned to improve the lot of all our people. The Minister has gone a long way in respect of relatives of parents who are ill at home. He was the first Minister to introduce this scheme for which we are deeply grateful.  The extension of the] scheme will help to keep old people out of institutions or homes if the depenants get any help at all.  In turn, the State will benefit.  The trend nowadays, if a person is ill or unable to do anything, is for the children to try to get that a person a bed in some institution or hospital.  The Minister has a perfect social conscience.  Anything he can do to improve the position here and to encourage the care and treatment of more and more people in their homes would be a great social advance and, in turn, it will to a considerable degree reduce the demands on the Department of Health and on the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>The various social welfare officers employed by the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health co-operate very well in dealing with their cases.  Nothing is perfect but, as far as possible, we have a reasonably good welfare officer system in the city and county of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the <Col N="1024" /> introduction of this Bill.  He himself, his Parliamentary Secretary, his staff and the Department have been very helpful.  Inevitably, certain benefits will be delayed but as far as possible the Minister and the offices of his Department have tried tio eliminate any misunderstandings that occur from time to time.</P>
    <P>I trust our State will be able to continue to increase benefits for the weaker sections of our community.  We have tried to ensure that nobody in our society will be hungry or in want.  When Budget Day comes,  we are always pleased that the State displays concern for those who require aid from the community.  In the light of demands for housing, water, sewerage, rates, agriculture, and other matters, we have got a reasonable slice of the financial cake in each year and we trust that that situation will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a  fairly detailed Bill.  Before dealing with it, perhaps I should say that it is essential to have a separate Minister in charge of the Department of Social Welfare as distinct from one Minister looking aftr that Department plus the Department of Labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise relevantly on this Bill. It is solely a matter for the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, I wonder on whom we can pin some responsibility.  Some delays in the Department are excessive.  With a Department which cover a wide spectrum of social problems, it is in the natural order of things that we would have delays.  A Deputy receives more queries in relation to social welfare than in relation to any other State activity. When I write to the Department of Social Welfare I receive an acknowledgement a few days later of receipt of my letter and informing me that the content of it is receiving attention. I may have to wait for weeks or possibly up to four months before the matter is finalised.  Persons waiting for some social welfare benefit find these delays very disheartening.  It is unfair and unjust that a person should have <Col N="1025" /> to wait a long period before receiving the benefit which, in most cases, the person is entitled to receive</P>
      <P>I can give one example of a woman who has been waiting since the end of March for a widow's pension.  Until recently she received no pension.  In fact, she received two weeks pension since the end of March.  She has seven children and she has had to wait that length of time.  The local authority wrote to her for rent which was due. They told her that ejectment proceedings would be started against her if her rent was not paid.  I wrote to the local authority and asked to have her rent reduced because her husband had died.  I received a letter from the local authority saying her rates could be reduced or abated but they were nor prepared to grant her a rent reduction. The matter is with the solicitors for the council.</P>
      <P>The main responsibility for the rent being due lies with the Department of Social Welfare.  I have been  in correspondence with the Department since the end of April or early May trying to get this pension.  I have a full file on it and I can show it to the Minister or his private secretary at any time.  That is only one example.  This happens on numerous occasions. I have a vast number of files dealing with delays in the Department.  For that reason alone, it is essential that we have a full-time Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill has gone through the House in which I should like to have seen some provisions in regard to a person who has been partially incapacitated for work.  I know different instances in which, according to the medical referee, people are fit for light work. They receive a very small allowances, perhaps in the region of £1 or £2.  In the medical referee's opinion they are fit for light work, but invariably they find that they are unable to find light work in the provincial towns or villages. No light work is available.  Most Members of the House will agree that it is almost impossible for people who received an injury to obtain light work. Perhaps a claim is pending for compensation. Other employers are somewhat doubtful about employing them because they are afraid that, if they employ them, they may have a claim <Col N="1026" /> on their hands later for increasing the injury.  They are afraid that if they take them on they may later be sued as joint defendants or co-defendants.</P>
    <P>People who are injured are paid on a certain scale for the loss of a particular part of the body. They get a lump sum payment or a payment per week.  Perhaps in theory this is suitable. When this legislation was going through the House I believe that even the trade unions were in agreement with it.  It is time the Minister had a further look at the Occupational Injuries Act.  I should like to see it amended.  These people can be living on the breadline, and I really mean the breadline, because they are drawing in the region of £1 or £2 a week. That is all they can get.  Improvements could have been made in that Act. Under this Bill they should be entitled to receive more benefits than they are now receiving.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that increases were to be granted to widows, old age pensioners, deserted wives and also in relation to children's allowances.  I want to say to the Department, the Minister and the Minster for Finance, whoever he is when the next Budget is being drawn up, that tax increases in general will come into force the day following the Budget, but the increased benefits granted to recipients of social welfare are not paid until the following August, September, October, November, December of January.  The increases in the price of foodstuffs, clothing and fuel come into effect on the day following the Budget, but the increases which those people receive, and which they require to meet the increased costs, are not payable until some months later.</P>
    <P>In the last Bueget the turnover tax was increased by 2½ per cent, but the increase in the cost of living was about 12 per cent.  Unfortunately many people who would be entitled to increased benefits have passed away and, while we are waiting for this Bill to be passed, many more people will not be here to benefit because they too will have passed away.  Year in and year out tis is happening.</P>
    <P>I have been in the Dáil for a year approximately.  Last year I mentioned this matter when the Bill came before <Col N="1027" /> the House.  I mention it again this year. I recognise that it is difficult to provide the money.  All the stronger members of the community, the trade unions, the different bodies, the different associations, the people who can drive a bargain and the people who can go out on strike and hold up the country to ransom until they are granted their increases, have their increases granted retrospectively.  They are in a strong position to bargain.  They are in a position to hold out.  They are bargaining from a position of strength.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare recipients cannot bargain from a position of strength.  It is our responsibility to recognise that they must be treated fairly and squarely and decently and honestly.  It is up to us to ensure that their increased benefits are granted retrospectively to the day on which the turnover tax was increased. You must temper any form of Government with justice.  When other sections of the community can obtain retrospective payments, there is a responsibility on us to ensure that the people who have been suffering under the increased turnover tax, and who have not yet got their increased benefits, are compensated.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I labour the point, but it is important.  Every member of the Fine Gael Party supports me fully in saying that these people should be granted their increased benefits retrospectively. The people who are to benefit by these increases, in many cases I believe, have run up accounts because of the increases in the cost of living.  Everything went up in the last Budget, food, drink, fuel, clothing and medicine but to date the extra money needed to meet these extra costs has not been granted to people drawing social welfare benefit. I should like to see these increases applied retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that death grants are to be payable.  I believe I am correct in stating that these grants are payable only in respect of social welfare contributors. I should like the Minister to confirm that at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In the coming Budget I hope some provision will be made for deserving cases who are unable to meet increased costs themselves.  I recently came across a case of a person drawing military service pension in respect of whom a grant had been <Col N="1029" /> applied for.  I should like some grant to be payable for people drawing IRA pensions and I should like provision to be made in this Social Welfare Bill for all those who are drawing Old IRA pensions and who are unable to meet the cost of burial.  I know a case at present where the family are finding it very difficult to meet the funeral expenses.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the free fuel scheme extended.  The electricity allowance has benefited many people and those who are using it are very pleased with this scheme but I think it would be within the capacity of the Department to grant free briquettes as something home produced.  These could be provided for old age pensioners and widows living alone.  It should be quite simple to include such a provision in this Bill.  Perhaps, by means of a separate book or, if that was not necessary, pages could be included in the old age pension book which could be exchanged at the local store for a supply of briquettes.</P>
      <P>Government Departments, in the case of many new buildings, and State enterprises in some cases, are giving bad example by using oil for heating purposes.  Such bodies should encourage people to use native fuel instead of importing oil from abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that but he has responsibility for granting electricity and fuel allowances to social welfare recipients.  The Minister could give a very good example, and give a lead to Government Departments, by allowing peat briquettes to be given free to old age pensioners.  This would provide extra employment in Bord na Móna which would be desirable.  There are many bogs throughout the country that have not yet been&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the development of bogs on this scheme.  It would be irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to include a scheme for the provision of free briquettes to people <Col N="1030" /> drawing old age or widows' pensions. I know a case of a person who was not aware of the number of units to which he was entitled.  He lived alone and while suffering from a very bad flu he had no heat in the house except an electric fire and he allowed his electricity account to over-run his allowance.  Because of this he is now faced with an account for £15 for arrears from the ESB and he has to meet this bill from an old age pension. That is why I mentioned this point.  The person in question is from Ferbane which is in the heart of the Bord na Móna area.  I think what I am suggesting is a good idea as it would provide employment and possibly lead to further extension of Bord na Móna's operations.  The cost of such a provision would be very little and it would be of great assistance to people who require help and are grateful for any assistance given to them.  This would be a very wise provision by the Minister and something that could be easily implemented at small cost while providing additional revenue for Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to deal with the position of those caring for the aged. In many cases where a relative looks after an old age pensioner the Department are a little too strict in their interpretation of the rules.  Where a medical certificate is obtained from a doctor to the effect that a person is ill at home and requires attention from, perhaps, his daughter, whose husband is working, even though the husband is working and even though the person who is ill is drawing an old age pension, the wife of the employed man should be granted a pension for looking after the person who is infirm or suffering from a long-term illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that people look after their parents out of love and out of gratitude for bringing them into the world and for being good parents to them, but a son or daughter with a large family and having to cope with all the problems of living from day to day, may find it difficult to look after his or her parents.  Therefore, this allowance would be an extra incentive. It may mean that a person will die among his family and friends in the <Col N="1031" /> locality in which he was born instead of dying in some home where he knows nobody, however excellent such a home may be.  The cost to the State of extending the scheme would be very small, and the cost of making such a payment to a son or daughter, niece or nephew, would be much less than the cost of keeping this person in some home having regard to the cost of nursing and medical staff and other institutional expenses.  It would also mean that many of the much-needed beds in these homes would be available when required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct the impression which has been created by one of the Government Deputies that we are opposed to these increases.  We are opposed to only one thing, the fact that the increases are so small.  No party calling itself a socialist party or a labour party could oppose attempts to improve the conditions of the list of people included in this Bill, the disabled, the widow, the old person, the unemployed person, the deserted wife. They are obviously people who deserve every help society can give them.  Our opposition is connected with the fact that such a pittance is being offered to people to live on because of the ineptitude with which the economy has been handled over the last half century by the different Governments who have been in control of our affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nobody here on any side of the House who can seriously believe that out of £5 a week an adult human being can pay rent, pay for clothing, pay for transport, pay for adequate fuel supplies, pay for various sickness contingencies, not to talk at all about entertainment, recreation, tobacco or anything like that.  The life which many people are able to lead on £5 a week must be particularly bleak and distressful. Not only have the Government Ministers in charge of various wealth creating Departments failed to create enough national wealth at a level which would allow us to provide a proper allowance for the old, the disabled, the widow and the unemployed, the most dependent section in our society, but they have also failed to control the price rises which have taken place with <Col N="1032" /> appalling rapidity over recent months and years.</P>
    <P>One of the regrettable changes in the Fianna Fáil Party's attitude and social consciousness over the last 30 years has been the change away from the idea of taxation based on an individual's capacity to pay.  In the early days Fianna Fáil based their fiscal policies on the socialist idea, from each according to his capacity to pay and to each according to his needs.  That has been changed now, and it is noticeable that in the financial provisions for this Bill increased contributions to the fund amount to nearly £8 million of which the Exchequer pays a mere £2 million-odd. This shows that all the Fianna Fáil Government have now decided to do is to take the money from the ordinary consumer, the ordinary white collar or manual worker and redistribute it to them in the form of social benefits of one kind or another, taking good care to extract as little as possible from the really wealthy sector in society.  It may be said that the employer pays a contribution and to that extent the wealthy sector of society is being soaked to pay for the less wealthy or the poor.  That, of course, is not true, because most of us know quite well that it has been so organised by industry and by the employers that, by a simple adjustment in prices, it is now possible for the employer to recover his so-called employer's contribution to the social security scheme.  He takes it back in the form of a slight increase in the price of the commodity. The employee pays his own contribution directly.  He pays another contribution indirectly through an increase in the price of the commodity.  He pays further, through the Exchequer, a contribution by the indirect taxes which bear most heavily now on the ordinary consumer and do not bear, as they did in the old days, on the very wealthy taxpayer who paid the highest possible taxes and in that way the burden of tax on the ordinary consumer was reduced. This change in fiscal policy towards increasing indirect taxation in order to save the very wealthy direct taxpayer has been one of the most retrograde developments in the social consciousness of the Fianna Fáil Party over the past ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> I should like to challenge the Minister, when he is replying if he would not mind, to tell us how he would advise an old person, a disabled person, a widow or anybody else in this group, to budget for a week's food, rent, fuel, clothes, emergencies, recreation, entertainment, transport and lighting on a £5 note.  Does he seriously believe this can be done?  If he does, can he give us a specimen budget for a week which he has tried out himself?  I do not wish any disrespect to the present Minister. I am talking to a Minister.  Can he give us a budget which he tried out?  Does he feel he can seriously suggest that an old person, a disabled person or a widow, can live out his or her life on this very inadequate allowance which we pay to these people in our society?</P>
    <P>A number of speakers said that now that we are going into the Common Market they hope that this or that will happen.  That is an extraordinary way to approach this question.  Similarly, people have made comparisons with Britain.  Equity in relation to a human being, a member of our society, is something which does not change simply because one is associated with other countries or other communities. It does not alter because one must keep up with the Joneses with whom one is now coming to live in the Common Market or in any other sort of alliance.  These questions of how people are to be cared for and to live out their lives in dignity are factors which are completely untouched or unchanged by any alliance which we may form in the future and are simply determined by the present needs of the individual in the light of the cost of living, in the light of conditions under which a person is asked to live his life among us.</P>
    <P>For over half a century we have had the opportunity of creating a society here which would, first of all, epitomise what could be broadly called the Christian ideal, that is, in relation to how one treats the underpriviliged in one's community.  I feel we have failed to do that completely.  Secondly, there are many people on all sides of the House who have for years protested their unshaken determination and ambition to secure a united Ireland and they are prepared to use practically any means <Col N="1034" /> in order to bring this about but the one means which could make it easier to bring it about would be for us to be able to say to our fellow Irishmen in the north, no matter who they are or which side they are on: &ldquo;If you come into a united Ireland you will find that conditions here are certainly as good as anything you enjoy at present.&rdquo; Preferably, they should be better. Surely that would be the best possible argument which we could put forward at this very critical time in our lives in order to answer the real or imagined objections which these people might have to the prospect of a united Ireland? I can never understand how people who have protested their republicanism over the years and their anxiety to see a united Ireland cannot see that the first precondition to unity must be that we can maintain parity in relation to health, education, and to the allowances paid to all these dependent classes.  It seems to me so self-evident that I cannot understand how all the political leaders over the years have not seen this.  At the present time, when this is a much more emotive subject, should we not, even at this very late stage, see that we cannot continue to treat these dependent people in this way lest it provide one real or imagined barrier towards the resolution of the objective which, I think, we all genuinely want? Quite obviously, nobody, whether nationalist or unionist, would come into a united Ireland where the social benefits are as paltry as are now offered here by the Government.</P>
    <P>Frequently it is said that we are a poor country and cannot afford to do any better than this.  I do not accept that at all.  For one thing there are examples of enormous wealth in the community held by a minority of people.  There is a sector of society here which lives very well, indeed, and there is quite an amount of extravagant display of great wealth in this country today while these pathetically inadequate allowances are paid to a very large sector of society&mdash;the old, the widowed and so on.  Even if that were not true my case always against the whole political and economic conception of private enterprise, capitalism, has been that every Minister&mdash;I have listened to every Minister who is <Col N="1035" /> a giving Minister, whether it is on Education, Health or Social Welfare&mdash; comes in with precisely the same story, that this is all we can afford and that we are a poor country.  I feel that an honest man who looks around the world today and sees countries such as ours&mdash;rural, predominantly agricultural communities with a relatively small industrial arm&mdash;can see many countries which have overcome this apparently basic difficulty of being a predominantly rural or agricultural community and have created a very high level of social services.  Some of the Scandinavian countries, particularly Denmark, are examples of this and New Zealand is an almost exclusively agricultural country.</P>

      <P>It is concerned with the provisions in chapter 2 of Part I of the Bill which deals with income tax, sur-tax <Col N="1037" /> and corporation profits tax.  Generally speaking these provisions impose a charge to tax on sums which at present escape tax because they are received after a trade or a profession has been discontinued, or after its accounting basis has been altered. Liability is also imposed on sums released in respect of trading debts for which deductions have already been allowed and provision is made for valuing work in progress at the discontinuance of a trade or profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for myself I do not like legislation which I feel does not tell the truth.  This statement that sur-tax is levied after £2,500 only applies to unearned income and therefore it is not a credible statement.  It is not the literal truth.  I do not like legislation which is crooked and there is an awful lot of crooked legislation around in this kind of situation.  The Minister might benefit from this kind of thing, or the Parliamentary Secretary might benefit, or I might, but that is not my point.  My point is that there is a statement here that sur-tax for the year beginning 6th April, 1970, shall be charged in respect of the income of any individual the total of which from all sources exceeds £2,500.  There is not one of us here who does not know that is not the truth.  You do not pay sur-tax on earned income, broadly speaking, under £5,000 a year.  Therefore, I do not like this kind of thing in a Bill which goes through this House.  It is discreditable to this House and to the people who drafted this legislation and put it into the Bill.  Therefore, I should <Col N="1042" /> like to ask the Minister why must it be done in this way?</P>

      <P>It appears, therefore, that it is merely a question of drafting. What is in this Bill is stated in the Finance Bill each year.  Nobody has been misled by it and I think it is putting it rather strongly, to say the least, to describe it as &ldquo;discreditable&rdquo; or &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone should legislation be accurate and truthful but it should be seen to be accurate and truthful.  This is not truthful in the sense that it does not tell the whole truth.  During the fifties we were all paying sur-tax on incomes in excess of £1,500 which, of course, was quite unfair.  Many of us with relatively small incomes were paying 2s 6d in the £ in sur-tax in addition to the ordinary tax. The reason the Government gave for making certain allowances was that we wanted expert executives to return here from Britain.  This was nonsense because if those expert executives were true Irishmen they would come back anyway.  In fact, the Government added £2,000 in two years to the £2,500 which was then the point from which sur-tax was levied.  It is not quite just for the Minister to infer that my remarks are unfair.  There are very few people in this country with unearned incomes in excess of £2,500 per year and yet this peculiar indirect method of legislation adopted by the Government results in this being the main section in the Finance Bill relating to sur-tax.  This kind of thing should be laid on the line so that we will know that this country is a country of Green Tories if, in fact, that is the case.  I do not think what is proposed here is reasonable and I do not care who drafted the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 4, line 27, to delete &ldquo;two-thirds&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;three-fifths&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments must be considered in relation to the section which it is proposed to amend and the section itself has to be considered in the light of the introduction of decimal currency on 15th February, 1971.  It appears to me utterly incongruous that in section 2 it is proposed that an individual who makes a claim and makes a return in the prescribed form of his total income shall be entitled to be charged at two-thirds of the standard rate of tax on the first £100 of taxable income.</P>
      <P>In relation to decimal currency the percentage two-thirds is unworkable: it produces a recurring decimal of 6.6 and does not operate.  If we are to have decimal currency on 15th February, 1971, it is about time that whoever drafted finance legislation would live with the times and at least produce a fraction&mdash;maybe a fraction of ten or 100&mdash;that is workable from the income tax point of view.  Accordingly, I have tabled amendments suggesting that &ldquo;three-fifths&rdquo; be substituted for &ldquo;two-thirds&rdquo;. Regardless of whether my amendment is accepted, the fraction two-thirds cannot remain after decimalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As Decimal Day is occurring not at the beginning or the end of a financial year but at a point in between, one has to choose between a rate that is suitable in decimal currency and one that is suitable in sterling.  In practice, virtually all assessments will have been made before 15th February, 1971, and as of now the revisions necessary in anticipation of the passing of this Bill in the allowances for PAYE purposes have been almost completed. In other words, we have had to opt for operating on the basis of the present currency and not on decimal currency.  To reverse that would lead to appalling difficulties and delays; <Col N="1044" /> there were some complaints on the discussion of the Second Stage about delays in issuing certificates of tax-free allowances under PAYE.</P>
      <P>What is intended is that we operate as indicated here on the sterling basis and that will be the practice for this financial year.  The change to decimal currency which will be necessary will be carried out in conjunction with the other changes necessary on the changeover to decimal currency, but the Deputy will appreciate that to accept his amendment would involve a calculation at the rate of 4s 2.4d in the £ as against 4s 8d which arises under the Bill as drafted.  For practical purposes for the present year this is a much more operable arrangement. Some people might consider it a relatively minor objection to the amendment&mdash;I do not consider it such&mdash;that it would cost the Exchequer approximately £700,000, and for all these reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from what the Minister has said that this was a considered decision in relation to the fraction to be used?  I am going to suggest that it was no such thing, that this particular section went into the Bill without regard whatsoever to the occurrence of decimalisation. The Minister is now very necessarily and understandably putting a bold face on what was a complete oversight by those who drafted or suggested the fraction used here.  Decimalisation occurs within the financial year for which legislation is sought, on 15th February, 1971.  I am quite certain if the full impact of decimalisation were understood a fraction appropriate to decimal currency would be suggested here.  I cannot see what the complications are.  The Minister has suggested that to alter it now would cause a variety of difficulties but I should like to know what the difficulties caused by getting some appropriate fraction&mdash; which would be appropriate for the portion of the financial year from February to April&mdash;are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the PAYE tax-free certificates for the current year are almost ready on the basis of the provisions of this Bill.  If any <Col N="1045" /> change were made these certificates would have to be started again.  I have also indicated that there have already been complaints in the House because of the delay in issuing these because people are operating on the basis of last year's assessment.  Another difficulty is that the non-PAYE assessments would be affected and would be considerably delayed.  In practice virtually all assessments would be made before 15th February, 1971, so that the practical choice with which one is faced must be dictated by the volume of assessments affected in the current financial year.  On that basis one must clearly work on the basis in the Bill and not on the decimal currency basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be getting a little more confused.  Under the Constitution we are the body designated to make laws.  I would not like to think that the Civil Service or the bureaucracy behind the Minister make the laws for us.  Are we to understand that without regard to this House and what it might decide, a group of civil servants have gone ahead and printed forms on the basis that section 2 of this Bill will be passed as proposed?  The Minister has told us because that has been done Deputies here should not alter the fraction in section 2.  We have had a fair amount of experience of this kind of situation, with particular reference to finance legislation over the years, where this House does not seem to count because some body outside, bureaucratically controlled, proceeds irrespective of what this House may decide.</P>
      <P>I assert that these gentlemen made a bloomer.  They provide in section 2 for a recurring decimal but they did not know about section 3 which provides for decimalisation.  They have had all the forms printed on the basis that no one here would advert to the bloomer made.  We are faced with the situation that because the forms will have to be re-printed some people will have to work a little bit harder undoing their mistakes.  I do not think it is good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has misunderstood me, whether deliberately or not I am not quite certain yet.  I did <Col N="1046" /> not say anything about the printing of forms or the trouble involved for civil servants.  I did talk about the many thousands of taxpayers on PAYE who, the longer the tax-free certificates giving the benefits of the increased allowances provided for in this year's Budget are delayed, the more they are inconvenienced.  It was the taxpayers' convenience that I was talking about; it is the taxpayers' convenience I am concerned with.  It is highly commendable that preparations should be made as far as they can be in anticipation of the passing of the Bill in order to convenience the taxpayer.  If, of course, the House decides to change the Bill, then whatever changes are necessary in the arrangements will have to be made.  It is highly commendable that every effort should be made to delay and inconvenience the taxpayer as little as possible.  This is the reason I gave and not any other reason.  I repeat this is the reason which I think the House should take into account.</P>

      <P>The Minister is talking about the interests of the taxpayer. It is right to indicate at this stage that the Budget was introduced on 23rd April last.  There has been a long conception of this Finance Bill by reason of difficulties of one kind or another in the Government Party, but we on this side of the House cannot be held to blame for that.  A properly controlled Government would have had this legislation before the House a long time ago.  It is a bit much if we are to debate this measure on the basis that our decisions do not count.</P>

      <P>Before world war II the rate of income tax here was half the standard rate on the first £100 of taxable income.  The Minister made a great song and dance in the Budget about giving the concession of two-thirds of the rate on the first £100 equivalent to £20 before world war II. If it be the case that the State cannot afford to make this half the rate instead of two-thirds of the rate the same as it was before the war even on £100&mdash; even as one-fifth on real terms&mdash;it is a bit steep.  The tax system is very unfair.  Whole chunks of the population are legally free from paying income tax and other chunks of the population are able to evade it on a massive scale. When the Taoiseach delivered the Financial Statement on behalf of the former Minister for Finance he said that 50,000 people would be taken out of the income tax assessment by this particular provision.  Everybody in this country who has anything to do with income tax knows that Dublin General has for years been an Augean stable. The Revenue Commissioners would be the last people to say it was anything other than that.  The most dreadful blunders have been made down there and still the Minister would not take a couple of hundred thousand people out of these assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exception is taken to quoting the conditions at the end of the economic dispute with Britain.  Let us come to the end of the 1950s.  We find that there has been no change whatever until this year since 1959-60 in the allowances for income tax since PAYE came into operation, except in relation to sur-tax. This is the reverse of what the position should be.  I do not mind what plea the Minister makes about it costing him so much to give half the rate on this small sum of £100.  This is but 100 buttons compared with 1939.  In real value it is only one-fifth.  The Minister is going to assess people at two-thirds.  This is the clear proof of the appalling state which has been reached in our community where people must be &ldquo;grilled&rdquo;.  The ordinary worker, the man who works essentially with his hands, and who makes £600 or £700 which is equivalent to £120 before the war when he would not have been liable to income tax, now <Col N="1048" /> finds that he is up to his neck in income tax payments.  This may seem like a concession of some sort but it is only a piece of nonsense.  If there were any serious effort to run the State on a proper basis, this kind of thing could be done on the inflation alone.  One of the Minister's predecessors, Dr. Ryan, used to say that the revenue was buoyant.  Is revenue not going to be more buoyant this year than ever before?  It is.  I regard this as a miserable concession.</P>

Since the Minister drew attention to my remarks let me say that if, in fact, my suggestions were to cost an additional £3 million a year all that proves is two things.  First, it proves the decline in the value of money and, secondly, it proves that the workers as a whole are being grossly over-taxed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to add to section 127 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 a provision enabling certain further regulations to be made for PAYE purposes.  There is a question of assessing people with incomes of less than £2,000 for PAYE purposes.  Employers are asked to supply a list of those whose earnings they expect will not exceed the maximum under the PAYE system and there is an earned income relief of £500 coded in as a deduction from the income in the course of the preparation of PAYE tax deduction certificates.  In these cases it can happen that if we do not have the regulations that can be made under this, we are going to have to demand from employers the returns in respect of these people earning more than £2,000 per year.  Either we shall have to deny to those people the allowances to which they would be entitled and hold them until the end of the year or we shall have to come back to the employers in the course of the year and add considerably to their difficulties.  The object of this is to enable the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1051" /> to make regulations which will enable the system to continue to operate smoothly having regard to the changes taking place in the allowances granted under the Bill.  Perhaps, I have not made the point very clear to the Deputy but if he could be a little more specific about his problem I shall try to explain more clearly.</P>

      <P>Section 134 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 enables an individual to claim a deduction of one-fourth of his earned income subject to a maximum deduction of £500.  The purpose of the section is to provide the minimum earned income relief of £125 for single and widowed persons and £225 for married persons.

      <P>This is a relief section, but while the measure of relief in the section is welcomed, it is worth indicating that it is not a very notable step forward.  I cannot understand why, since this first came in in 1920, no worthwhile step forward was taken in relation to allowances for the earnings of wives.  We have a situation developing in our economy where the working wife will play an increasingly important part in the development of many small and growing businesses in this country.  This mild, slight amelioration of the position, while welcome, is something <Col N="1054" /> which I do not think justifies much bugle blowing.

      <P>In subsection (2), page 9, line 51, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than a registered sub-contractor under this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 17 of this Bill is a copy of section 17 of this year's British Finance Bill and, like its British counterpart, it is aimed at an evasion of income tax by labour only sub-contractors.  I want to indicate to Deputies that we are dealing with a section now which is of the utmost importance to every Deputy in this House because the effect of this section, if it is passed as it stands, will be felt in every constituency in the country.  As I say, it is aimed at an evasion of income tax by what are known in the income tax code apparently as labour only sub-contractors, who are more often known as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; in the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing in section 17 with what is a most complex and difficult subject.  Before the similar section&mdash; it is almost precisely the same&mdash; appeared in the Finance Bill of this year in the United Kingdom, a committee of inquiry, under the chairmanship of Professor E.H. Phelps Browne, was set up to inquire into certain matters concerning labour in building and civil engineering.  This committee of inquiry went into the whole question of how labour was employed, deployed, organised and remunerated in the construction industry. Eventually this year, following the report of that committee, a Bill was introduced in the British House of Commons known as the Construction Industry <Col N="1056" /> Contracts Bill.  This particular Bill, following this report, set out to deal in effect with genuine sub-contractors who employed labour, who genuinely contracted with a contractor, who had a known business address and settled place of abode.  It set out to provide a standard whereby genuine sub-contractors in the building industry in Britain would be recognised and it provided for their registration.  It also provided for other consequential matters.</P>
    <P>That Construction Industry Contracts Bill was, in fact, run in tandem through the House of Commons with section 17 of their Finance Bill of this year.  However, the Construction Industry Contracts Bill did not get a Second Reading because Parliament was dissolved.  The result was that section 17 of the British Finance Bill was dropped and excluded from the Bill which eventually went through the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>We find here&mdash;without any explanation, without any investigation, without any inquiry&mdash;that the people who sponsored section 17 have taken section 17 of the British Bill and put it in as section 17 of our Finance Bill, 1970.  Do they, I wonder, realise what they are doing?  Do they realise what is proposed here?  I invite all Deputies to study section 17 so that we may understand what it is we are being asked to legislate here.  Section 17 provides that every contractor, before he pays any sub-contractor, shall deduct from what is due to that sub-contractor full income tax at 7s in the £.  No reliefs, no earned income relief, nothing whatever.  He must deduct income tax at 7s in the £.</P>
    <P>The contractor, who is generally the big man, can afford to finance his operations and pay his tax in due course on assessment; he can make his reckoning with the Revenue Commissioners. Under this proposal, every small sub-contractor will face a deduction of the full rate of income tax at 7s in the £ on his bill.  No relief.  No PAYE.  There is nothing of that kind because the Revenue Commissioners are out to get the &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; are the fellows who club together, who have nothing else except <Col N="1057" /> their own labour, no material, no business address, nothing of that kind; they just lump together to contract for labour only and they are paid a lump sum.  Up to this they got away with it on the basis that it was a contract price and not an earning or a wage. Now, in order to get these, it is proposed in this section that every genuine sub-contractor will be charged at the full standard rate of 7s in the £ which will be deducted as a matter of obligation by the big contractor from the sub-contractor's bill when he quotes his contract price.</P>
    <P>This is an outrageous proposal.  I do not believe the Minister was responsible for it.  The Minister is experiencing what so many other Ministers for Finance have experienced over the years&mdash;stuff put in without Ministers being fully acquainted with it.  It is the old system we always find here&mdash;legislation by bureaucracy.  This section was, in fact, dropped in Britain because in Britain they were not able to get the associated legislation through the House of Commons.  If section 17 of the British Finance Bill were enacted in Britain the income tax law in relation to sub-contracting would have provided that all sub-contractors genuinely in business, having a business address, or a known place of abode, observing the law of the land, providing for employers liability insurance, providing for PAYE in relation to their employees, would be registered and any sub-contractor who did not qualify would not be registered.  The British Act would have provided that it was only in relation to a non-registered sub-contractor that the main contractor, when making payment, would have to effect a deduction of tax and so on.</P>
    <P>Since this section was borrowed from the British Bill, the amendments I propose are designed to ensure that, if it does comes into our financial legislation, it will come in in the sense in which the British proposed it would operate in Britain.  The purpose of the amendments is to provide, in effect, that the Revenue Commissioners, who desire to deal with the tax evasion involved in lumping, or in labour only contracting, will be obliged to establish and maintain a register of sub-contractors <Col N="1058" /> containing full particulars of their Christian names, surnames, addresses and, to qualify for registration, sub-contractors must satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that they, first of all, have a settled residence or business address; in other words, that it is not a nominee representing a floating group operating from construction site to construction site throughout the country which is, I gather, what this legislation was intended to cover; secondly, that they comply with the requirements of the Social Welfare Acts and operate employment in the sense that the proper social welfare contributions are paid; thirdly, that they comply with Statutory Instrument No. 28 of 1960, which is PAYE; fourthly &mdash; I regard this as of the utmost importance&mdash;that they provide in relation to those whom they employ proper employers liability insurance cover.  That is what was proposed to be done in Britain.  That is what this report is all about.  That is why they introduced in Britain the Construction Industry Contracts Bill.  That is how they proposed to deal with this problem in Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that the same thing should be done here and, if it is done, it will be possible to differentiate between the genuine, hardworking, small contractors, who have a difficult job to keep things going, and whom it is proposed to tax under this section and discriminate against in a most unjust way, and those who fail to be registered because they have no fixed place of abode, no business address, do not observe the law in relation to social welfare contributions, or anything else. Let the section operate against them, which is what I anticipate it was designed to do.</P>
    <P>My amendments are intended to achieve this end, subject to this: the genuine labour only sub-contractor organised himself and his mates to evade income tax, but what he did was lawful. It was not prohibited by the law as it stands and, therefore, I do not see why, if a section is being brought in to deal with that kind of tax evasion, such people should not get the ordinary reliefs available to other taxpayers.  I <Col N="1059" /> do not see why the provisions governing PAYE, providing for the various personal reliefs, should not be available to them.  That is the purpose of my amendment No. 6.  It may not be very happily worded but the purpose is that the Revenue Commissioners should be in a position to allow a sum, in relation to the tax, to be deducted which is fairly representative of the reliefs such people would have been entitled to had they fallen naturally into the taxing ambit.  I consider this section inappropriate. It is a pity that a practice, referred to frequently in this House on Committee Stage of this Bill, should be continued so blatantly.  Sections are borrowed from British legislation and put into our Bills here without any association in relation to background or circumstances&mdash;in this instance, without any of the safeguards that were envisaged in Britain: just put into a highly technical piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>No matter who we are in any part of this House, we are dealing here with legislation which is highly technical.  It took me hours to work out the scheme behind section 17.  I feel the loss in this debate of a man who was an acknowledged expert on these matters&mdash; the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman&mdash; but we have to carry on.  It is a matter for protest that a section, described in the side note as one dealing with &ldquo;tax deductions from payments to sub-contractors in the construction industry&rdquo; should be designed to put a discriminatory tax imposition on every sub-contractor throughout the country. That this should be put into our legislation here, without any explanation, is wrong and I want to make a protest on that ground.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12, which reads as follows,</P>
    <P>In page 10, subsection (11), line 54, after &ldquo;appoints&rdquo; to add &ldquo;but not before the 6th day of April, 1971&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>proposes that the section, as amended. and dealing with what it should deal&mdash; purely the problem of tax evasion&mdash; should not operate until at least 6th April of next year.  A fair warning should be given in relation to such a <Col N="1060" /> complicated matter.  I have here the report on the distribution of labour in the building industry in Great Britain. Anyone reading it will appreciate how dangerous it is suddenly to alter a habit and a practice that has grown up.  If this change is to come about, it is only fair that a warning of some six or eight months should be given as to what is involved and that this legislation should then take its effect after that due notice.</P>
    <P>We are concerned in this Bill primarily with fiscal considerations and fiscal matters.  At times, one forgets that the very operation of a tight, Draconian, fiscal legislation may have a very unintended but inevitable result on the economy.  I do not blame the Revenue Commissioners.  Their concern is merely further to tighten and to abolish loopholes in relation to the tax net.  The very doing of that can, at times, have a very disadvantageous economic effect on the country.  This is an example.  At the moment, this country requires skilled labour.  There is a need in this country for every man with a skill to be here at home.  This kind of legislation can drive them away.  If we have to hasten at all in this respect, we should hasten very slowly, indeed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the different amendments is to write into section 17 an obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to establish a register of genuine sub-contractors; to provide that on payments an employer or a main contractor may make to a person not registered as a sub-contractor there will be allowed the appropriate measure of relief that normally would be allowed to a taxpayer earning money on a building site; and, lastly, that the section itself should not come into operation upon the proposed day, which I think is the date of the passing of the Act, but after due warning has been given: the date I suggest is 6th April of next year.</P>

      <P>The House is indebted to Deputy O'Higgins for the work he has put into this appalling section.  Essentially, what is written in it is &ldquo;Trust the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo; It is a long way back in history since the Greeks, in their <Col N="1061" /> financial system, spied on one another. I would not trust the Revenue Commissioners outside the door of this Chamber.  The essence of subsection (7) is: &ldquo;It will be all right.  The Revenue Commissioners will leave out honourable, decent people and will look after them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is nowhere in this section a provision for expenses incurred, let us say, by a sub-contractor buying materials.  Why?  Because it is intended to catch lumpers.  Why then, when the section was being drafted, was not the word &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; in inverted commas put in with a definition.  This would be quite a simple straightforward job. Instead of that, we have these involved phrases, including the phrase at one place: &ldquo;where a contractor makes a payment to another person whether a contractor or not.&rdquo;  That could be construed as &ldquo;whether to himself or not.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an appalling section.  I had great sympathy with Deputy Gallagher on Second Reading when he made a rather different case against it from the case I am making now, just as Deputy O'Higgins made a different case against it a while ago.  Let us not misunderstand the situation.  Nearly everybody in this House who will speak on this section will pay his proper income tax.  Therefore, he will not shed any tears over people who have been escaping the net being caught.  At the same time, fair is fair and there is no point in delivering people bound hand and foot into the net of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To err is human.  The officers of the Revenue Commissioners being so hard pressed as they are&mdash;and everybody knows they are hard pressed; they cannot get staff at present&mdash;are bound to make errors, and these errors can cause grave trouble to people who, if they are lumpers or semi-lumpers, are hard-working people.  I do not agree with creating difficulties for people who work hard.  I do not think this House should create such difficulties.  I hope the Minister will either approach the matter in the simple straightforward way I have suggested which, of course, never appeals to people who go in for this kind of legislation, or else that he will take the section out of the Bill altogether.  I believe the Minister could <Col N="1062" /> get at this matter in a completely different way.  I am convinced of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This group of amendments is designed to do something quite similar, in fact, in some ways to the proposals contained in the British Construction Industry Contracts Bill, 1970, which was abortive in the situation described by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
      <P>One can see at a glance that the group of amendments envisage a much more elaborate type of machinery than is envisaged in the section.  This matter was considered by the Revenue Commissioners but it was quickly realised that the problems with which they were faced in Britain were very much more complex than the problems with which we are faced.  There were many more items with which they were concerned; for example, the selective employment tax which does not operate here and many other items.  Presumably they decided, because of the complex nature of their problems, that this elaborate structure was necessary.</P>
      <P>However, in our circumstances it does not seem to us that a very elaborate arrangement of this kind is necessary at all.  If it should eventually turn out to be necessary to have a more elaborate arrangement, this can be done.  As of now, it is intended to have this arrangement as simple as possible and to impose the least possible burden on the construction industry. I might point out that the acceptance of these amendments could very well impose a much greater burden on the construction industry.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy O'Higgins, in something he said and repeated at least once, if not more than once, did not advert to the provisions of subsection (7) because he stated that this subsection would operate in relation to all the sub-contractors in the country and would have the effect of deducting from payments due to them income tax at 7s in the £.  This just is not so.  To get this into perspective we must realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the provisions of subsection (7) this section should operate only in relation to sub-contractors or lumpers who are not paying their tax and making no returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  The majority of the <Col N="1063" /> sub-contractors make returns and pay tax, so that we are dealing, in the first instance, with a minority of sub-contractors. Secondly, of that minority, those who have not heretofore made returns or who have not heretofore paid tax, have the opportunity now, before being caught by this section, of making arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners whereby they will get the certificate, and this section will not operate.  There will be no deductions from the payments made to them if they have this certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>So, we are left with a small group and they, in turn, may be divided into two classes.  On the one hand, there are those who might be regarded as genuine sub-contractors, genuinely self-employed, who, despite the provisions of this section, intend to continue to evade their liability to tax.  I do not think anyone in this House will shed a tear over them.  The other class remaining are those who heretofore were employed people and in substance were working for a wage but, in order to avoid liability for tax, operated on the basis of being sub-contractors.  These people in their own interests should be operating under the PAYE system and, if they go back into that system, this section will not operate against them at all.</P>
    <P>What we are really talking about and dealing with here in this section are sub-contractors who have not made and will continue not to make returns to the Revenue Commissioners, people who do not want the Revenue Commissioners to know they exist.  In speaking of them we are speaking of a small minority of sub-contractors.  It seems to me that, while this is a problem, it is not a major problem.  It certainly has not the dimensions or complexities of the same kind of problem in Britain and we do not need a very elaborate system to deal with it.  At least, it does not appear at the moment that we do.  In my view the simpler the system we have to deal with it the better and the less we impose on the construction industry in this way the better.  Consequently, what is proposed in this section seems to me to meet the requirements of what <Col N="1064" /> needs to be done with the minimum amount of dislocation.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that a sub-contractor who submits returns and accounts to the Revenue Commissioners, or who satisfies them that he genuinely intends to do so, will get the certificate required under subsection (7) and will, therefore, have no difficulty in the operation of the section.  That being so, and dealing with a small class that could theoretically, at any rate, be divided into the two groups I have mentioned, it seems to me that what we are providing for here is designed to deal with this small group and, at the same time, to deal with them in as simple a way as possible.</P>
    <P>The group of amendments proposed by Deputy O'Higgins are much too elaborate for what we need to do.  I certainly think we ought to see how this section operates before we impose such an elaborate system on the construction industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Finance does not know a great deal about the building industry.  I do not say that just to be critical of the Minister or of what he has said but some things which he said this evening give me the impression that he does not understand the situation.  Deputy O'Higgins's amendments have been fairly well documented and thought out and well presented.  In my opinion he was dealing with the position of the sub-contractor and what the Minister was talking about was a different type of people, those we refer to as the lumpers&mdash;call them sub-contractors or anything you like.  They are not as scarce in the building industry as the Minister seems to think.  The situation has been forced on them because very many of these people travel long distances to work and do very hard work.  The hardest work on building sites is usually the work taken on by the group who do the lumping job.  Because they get no compensation of any kind from the Department of Finance they must meet their full income tax payments if they are making returns in the normal way despite the fact that they have to provide their own transport, meals and so on.  They get no allowances <Col N="1065" /> for that.  Their answer is that a group of them get together and carry out jobs under a verbal contract commonly known as a lump job.</P>
      <P>There are so many loopholes in this that I cannot see that it makes very much difference.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that this provision will catch the genuine sub-contractor, the little man who is doing small jobs of sub-contracting, who carries on a business. It will catch him because he works from a regular base at the same type of work and keeps accounts.  Those the Minister is talking about are people who do not work from a regular base and do not keep accounts and in order to compensate themselves for their long journeys and the type of work they do they undertake this work under a verbal contract.  Perhaps they work longer hours than is usual, work in all kinds of weather, and they work very hard.</P>
      <P>What the Minister seems to have completely overlooked is that this is not a matter for him.  As I said on Second Reading, this is a job for his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, who could very well do it, because I think the big point in this case is not the fact that they cannot be caught for income tax but that they do not stamp insurance cards and when one of them becomes ill or unemployed he gets no benefit from anybody.  I believe the Government could very well investigate this aspect of the matter and do something about it.  Usually, these people pass from one job to another.  Some may stay with one firm for some time but that is rather unusual. Usually they go from site to site doing certain jobs under lump conditions. They move around until they find a site where they can do the same type of work.  They do not have regular employment.  In effect, the Minister is saying that somebody, say the first man to employ them, will deduct income tax at 7s in the £ from what they get even though there may be ten of them in the group and some may be entitled to tax free allowances or others &mdash;many of them have big families&mdash; even if they filled in income tax returns, would not be liable for tax in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For days or even weeks they may <Col N="1066" /> not be employed on this sort of work. Then they go along to a new site.  They move around from place to place.  How does the Minister suggest they could be traced or that it would be possible for a main contractor to keep track of such people for the purpose of finding out what income tax they have already paid or should pay?  Is the Minister about to create a new class of people who will be taxed on everything they earn whether they are entitled to allowances or not?  He referred to the fact that this is different in the case of England but the only difference I see is that workers here cannot declare a wife in Ireland which very often happens in the case of a worker on the English side.  He may get a tax allowance on that basis.  They cannot do that here because it can too easily be checked.  I believe the Minister is using a very big mallet to crack what is relatively a very small nut.  The amount of tax involved is relatively small and the amount of trouble involved for the contractor and the Revenue Commission will, in my opinion, far outweigh the amount of money that could be collected in this way.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this is a result of what was done in the British Parliament. That may be at the back of it, but if the Minister were determined to catch people who were not paying tax he could have looked in other directions rather than towards those people who are not earning such very big wages and whose income is not so great that it will yield the type of money commensurate with the work involved.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to get somebody in the building industry from one side or the other to have a look at this matter because I am quite sure that while the Revenue Commissioners, from their ivory tower, may see this in a certain light, if the Minister gets the advice of somebody who really knows the situation he will find the problem is not what is suggested to him.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister knows what happens when contractors, not in the city, but in the country, take on, perhaps, 20 or 30 houses scattered <Col N="1067" /> over a big area.  The usual thing is for them to get somebody to dig the foundations, somebody else to lay blocks, somebody to do the timber work and somebody else the tiling, and so on.  These people are employed for only a short time and move from one job to another.  They may have many other types of work.  Small farmers particularly, are involved in this in a big way.  Does the Minister suggest this provision should apply all round and that the main contractor should deduct tax at the rate of 7s in the £ from every £ irrespective of whether they are employed full-time or entitled to tax-free allowances or anything of that kind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have mentioned when I spoke that it is intended, before making regulations under this section that the Revenue Commissioners will have consultations with the various people involved, particularly in the construction industry. No doubt they will learn more about the building industry than I know but despite what Deputy Tully has said since he began he did not tell me anything about it that I do not know.  I do not see what his difficulty is.  He may have a difficulty in mind but he has certainly not made it clear to me that there is any insuperable difficulty in the operation of this provision. When he spoke about people moving around and not having fixed jobs or even fixed addresses, he suggested that the main contractor would not know what their allowances should be or anything else.</P>
      <P>I agree this is so if the situation were to be that the main contractor were expected to know this, but he is not, and it is not only the main contractor, remember.  The person who is paying the money to somebody like this will either have to deduct tax at 7s in the £ or the man to whom he is paying the money will produce a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners in which case the contractor who is paying the money can forget about it.</P>

      <P>From what Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Tully have said, and even from the Minister's own remarks, this is not a particularly big problem here.  If it is not, can the Minister explain why this section was taken holus-bolus out of a British Act without any inquiry such as Deputy O'Higgins has quoted from and in circumstances &mdash; and I think the Minister should advert to this &mdash; of a particularly difficult year for the building industry? There has been a protracted cement strike.  There is a bank strike still continuing. The Minister himself is aware, as are the other Deputies here, that a great deal of the building in this country is done by small builders, particularly in respect of housing, and I suppose in a matter of this sort we are anxious to assist in every possible way with the construction of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly in England it is a bigger problem and the extent of tax evasion and the amount of revenue <Col N="1069" /> lost may have been considerable. At any rate, it was so important that the authorities there, apart from the comparable section in the legislation there, had also drafted this other legislation, which as Deputy O'Higgins and the Minister remarked, has fallen by the wayside because of the election.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister says, there is a very small group that may be caught, then the extent of the loss of revenue cannot be considerable, and I think Deputy Tully is to a great extent correct.  Already this year I have known of cases under PAYE where, because of the changes in the allowances made in the Budget and the need to amend certificates of tax free allowance or other allowances that are granted under PAYE, at least two amendments had to be made in order to effect them.  In these cases the person's income was known because the salary was a fixed one and there was not any of the complications that arise in this instance. However, I would suggest to the Minister that what should be done is to consider the substance.  It may be in the circumstances that the type of machinery which Deputy O'Higgins has provided is more elaborate than is necessary, but the only reason for introducing it is the manner in which this section was originally drafted and the fact that the safeguards and the machinery that were intended to be provided in the British legislation are not being provided here.</P>
    <P>Some indication should be given, before a section of this sort is drafted, of the estimated revenue loss.  It is important not to make a change especially at a time when the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Labour, announces that he is making special efforts to attract back Irish personnel who have particular skills, who are working in Britain and who have been canvassed or notified of suitable vacancies existing here.  In many cases the people commonly described as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; are people with special skills and, as Deputy Tully rightly pointed out, in most cases they go from job to job and they might be very far away before the detailed particulars which the revenue certificate would require to be available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> I should like to support the idea behind Deputy O'Higgins's amendment and also the pertinent remarks which were made by Deputy Tully as to the possible serious effect of this particularly in a year in which builders, especially small builders, are having a difficult time because of the credit situation, the prolonged bank strike and the lengthy cement strike.  The provisions that are being made here should at least allow for notice, such as is provided in the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Higgins, that this section would not operate until April, 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has taken a section, section 17, out of a British Act of Parliament and put it into this Finance Act as section 17.  Normally objection could be taken to that, especially if it deals with a problem which has assumed considerable magnitude in England but which is a very much smaller problem, if it is a problem at all.  However, the Minister has gone much further here, because he has taken out of an English Bill a section which was subsequently deleted from that Bill before it became law, because another Bill which was going through the English Parliament and which provided certain safeguards against the effect of this particular section was dropped.</P>
      <P>This is unpardonable.  It shows that once the Minister gets the scent of something in a British Act of Parliament which he thinks might be useful here in enforcing his revenue laws he will hold on to that at all costs and he will out-do the British.  Even when they have decided that it would not be safe to proceed with it in certain circumstances, the Minister says: &ldquo;I will operate it here anyway.  I will enforce it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how he draws a distinction between a sub-contractor who is operating for a large contractor and a small contractor-in-chief, if he knows what I mean, a small one-man contractor who is carrying out small contracts for citizens.  How does the Minister draw a distinction between these two?  I feel that this is the thin end of the wedge <Col N="1071" /> and that it is imposing a very heavy burden on the contractor and on the sub-contractor.  Furthermore, it seems to me that it is an extension of the practice which seeks to make the citizen a collector of taxes; it is an extension of the PAYE system.  It is hard to see where the line will be drawn or how far this practice might be extended to cover other forms of service rendered by one person for another.  This was obviously the brain child of the British Department of Finance or its equivalent and they did not proceed with it.  That is the important thing.  They apparently did not consider that it would be reasonable to proceed with it without building in certain safeguards.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins and other Deputies who have spoken about subsection (7) which says that the tax need not be deducted if a certificate is provided.  I could see a genuine sub-contractor being held up for ages in obtaining the necessary certificate while the Revenue Commissioners made inquiries about him and got him to fill in forms.  Very often the sub-contractor will not be a very learned person.  He will not be skilled in the art of filling forms and he will be reluctant to fill them up.  The result will be that it will be well-nigh impossible for him to get the certificate under subsection (7) of section 17 which would enable the contractor to pay him in full.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give much more consideration to this and he should drop it until such time as he has considered it and is able to put before the House or to write into the Act adequate safeguards.  Failing that, he should accept Deputy O'Higgins's amendments which are designed to provide the safeguards which the British Minister and the British authorities thought necessary before introducing this section.</P>

He has lumped together what are known as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; and genuine sub-contractors.  He has made no effort to distinguish between them in the <Col N="1072" /> legislation he has drawn up.  We have often heard complaints in this House about government by regulation where the Minister passes an omnibus section and then makes regulations under it. We are going a step further now: we have government by the Revenue Commissioners. It is not written into a statute; it is not written into a regulation which can be considered by the House afterwards; it will be done by a certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  This is going a step further than usual; it is legislation by somebody outside this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has quietly referred us to subsection (7) and there it is stated that people will be exempt if the Revenue Commissioners give them a certificate.  If they get that certificate all they need do is produce it and they have no further trouble.  Bob's your uncle after that.  They must get the certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. Deputy O'Higgins has endeavoured to provide safeguards.  He has put a lot of work into this and he has endeavoured to include stipulations in the Bill to protect the taxpayer so that they will be written there in black and white and he will not have to go afterwards cap in hand to a Revenue Commissioner to get his exemption.</P>
      <P>The law in this country as regards revenue is very different from the ordinary law.  Under the ordinary law one is innocent until one has been proven guilty.  When one is dealing with revenue one is guilty until one has proven one's own innocence.  The position here will be that the citizen will be obliged to go along and try to get this certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners may do it very fairly; they may not.  It is only proper that the citizen should be given protection and that his exemption should be written into the Bill now going through the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister in effect has said: &ldquo;This is all right.  None of the general effect that I have indicated will happen.  This will fall only on those for whom nobody in this House would hold a brief.&rdquo;  That is all very well.  We must regard all legislation here, particularly financial legislation <Col N="1073" /> because it is imposing taxation, with considerable suspicion.  This is not said in any aggressive or vindictive manner.  It is the duty of Deputies so to regard legislation of this kind in this House.</P>
      <P>Section 17 tells us that in this section</P>
      <P>&ldquo;construction contract&rdquo; means a contract whereby a person is liable to another person to carry out construction operations or to be answerable for the carrying out of such operations by others, or to furnish his own labour or the labour of others, in the carrying out of such operations.</P>
      <P>That is what a &ldquo;construction contract&rdquo; is and that applies to any agreement between one man and another relating to any aspect of the building industry.  Therefore, this section is of general application.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this section where in the performance of a construction contract, whether made before or after the commencement of this section,...</P>
      <P>The next thing we know is that in this section of general application provision is made that it will have retrospective effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I say &ldquo;no&rdquo; because the effect of it is that it would apply to payments made after the passing of the Act, whether made on foot of a contract entered into before or after the passing of the Act.  It only relates to payments made after the passing of the Act so I do not think that it is accurate to describe it as retrospective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is inaccurate to describe it that way.  A contract has been entered into today, say, before the passing of the Act, under which a building operation is to be carried out at my behest because I have entered into a contract with Deputy Fitzpatrick or Deputy Tully. That is entered into, say, even before the Bill was introduced here.  Payment comes to be made on the 1st August and under the provisions of this section when I am paying Deputy Tully for the work he contracted to do for me I am obliged to deduct tax at 7s in the £.  Now, that obligation was not there because it could not be there when the contract was entered into; it was not there because it could not be there because it was not the law when the contract first went into operation. It is the law when the contract is completed and when the contractor exacts the contract price from the principal. Surely that is clearly retroactive and retrospective legislation.</P>
      <P>I indicate that for the moment because we have a Constitution, people seem to forget, which does not look kindly on legislation which is retroactive and retrospective.  That is as I read subsection (2).  It applies to contracts entered into before the commencement of the Act under which payment is made after the operation of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but after the operation of the regulations.  The principle is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is the same.  It is, in effect, putting a charge on the consideration of a contract which could not affect and was not properly affecting that consideration, or purchase price, or contract price at the time the contract was entered into. That is retroactive in the sense I have said so that we find a section of general application applying to all contracts between one man and another affecting building operations, which affects contracts entered into before this legislation is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> What does it do?  This section provides that where the principal, that is, the person who engages the contractor to do the building operation, whatever it may be, makes a payment to another person obviously in pursuance of the contract, where he proceeds to pay him as the contract provides for the work he has done, he shall deduct from the payment and pay to the tax collector at the rate of 7s in the £, or at a rate equivalent to 35 per cent on the amount of such payment.  Now, that is an extraordinary Draconian piece of penal legislation, putting this obligation on a principal, who may be a building contractor, probably would be, who is a big man in a big way, who is well able to finance his own business and pay his own tax in his own time.  When he is dealing with the small contractor he has an obligation imposed on him to stop 7s in every £ and pay it over to the collector of taxes.</P>
    <P>I call that Draconian; I call it punitive and I call it penal.  I do not understand why it should be imposed.  After all, the person being dealt with, be he a lumper or a labour only contractor, is not a criminal.  He is a person who did something which was perfectly lawful to do, who entered into a perfectly valid contract, who was infringing no law, who was offending no regulation, who was doing something which the law entitled him to do, freely to enter into a contract with his fellow man, freely to engage that man, to pay him a contract price, whatever it may be.  That was his lawful right so to do.  However, under this legislation we are providing that when he comes to be paid the other contracting party is put under a legal obligation to take from him 7s in the £ and give it to the collector of taxes.</P>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies appreciate what we are doing?  This was never a liability.  There was no such tax known to the income tax code and still when this man, having fulfilled his contract, comes to be paid his other contracting party is suddenly turned into a punitive tax collector, stopping from him 7s in the £.  Is it appreciated what is involved?  The Minister says it is only going to be the fugitive <Col N="1076" /> itinerant lumper.  Mark you, you will hear a lot about them.  I warn the Minister. He says it is only going to be those but will that be so?  This is of general application and the very moment this is passed &mdash; let every builder in the country realise what we are doing &mdash; in relation to every payment a builder makes from the moment of the passing of the Act he will have to deduct 7s out of the £ in regard to his electrical sub-contractor, his decorator, the person who does the heating installation, or whatever it may be on the site and pass it over to the collector of taxes.  That is what the section says.</P>
    <P>There will be no earned income relief, not even the 25 per cent that is provided in the Income Tax Act, that cannot be stopped; no allowance in respect of children, dependent relatives or anything of that kind.  Seven shillings in the £ must be stopped and not a halfpenny less.  That is what we are providing here.  This is all done because suddenly in the last few months people began to be sensitive about the term &ldquo;lumper&rdquo;.  In England they have a more complex society.  They have greater problems and they have problems arising from people who go to work there and whose relatives may not be precisely recorded or known.</P>
    <P>We have none of these difficulties.  It is not very difficult in this country to know where a person is at any time.  I suggest that this is not a problem here which justifies this kind of section.  This is something which was done because it was being done in England and the people responsible for our finance legislation got the wind of the word and adapted section 17 of the English Finance Bill, put it into this Bill and then, lo and behold, they dropped it from the English Bill and we are faced with a problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got to make a defence for it now.  Whatever problem there is regarding &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; it does not justify the kind of disorganisation that this section will cause in the building industry.  As an afterthought the Minister said that regulations will be made and that there will be consultations with the affected people, but how does the Minister know that?  If I <Col N="1077" /> asked the Minister a Parliamentary question as to what the Revenue Commissioners propose to do about some matter, the Minister could tell me to mind my own business and say he had no statutory responsibility for what the Revenue Commissioners might do.</P>
    <P>Regulations under this section are made not by the Minister but by the Revenue Commissioners and with whom they consult is known only to the Commissioners.  In this House we cannot afford to take this attitude.  It is our job here to pass legislation and not to do so in the fond expectation and belief, born of charity, that the Revenue Commissioners will do the right thing.  All these matters should be written into our legislation and the only way to write them in is to do what I suggest: compel the Revenue Commissioners to draw up a list of genuine registered contractors in this country. Once they do that there cannot be any quiet undertakings given and everybody will know precisely where they stand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said something I consider very important.  One of the problems associated with &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; in this country&mdash;and the practice is not so extensive as to justify this section&mdash;is not tax evasion but it is the fact that a group of men are organised together to work for a lump sum price and they are not insured.  For the course of their employment their cards are not stamped and contributions are not paid in respect of social welfare and there is no insurance in respect of ordinary third party liability.  That is the important point and it was that aspect of &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; that was dealt with in the English Construction Contracts Bill providing for legislation.  They made it a <i>sine qua non</i> of a genuine contractor that not only should he have a permanent place of business or abode but that the statutory provisions in relation to insurance contributions and so on should be observed.  I do not see why this cannot be done here because it is a perfectly simple thing to do.</P>
    <P>There is no urgency in this legislation. If it goes into operation immediately its impact will be felt at once on the building industry and many people will be upset and troubled.  The Minister says that you can get a certificate <Col N="1078" /> under subsection (7).  I say to the Minister that to suggest that as a satisfactory answer to the problem posed here is utterly impracticable.  It just is not on that there will be a blanket safeguard for the genuine sub-contractors in this country, that they will get certificates from the Revenue Commissioners directed to the other party &mdash; the larger contractor &mdash; to pay them without deductions.  The Revenue Commissioners will not drop all their work and issue certificates for all the sub-contractors in the country.</P>
    <P>What will happen is that many inoffensive, small, hardworking contractors, who are trying to better themselves, will find the money they earn reduced by 7s in the £.  It will be handed over to the collector of taxes and they will spend the next two or three years trying to get it back.  In England they had a problem and they proceeded to deal with it.  However, the people in this country who read the English Bills said: &ldquo;That is a very good section; we will put it into the coming Finance Bill&rdquo; and that is why it is in our legislation.  In common decency it should be removed and with its removal we will have a vastly improved Bill.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that one of the difficulties with which this House is faced in regard to this section is that the Civil Service can never be wrong and of all the people in the Civil Service the group who can absolutely never be wrong are the Revenue Commissioners.  The draftsmen might make mistakes in drafting and even the lordly Department of Finance have made occasional errors, but not the Revenue Commissioners. The best thing the Minister could do would be to scrap this section completely, but of course he will not do that.</P>

      <P>I certainly agree with that.  The law should be stated so that people will understand it and, when they understand it, that it will be seen to be the most direct and reasonable way of collecting the tax.  There is nothing direct or reasonable about this section; in fact there are many extraordinary statements in it.  I shall quote one such statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;construction operations&rdquo; means operations of any of the following descriptions...</P>
      <P>(b)  the construction, alteration, repair, extension or demolition of any works forming, or to form, part of the land...</P>
      <P>The land is there and yet there is reference to works forming part of the land.  Definitions like this are complete nonsense and there are many such definitions in this Bill.  There are all kinds of contradictions in it.  Regardless of how cleverly it may be construed, it is an unalterable fact that subsection (7) means, &ldquo;Trust the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;, but they do not even trust themselves because in subsection (7), having said they will give a certificate, they go on to say:</P>
      <P>Provided that the Revenue Commissioners may at any time withdraw such notification...</P>
      <P>Subsection (9) states:</P>
      <P>Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before Dáil Éireann...</P>
      <P>That is just rodomontade.  To the best of my knowledge, no regulation ever laid on the table of this House has ever been rescinded.  There is no use in contending that by the insertion of a subsection like that anyone is being safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not answered the point I made originally which was: Why was this problem not tackled in a direct way by saying that in the case of &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; a deduction may be made for tax?  Of course, in the case of &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; it would have to be made as a deduction on PAYE.  Let us take the case of a &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; who <Col N="1080" /> earns £2,000.  I have a contract to pay him £2,000 but when he comes along to be paid I hand him £1,300 and I tell him that he is now paid under this section.  If he is a genuine &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; I can imagine the language he would use.  He would soon tell me what I could do with the money.</P>
    <P>Neither in his Budget speech nor in relation to this section has the Minister told us what amount of money is involved. He has not told us whether £10,000 a year revenue is involved or whether it is £100,000 or £1,000,000. I do not see why any legislative assembly should be asked to swallow this kind of legislation without being told what amount of money is involved. Having watched the Revenue Commissioners operate for many years I have great respect for their estimates of what the effect of any change in tax will be.  They are usually accurate to a degree that nobody would expect.  I have not the slightest doubt that the Revenue Commissioners have told the Minister the amount of money they believe is involved but the Minister simply will not discuss it here.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister said to Deputy O'Higgins, I do not know whether they expect by indirect methods, and this business about the certificate, to get back tax by making the section retrospective.  How will a person get a certificate?  It is no use for the Minister to come into the House and simply say, &ldquo;There it is&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>...the principal makes a payment to another person (whether the contractor or not and hereinafter referred to as the sub-contractor)...</P>
    <P>That is one of the best phrases I have ever seen in a Bill.  He is a contractor one minute and &ldquo;hereinafter he is referred to as the sub-contractor&rdquo;.  One might also say the contractor pays himself.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us two things? First, will he tell us there was no other method of dealing with this problem than this?  I do not believe that is the case.  I believe there was a simple and direct method of dealing with it. Secondly, will he tell us what amount of revenue is involved and what the <Col N="1081" /> Revenue Commissioners have been losing up to the present time?  If the Minister answers these questions the House may be able to come to a reasonable decision on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have enough respect for the Minister's common sense to feel very strongly that this section of the Bill has not come to the House through his initiative.  The only concern of the Revenue Commissioners is to get the maximum amount of money but when a piece of legislation comes before the House it is our job to try to ensure that it is not passed unless it is sensible and unless the effects of it will be good for the country. If ever there was a provision which could be described as penny wise and pound foolish it is the piece of legislation which we are considering here this evening.  I cannot believe that any sensible person would expect us, as Deputy Hogan said, to put what are normally known as sub-contractors and &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; in the same category. The Minister knows enough about the building industry and about contracting to appreciate that it is possible to have a sub-contractor who is a much bigger man than the main contractor but who is now expected to be responsible for his tax.  For instance, a small builder might have to bring in a heating contractor who may be carrying enormous contracts throughout the country. Nevertheless, this small builder, if this legislation goes through, will be expected to be responsible for the big man's income, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have spoken about what has happened to the building industry in the past year with the enormous increases in the cost of building houses and the consequences of those increases in the enormous prices of houses and the inability of people to pay these prices.  So much work is now done in the way described that the immediate effect of this legislation can only mean that labour costs will increase by one-third. Does the Minister want to do this?  Does any Deputy in this House want to see labour costs in the building industry increased by one-third?  We all know that the labour costs of any building today amount to 65 per cent of the total cost of the building.  We <Col N="1082" /> should not allow this consideration to pass lightly, because, if we are not concerned about the price of houses and the cost involved, we ought to be. The price of cement this year was allowed to be increased by £1 19s per ton.  The price can go up again and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is unable to do anything about it.  Nearly 5s of the most recent increase was attributable to wage increases and this has added to the cost of building, which nobody in the Government seems to be concerned with. The effect of this piece of legislation will be to increase labour costs by one-third. It seems incredible to me that anyone could contemplate costs in such legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke in some detail about the conditions under which these unfortunate men who are referred to as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; have to work and the reasons why every penny should not be extracted by the Revenue Commissioners. These men have to travel long distances all over the country, sometimes on motor bikes and sometimes in old cars or in buses.  My belief is that if we try to extract the pound of flesh from these men we will strike the building industry a further blow in this present year.  This is a serious matter. These men are called on to work long hours when the weather is good.  They may be idle for long periods due to severe frost or heavy rain or for various other reasons.  They are treated as if they were normal workers going a normal distance to their work and having a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job.  If they are getting away with something in the tax line, I believe they deserve to get away with it.  They work in extraordinary conditions.</P>
    <P>The only effect this legislation could have, if passed, would be to slow down the building industry.  Every county in Ireland needs a large number of houses.  Do we wish to reduce the number of houses being built?  If anything has given a fillip to the building industry it is the &ldquo;lumping&rdquo;.  It has induced men to work as they never worked before and has induced them to stay out in bad weather, travelling long distances and feeding themselves in a haphazard sort of way.  As regards <Col N="1083" /> income tax they are treated as if they were earning their wages in a normal way under normal conditions.  There is nothing normal about a building worker's job.  That is generally recognised. If this legislation goes through I hope the Minister will have the good sense to see that this section is deleted. The Minister will be sorry later on if he does not have it deleted because its effect will be apparent almost immediately in the increased cost of houses and in reduced output in the building industry.  Men will not slave and do overtime and, as I have been told, they will not work for the Revenue Commissioners. Even though they might be doing an extremely important job to assist many families living in overcrowded conditions they will not work if we extract the last penny.  By the time it is collected there will be an amount of evasion which it will be impossible to track down.  We will have inspectors watching if this legislation goes through.  If ever there was a piece of legislation that demonstrates the meaning of the saying &ldquo;A penny wise and a pound foolish&rdquo;, this is it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan made a comment which we have been discussing on these benches.  If a group of people take on a job for £2,000 and do the job, when they are finished, according to this Bill if passed, the contractor will give the sub-contractor £1,300 and say: &ldquo;That is yours.  The Revenue Commissioners want the other £700&rdquo;.  The Minister said earlier that a certificate can be obtained which will make it unnecessary to have this done.  As I see it the contractor will employ a number of people on timerate. This happens often.  They are getting no allowance for their travel if they decide to take on &ldquo;lumping jobs&rdquo;.  A few years ago the &ldquo;lumping job&rdquo; was the bane of the building industry. It was felt that the type of work being done was not good.  Eventually those in charge realised that the clerk of works was responsible for inspecting the work and for seeing, whether it was time rate or a &ldquo;lumping job&rdquo;, that it was done properly.  It became known that the men would not be paid if the job was badly done. <Col N="1084" />&ldquo;Lumping&rdquo; has developed into something respectable.  &ldquo;Lumping jobs&rdquo; are being done in the building industry because otherwise the men who are employed on the jobs would not earn enough to compensate them for the long hours.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual for men to get up at 5 a.m. and to leave their homes at 6.30 a.m. so as to arrive in the city, 40 miles from their homes, at 8 a.m., and to work until lunch-time at 12 noon on a cup of tea that had been boiled in a black can.  The men might have a few sandwiches and tea around 1 p.m. and then start work again. After more tea in the afternoon, they would work until 6.30 p.m. and they might work until darkness fell and then drive home again.  They get no allowance for travel or for meals.  The income tax authorities say they are not entitled to an allowance for the car used travelling to and from work.</P>
      <P>The employer of these men can start from the same base several hours later and travel to his office, inspect the work and drive home after entertaining business associates to lunch.  The employer gets an allowance for everything. This does not make sense.</P>
      <P>It became known that some men were trying to make extra money and to defraud the Revenue Commissioners of something which the men believed the commissioners were not entitled to. An elaborate section is being put into this Bill for the purposes of preventing this.  The Minister would be well advised to have a look at this provision before going further.  Many of these people might be entitled to a tax remission. It is no answer to say that it is easy for them to get a certificate from the income tax authorities if they go on &ldquo;lumping jobs&rdquo; and that the certificate would relieve them of paying income tax.  At the present time the Revenue Commissioners are unable to get PAYE forms out to the people who are entitled to them.  They cannot get the amended tax forms out because they cannot get staff.</P>

      <P>I have never attempted to threaten anybody in this House and I do not propose to start doing so now with Deputy Andrews because it is not necessary.</P>
      <P>One of the points I wish to make about the Bill is that the Minister or whoever was responsible for drawing it up was not sure as to what was meant by &ldquo;construction operations&rdquo;. In this country, the phrase is usually taken as meaning the construction of buildings of one kind or another but, lo and behold, this Bill interprets &ldquo;construction operations&rdquo; as including alteration, repair, extension or demolition of any works forming or to form part of the land, as pointed out by Deputy O'Donovan, including walls, roadworks, power lines, aircraft runways, docks and harbours, railways, inland waterways, pipelines, wells, sewers, industrial plants and installations for the purposes of land drainage. If that is construction work then I am afraid that some of us have been using the wrong dictionary because the dictionary which defines all of these activities as &ldquo;construction work&rdquo; is one which I have not yet had the opportunity of seeing.  Perhaps the Minister will lay it on the Table of the House at some stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of land drainage raises a point which strengthens the argument I made earlier.  It is not unusual for persons who normally do not carry out any type of contract work to take up a job on land drainage.  They may be employed on such work for a couple of months but they may never do that type of work again.  However, if this <Col N="1087" /> Bill is passed, the person who is paying the money must ensure eventually that 7s in the £ is deducted from these people who, in the normal way, never had anything to do with employment or tax of any kind.  This is written into the section in a vindictive kind of way.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this type of work should be singled out for inclusion in a section of a Finance Bill thereby ensuring that the people concerned can be hounded for the small amount of money that would be recovered as a result.  I said earlier that it is difficult to get the certificate which the Minister seems to think it is easy to obtain.  I would go further and say that it is not because the employees of the Revenue Commissioners are not doing their job but because they cannot overtake the work.  I would suggest that the number of staff available and the conditions under which they work render it almost impossible for them to keep their work up to date.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, I am the general secretary of a trade union and in that capacity I receive complaints every day from people who have not received their tax-free allowance although they have returned completed forms.  This is because the staff have not the time to overtake the work. That being so, is it not then remarkable that here an entirely new set of arrangements are being introduced which are supposed to be operated by the Revenue Commissioners for what I believe will produce only a very small amount of money?</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether or not there is some particular aspect of this which the Minister has in mind but which he has not disclosed to the House.  I would suggest to him that if he is aware of some shortcut by which this scheme could be operated, he should tell us.  Would he tell us what exactly he means when he says that a certificate can be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners?  How will that operate as between one employer and another?  Will it be on the lines of a P 45 form?  What will happen with regard to this year, for instance, where very many building workers have been out of work for 20 and 21 weeks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will they be able to obtain the certificates that will allow them to go tax free or, at least, to pay a reduced amount of income tax? Why has the figure of 7s been decided? Will the 7s apply in cases where the sub-contractor, as somebody over here said, is bigger than the contractor himself? If he does not complete a tax form, how will he prove to the contractor that he has done so?  What sort of documentary proof is required?  If this is not done will it follow that, whether he is liable to tax at 9s in the £, the tax he will be paying will be 7s in the £1 because some of the contractors would be very glad to get away with paying 7s in the £1?  Some of the bigger contractors would find it very convenient if that were the case.</P>
      <P>These are questions which, although it might be boring for the Minister to explain to the House, must be answered.  If we are to deal with this matter we should be made aware of all the aspects involved.  The section is very extensive.  It is extraordinary that so much trouble has been taken.  It is even more extraordinary that in this Bill of more than 60 sections, no effort has been made to deal with the matter I have referred to twice already, that is, the question of travelling allowances for these same workers.  If they got a fair deal on that question, I believe they would have no objection to working ordinary hours at hourly rates and having income tax deducted in the normal way.</P>

      <P>First, I shall deal with some of the criticisms made against the wording of this section.  Deputy Tully seemed to be amazed at the definition of &ldquo;construction operations&rdquo;.  However, I would suggest if I were to tell him that a building operative entitled to rates negotiated by his trade union was the only one who was engaged in the construction of a building Deputy Tully would very quickly tell me I was talking through my hat and would proceed to list the various operations to which those rates would apply and he would give me the list which is in this section.</P>

      <P>That is not the case.  He did not refer to land drainage but he referred to all the others.  I am talking about the wording of the section first and the criticisms made of it.  Deputy O'Donovan also criticised it.  In the beginning of the debate on section 1 he made a similar criticism of the wording of it and he made a plea for a simple straightforward placing before people of the law.  It is surprising really coming from a man of the experience of Deputy O'Donovan.  We would all love to have this situation.  If it were possible the legal profession would never have been heard of but it is one of the oldest in the world.</P>

      <P>I said it was one of the oldest.  The efforts of people to do this simple straightforward thing produce a lawyers' paradise.  I regret it and I am sure most of the Deputies here regret this.  Inevitably in any system, but particularly in the interpretation of law, certain jargon and technical terms are developed which may be objectionable but which mean precisely certain things.  When you depart from that you run into trouble.</P>

      <P>I would accept that the Deputy endeavoured to do it very simply but I would not say he succeeded. The next thing I want to refer to is that Deputy Clinton said the implementation of this section would add one-third to the cost of labour in the price of houses.  He can only have arrived at that conclusion on the assumption that every single sub-contractor or every single housing jobber (a) was not paying his tax, (b) was not willing to say: &ldquo;I will submit accounts and therefore give me a certificate&rdquo; and (c) was saying: &ldquo;Because I was not paying tax before and now I will have to pay tax, my prices will have to go up by one-third.&rdquo;  There is no other possible justification for what the Deputy said.  It is obviously ridiculous. We are talking about a relatively small number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of this section, as has been pointed out, is relatively wide, certainly in regard to anything to do with what is commonly known as the building industry. Theoretically it is relatively wide.  This is why I said at the beginning that in practice we are concerned only with a minority of sub-contractors because the vast majority of sub-contractors are people whose operations are within the definition of this section but are people who submit accounts to the Revenue Commissioners and pay tax. Such people, of course, will not be affected by this section.  Even if you take those who have not been submitting accounts and have not been paying tax, they can get in under this section.  They can get a certificate and they will not be affected by this proposed deduction.</P>
      <P>The people who are generally referred to as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;, as distinct from those who have been referred to as genuine sub-contractors, will be affected.  Some genuine sub-contractors will be affected too but they are a minority.  The people known as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;, whose activities have been described, will be affected.  It is intended that those people should be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>None who either have been submitting accounts or who now undertake to submit accounts and thereby get their certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  I was asked a question about how much was involved in this.  Indeed, Deputy O'Donovan expressed the view at the time that I had been told by the Revenue Commissioners what the number <Col N="1091" /> was but was not disclosing it to the House.  May I suggest to Deputy O'Donovan and to the rest of the House that it is impossible even for the Revenue Commissioners, to whom Deputy O'Donovan paid a tribute for the accuracy of their estimation, to estimate the amount of revenue lost by evasion.  Evasion by definition means that you have not got a record of it and you do not know it so you cannot estimate it.  However, although it cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy there is evidence available to suggest that this practice is fairly extensive with a consequent loss of revenue. Perhaps even more important, this practice is likely to grow with consequent substantial increase in revenue loss, unless some action is taken.</P>
      <P>The amendments which we are discussing are, I think, designed to deal with the case of what might be described as genuine sub-contractors.  Such people have no worries at all in this because they just carry on as they have been.  They will get their certificate and carry on as before.  Assuming they have submitted their accounts and paid tax, there will be no problem for them under this section.  A case has been made for the need for skilled men, the need for productivity in the building industry.  I acknowledge both of those needs but I do not think we ought to try to satisfy those needs by saying: &ldquo;Let them carry on evading tax.&rdquo;  If we think a special case exists because of the grounds mentioned, the need for skilled men and the need for increasing productivity in the building of houses, for a special incentive by way of exemption from tax then it ought to be done in that way and not simply by closing our eyes to evasion.</P>
      <P>I am sure other Deputies in this House have as much experience as I have of the ill-feeling which can be generated by people making substantial sums of money not paying tax. This applies in various areas but in particular it applies in this area.  I know from my own experience of the ill-feeling that this can generate.  I do not want to depart from the terms of the Finance Bill except to say that it operates outside the area of evasion of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The British proposals have been referred to.  Some Deputies appear to have misunderstood the position; they seem to think the British decided not to go ahead with their proposals because they thought better of them.  I think one Deputy did say that.  That, of course, is not the position.  The position is, as was stated by Deputy O'Higgins: the proposals were in tandem &mdash; one was in their Finance Bill and another was in the Construction Industry Contracts Bill.  They were bringing both forward together but, because of the advent of the general election, the Construction Industry Contracts Bill had to be dropped.  It could not be proceeded with and, consequently, the provision in the Finance Bill was dropped.</P>
    <P>In our consideration of the matter, irrespective of whether or not the British had gone ahead with their proposals, we did not intend to go ahead with similar proposals for the reasons I have indicated.  Our problems are different.  They are less complex.  It seems to me we ought to try the relatively much simpler arrangements proposed here before we start elaborating further.  If, as a result of experience, we find it necessary to make our provisions more elaborate, we can think about it, but we should not start on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be, I agree. It has been suggested that the effect of this section is to operate retrospectively. I want to make it clear that, first of all, we are dealing only with an obligation to pay income tax, an obligation which existed irrespective of whether or not the contract from which the income arises was entered into <Col N="1093" /> before or after this Bill comes into operation.  Deputy O'Higgins contended that what we are doing is applying this to moneys arising from payment on foot of a contract entered into before the Bill was introduced at all.  If you take a contract which was entered into before the Bill was introduced, then any moneys falling to be paid on foot of that contract, whether before or after the passing of the Act, would in the hands of the recipient be liable to tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am coming at; they would be liable to tax.  This is merely dealing with the evasion of that liability.  To suggest that we are retrospectively applying provisions to liabilities which did not exist when the contract was entered into is misreading the situation.  The liability to tax existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were taxable under Schedule D they would be entitled to all the various allowances, reliefs and so on.  This deprives them of all of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  I am coming to that point.  The liability to tax and the right to allowances are no different before and after the passing of this section.  The position is exactly the same before and after.  The only difference is that persons who had this liability and evaded it, and intend apparently to go on evading it, will suffer the deduction at the rate of 7s in the £.  But, even then, that is not the end of the story.  Their actual liability and their actual allowances will, of course, be assessed and will be accounted for in relation to the money so deducted at 7s in the £.  In regard to the point made by Deputy Tully as to people who might be liable for more, they will not of course discharge their full liability by paying at 7s in the £ if they owe more than that.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is thinking in terms of tax-free allowances under PAYE where they would change depending on whether one worked for a certain length of time and did not work for another period.

The Minister is talking as if it was a job for which a contract is made and a certain amount of profit accrues to the man in charge and it is on that profit he is taxed.  This is a different thing altogether.  All they are paid for is the labour they give to the contract they are doing and the Minister's suggestion, therefore, is not workable at all.  It makes matters even more complicated.</P>

      <P>I did say earlier that in many cases people who are operating this should really be under PAYE and, if this puts them back under PAYE, it would be better for them and for the Exchequer.  It may well have that effect. The principle of the certificate is really to ensure that the person in receipt of the money is somebody about whom the Revenue Commissioners know and from whom they have some hope of getting accounts and, if they do not get accounts, they can get after him.</P>

      <P>The basic requirement is that the earnings of each of the people involved should be made known to the Revenue Commissioners.  This is what this is all aimed at.  A lot of objection seems to be taken to this section &mdash; it seems to me, in many instances &mdash; on mistaken grounds.  There is one aspect of it that I think deserves a little more attention.  Subsection (7) may be a bit weak in so far as the exact circumstances in which the certificate referred to is obtainable, or the right of the person concerned to obtain the certificate, are not spelled out.  I think the point has been put &mdash; in theory, anyway &mdash; that the person is dependent on the goodwill really of the Revenue Commissioners to get it.  I said on the Second Reading that the Revenue Commissioners would not be entitled to withhold their certificate in order to collect arrears.  I agree that, on the face of it, subsection (7) does not perhaps spell this out as well as it should be done.  Between now and Report Stage, I shall consider in what way subsection (7) might be amended to spell out more clearly the right to the certificate and the circumstances in which the certificate referred to in subsection (7) would be obtained.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question at this stage?  I have listened to the debate with interest.  I am not familiar with the problems in the same way as other speakers are and, therefore, I have stayed out of the discussion.  One thing puzzled me. From Deputy Tully we heard that people engaged in this activity are not entitled to charge legitimate expenses as employers are and, yet, in the section itself there is a reference to Schedule D.  Is tax charged under Schedule E or Schedule D (a) to the person responsible for the money and (b) to those who are in receipt of it and sharing with him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Tully was somewhat mistaken in what he said.  People operating as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;, and therefore carrying on a trade, are <Col N="1100" /> entitled to claim in respect of the expenses to which he referred.  What he had in mind, I think, was that such people carrying on simply as employees were not entitled to these allowances and that is why, he said, they went into the &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; trade.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If a number of people join together in a co-operative enterprise for this purpose as equal partners, possibly nominating one of them to be the person to whom the payment is made because somebody has to receive the money and distribute it, are they not all equally engaged as partners in a trading operation? On what possible grounds are they excluded from Schedule D in those circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that only the person who receives the money comes under Schedule D and that the other people who are engaged in the operation and receive payments come under Schedule E?  Is that wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that persons engaged in &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; operations are engaged in a trade.  They come under Schedule D.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What I was saying was that Deputy Tully had made the case that people employed in the normal way would come under Schedule E because they did not get the allowances under Schedule E and then went into the &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; business and came under Schedule D.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question in respect of subsection (3) which is deemed to be a Schedule D payment.  Apparently 7s in the £ will be deducted immediately from the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; and no allowances are made at that time.  Later on allowances are worked out from whatever <Col N="1101" /> deduction he may be entitled to.  If that covers a prolonged period it means that the Revenue Commissioners have got his money for a long period.  The ordinary person paying Schedule D tax submits his accounts and, before he pays anything, all his allowances are deducted.  This individual pays 7s in the £ and, at a later stage, he is allowed &mdash; presumably through some form of rebate &mdash; whatever allowances accrue to him.  If the arguments are protracted the Revenue Commissioners have the use of his money, so to speak, for maybe six months or seven months or a year.  Revenue can keep on arguing these things for a long time.  It does not cost them any money.  Is any provision made to compensate this individual? Does he get any interest on his money while Revenue are holding on to it?  If I had not paid money to Revenue I would have to pay interest. I would have to pay 1 per cent per month or whatever it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>How is the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; compensated for Revenue holding on to his money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is true.  It could be that the money would be held up for some protracted time while arguments ensued.  I hope it would not, but I could visualise that it might happen.  There is no provision for paying interest on the money but what there is provision for is very simple, that is, avoidance of this happening at all.  All he has to do is either make returns or undertake to make returns of his income to the Revenue Commissioners like any other tax-payer. He gets his certificate and this problem does not arise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer to the point I raised before, now that I fully understand the point that Deputy Tully was making?  If the position is that people have an incentive to lump because they are then entitled to expenses under Schedule D to which they would not be entitled under Schedule E, does this not suggest that there are grounds for seeking even a limited reform of Schedule E taxation in this respect? As the case involved here relates to the <Col N="1102" /> building industry and the problem arises because building workers have to go from their homes to different places on different occasions because, unlike the ordinary worker, they cannot site their homes near their employment if they wish to do so, could there not be some provision under Schedule E that at least there would be an entitlement to expenses in respect of travelling where people have to travel not to the same place every day for their employment but to different places and, therefore, the possibility of minimising or avoiding travelling expenses by siting one's home near one's employment does not arise.</P>
      <P>I recognise the difficulty of moving to a situation where all travelling expenses to and from work would be allowed under Schedule E, but it seems to me that the problem here giving rise to or partly contributing to the growth of &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; could be overcome by such a provision.  Would the Minister agree to look at it because otherwise there will be a continuation of this practice for tax avoidance reasons despite what the Minister is doing?  Even if the Minister's proposal goes through people will still be avoiding, not evading, tax.  Presumably the Minister wishes not only to prevent tax evasion but to discourage tax avoidance.  The best way to discourage tax avoidance is to change the law if there are anomalies in the law which are encouraging people to adopt expedients designed to avoid tax.  If there is an artificial incentive to &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; at the moment through the difference between the expense accounts provisions of Schedule D and Schedule E, this could best be got over by dealing with the situation under Schedule E in the way I suggest.  Would the Minister be prepared to consider that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to look at it but I am making no commitment. In fact, to be quite honest, I think I will have to come back and say it is not possible for me to do it.  I am certainly prepared to examine it.  I would add that, despite what Deputy Tully said which, to a simple person like me, might indicate that he believed it was only because these allowances for <Col N="1103" /> travelling were not given that these people engaged in &ldquo;lumping&rdquo;, I think Deputy Tully knows that there are certain other inducements to engage in &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; besides the fact that allowances for travelling are not available to people operating under Schedule E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I went into great detail in pointing out to the Minister that there were a number of inducements, one of them being the fact that because they get no tax free allowance when they are on day work and the fact that they have to pay their car expenses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They leave home at 5.30, 6, 6.30 or 7 a.m. and work very hard all day and return home at 10 p.m. and the only way they can get compensation for the distance they travel, which is often up to 60 or 80 miles a day each way, is by going on to &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; jobs.  In that way they can earn as much money in one day as they otherwise would in a day and a half. That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald may have been a little confused as he came in a little late on the argument.  He may have assumed that Deputy Tully meant that such people were given a tax relief, because of travelling, under Schedule D.  I do not think that is what Deputy <Col N="1104" /> Tully meant.  I think what he meant was that they did not pay any tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is undesirable that a situation should exist where, if people adopt this &ldquo;lumping&rdquo; practice which, on general policy grounds, we might wish to discourage, they can avoid tax legitimately on part of the amount of money involved?  It seems to me that if it is open to them to do that we ought to give the same entitlement to people under Schedule E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
