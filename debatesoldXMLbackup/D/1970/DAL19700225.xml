    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any of the recommendations made by the Committee set up to examine the Constitution remain to be acted upon; and the Government's intentions in regard to such recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in general is still as set out in the reply given by me in this House to a similar question addressed to me on the 8th February, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that the Taoiseach still intends to do nothing about the report, that he intends to ignore it, as the Government have done so far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated before, this was the report of a committee of all parties in the House and each party have their own obligations to examine and to adopt the recommendations to whatever extent they can, but there is no obligation on the Government to implement any part of the recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state whether he intends to initiate any constitutional amendments during the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a question on the Order Paper on some day next week?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw my question next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the answer I can give will be satisfactory to the Deputy but he will be aware that constitutional changes may be necessary in the event of our accession to the European Economic Community.  The changes that will be necessary are being examined and will naturally be brought before the House in due time.  At this stage I do not envisage any other constitutional changes in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from that reply that the Taoiseach has had second thoughts about certain important constitutional changes which he indicated might be desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that certain constitutional changes would be desirable especially in the context of the reunification of the country.  I have not certainly abandoned any ideas I have had about that but I think the timing of the changes will have to be appropriate to the advance of our reunification ideals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his statements on these changes, especially on Article 44 (1), were made to enhance the liberal image of the Taoiseach and that he has no serious intention whatever of making these changes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to enhance my own image but I do not deny that I wish to enhance the image of my Government and my party.  As far as Article 44 is concerned, the views I expressed were sincerely held and were shared by very many citizens of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Then do something about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the responsibility of each party.  May we now take it that Fianna Fáil have examined the recommendations and have decided to take no action, this year at least?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not likely that action will be taken this year as far <Col N="1545" /> as the constitutional changes are concerned, but that is not certain.  It will depend on our approach to the reunification ideals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach one further question. If the Constitution is defective in a way that is damaging to the reunification of this country, surely it becomes urgent to correct this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue about the urgency.  That is a matter of opinion.  If changes are necessary they should be made in the context of something worth while being done and achieved.  Changes now may not achieve anything and it is important that we should time the changes to the prospect of some achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to tell us the cost of this report and will he agree that by virtue of the fact that his Government have ignored the report the matter was a useless exercise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the cost now but if the Deputy likes to put down a question I will try to have the information for him.  It is not true to say that we have entirely ignored the report.  There are matters which may be worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach care to explain that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the outcome of the review meeting between Ministers of the Irish and British Governments of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreements held in London on 19th February.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is in a position to make a statement on the results of the recent Ministerial discussions held in London on the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins  Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Timmins</b> asked the Taoiseach if he has any statement to make in connection with the Anglo-Irish trade talks held recently in Lancaster House, London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have seen the text of the communiqué issued after the conclusion of the talks between Irish and British Ministers in London on the 19th and the 20th February.</P>
      <P>The Ministers discussed further the operation of the Free Trade Area Agreement in its various aspects including the question of access to the British market for Irish agricultural products and developments affecting trade in industrial products.  The Irish Ministers emphasised their concern at the continuance of the British import deposit scheme.  The British Ministers again indicated that their Government did not intend to keep the scheme in operation any longer than was required by the balance of payments position.</P>
      <P>The supply of Irish butter and cheese to the British market during 1970-71 was also discussed and it was agreed that this question would be the subject of further contacts between the two governments.</P>
      <P>The two sides exchanged views on the Irish and British applications for membership of the European Communities in accordance with the arrangements already made for continuing consultations on this subject. It was agreed that further Ministerial meetings would be held as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say in regard to quotas for cheese and butter whether any indication has been given of the extent of the revised quotas for the current year and, if so, when it will be possible to make a statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British side did give an indication of the amount they are making available to us.  We have been examining it and we will be in touch with the British again, but no final decision has been taken on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1547" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the vital importance of an increase in our cheese and butter quota, is the Taoiseach in any way hopeful that the British Government will agree to an increase? Secondly, did the British Government make any overtures to us concerning meat marketing arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the question, the fact that the negotiations are still open indicates that we are seeking and hopeful of a higher quota in both butter and cheese. As far as meat marketing is concerned, that situation was discussed in general and will continue to be discussed because it will be a matter of further contacts between the two governments and more particularly between the two Ministers for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the British are taking the maximum amount of beef we can give them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we can do more on the processed side particularly, but we must recognise that the British Government have obligations to other countries as well.  However, in regard to exports of beef and processed meat generally, I think we are doing reasonably well on the British market.  We are now at the stage when our meat exports to the British market supply British tables one day out of every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any representations been made to the British Government that they would bear the cost of the import deposit scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That has already been a subject matter of the discussions. On each occasion the British Government have not agreed to give us compensation as such for the import deposit scheme because they say, quite rightly, that it operates against every other country in the world, including Commonwealth countries and British possessions.  However, we are keeping this matter open and whatever advantage we can get from negotiations will be got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that other <Col N="1548" /> countries have not a free trade area agreement with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will these further negotiations between our ministerial team and the British team take place before the quota for butter and cheese is decided upon and will these negotiations then fade out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have made our representations known to the British Government and we expect to hear from them what their attitude is. If that is not satisfactory to us we shall be in touch with them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach make it clear to the British Government that the balance of trade is deteriorating against us all the time, particularly since the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance of trade has been getting worse but not due to the British trade agreement&mdash; if at all, to a very little extent.  However, I can assure the Deputy that on each occasion we discuss this matter we emphasise the fact that the Irish economy <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British one has not in any way contributed to the British balance of payments problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give references for evidence and reports on hospital organisation coming from a number of modern countries and other documents of similar kinds emerging from other health authorities all over Northern Europe to which he referred in replies on 11th February, 1970, and which, he stated, agree completely with everything that has been said in the FitzGerald Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent relevant report is that by a committee of the British Central Health Services Council on the Functions of the District General Hospital. This was published by the Department of Health and Social Security and the Welsh Office in 1969.  An earlier publication in 1967 entitled Regional Hospital Planning by the National <Col N="1549" /> Board of Health, Sweden covers experience in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Belgium and France. The salient principles arising in the consideration of hospital reorganisation are also dealt with in &ldquo;Hospital Planning and Administration&rdquo; published by the World Health Organisation in 1966.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what four hospitals are at present included in the Medico-Social Research Board investigation; if information is being acquired on site by interview and inspection or if it is being acquired by submission of oral or documentary evidence to a central office; if it is intended to survey all remaining hospitals; if so, how long it will take; and if any intervening reports will be issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Medico-Social Research Board was set up by the Minister for Health under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  The board, of which the chairman is Professor Patrick Lynch, has 11 other members distinguished in the fields of medicine, sociology and statistics.  Copies of the Order S.I. No. 80 of 1965 (Pr. 8264) are in the Library.</P>
      <P>I am informed that further details of the board's staff and of the research being undertaken, including the hospital in-patient inquiry referred to by the Deputy, will be given in their first report which is due for publication shortly.  I shall arrange to have a copy of this report sent to the Deputy when available.  The hospitals in which the in-patient inquiry has already commenced are Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin, the Galway and Limerick Regional Hospitals and the County Hospital, Cashel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> The inquiry, as I told the Deputy in reply to a question two weeks ago, is being extended to other hospitals as rapidly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware of the hardship caused to the people of Villierstown and Aglish, Cappoquin, County Waterford because of the lack of proper dispensary doctor services, especially for holders of medical cards; and if he will take urgent steps to have these facilities provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that hardship is being caused to the persons covered by medical cards in the areas mentioned, through lack of proper dispensary doctor services.</P>
      <P>In fact, a continuous service has been provided for the district by the same doctor over the last nine years, and I am assured by Waterford Health Authority that the doctor in question provides an excellent service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that since the closure of the doctor's residence at Kereens the residents of the area specified have been depending on the services of a temporary doctor who is already pretty fully occupied.  In the circumstances would the Minister take steps to ensure that there is a permanent doctor resident in the area as was the position heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This vacancy will not be filled by the Waterford Health Authority.  They never had any complaints about the service which the doctor who is in charge of the service there has provided since 1961.  If one examines the geographical area here and bears in mind the choice of doctor principle will commence on April 1st, 1971, one could not possibly recommend the appointment of a district medical officer here, having regard to <Col N="1551" /> the average distances between dispensary doctors and other doctors the choice of whom will be available to the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is deep anxiety in the area and this was made known to me on my many visits there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at the whole map of Ireland in regard to dispensary residences and their distances from each other.  In the modern world with the growth of better communications and of the car population, it would not be part of the policy to establish medical officerships in such an area having regard to the number of doctors who are adjacent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware of the long delay in providing a dispensary doctor and other health facilities for Ballingarry, Thurles, County Tipperary; and whether, in view of the wide hardship caused to the people of the area through the lack of these facilities, he will take special steps to resolve the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the health authority has so far been unsuccessful in the efforts it has been making since 1967 to appoint, on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners, a permanent dispensary doctor for Ballingarry.</P>
      <P>I understand that the health authority has recently renovated the dispensary residence and has succeeded in appointing a dispensary doctor in the district on a temporary basis.  I hope that the health authority will be able to keep the post filled pending the introduction of the proposed new general medical service with choice of doctor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there is a particularly difficult problem arising here in respect of the appointment of a permanent doctor.  I am putting it to the <Col N="1552" /> Minister that special endeavours should be made to secure the appointment of a permanent doctor.  Temporary doctors we have had to contend with in that area in recent years have simply not been satisfactory or not good enough for the people of the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 together.  I am not a party to the scheme of conciliation and arbitration <Col N="1554" /> for local authority officers, my sole function being to accord (or withhold) sanction to any settlements emerging.  The scheme is comparised of the County and City Managers' Association, representing the employing health authorities, on the one hand, and trade unions and associations representing the employees, on the other, with, of course, an independent arbitrator to adjudicate when the parties fail to reach agreement.</P>
      <P>Conditions of service are not comprehended by the present scheme but remuneration is.  Since the inception of the scheme in 1964 it has worked reasonably well and has produced an impressive succession of settlements acceptable to the staffs.  I understand that, at the moment, eight claims from the medical staffs of local health authorities are awaiting resolution.  Of these, I am informed that the claims on behalf of the medical staffs of psychiatric hospitals is listed for hearing by the arbitrator on Friday of this week.  The Deputy may rest assured that any settlement emerging will have my prompt attention.</P>
      <P>An acknowledged problem of the present scheme is that latterly the machinery has become overburdened by claims from the various grades of officers and that delay has occurred in processing these claims because the managers had not adequate staff to assist them in handling huge and unexpected volume of negotiations involved. Conscious of this problem, the parties to the scheme, assisted by officers of my Department and the Department of Local Government, have been discussing the outline of a revised and improved scheme.  The main innovation will be the setting up of a corporate body, to be financed by local authorities, with premises, staff and office equipment for the purpose of handling claims from the staff side. The approval of the Government has been conveyed to introduction of the necessary legislation.  In the meantime, provisional arrangements to expedite conciliation and arbitration work are being considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The health authority was pressed by my Department as far back as 1957 to make improvements in ward 8, which catered for very severely mentally handicapped patients.  Over the years since that time a number of improvements have been made.  These included improvements in decoration, the subdivision of the original ward into two separate wards and the sending away of nurses to obtain experience in providing &ldquo;habit training&rdquo; for severely handicapped patients.  In the past fortnight, as the first stage of a programme for the replacement of all temporary buildings now used to accommodate patients at St. Ita's, the health authority submitted a proposal for a new unit of 100 beds.

      <P>Would the Minister consider it reasonable in dealing with a matter of such importance to rural Ireland that in fact only civil servants have been appointed to the committee? Would the Minister be able to say why the normal procedure of appointing people who would represent various interests was not followed in this case?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may recollect my indication of intention to set up such an examination was given off the cuff in the Seanad at that particular time last year with a view to examining what was already in existence by way of legislation and what seemed to be missing.  This was for the purpose of checking on what we have and of having it examined with a view to seeing where the gaps were.  Having received such a report it would be my intention, if there is to be additional or amended legislation, that interests other than purely departmental ones would be brought in to decide on the proper course to be followed.  Since last July there have been seven meetings.  Without any reflection on anybody I might say that if I had arranged for anything other than a departmental committee it would hardly have been set up by this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the civil servants had met even for an eighth time for the purpose of examining this they must have known very little about the subject at the beginning.  Does the recent document issued by the Minister for Labour in regard to hours of work and conditions of employment, from which agricultural workers are being left out and who are being dealt with as separate people, not prove that the report <Col N="1563" /> on this subject should have been before the Minister for Labour before he introduced such a document?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had not moved then there would not be a report even in prospect.  The complaint that it is not before the Minister for Labour is scarcely one that should be made at all.  The fact remains that rapid progress is being made on the examination of this whole matter.  It is likely to be shown as having been competently done.  When we get the results of this examination, depending on what the report is and what seems to be needed, it will be decided who would be required to be brought in to do a job on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that simply setting up a committee which will continue to meet often&mdash;being civil servants they can meet easily&mdash;will not solve anything? Would the Minister hazard a guess as to when something concrete will be produced by way of a report from the committee?</P>

I understand that <Col N="1567" /> the corporation now, in fact, notify each tenant of the rateable valuation of his dwelling so that he can calculate the rates payable on it.  I might mention that the amount paid by tenants on the minimum or lower points of the differential rent scales is insufficient to cover the rates on their premises so that they are, in fact, paying no rent and only a fraction of the amount due for rates.</P>

      <P>As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Numbers of Inspectors: Four inspectors are engaged on new house grant inspection work in Dublin, four in Cork/Kerry, two in Mayo, two in Galway/Tipperary North Riding, and one in each other county.  In addition, a proportion of the time of six supervising inspectors is occupied by this work.</P>
      <P>Number of Applications: Records of the numbers of applications received for new house grants are not compiled because a proportion of applicants do not go ahead and build.  The following are statistics of the numbers of new house grants allocated in each county in 1969:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When I started to speak yesterday on the Buchanan Report there was an intervention from the Government front bench&mdash;not from the Minister who was unavoidably absent at the time but from his deputy &mdash;to say that I was widening the scope of the debate in an inappropriate manner, that I was being irrelevant and that as this matter had not been previously referred to in the debate in the Minister's opening statement I was not entitled to discuss it.  He almost persuaded the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that there was something in this and it was only by dint of perseverance on my part that I succeeded in discussing this report.  At the time I had not the Minister's opening statement but I should like to draw attention to the fact that three columns of it, at least, are devoted to the Buchanan Report, to which there are references further on, and other references to regional planning associated with it.  I deplore this attempt by the Minister's deputy to mislead the House and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to restrict the debate and to prevent me from commenting on a matter the Minister had opened up for debate.  The Minister himself would not have done this had he been here but this kind of intervention by somebody standing in for him is inappropriate and regrettable and I hope we will not have a repetition of this attempt to mislead the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before moving on to other matters there are a number of points I wish to make in regard to housing.  I shall refer to the Minister's opening speech: there is much in it on the subject of housing with which I am in wholehearted agreement.  There are a number of proposals listed at columns 582 and 583, volumn 244 of the Official Report, to improve the housing situation that are well thought out and have the support of this side of the House, but there are certain statements which I find difficult to accept and which I would ask the Minister to justify.  There is a statement at column 583 that the figure of grant houses <Col N="1589" /> was higher than the total completed in any previous year.  This statement, while true in itself, is misleading in the context in which it is placed.  I shall read the full sentence:</P>
    <P>Of the 13,033 new dwellings completed in 1968-69, local authorities provided 4,613 and 7,519 private houses were built with the aid of grants from my Department.  This figure of grant houses was higher than the total completed in any previous year.</P>
    <P>The statement is literally true but anyone listening to it and hearing it said quickly without the benefit of text and without an opportunity of scrutinising it might be misled into thinking that the Minister was claiming that the overall housing drive was in some way at a record level.  I shall repeat what I said last night in this context: that this high level of grant-aid houses is an incomplete and inadequate replacement for the local authority houses not being built.</P>
    <P>If we refer back to the years in the early fifties when there was a housing drive, despite the much lower level of wealth available to the Government then, we find that in 1950-51 there were 7,787 local authority houses built, 5,221 private grant-aid houses and 266 others.  The Minister is making great play of the fact that in the period since then there has been an increase of 3,200 in grant-aid houses but he did not mention, and by omission sought to mislead the House, that there was a reduction of 3,200 in the number of local authority houses built in the same period.  It is no particular credit to the Government that they have switched the emphasis from public housing available for rental at rents which are related now to the means of the occupants, to private housing for which people must put down a deposit and must repay the capital at rates far beyond the means of the great bulk of the workers.</P>
    <P>It is a very inadequate statement for the Government simply to make the claim that the number of grant-aid houses built is higher than ever before. It is higher than ever before because the Government have replaced public housing by grant-aid houses at the <Col N="1590" /> expense of the workers.  This needs to be said and I do not think the Minister should be allowed to get away with a <i>suppressio veri</i> of this kind in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister at column 589 also tried to cover up the position by remarking that the number of local authority houses built was the highest for many years.  It was, in fact, a lower figure than in any year from 1949-50 to 1954-55.  It is true that in the period since this Government came into office&mdash;since 1957-58&mdash;there has not been a year in which they built more local authority houses than they did last year.  However, that is no particular record or achievement because this Government have the unenviable distinction of having virtually suppressed local authority housing and having kept it, even today, at a level 40 per cent lower than in the immediate post-war period after the housing drive of the first inter-Party Government. To say it is the highest for many years merely means that by Fianna Fáil standards of suppressing local authority housing and substituting speculative building, forcing workers to buy houses they cannot afford, then by that standard, last year was the best of the bad Fianna Fáil years of public housing.</P>
    <P>Last year Fianna Fáil got back almost to the level of local authority housing in 1956-57 but they did not get anywhere near the level achieved not alone by the inter-Party Government but by the Fianna Fáil Government from 1949-50 to 1954-55.  In that period the Governments, regardless of their political complexion, tried to do something for housing in this country and even the Fianna Fáil Government had a social conscience about the matter although they did not maintain the momentum of the housing drive of the inter-Party Government.  However, the present Fianna Fáil Government in contradistinction to the Fianna Fáil Government of that time&mdash;perhaps because the previous Fianna Fáil Government had the threat of the return of an inter-Party Government&mdash; maintained housing at a reasonable level but the present Government, who apparently feel safe in the face of a divided Opposition, have taken the <Col N="1591" /> opportunity to reduce local authority housing and to keep it down.  Even in the conditions of the relative prosperity we have now, with the national wealth perhaps 45 per cent greater than 20 years ago, they have not got back to within 40 per cent of the level of local authority housing at that time.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to claim that local authority housing is at the highest level for many years is once again a statement characteristic of this Government and of all Governments who try to avoid direct lies&mdash;but some Governments are more adept at suppressing the truth than others.  Some are more selective in statements on a situation but this Government have a particular technique of doing this which is highly skilled.  They have the belief that by constant repetition of misleading or partial statements people will believe the myth that in some way the Governments of those years did something dreadful to housing and that only Fianna Fáil can be relied on to recover the position and maintain housing when, of course, the exact opposite is the truth as any examination of the figures will show.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a suggestion that at that point there was inadequate land and that Fianna Fáil are so incredibly incompetent, slow and lax that in 13 years they could not provide serviced land to produce 6,400 houses while the first Coalition starting from scratch in 1947-48 increased housing from 1,600 to 12,300 in three years?  Fianna Fáil have increased housing at the rate of one-eighth of the rate of increase for the period 1947-48 to 1950-51.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, having described what is being done with regard to local authority buildings, describes this progress as showing the urgent priority given to this type of housing.  I am not quite sure whether <Col N="1592" /> those were the words he used or whether he referred to the urgent priority of house building but whichever he referred to his description of urgent priority is a little difficult to take when, in fact, we are only devoting to housing a proportion of our national output which is only about half of what the average European country is devoting to housing.  Some of these countries have a standard of living that is much lower than ours, for example, all the countries of Southern Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to come back to that when we reach the Estimate for Social Welfare but, of course, in every case it is higher than what it is in this country.  They, also, in almost all cases, devote more to defence than we do so that we do not have that alibi either.  Here we are devoting less resources to defence than they do so that, although we have more resources available, we do not devote them to housing or social welfare.  We dissipate them in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the current situation in housing, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the Minister on the <Col N="1593" /> housing statistics which his Department now produce.  We were deficient in housing statistics a few years ago but excellent work has been done by the Minister's Department in producing up-to-date and accurate information with regard to the numbers of houses built and with regard to their financing. Indeed, I recommend these statistics to Deputies.  They are not as yet published in printed form but I understand that they are available to anybody who seeks them.  They are very valuable and enable us to get a better picture of what is happening in housing.  The Minister will forgive me if I select some figures from these statistics to show that there is evidence of a deteriorating trend with regard to housing in this country.</P>
    <P>These figures are from a document entitled: <i>House Purchase Loans by Building Societies' Assurance Companies and Local Authorities</i>.  It is issued by the housing administration section of the Minister's Department and is dated October, 1969.  Applications on hand rose in the 15 month period from the second quarter of 1968, that is, the first quarter of the financial year but the second quarter of the calendar year, to the third quarter of the calendar year, 1969&mdash;between June, 1968 and September, 1969 from 17,110 to 22,913.  We have here a disturbing accumulation of applications for loans for housing.  These are applications from insurance companies, building societies and local authorities, an accumulation which, because of the rate at which it is taking place&mdash;an increase of 5,800 or about 35 per cent in 15 months&mdash;in the number of applicants on hand there is evidence of a rapidly accumulating backlog of demand not catered for because of inadequate finance being available&mdash;a backlog of demand which arises primarily from the total inadequacy of the local authority programme held back as it is to a level of 40 per cent below what it was 20 years ago, an inadequacy that is forcing people to buy houses regardless of their income.</P>
    <P>On page 8 of this document there are figures which indicate that a proportion ranging from three-quarters to something under a half, depending on <Col N="1594" /> the period we take, of applicants for loans to local authorities to buy houses have incomes of less than £1,050 a year or less than £20 a week.  People within that income are being forced to buy houses when they should be able to get them for renting if there were a decent public housing programme. Of course, borrowers from local authorities have to be within a certain income limit but it is interesting that such a high proportion of the borrowers have an income of less than £1,050 a year.  I admit the proportion is diminishing.  The tendency for those with incomes of more than that figure is to become more important as incomes increase but even today the proportion of people within that income level is high.  I wonder if there is any country in Europe where people with that kind of income are forced to save deposits of hundreds of pounds and are forced to make repayments at five or seven pounds a week.  We must be unique in this particular form of torture.</P>

      <P>The failure to provide housing and thereby forcing people to live beyond their means, to save hundreds of pounds out of incomes of £20 a week or less and to make repayments at £5 or £7 a week when they should be getting houses to rent, is what I would call torture if I were in that unhappy position, which I am not, but that does not mean that I cannot have sympathy for those who are.  The point I wish to make is that the rapid accumulation of applications on hand which shows the inadequacy of the present housing programme, both as regards the public and private sector leaves us in the position in which these applications total £22.9 million as against £17.1 million 15 months earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other relevant evidence here is the decline in the number of approvals of loans from these three sources, local authorities, insurance companies and building societies.  The number has been falling sharply.  It is this decline which is creating the backlog.  If we take the last 12 month period for <Col N="1595" /> which figures are available&mdash;the 12 month period ended September, 1969 &mdash;as compared with the previous 12 month period, we find that the number of loans approved in total fell from 10,700 to 9,984.  There is a 7 per cent drop in loan approvals in the latest 12 month period for which figures are available.  It is that decline in loan approvals which is leading to this congestion and backlog in the private sector and which parallels the backlog in the public sector.</P>
    <P>If we look at the number of loan applications on hand at the end of the relevant quarter, we find that in the two years ended September last, the number of loans on hand and unapproved has risen from 1,428 to 2,360, an increase of 70 per cent.  If we break these figures down between the different sources we find that the accumulation of unapproved applications is concentrated largely in the local authority sector and, if we take the building societies and insurance companies together, we find there is an increase of about 24 per cent in unapproved loans.  It is 80 per cent in the case of local authorities.  The money which the Minister is unable to extort from the Minister for Finance is responsible for this.  In two years unapproved loans have risen by 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>These are formidable figures.  They add to what I said yesterday when speaking about the inadequacy of public housing.  What I am trying to show here is the appalling backlog of public housing which is growing all the time because the Government's housing programme is not keeping up with current demand, never mind reducing the backlog, and which is paralleled by and, indeed, is contributing to, a growing backlog in the private speculative sector where the resources available, particularly from local authorities rather than building societies or insurance companies, are so inadequate that the demand is building up all the time and more and more people are in the queue and the queue gets longer and longer.  That is the situation at this point when, as I said at another stage, our national <Col N="1596" /> wealth is 45 per cent greater than at the period when we really had a housing programme at a level that has never since been attained under this Government, when we built 14,000 houses in one year, excluding conversions, 1,000 more than has been attained after, God help us, 13 years of Fianna Fáil rule.</P>
    <P>Turning from that to some other related aspects of housing, turning away from the housing programme itself&mdash;I have said enough about that to establish where we stand&mdash;there are a couple of points that I should like to make about the housing programme which are perhaps less controversial and less critical but involving some criticism or, at least, some questions. The Minister, at column 596 refers to the encouragement he has given to local authorities to purchase land for housing purposes.  He had a great deal to say about this&mdash;the third successive year in which £1 million was provided for this purpose.  He mentions the number of sites available now as a result of this.  He does not tell us how many of these are serviced or will be serviced in the foreseeable future.  At least there are a very large number, many thousands of sites.  I wonder am I right in thinking that the Corporation of Dublin under the Minister's appointee are now proposing to sell much of this land again to private builders?  I understand this to be the case.  There is, no doubt, an explanation, perhaps even a good explanation, of this, if the Minister would explain it to us.  It seems a little odd to tell us at the length of several columns how much land the corporation have been buying for building but if they are now selling it again, or proposing to sell it, the Minister should make some mention of that fact.  There may be good reasons for this.  We should hear them.</P>
    <P>I would have thought in these circumstances&mdash;I speak from ignorance of this subject and the Minister can guide me&mdash;that the corporation would make the sites available perhaps to private builders as well as having them for their own purposes without selling them, that they would at least retain ownership of the land and the ground rents that may flow from that.  I am not quite sure why they should sell it <Col N="1597" /> to builders.  I should like to know what provision there is to ensure that the developers of the land do not make a speculative profit from land they buy from the corporation.  It would require very tight control of prices of houses to ensure that the prices of the house did not contain in respect of the land an element of profit on the purchase price paid to the corporation for land that the corporation bought some time ago.  I am sure that, in fact, the Minister has given thought to this.  I know he is concerned about this question of land values; indeed, I think our thoughts run on similar lines here, but I would just like to hear from him what, in fact, is his thinking on this subject and what are the safeguards that he has thought it necessary to invoke in this process of resale of land to builders which is taking place or about to take place to ensure that there is no danger of the public being in any way exploited and as to why he feels it necessary for the corporation to sell the land as distinct from making it available, while retaining ownership in it, to speculative builders.</P>
    <P>On the question of land values, as I have said, I would go along with much of what the Minister said although the indefiniteness of his conclusions as to what action can be taken about it is a little bit disturbing especially as it has gone on so long.  He refers, I think annually, in the debate in the Estimate to the various obstacles involved; that at first sight it might seem that the right thing is to nationalise land but that there are many obstacles involved, constitutional, legal, and so on.  He has not, at least I do not recollect him doing so, explained in full the character of the constitutional obstacles.  Personally I am less than convinced about this and I wonder whether the Minister's Department is not being unduly cautious in this matter and if there is no way in which they could establish whether there is or is not a constitutional obstacle.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech seems to imply that the answer is that there is a constitutional obstacle so great that we have to find some way around it. He speaks of finding some other solution that will avoid the constitutional <Col N="1598" /> obstacle.  I am not clear that there is such a constitutional obstacle.  If there is, we should hear about it and the House should be given the opportunity of considering what action might need to be taken.  I should like to know what advice the Minister has had that there is a constitutional obstacle, the nature of this obstacle and what might have to be done to remove it because I am not talking here of any mad socialist idea.  I am not suggesting that all socialist ideas are mad or that any of them are but I am speaking of them in inverted commas.  I am not speaking of ideas which the Minister might describe as mad socialist ideas.  I am talking of the kind of situation which exists in Northern Ireland, which is not perhaps the most socialist country in western Europe.  My understanding of it is that when the Craigavon town came to be developed the Northern Ireland Government purchased the land announcing their intention on a certain day that they would pay the current agricultural value of the land, not its developed value or value for development purposes.  I believe there was agitation from the farmers and I believe the farmers did extract from the Minister a somewhat better price. But there was no constitutional obstacle there to the land being purchased at its agricultural value without any special profit accruing to the farmers because of the mere accident that they happened to own land which public authorities decided to use for development in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Is it the case that our Constitution prevents us from acting in a manner which is thought not to be too revolutionary by that somewhat less than red Government in Belfast?  Are we tied in some way by our Constitution that we cannot even take the kind of action which this Tory Government finds appropriate in Northern Ireland? If so, and if our Constitution contains a clause so extraordinarily conservative as to force us away from adopting the kind of procedure which that Government adopts as a matter of routine, then I think our people could be asked to change that clause in the Constitution.  I am not at all convinced that there is this obstacle.  I am not <Col N="1599" /> at all convinced that it is as serious as it is made out to be.  I think, perhaps, the Minister's Department have been unduly cautious about it. I may be wrong in that.  As we have not been told anything in details about this it is not easy to judge it, but the Minister will know that if he has a problem here he will get the co-operation of all sides of the House in dealing with it.  We would not wish our Government to be prevented from acting in the way which is thought entirely appropriate even by the Tory Government in Belfast.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will want to justify a situation in which individuals make large capital gains out of transactions in land or, indeed, out of the ownership of land which is used for housing purposes.  Everyone has a right to be fairly compensated if his land is purchased.  Indeed, I would hope that any compensation in a compulsory purchase would, if anything, err slightly on the side of generosity rather than leaving people with a feeling of grievance against the State for acquiring their property.</P>
    <P>It is quite different if because a public authority decide to build a town or develop an existing town in a certain area the value of the land there in its present use is not alone paid but, on top of that, large capital gains accrue to the man who happens to own the land, not because he has done anything with it, not because he happens to own land which through a communal decision in the interests of the community is to be taken over for public purposes.  That is unsatisfactory. I know the Minister is trying to do something about it, he has told us that, but I wonder if he is being radical enough about it.  I wonder whether he is not being too hedged in by this constitutional obstacle.  Either it is a real obstacle in which case we should know about it and try to resolve it, or it is not, in which case we should ignore it and get on with the job.</P>
    <P>At column 585, if I can read my own writing, the Minister says that he is not happy that firms are doing enough to help their employees with their housing problems.  I am sure he <Col N="1600" /> is right in this.  There are some good examples.  There are some firms who are doing something, but I wonder whether the existing encouragement given for this purpose is adequate. Could something be done by some kind of tax rebate to encourage firms to do a little more in the way of lending money for this purpose?  There are firms which are at times liquid to the point where they can afford to lend some money to employees for housing purposes.  Perhaps they could be given some little encouragement for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Building societies are given this kind of encouragement and an industrial firm or a commercial firm could be given it too.  It might be of help.  I am merely suggesting to the Minister that it might be worth looking at the question of whether he is right in saying that firms are not doing enough for their employees as regards housing&mdash;and I think he is&mdash;and whether there is anything he can do to give them an additional push in this direction by holding out some kind of carrot.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the impact of housing on industry.  The Minister referred to the fact that it is now possible to get a two-thirds subsidy for industrial housing.  I think I am right in saying there has been a change here and this kind of change is welcome.  I do not think we will solve the problem of industrial housing completely, despite the efforts of the National Building Agency and the changes the Minister has made, so long as we are in the position of having this enormous housing backlog.  It is quite unsatisfactory that we should be in the position we seem to be in that, if an industry sets up somewhere and needs houses for workers, the local authority cannot do anything about it because they have so many people on their own lists and such a backlog that they must give them priority, and a separate scheme is needed to house industrial workers.  The right answer here is to clear the backlog and have a single scheme for housing rather than two parallel schemes going on together.</P>
    <P>More generally on the question of housing I would put the point which is included in the policy of this party <Col N="1601" /> that the present system on which the subsidisation of housing has to be undertaken by local authorities out of the rates is basically a bad system.  I shall not go into the question of rates being a bad tax.  This has been said repeatedly but we have not yet succeeded in doing anything about it.  A system under which a local authority know that the more houses they build the bigger will be the burden on the ratepayers and the more unpopular will the members be with the local community, is designed to discourage adequate housing.  I find it hard to believe there is not some connection between the fact that our public housing is at such a low level, half the rate per head in Northern Ireland and 40 per cent lower than it was 20 years ago, and the discouragement offered to the local authorities by the knowledge that the more houses they build the greater the burden will be on the rates.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the burden of subsidising housing is a Central Government responsibility, something which should be carried by Central Government.  Indeed, I would like to see a situation in which local authorities would feel that the more houses they build, if they can get the capital to do so, the more they will, perhaps even marginally, improve their financial position and not disimprove it.  In any system of financing it is important to have an incentive rather than a disincentive built in.  I should like to feel that the local authorities were in a position to know that if they built houses they might make some profit&mdash; even £5 or £10, no matter how small&mdash; on each house they built rather than feel they are incurring a large and recurrent loss through having to subsidise the rents.</P>
    <P>Subsidisation of rents is a matter of income supplementation.  It is an essential Government responsibility.  It is not something to be hived off piecemeal from one person to another or from Central Government to local government.  The Central Government should deal with the whole question of income supplementation and ensuring that people have enough to live on, and the subsidisation of rents is part of this process.  There are no rational <Col N="1602" /> grounds for hiving this off to local authorities and putting it on the rates. The problem of making the transition is, of course, clearly a difficult one.  If we become members of the EEC, and if this leads to the introduction of a value added tax, and at some point in the future this value added tax is set and we are obliged to impose it at a level higher than its yield, perhaps significantly higher than the present turnover and wholesale taxes, that opportunity should certainly be taken to use this additional taxation to replace the rates.  We may be forced willy-nilly to do this whether or not we want to.  Certainly, if we are forced to increase taxation in that way as part of a harmonisation process in the EEC, we ought to take that opportunity to replace the rates system and that would give us the opportunity to make this transition to a system of housing subsidisation by central rather than local government.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some reference to the rise in prices.  I referred yesterday to his statement that the additional funds available could not keep up with this in the year ahead and therefore borrowing for housing would be reduced and all kinds of steps would have to be taken to try to mitigate the effects of that.  This is very disturbing indeed.  The figures which the Minister's Department give for house prices show an increase of 18 per cent in the 15 months ended September last.  That is a fairly phenomenal rate of increase in average house prices.  It may be, of course, that there was some change over that period in the quality or the size of houses or that the houses in the last period are not directly comparable with the houses in the first period.  This may be the case but, even allowing for that, it seems a very big increase in the average cost per house. The Minister is right to be disturbed. He should also be disturbed by the remarkable disparities between the average cost of houses in different parts of the country.  He will be aware that in Waterford the average price of a house is £3,962 in the latest period.  In the rest of the country outside the major towns it is £4,014.  In Dublin it is £5,243.  That is a very big difference indeed.  It is a difference of 30 <Col N="1603" /> per cent.  I wonder has the Minister any idea how much of that is due to the cost of land becoming inflated because of the absence of serviced land as a result of the inadequacy of the planning in his Department over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>I wonder also has the Minister any explanation to give of the fact that the cost of houses in Galway is so much higher than it is in Dublin.  What is there about Galway that pushes house prices up so high, and indeed so rapidly?  Is there some particular scheme going on in Galway, building larger houses than elsewhere?  These are private speculative houses.  The last figure we have for Galway is £5,372 per house.  One could understand, although not accept or agree with, the fact that in Dublin house prices are higher than elsewhere because of land values.  I should not have thought this was such a vital problem in Galway. I wonder whether the Minister has investigated this and whether he has any explanation to offer for the very high level of house costs in Galway as against other parts of the country.  In fact, houses in Galway cost 17 per cent more than houses in Cork which has the next highest figure.  This requires some explanation.</P>
    <P>There are some other points to which I shall refer briefly.  The Minister mentioned his intention to establish a national roads authority to look after arterial roads.  This is a right decision. What I am not so sure about is that he is right to make this authority simply part of his Department.  The kind of job to be done here is one preeminently suited, I would think, to the kind of State enterprise of which we have so many successful examples, many established by the present Government, many by a previous Government and many by the first Government.  Why in this instance has he chosen&mdash;it is, I think, very much his personal decision&mdash;to adopt this approach rather than create a State-sponsored body with the extra flexibility such a body has <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Public Service?  That is the reason why so many of them were established and I think the Minister should give some explanation for his decision here.  I <Col N="1604" /> am sure he has some reasons&mdash;possibly he considers them sound reasons &mdash;for this decision, but we would like to hear them.</P>
    <P>With regard to other aspects of his speech I will say no more than that they are to be welcomed.  The provision of swimming pools is long overdue. What is being done in regard to the itinerants is excellent.  We should all echo the humanity and wisdom of his remarks with regard to the itinerants and the housing of them. We welcome also the establishment of the water resources section for the purpose of tackling the problem of pollution.  The action of the Government in this respect is, I think, in response to public opinion.  It is interesting to note that when public opinion asserts itself and voluntary effort is employed in areas such as this a response is produced.  That has happened in the case of the itinerants.  Again, in the case of water pollution, the Minister has very properly and very promptly responded to public opinion and public concern.</P>
    <P>There is one matter the Minister has not dealt with except in very general terms.  This is the problem of planning decisions in relation to areas which should be preserved.  In all that has been said about Hume Street I do not think the Minister has, in fact, given us an adequate explanation for the action he took here.  There is a great deal of confused thinking about this and I am afraid the Minister has contributed to it.  When people raise the question of preservation there are various reactions, some less intelligent than others.  One reaction&mdash;it is a kind of feeling that crops up occasionally behind the remarks of some people on the opposite side of the House, though it does not apply to all Members there &mdash;is the sort of feeling that anything built before 1921, unless it is a mud cottage, is apparently English in some way and not to be preserved.  I state this in an extreme form.  That proposition has not been enunciated, but it is a kind of attitude of mind, particularly in regard to Georgian buildings.  It is a pity this is the technical description of them, though I have been told by an eminent architect that it is an incorrect <Col N="1605" /> description.  They differ markedly from Georgian buildings elsewhere. They are a peculiarly Irish phenomenon. The fact that they are called Georgian, however, seems to have a prejudicial effect on the attitude of people on the opposite side.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister has contributed to the argument that the State cannot get involved in preserving these buildings.  That is not an issue. I am not saying there are not buildings that the State should preserve, buildings the people will ask the State to preserve, and quite properly, but the proposition that the State should intervene and take over at enormous cost to itself vast stretches of Georgian Dublin for the sake of preserving it is something no one would put forward in the present state of our economic development.  The proposition put forward is rather that, if you do not intervene in this situation by giving planning permission for speculative development, then, in respect of much of these areas&mdash;not all, but particularly the central core&mdash;and if you leave market forces to work themselves out, without intervening to make speculative development possible, in fact these houses will be preserved.  If you make a requirement that the facade is to be preserved and the interior, where the interior merits such preservation, there will be found people willing to buy these houses in their current form and keep them in that form.</P>
    <P>Many parts of what was formerly Georgian Dublin have become slums and, unless some benevolent protector intervenes, they are bound to crumble away.  Some, indeed, have crumbled away at the expense of the lives of people in and near them.  But in the part of Dublin about which I am talking there is not, I think, a problem in providing financial aid in order to preserve these houses.  All that is needed is a policy decision.  We thought we had a policy decision from Dublin Corporation that these buildings should be maintained in their present state.  If, as a result of imposing this condition on these buildings, it transpires that in respect of part of this area no one is willing to buy, subject to that condition, except perhaps for the purpose of allowing them to become <Col N="1606" /> tenements and slums, then we would, of course, face a dilemma, the dilemma between the Government putting up money in order to preserve them or allowing them to deteriorate.  This is a dilemma that has to be faced and, if it arose on a large scale, it might be difficult to justify the Government spending money on a large scale in order to preserve these buildings.  But this is not, in fact, the position.  The position in regard to most of this area is that this condition was imposed on people willing to buy these houses but, in fact, the tendency has been towards a growing investment in the area and towards a restoration of these buildings.  People have been willing to invest very substantial sums in these buildings.  I know one case in Fitzwilliam Square where eight years ago £30,000 was paid for a house and £23,000 was spent in putting it in order merely to use it in its present form, without any extension or any change in it for office purposes.  The fact is that in their present form, and subject to these restrictions with regard to maintaining the facade and the interior, where that is desirable, people are not alone willing to keep them as they are but to maintain and improve them.  All the pre-servationists ask the Government to do is not to intervene unless they are convinced that the area will turn into a slum and needs something done to prevent that.</P>

      <P>Is that not what happened in Gloucester Street?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think the Government's intervention in Gloucester Street was disastrous.  It may have been well-intentioned at the time because building was very difficult. There may have been good social reasons but the result from an architectural point of view was unfortunate. I am speaking of that part of Georgian Dublin stretching from St. Stephen's Green to the Grand Canal.  All we ask the Government to do is not to intervene and reverse the corporation's planning decisions, particularly not to intervene by selling houses it owns without itself imposing a condition about their <Col N="1607" /> preservation.  That is all we ask.  I do not think it is too much.  The defence the Minister has made does not, in my opinion, answer the point.  Much of the defence was a smokescreen.  The Minister is an adept at producing smokescreens.  I hope he will reconsider his decision in this matter and not again take the kind of decision he took here.</P>
      <P>In the light of what is happening there is now a strong case for trying to maintain these houses by a simple act of non-intervention on the part of the Government and by the Government refraining from conniving at their destruction.  The Minister has not adequately explained to the House his reason for the action he took.  I would appeal to him not to make a similar decision in future.  There may have been good reasons for his decision but we do not know them because he has not explained them adequately.  I think he should agree now that his decision was a mistake.  I do not ask him to say so publicly.  All I ask him to do is to decide privately that it was a mistake and one not be be repeated by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask him in future to let the corporation try to preserve this area by the simple expedient of saying that it should be preserved and letting private interests spend the money necessary to preserve it.  We hope the efforts made to maintain these houses will be successful. I have been disappointed by the way in which their value has been denigrated and dismissed by some people, including those on the other side of the House.  I agree that some of the houses have not any great architectural merit.  Some of them were in bad condition before the development agency took the roofs off them.  Their merit lies in the fact that they are part of a streetscape, part of a view of a small Georgian street, and it is in that capacity that they should be preserved.  I do not think there is anything of importance inside them which is worth preserving but we should keep the facade in its present form and I do not think this would involve a significant figure as far as the developers are concerned.  There are other cases where the interiors are worthy of preservation and we hope <Col N="1608" /> the Minister and the local authority will co-operate in that.  That is all I have to say on that matter and in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not lightly that I decided to take as the subject for my maiden speech that of local government.  I decided to speak because I personally am not satisfied with the progress made in the field of local government generally, although I am satisfied that the efforts being made by the Government within the capacity of our resources are indeed a serious attempt to meet the situation as we see it today.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech has been criticised by a number of Opposition Deputies.  Not one part of it in my opinion has been improved upon or contradicted by the various contributions made.  Investment of £74 million in local government represents a significant effort to improve the housing situation, the sanitary services and the various other areas for which this Department is responsible.  We on this side know that the situation in many cases is bad.  We know there are many thousands of people waiting to be re-housed. But we also realise that the attainment of our goal in this respect is not achievable by any crash programme or any rash decision to try to provide adequate housing within a very short time.  We know that is not the answer to this problem.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to hear the last speaker refer to the large number of local authority houses built in the mid-1950s. We know that at that time there was an imbalance of investment in local government and that the situation was one in which there were more empty houses than there were people to occupy them.  We had 90,000 people leaving in one year and that situation came about because of imbalanced investment in local government without a corresponding development of other resources and potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, I personally am not satisfied.  I know other Members on this side are not satisfied, but I do not want a situation to be brought about which would bring a strong, stabilised building industry to a halt. We want to see the problem of housing&mdash;it <Col N="1609" /> is a problem that will always be with us&mdash;tackled in such a way that at all times those who are in need of houses will get them within a reasonable time.  We want to see this as a continuing process.  We want to see a developing economy, a rising population, a continual increase of investment by the Government, year in, year out, to meet a developing, progressive situation.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we hear the Minister's statement next year we will learn that our investment in housing is still greater and that the economy will be developing along lines that will enable us to afford greater investment all the time.  We appreciate that local government is in the process of change because of changes in needs, a rise in the standard of living, easier communications, industrial development.  This in turn creates problems: planning problems, pollution problems and so on.  It behoves each of us to ensure that change is not imposed as a stopgap procedure to meet changing circumstances, but rather that we examine the overall position and try to anticipate what the changes will be and to draw up our local government structure so that it will be geared to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>I would like to see in whatever structure evolves in the future the involvement of local groupings, local people who are conversant with and who know the intricacies of local situations.  The identification of local people with such things is very worthwhile because there has been a danger of apathy among the electors; all the evidence is that electors in small areas exercise their rights more jealously than in larger areas.  At the same time one appreciates, particularly in smaller urban areas where the penny in the £ does not realise large amounts of money, the difficulties the people are having in improving their planning and in developing industrially and otherwise.</P>
    <P>I should like to see special allocations particularly to the smaller areas to enable the people to purchase more serviced land for development of local authority and private housing.  In many areas where there is inflation in <Col N="1610" /> housing site costs this will help people to get houses at a more reasonable cost, at least as far as site costs are concerned.  Again I was surprised by the last speaker who almost condemned people whose earnings he considered to be low, as we all would consider them to be, but who had the initiative to try to purchase their own houses.  He seemed to suggest this should not be encouraged, but I believe it should.  It leads to better citizenship and I would ask the Minister to increase the allocation to local authorities for purchasing sites to enable people to purchase or build their own houses.</P>
    <P>In the town of Thurles in my own constituency a 14-acre site has been provided for housing development but no site has yet been acquired for private development.  While local councils may be criticised as being conservative and lacking in initiative, decisions of this kind are related to the economic capacity of the council to bear such costs.  Great improvements. I admit, have been made in this field and most towns have been gearing themselves for an expansion in housing development.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects in relation to housing on which I should like to touch briefly. In regard to reconstruction and supplementary grants, as the Minister indicated in his opening speech, a high proportion of national housing stock is old and consequently reconstruction work plays an important part in providing suitable homes for people.  However, there is need for improvement in the situation.  I would like the Minister, especially where there is overcrowding, to examine the possibility of reducing the period within which a grant is not payable at the moment.</P>
    <P>The smaller urban councils cannot afford to pay supplementary grants and if they pay them at all it is at a reduced level.  This means that a person building a house in an area which is outside the urban area, which in some cases has greater economic potential, may receive a supplementary grant of up to 50 per cent greater than that received by a person within the urban area.  As suggested in <i>Housing in the Seventies</i>, the urban council should be <Col N="1611" /> in a position to pay a £ for £ supplementary grant with the local government grant.  This would alleviate hardships among the poorer people in urban areas where there is overcrowding and other problems.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in the provision of housing for elderly people.  In my own constituency the county council has just completed 20 dwellings throughout the country and the Minister has recently sanctioned tenders for the erection of six more. It would be desirable to incorporate in future housing schemes a number of smaller type houses for elderly people so that they could remain on in their own neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I have always favoured the differential rents system and I could never understand how people professing to be interested in the rehousing of the poorer sections of the community could be against it.  Schemes can always be improved, and it is the business of all of us to ensure that the deficiencies in any of these schemes are eradicated. I often wonder if in the case of a man in the firefighting service, who sometimes has to operate under conditions which bring out the best in him, some percentage of the extra earnings from his work could be disregarded in determining the rent payable.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for speedily sanctioning water schemes for Roscrea, Templemore and Thurles. These towns are expanding at a fast rate industrially and without a corresponding development in the infrastructure in the area progress would be restricted.  However, in relation to the provision of water supplies in rural areas the position is not good.  When one considers the necessity of running water nowadays and that it is indispensable on a farm or in any house one realises how difficult the position is in many rural areas, particularly in my own constituency, where people have no running water supplies.  We have to set about this matter more urgently and much more remains to be done in regard to group water schemes.  I was a bit disappointed that in the Minister's speech the grant for the provision of <Col N="1612" /> group water was not increased.  I welcome the proposal to strengthen the existing field staff by recruiting more inspectors to help in the formation of those schemes.  Close liaison must be maintained between the Department, the group organisers and the council. While I admit those schemes are by their very nature difficult to get off the ground in some cases the non-availability of the inspectors was an impeding factor and for this reason I welcome the Minister's proposal to strengthen the field staff.</P>
    <P>I believe group water schemes are the only way in which the provision of water supplies to rural areas can be improved.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister if he would request those inspectors to be available in the county council offices at regular intervals.  I know from my own experience the disappointment and almost confusion that can arise in areas where one or two people take on the heroic task of organising group water schemes and the frustration that can very often follow if the liaison and the co-operation one expects is not always forthcoming.  I appreciate that the number of inspec tors operating this scheme may not have been adequate.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of those schemes I am informed at present that the ESB are no longer helping in the cost of those schemes.  I know this may not come under the Minister's parti cular jurisdiction but I would ask him to ensure as far as possible within his power that the ESB play a greater role in the implementation of group water schemes.  I feel they can help to make the eventual carrying through of the financial aspects of those schemes easier and take a considerable load off organisers who have in many ways carried out the work both of the coun cil and the Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to local improvement schemes which were taken over by the county council from the Office of Public Works I want to say that tremendous progress has been made in their operation.  This is a great social scheme which fills a gap in the council roadwork scheme which in my opinion has improved the access routes to the many backward places throughout the <Col N="1613" /> country.  However, in the formula for the allocation of moneys for this scheme I understand it is based on the demand for moneys in the previous five years.  This formula may act against counties which have not in the past become more acutely aware of the advantage of this scheme and are now in the position that the amount of the grant which they can have from the Department of Local Government is not adequate to carry out the work they have in mind.  I would ask the Minister to consider reviewing the formula for the allocation of moneys in this scheme with a view to strengthening the allocation in those counties where the demand is rising at the moment and where the money is not adequate.</P>

      <P>I was just saying that I favour the local improvement <Col N="1614" /> schemes.  I have seen them operating very effectively in my area.  I would ask the Minister to review the formula for the allocation of moneys for these schemes.  I would also ask him to request the various county councils to ensure that where these schemes have been carried out, the roads in question are automatically taken over by the county council and maintained thereafter.</P>
      <P>I come now to the question of swimming pools.  The allocation of money to swimming pools at present is not nearly as high as many of us would like it to be.  I appreciate that every available pound has to be directed towards the more essential services, such as housing.  At the same time, particularly in large midland towns situated a long distance from the sea, there is a necessity for swimming pools. My own county of Tipperary is very poorly served in this regard.  In particular the towns of Roscrea, Templemore and Thurles need pools.  I should like to refer briefly to the position in Thurles.  Thurles is a town with a population of 7,000 people.  It is situated 70 miles from the nearest seashore. The town is developing all the time.  There is a fund-raising committee under the auspices of an urban council. Their contribution towards the provision of a pool is great.  They now have a little under £6,000 in the fund. This amount could be readily increased if the Minister would indicate when he might be in a position to sanction the provision of a pool for that area.  I would urge the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the provision of a pool in Thurles because of the situation of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the rates system which is inequitable is retained some effort must be made to ease the burden of rates falling on many urban ratepayers, not at the expense of the agricultural ratepayers but as a special allocation.  The recent legislation giving relief to certain categories of persons, such as old age pensioners and social welfare recipients, is a welcome step.  The owners of many small businesses, as well as the lower-paid wage-and salary-earners, are finding it a burden to pay their rates.  I welcome also the development whereby rates can be paid by instalments.  I <Col N="1615" /> should like to see these instalments made as flexible as possible where the situation demands it.</P>
    <P>I know that valuation does not come under the direct jurisdiction of the Minister.  Nevertheless, I ask him to use his good offices to request the valuation offices not to consider the provision of essential services, the building of extra rooms where there is overcrowding and the provision of toilets in placing increased valuation on houses.  Such a step could act as a deterrent to people with limited means who are trying to improve their houses. With regard to appeals made by ratepayers from time to time against increases in their valuations, I feel there is not ample opportunity for these people to develop their case for having their valuations lowered.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty because of the legal complications.</P>
    <P>It is apt to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he has been facing up to the problem of the itinerants.  He has increased the social consciousness of the local authorities and of the public in general on this question.  The fundamental question we must all ask ourselves is whether or not we cherish the children of this country equally.  The fears of the settled population need to be allayed in some cases.  Perhaps, we should try to look at the itinerant question from the point of view of a people who are prematurely aged because of the hardship of their lives.  In many instances the women rear large families without even the most modest kind of living facilities. The infant mortality rate among the itinerants is very high.  We must all become aware of how serious their situation is and how much needs to be done for them.</P>
    <P>Very often we want to compare their standards with ours.  This is unfair because you cannot change the habits of a lifetime overnight.  These people whose education and opportunity are nil and whose needs are desperate at times cannot be expected to discern between true and false principles. For this reason I congratulate the Minister on urging local authorities to take the first step in providing <Col N="1616" /> camping sites.  This is not the final answer but is the first step if education is to be provided for the children to fit them for eventual integration into society.</P>
    <P>Greater confidence should be placed in local authorities and their staffs. There has been a welcome improvement in this field in recent times but it is generally felt that if there was more local autonomy, if the councils had greater power, particularly in drawing up programmes which are so closely related to their allocations for a particular type of development this could be done much more effectively if they had advance knowledge of the allocation. I can appreciate the difficulties here but economies could be made.  I know that while the percentage grant system obtains it must necessarily lead to certain duplications and I often wonder if a block grant could be introduced in its place.  I suppose one cannot get away from the advisability of having common standards throughout the country but in modern conditions of speed, adaptation and growth more frequent decisions must be made on big issues by Departments one wonders if it is desirable to have Departments cluttered up with smaller schemes, extensions and additions which must be examined and sanctioned eventually.</P>
    <P>On occasions I understand the local government inspector visits the county council offices and schemes are discussed at local level.  This is a welcome development which can speed up progress and enable councils to expedite their programmes.</P>
    <P>Since the Planning Act became law all the evidence shows that greater interest is being taken in development of this kind by councillors and the community generally.  This supplements what I have already said about strengthening local autonomy and giving greater interest to the people, particularly by bringing many smaller decisions to local level where people are involved in decisions affecting their own lives.  Refusal of permission for development by councils could and should be avoided in some cases because this sometimes causes undue economic hardship to the applicant.  If the council invited him in to discuss the matter <Col N="1617" /> when it became obvious that the application was not within the area in which the council could grant permission but was at the same time close enough to an alternative about which the council could advise the applicant, this could avoid much delay for the person concerned and would also give him a greater interest in planning and greater knowledge of what is involved in the Planning Act.</P>
    <P>On the question of the regional organisations that have been set up for the development of North Tipperary, Limerick and Clare I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that Roscrea, because there is no statutory body in the town, is not represented on the regional body.  Roscrea is a fast-growing industrial town and while I appreciate that the prospective members of the board will give due regard to the particular problems of the area, one feels that local representation is absolutely essential because the town is situated on the perimeter of the area.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Dr. Nathaniel Lichfield in a report said that this area was retarded.  While this has been well refuted not only by the present developments but also by the population growth rate and development which has been sustained in that town for the past 20 years, representation is essential if the town is to develop effectively under the auspices of this regional board.  I again urge the Minister to ensure in so far as he can that this position is rectified.  Under the constitution for the area the board have the right to make changes whenever they see fit.  The machinery for this change is there but needs to be used.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, which is relevant to this debate because of the necessity for the development of the various services which are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Local Government and which act as a springboard for the development of industry, the urban council in Thurles have acquired a 13-acre site for development.  A 15-acre site has been acquired in Roscrea and a smaller area in Nenagh.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I would come back to the regional development <Col N="1618" /> organisation for North Tipperary, Clare and Limerick.  This organisation is just two years old and has resulted from a spirit of co-operation between the local authorities concerned One cannot claim at this time that this regional organisation will be the answer to the problem but it is noticeable that great and valuable work has been done by the organisation.  Certainly it has helped to create a regional conciousness in that area.  The organisation defined clearly the areas in which it ought to function, which were higher education, industrial development, services, communications, housing, tourism and amenities.</P>
    <P>The committee dealing with industrial development has made great progress. In this regard I should like to compliment the county development team and the county development officer on the work they are doing, particularly in relation to the fostering of small industries and encouraging the expansion of existing small industries. In relation to the council's schemes for many rural areas which have been submitted to the Department for sanction, and also the sewerage schemes submitted, I want to ask the Minister to sanction them speedily to meet the urgent needs of the people there and also to ensure that the service structure in these labour areas will be able to take industrial development when it comes.</P>
    <P>I want to again urge the Minister to sanction one scheme I am particularly anxious about: Kennedy Park, Roscrea.  Significant development has already taken place, but there is a growing need for more houses there and also for the scheme for elderly people at Grove Street, Roscrea.</P>

      <P>This Estimate has been recognised as one of the most important social documents of recent times.  It is a document which deals with the very wide spectrum of local government.  It deals with, on the one hand, housing and the very important social problem of itinerants, on the other.  It deals with pollution, conservation and many other aspects of local <Col N="1619" /> authority.  For that, it is recognised as a document into which a considerable amount of thought has gone.</P>
      <P>The debate on local government gives Deputies an opportunity to refer to problems in their constituencies.  I should like to refer particularly to a very important issue which has been bothering the area of Dún Laoghaire for two or three years.  It is the application by Ostlanna Éireann Teoranta, a subsidiary of CIE, for planning permission over the railway station in Dún Laoghaire.  This permission was sought a number of years ago and for some obscurantist reason was turned down by the Fine Gael dominated council.  I will say this for the Labour Party: for once they were right.  Perhaps I should say &ldquo;correct&rdquo;.  I do not like to refer to the Labour Party as being &ldquo;right&rdquo; in the philosophical political sense.  They were correct.  They supported the pro-Fianna Fáil councillors in giving their sanction for the planning permission sought.  However, their numbers were not sufficient and consequently permission was turned down.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, I may mention one of the councillors who is taking a particularly active part in having this hotel located in Dún Laoghaire, namely, Seán Byrne.  He is devoting a considerable amount of his time to bring about a situation in which we will have in the near future the refused planning permission re-activated.  In that connection may I refer to a report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of the 24th February, 1970?  It is necessary for me to quote the article at some length to give the House an indication as to why this hotel is so badly needed in the Dún Laoghaire area.  The Acting Chairman may feel it is not within the scope of this Bill but, if I am allowed to develop it, I believe he will agree with me.</P>
      <P>Station hotel plan still &ldquo;on&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>CIE's plan for a multi-storey luxury hotel on top of Dún Laoghaire railway station is still very much &ldquo;on&rdquo;...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A CIE spokesman said that they had reopened talks with the planning <Col N="1620" /> officer of Dún Laoghaire Corporation about the siting of a Great Southern Hotel in Dún Laoghaire at the request of the corporation.</P>
    <P>A Dún Laoghaire Corporation spokesman, however, pointed out that the talks were very preliminary and that so far nothing concrete had been agreed on.</P>
    <P>CIE says that the new hotel would cost about £500,000 and would eventually employ about 150 people. It would overlook Dún Laoghaire Harbour and have a swimming pool on the roof.</P>
    <P>It is understood, however, that the company has also been thinking of sitting the hotel elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire Corporation, the officials and the councillors have an obligation to the whole future of the Dún Laoghaire borough area that when this planning permission comes before them again it must be granted and there must be no prevarication on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to consider the background: £500,000 is being pumped into the area and 150 people will be employed as a result of this development. It has also been mentioned that if permission is granted and the hotel is located in the Dún Laoghaire borough area, £250,000 will be spent annually throughout the area.  This is a very important social consideration apart from any other aspect.</P>

      <P>I am using this occasion as a platform to ensure that this development goes on.  However, I have made my point and do not wish to put the Chair at any disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important social problem <Col N="1621" /> the Minister has dealt with is itinerancy. Much has been said about the itinerants.  People will say: &ldquo;We are in favour of solving the itinerant problem as long as it is not solved on our front doorstep&rdquo;.  There is a certain merit in that in the sense that what the Minister is trying to do is to provide developed sites for itinerants and, in some instances, the settled community without any prevarication have accepted itinerants in their midst.  The Minister is doing a first-class job in this respect but the same cannot be said for some local authorities who are dragging their heels and will not take any decisions in regard to this important social problem.</P>
    <P>It is not an easy problem to solve. Someone observed that the only way to solve the problem was to take the children away from the parents.  That is one of the most fantastic and outrageous solutions to any problem apart from the unconstitutionality of the suggestion.  It is important that the children are properly educated.  This opportunity was not available to their parents.  Schooling is available on quite a number of the sites and, I believe, the itinerant problem which will remain with us for quite a long time will phase itself out with the education of the children.  I know of a number of cases where parents have been attending classes and these are important developments to the solution of this problem.  It is a problem which causes much worry in city areas but if we are sincere and honest with ourselves we must confine ourselves to the solution proposed by the Minister in his brief.  Therefore, I call on local authorities to do their part.  We can urge them; we can use all the flowery language needed to persuade them to play their part but the final action must emanate from the local authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish to raise is the provision of a park on the south side of Dublin, similar to the Phoenix Park on the north side.  There is undoubtedly a great need for this but it is difficult to know where it should be situated.  Perhaps, a tract of the Dublin mountains could be developed on lines somewhat similar to the <Col N="1622" /> national parks in the United States with all the amenities not at the moment available here.  This is a matter that will become more important in the next ten or 20 years.  With the advent of computerisation, the updating of technological effort in the economic field and so on, people will have more leisure time and I would, therefore, urge the Minister to take a look at the feasibility of acquiring a suitable site on the south side of the city of Dublin and relate what has been done in the Phoenix Park to this site.  The Phoenix Park is one of the most highly developed parks in Europe but not every citizen has a car or the facilities available to go there.</P>
    <P>Another very important feature of my plea in this respect is that, with the growth of development of the south side of the Liffey, the need for a park of the type I have just mentioned will become greater.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, it has long been recognised that the normal practice and procedure in the House has been that in Private Members' time, as at other times, the speakers from each Party would rotate.  However, in this case this practice has been departed from and, naturally, we are concerned about this particularly in view of the request made to the Chair by the Minister for Local Government with regard to this matter some short time ago.  With your permission, I shall quote the ruling made by the Ceann Comhairle at the time. I am quoting from volume 242 of the Official Report for the 26th November, 1969.  At column 192 Deputy Boland is quoted as asking:</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That is not in dispute.  The position as I understand it is that speakers were being called in rotation but when Labour's turn came there was no one from that party in the House.  The Acting Chairman <Col N="1624" /> then called a Fine Gael speaker who was followed by a Fianna Fáil speaker.</P>

      <P>It would appear that Fine Gael and Labour Members have no interest whatever in the motion put down in the names of Deputies Richie Ryan, Tom O'Donnell and Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins.  In relation to the motion I would say that some weeks previous to the acceptance of this particular motion, Fine Gael put down a similar motion in relation to social welfare problems and on that occasion the motion was moved by a front bench member of Fine Gael but he failed to find a seconder.  This was an indication of the lack of concern on the part of that party for social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say the dismal past of Fine Gael and the Labour Party when their contribution to the old age pensioners was tenpence a week on average over the period in which they were in office, is very much removed from the substantial increases the old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients have got during the past ten years or so.  The increases were substantial; there is no need for me to mention them.  The old age pensioners are as well aware of them as they are of the dismal failure of Fine Gael or Labour to make any substantial increase during their term and, as I said before, the very fact that the previous motion in the name of Fine Gael failed to find a seconder is absolute evidence of their inconsistency and their failure <Col N="1627" /> to recognise this particular section.  It was purely a gimmick, as indeed is this motion, because we left it to the public to judge and they did judge in no uncertain terms last June and they will have an opportunity again in the coming week or so to make their judgment as to whether or not we have neglected the aged or the infirm in any way.  The Minister for Health recently indicated the introduction of a home help service and indeed a meals service is provided by voluntary organisations in certain areas in Dublin city at the moment.  I should like to pay a compliment to the voluntary organisations, supported by Dublin Health Authority, which provide meals for people who are unable to look after themselves.  A very effective service is provided in this city and no words of mine, or no words expressed in this House, could do justice to the personnel who operate that meals on wheels service.  As I said before, there is no need for me to explain further or to go into detail about the exact amounts allocated in the last Budget and in other Budgets to the old age pensioners.  In so far as the resources allow, the Government have made contributions to them and will continue to make them in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is as set out.  The actual terms of <Col N="1628" /> the Bill are substantially in line with the provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill introduced by the Minister's predecessor. The reasons for the proposals antecede by a considerable length of time the actual provisions included in the Criminal Justice Bill as introduced. Some years ago, both by way of Parliamentary Question and in the course of debate, I raised the urgency and gravity of the problem of injury and, unfortunately, loss of life occasioned in the main by the use of certain offensive weapons known generally as &ldquo;flick-knives&rdquo;.  The provisions included in the Criminal Justice Bill described under the title of the Bill submitted in the name of Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself, cover the description &ldquo;offensive weapons&rdquo; precisely because the difficulty of dealing with attacks on individuals and injury to persons by naming a particular weapon is obvious.  I have been seriously perturbed for many years by the number of serious injuries and in some cases deaths&mdash;quite recently a number of deaths&mdash;arising from stabbings or injuries inflicted by the use of flick-knives of knives of one character or another.  I recognise straight away that it is almost impossible to prevent by legislation injury to a person or persons by attacks of this character. The purpose of the measure that we have put down for discussion is to strengthen the authorities by enabling the Garda to have additional powers and, at the same time, prescribing penalties for injury or, in the most extreme cases, loss of life, caused by abuses which are currently liable to occur, mainly, of course, in the cities, but also in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone recognises that there is here a serious social problem, that the power and penalties that at present exist are insufficient to deter some of the perpetrators of these outrages from using knives or offensive weapons of one sort or another against an individual or group.  It is for these reasons that I have been pressing for a considerable time that steps should be taken to deal with this problem. When I raised this matter originally during the time of one of the Minister's predecessors he expressed the view generally that it was not a very <Col N="1629" /> serious problem.  Since then, unfortunately, there have been a number of serious cases of injury.  In some cases the person injured was a member of the Garda.  In most cases private citizens were the subject of attack. Undoubtedly, as I have said, this is not a matter that can be prevented by legislation.  If people are determined to commit crimes, no amount of legislation and no penalty however grave can act as a preventative.  On the other hand, if penalties are sufficiently severe and if the powers of action afforded to the Garda and sanctioned by the courts in respect of the commission of crimes of this character are sufficiently strong, they can act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>The phraseology of the Bill that we have drafted is very largely in line with the sections that I mentioned that were included in the Criminal Justice Bill as introduced.  When this matter was first raised by me and by some others in the House we were concerned at the number of incidents. Since then the extent and the number of these cases have increased and the severe losses that have been felt by persons who have been injured and the deaths that have resulted in some extreme cases have highlighted the need for action to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The reason that we drafted the Bill in the language that is included in the Bill as lodged and covered by the title Offensive Weapons Bill was to ensure that it would be readily and speedily acceptable to the Minister and the Government.  Anyone who has considered this problem will agree that it is a problem that concerns the welfare of society as a whole.  It is not a problem that has any political or other overtones to it.  It is a problem possibly associated with development elsewhere, possibly, in some respects as old as society itself.  There is no restriction on the purchase or acquisition of these weapons by individuals. We feel there should be control over their acquisition.</P>
    <P>There is in this country and in most countries an obligation on persons who seek to use firearms to get a licence to <Col N="1630" /> have a firearm.  There is no similar obligation in respect of a knife of any character.  The number of cases that have occurred and the potentiality for serious injury and loss of life that exists warrants the definite conclusion that some restriction should also be imposed on the acquisition of knives other than in the case of knives used by persons who is the ordinary course of their business are obliged to use them.  There are, of course, a whole variety of occupations in which people have to have knives or weapons.  Drillers, carpenters, mechanics, tool-makers of one kind or another are obliged in the course of their employment and the normal course of their work to possess and to use these weapons.  It would be a relatively simple matter to issue licences in respect of these defined categories of persons who because of their occupation are obliged to use particular types of weapons.  On the other hand, the absolute freedom that at present exists to buy or to acquire, use or carry offensive weapons or a knife, with the serious consequences, including lethal consequences, that may flow from it inevitably poses the question that there should be some restriction on their acquisition, ownership and possession by persons without legitimate cause and reason and not being possessed of a permit or licence of some sort from some recognised authority.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is a social problem.  It is a problem which because of its very nature it is not easy to solve.  I do not suggest that the enactment of any legislation, either this Bill as drafted or the provisions included in the Criminal Justice Bill or any other measure, can solve it in the last analysis.  All it can do is lessen or minimise the dangers. At the same time, I feel we have an obligation to enact legislation, to operate controls and to impose sanctions that may act in some way as an effective deterrent.  We have seen groups, or gangs if you like, of young boys or teenagers assembling together and, possibly, something that starts as a simple and ordinary display of good spirits or ordinary play or amusement between them develops into a row and, at some stage or other, knives are produced and the consequences are very <Col N="1631" /> serious and, unfortunately, in some cases fatal for those involved.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate the seriousness of that situation but, at the same time, the number of cases that have occurred, the number of cases of serious injury and the number of deaths, warrant action by the Legislature to provide adequate powers and some system of restriction on the carrying of knives and at the same time providing sufficient penalties.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the initial powers introduced in the Criminal Justice Bill would have been sufficient.  I think it was a mistake in a measure of that sort to embrace so many different matters, some of them completely unrelated to others, and some that had no obvious direct connection with the criminal code.  In any event, without discussing that, this is a matter that I and a number of other Deputies on all sides of the House have been concerned with for some considerable time.  It is a social problem.  Action by the Legislature is necessary in the form of the enactment of a particular piece of legislation.  The granting of certain powers to the Garda and the operation of certain sanctions might alleviate this problem.</P>
    <P>I want to indicate briefly to the House the terms of this measure so that Deputies may be familiar with the actual provisions in it.  The Bill is the same type as some sections in the Criminal Justice Bill and it provides:</P>
    <P>2.  Where a person, while committing (or being reasonably believed by the other person hereinafter mentioned to be about to commit) an offence, or in the course of a dispute or fight, produces in a manner likely unlawfully to intimidate another person any knife whatsoever, or any other article capable of inflicting serious injury, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment, and <Col N="1632" /> (b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>3.&mdash;(1)  Where a person, without reasonable excuse (the onus of proving which shall lie on him),&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  has with him in&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any dance hall, dance marquee, cinema, theatre, recreation hall or amusement hall,</P>
    <P>(ii)  any club premises, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  any premises in which food or drink (whether intoxicating or not) is served to the public,</P>
    <P>at a time when people are likely to be resorting thereto, or</P>
    <P>(b)  has with him at any sports fixture, carnival, bazaar or other place of entertainment where people are likely to congregate,</P>
    <P>any knife whatsoever other than a pocket-knife no blade of which can be locked by a lever, button, spring or other device in an &ldquo;open&rdquo; position, he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person, without reasonable excuse (the onus of proving which shall lie on him), has with him in any public place&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any flick-knife, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any other article whatsoever made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person,</P>
    <P>he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a person has with him in any public place any article intended by him unlawfully to cause injury to or intimidate any person either in a particular eventuality or otherwise, he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a new section.  It provides:</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a person imports, manufactures, sells, hires, offers for sale or hire, or exposes or has in <Col N="1633" /> his possession for the purpose of sale or hire, or gives or lends to any person, any flick-knife, he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(5)  In a prosecution for an offence under subsection (3) of this section, it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to allege or show that the intent to cause injury or intimidate was intent to cause injury to or intimidate a particular person and if, having regard to all the circumstances (including the type of the article alleged to have been intended to cause injury or intimidate, the time of the day or night, and the place), the court thinks it reasonable to do so, it may regard possession of the article in the particular circumstances as sufficient evidence of intent in the absence of any adequate explanation by the defendant.</P>
    <P>A person who is guilty of an offence under that section will be liable to the fines and imprisonments I have mentioned. It defines a flick-knife or a knife of that character.  That, I think, covers as fully as is necessary the provisions of the measure we have introduced.</P>
    <P>I want to re-emphasise the gravity of this situation.  Indeed, on many occasions when ordinary legitimate demonstrations are held troublemakers of one kind or another associate themselves or connect themselves with them.  These may be protests or sports meetings where people are, perhaps, excessively enthusiastic about a particular team.  Because of the consumption of intoxicating liquor or because of incidents in dancehalls and places of amusement people get involved in rows.  There have been exceptions where rows developed between rival groups, but in very many cases the people who have been killed or injured were inoffensive by-standers and not concerned in any way with the events that led up to injury or death.</P>
    <P>As I say, there have been exceptions where rows developed between individuals or rival gangs and, indeed, some of the worst cases have resulted from that.  I believe that the Garda have done a very good job with the existing powers.  In many cases they have <Col N="1634" /> shown great bravery.  In my own constituency a particular garda showed exceptional bravery in an individual case.  This was recognised and rightly so.  At the same time, the existing powers are not sufficient to deal with the problem.  As legislators we all know it exists.  It has been commented upon in the Press and in articles by responsible persons concerned with social problems, as an evil that should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>This problem in so far as it exists as a problem, to some extent can be lessened by effective action by the Legislature.  We have an obligation to enact the necessary legislation.  I do not for a moment suggest that the enactment of any legislation can prevent people committing crimes, that crimes can be prevented by legislation no matter how severe. The history of human behaviour negatives the suggestion that you can make people good by passing a law.  At the same time, you can operate restrictions and, in fact, restrictions are operated not merely here but in other countries on the carrying, distribution and sale of firearms.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate features of this problem is that the knives which have been the cause of so much serious injury and loss of life are relatively small weapons that can be carried without being obvious to the Garda or to other persons until some action or row occurs.  Because the problem exists and because it is seen to exist, we have an obligation to take action before it gets more serious.  Deputy Fitzpatrick and I have endeavoured to draft this measure in line with the proviso in the Criminal Justice Bill as initially drafted, in the belief that it would be generally acceptable to the Minister and the House and also in the knowledge that this problem is one which in a period of many years I have expressed concern about, indeed, long before it became a matter of such public attention as at present.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is an obligation on the Dáil to enact this legislation or a measure similar to it so that whatever powers are necessary can be given to the Garda and the necessary penalties fixed for imposition by the courts <Col N="1635" /> where persons are found to be in conflict with the law.  I believe this is a problem that requires to be dealt with, and this House has an obligation.  I think the country will accept a measure of this sort aimed at eradicating a problem which has already caused injury and loss of life and which may become more serious if effective action is not taken.  It is for those reasons that I formally propose this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am happy to defer to the Minister.  I always do.  In supporting the broad outline of the Bill I am in some slight difficulty at the <Col N="1636" /> outset and this very difficulty is the very reason why I should support the First Reading.  The difficulty is that the Bill is not available to me in its printed form.  Therefore, although Deputy Cosgrave has outlined its provisions in some detail, it would be most helpful to the Members to have the printed document.  This is an instance, therefore, when the motion that the Bill be printed could pass without opposition.</P>
      <P>Obviously the Bill has been framed with particular care and attention to detail and points to one of the most horrific social evils which afflict our contemporary society, particularly in a constituency like that which I have the honour to represent.  It is this growing flood of violence particularly among the young.  It is a matter with which under existing law the Garda Síochána are finding it increasingly difficult to deal.</P>
      <P>If I may make an aside point, it has been suggested in a place foreign to here that those of us who sit on these benches have some special hostility to the Garda Síochána.  I do not think that is so and I should like here to pay a tribute to the Garda in their efforts are seriously handicapped be-volume of violence in our city.  Their efforts are seriously handicapped because they are so much under strength and so much occupied with so many other problems of one kind or another ranging from guarding banks to the prosecution of motorists.</P>
      <P>This is a problem which I am particularly conscious of because of the constituency for which I sit but also, if I may pay a tribute in this House to someone, because of my close friendship with Detective Sergeant Brannigan, a famous member of the Garda Síochána whom I got to know closely through his boxing activities.  I know from him the extraordinary difficulties gardaí encounter late at night outside dancehalls and emptying public houses, with particular reference to violence among the young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say this is a growing problem I do not want to be called an alarmist or to be classed as the Mrs. Grundy of the Labour Party.  Neither do I wish to be taken as suggesting <Col N="1637" /> that the city has been given over to anarchy and violence.  It is confined to a small minority among our urban population.  I do say, however, that ordinary people living in ordinary corporation houses, trying to live decent lives and bring up decent families in the face of appalling difficulties, are living in fear of physical assault like the one on Christmas Day in this city so amply demonstrated.  This danger has been further increased by&mdash;this has been admitted only recently&mdash; drinking among the young, a very unfortunate and regrettable thing.  Some Deputies and others see fit to make a spectacular issue of the drug problem, but they would do well to consider the enormous incidence of alcoholism in this country and the fact that a very high proportion of children leaving school will be alcoholics within a relatively short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, unless the Minister is going to argue that violence is the result of original sin; I think it can be the result of alcoholism, so if there is a spread of the consumption of alcohol amongst the young, surely it relates to the problem of violence amongst the young.  This growth of drink amongst the young has further burdened the Garda and makes all the more necessary the acceptance of the principles outlined in the Bill which Deputy Cosgrave asks us to approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to underline my full agreement with one point he made and, in fact, to extend it.  Legislation of itself cannot be a deterrent to crime.  People will commit crime even if laws are passed against it.  People will externalise their inner tensions and problems in violence even if laws are passed which prevent them from carrying the physical weapons which lead to death and destruction in this city.  There are many reasons for this.  We live in an age in which violence is glorified.  As I tried to point out to the House in another context but the Minister did not seem particularly receptive to my point of view, the young have exposed to them on every side the whole concept <Col N="1638" /> of the virtues of war; they are exposed to horror comics; they are exposed to advertisements for guns and for all kinds of toys containing the idea that violence is manly and heroic.</P>
    <P>One must have the utmost pity for some of the people who are guilty of this form of violence, particularly violence with knives which are commonplace in large areas of working-class Dublin, violence with one of the most familiar phenomena in addition to the flick-knife, the lethal sharpened steel comb which I have come across very often in my work in working-class areas.  Many of these people are driven to this because of the absolute barrenness and sterility of their home environment.  They are brought up in barrack-like encampments, tiny houses pressed one against the other.  They have no privacy and no leisure.  They have no place to meet their friends, no place to congregate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave will agree with me that simply to pass a Bill will not solve that problem, although it will go some way to meet some of its consequences. Its consequences are that the place of congregation of these people is the new horrific phenomenon of the enormous dancehall to which so many young people travel such distances, wealthy to some degree as never before for a brief period before marriage. There they can drink and fight after the dances.</P>
    <P>Again there is the phenomenon of the enormous publichouse.  In my own constituency outside one publichouse close to where I hold one of my clinics there was a potentially lethal fight and only the rapid and fortuitous intervention of the Garda prevented someone from being killed there.  It is a sad thing that we have reached the stage in Ireland where the kind of people who used foregather at the crossroads now forgather in dancehalls and publichouses armed with the kind of concealed weapon which Deputy Cosgrave's Bill seeks to eliminate.</P>
    <P>This problem must be met in many other ways besides legislation, by the provision of community centres, for example; the provision of psychiatric <Col N="1639" /> care for these people, many of whom are simply disturbed rather than intrinsically criminal, disturbed very often by the example of violence given to them by their elders.</P>
    <P>The problem can only be met by the provision of youth clubs.  If I may, marginally within the rules of order, ride one of my hobby-horses, one way it could be met is by the provision of greater sporting facilities, more particularly for boxing.  One of the healthiest ways in which this sort of competitive, aggressive violence which exists in all of us, the Minister and myself included, can be externalised is within the boxing ring where it is subject to the control of certain rules. Again, I quote my friend, Sergeant Brannigan, who commutes from refereeing fights to breaking up fights in working-class Dublin and who would rather referee fights in the ring of the Stadium ring than break up the fights in the places about which I am talking.</P>
    <P>It will take many years to solve this problem, but the Bill introduced by Deputy Cosgrave is a step in the right direction.  It is also a step in the right direction, because it is appalling that there are people who can make money from the sale of these weapons which I myself have seen on display in certain shops in this city. I know when the Minister for Transport and Power was Minister for Justice he went some considerable distance towards the banning of the more obviously lethal flick-knives, but we could go considerably further in this direction.</P>
    <P>It is a very small request to ask the Government to allow the First Stage of this Bill to pass and be published.  If I, as a new Deputy, understand Standing Orders correctly, the Bill would be open to substantial amendment.  The Minister's knowledge of this subject is much greater than mine and he can explain this to me later, but at this stage it would be an appropriate gesture on the part of the Government to accept the Bill thus showing their concern about a pressing social problem which particularly but not exclusively applies to the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> This has been a slightly tense six months in this Dáil, I understand from people who have been here longer than I have, a tension not exactly reduced by the fact that a by-election is taking place next Wednesday.  To concede that Deputy Cosgrave has done his homework and produced the outlines of an effective Bill would be a small concession on the part of the Government. Therefore, on behalf of the Labour Party I should like to associate myself with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated I was opposing this Bill which is termed&mdash;and it is the only original thing about it&mdash;the Offensive Weapons Bill, 1970.  There is one thing which the mover, Deputy Cosgrave, has stated and with which I agree, that is, that no amount of legislation in this field will cure the matter but that it may act as some deterrent. There is legislation there, and there for a very long time, dealing with offensive weapons.  It is enshrined in section 6 of the Vagrancy Act of 1824. That law already makes it an offence to carry offensive weapons.  The suggestions made here provide additions to that law and the means of enforcing it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave stated that the provisions of this Bill are substantially the same as certain sections of the Criminal Justice Bill.  That is the understatement of the year.  The Bill before the House is in fact lifted word for word from Part IV of the Criminal Justice Bill which was held up so long in the last Dáil mainly by the efforts of Deputy Fitzpatrick and his predecessor then occupying that seat, the then Deputy Michael O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us, the Offensive Weapons Bill, 1970, is in fact word for word, comma for comma, Part IV of the Criminal Justice Bill which was introduced in this House and which will be reintroduced within the next couple of weeks in this House.  The effort of Deputy Fitzpatrick in this connection is to copy those sections of the Criminal Justice Bill but in the order of copying them to put section 23 before section 22 as those sections <Col N="1641" /> appear in Part IV of the Criminal Justice Bill.  It is as I said an exact replica line for line, section for section, word for word, comma for comma, including the definitions of this particular portion of the Criminal Justice Bill.  Now, that being so, it will astound some of those listening to hear the people in the Fine Gael benches speaking about their anxiety to have this legislation put on the Statute Book when in fact they took up so much of the time of the last Dáil preventing this very legislation going on the Statute Book.  We had week in and week out, month in and month out, this obstruction of the Criminal Justice Bill, which includes those very sections, a Bill opposed so bitterly by the Fine Gael Party and especially by their spokesman on legal matters in this House at that time who, as I recall, was so good as to prophesy in one of his last statements that in a very short time he would be occupying my place here and that that would be the end of the Criminal Justice Bill including those sections that are lifted from that Bill and introduced here under the guise of being a new measure.</P>
    <P>I must compliment Deputy Fitzpatrick on his tremendous research into his subject and on his great ingenuity in putting section 23 of the Criminal Justice Bill before section 22 and dishing it up here in this form alleging it to be some new measure after some deep thinking being done on this matter by the Fine Gael Party.</P>

It is certainly inconceivable, when they so bitterly opposed the Criminal Justice Bill including those sections, that in such a short time we should have this part of the Criminal Justice Bill lifted out of it, dressed up under a new name and introduced here word for word, sentence for sentence.  There <Col N="1642" /> are such things as plagiarism and copyright. I do not know that we will have to go into them in this connection but this is so.</P>

If he read it he should know and recognise those two sections are Part IV of that Bill.  There is no necessity for Deputy Thornley or anybody else in this House to ask for this Fine Gael Bill to be printed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will indicate to the House when I am introducing the resumed discussion what I propose to do about that Bill.  The one thing I want to assure the House on this issue <Col N="1643" /> is that those sections which have been lifted from it by Deputy Fitzpatrick will be included in the new Bill.  This effort of taking a portion of a law reform measure like the Criminal Justice Bill out of it and introducing it here with those two sections under a different heading is exactly what I think one would expect from Deputy Fitzpatrick's research because it is the very same thing as this effort made around Budget time to lift the good things like the provision of increases for old age pensioners out of the Budget, adopting them but at the same time voting against the necessary taxation to implement that particular portion of the Budget.</P>
      <P>It would appear that it is the effort of Deputy Fitzpatrick to lift a portion of a Bill introduced by this Government into this House, a portion he likes, and introduce it as a new Fine Gael Bill and leave the rest of that particular measure there.  It is for those reasons I am opposing this unprecedented effort at plagiarism by Deputy Fitzpatrick in this House.  This is the most outrageous proposal and the most outrageous example of political playacting I have seen in my long term serving in this House&mdash;to take two sections out of a Bill, give them a new name and pretend that this is something new to deal with an urgent social problem when the very same people stopped this legislation being enacted by the last Dáil.  Consequently I will oppose this measure and if the Deputies opposite are so worried about dealing with this problem they will have an opportunity of helping me to expedite the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill through this House when I introduce it in the Dáil in the next couple of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> For some considerable time past public opinion and the public conscience have been seriously distributed in this country by the increase in crimes of violence, violence resulting in serious bodily injury on many occasions and not infrequently resulting in death.  This party have been conscious of this state of affairs for some years past.  The leader of this party, Deputy Cosgrave, <Col N="1644" /> questioned the then Minister for Justice, Deputy B. Lenihan, about the necessity for controlling offensive weapons.  Deputy Cosgrave suggested that there was a serious problem to be dealt with.  The Minister's attitude was that the problem was not serious and that it did not need any special legislation. Not alone has this party been deeply conscious of the seriousness of this problem and of the necessity for controlling it but the Minister, in May last, in answer to a Parliamentary question stated that, in 1966, 34 assaults involving the use of knives took place.  In 1967 there were 31 assaults involving the use of knives and in 1968 31 such assaults occurred. In 1966 one death resulted from an assault involving the use of a knife.  In 1967 one death resulted from an assault involving the use of a knife. In 1968 two such deaths occurred.  The figures I have given do not relate to the whole country.  They relate only to the county and city of Dublin.  We know as a matter of public knowledge that many such stabbings took place throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have always been prepared to strengthen the law in relation to this so as to prevent the carrying of offensive weapons, such as knives, in public places and to deal seriously with offences resulting from such knives and other offensive weapons.  The Minister might have been a little bit more gracious in his speech dealing with this Bill, put forward in a serious manner to deal with a serious problem, which has perturbed the public mind, public opinion and the public conscience as evidenced by leading articles in newspapers and speeches made by responsible people. In this House the Minister harps on the fact that these provisions were included in the Criminal Justice Bill. I agree that they were included in that Bill.  I agree that for all practical purposes the sections of this Bill which I am asking the House to give authority to print were lifted out of the Criminal Justice Bill which was debated in this House last year.  I make no apology for so doing.  The then Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, as spokesman on Justice in this House, made it clear that there <Col N="1645" /> were many things in the Criminal Justice Bill which this party approved of, welcomed and endorsed but, on the other hand, there were many things objectionable and obnoxious in the Criminal Justice Bill which this party would resist to the last.  Indeed, I might tell the House in opposing the objectionable provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill this party were not out on a limb.  This Party were in line with public opinion as expressed by every free newspaper in this country, as expressed by members of the churches.  The Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis were of the same opinion as the majority of the people in this country when they passed a resolution stoutly condemning, and calling for the withdrawal of, certain sections of the Criminal Justice Bill.  This party were not prepared to accept a package deal. They were not prepared to accept the coating on the pill, the coating on the pill being these sections which we agreed with and the pill being the provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill which took away the freedom of the individual and interfered with his constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>This problem of flick-knives, offensive weapons and crimes of violence has been a source of great anxiety to the people of this country for a great length of time.  It is something which should not have been delayed.  It should have been dealt with as a matter of urgency.  The Minister comes in here and says he was dealing with this in the Criminal Justice Bill but was obstructed by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  He might have said also that he would have got further if he had not been obstructed by his own Ard Fheis.</P>
    <P>In the light of this serious national problem, let us consider the speed with which the Government were dealing with this matter.  The Criminal Justice Bill, on which the Minister bases his argument, got a First Reading in this House on the 22nd June, 1967. It got that reading by unanimous agreement of this House.  When did it see the light of day and when did the Government dealing with this urgent national problem see fit to give this Criminal Justice Bill a Second Reading?  It was <Col N="1646" /> almost two years later on the 18th February, 1969.  Surely this was an unprecedented delay in pushing forward the Bill of which the Minister is so proud.  This was an inexcusable delay in dealing with this question of flick-knives and offensive weapons.  The Bill was discussed on the 22nd, 23rd, 29th and 30th of April and on the 7th May, 1969.  There was a general election on the 18th June, 1969.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister should deal with this matter in a responsible way.  There is no use becoming truculent or offensive. I have told the Minister there was undue delay by the Government in controlling offensive weapons.  For that reason this party felt impelled to put through a Private Members' Bill to do what the Government neglected to do. In support of that contention I have reminded the House that the Bill containing the sections which I have put in this Bill was introduced first on the 22nd June, 1967, but the Government did not seek a Second Reading for it until 18th February, 1969.  There was a general election on the 18th June, 1969, as I was telling the Minister when he interrupted me.  An open cheque was given to the Minister and the Government to come back and get on with the urgent business of the country.  The Minister has not introduced into this House yet, or asked us to deal with, the Criminal Justice Bill which provides these sections which I have put in this Bill.  We will again resist the Criminal Justice Bill with its objectionable provisions and sections but we will give the Minister for Justice and the Government the portions of the Criminal Justice Bill which are exactly on all fours with the Bill which I am producing here now in five minutes in this House if he wants them, but we will not accept the package deal.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Government do not intend to give permission to have this Bill printed and circulated.  Therefore, it is necessary for me to explain to the House briefly what the Bill proposes.</P>

    <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes to enact that where a person while committing an offence or in the course of a dispute or fight produces, in a manner likely to unlawfully intimidate another person, any knife whatsoever or any other article capable of inflicting serious injury, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of £100 or six months and on conviction on indictment to £200 or two years.  That <Col N="1648" /> seeks to convey that any person who intimidates another with a knife, even if he does not in fact cause injury, shall be liable to these penalties.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is of vital importance, in my opinion, because it prohibits the bringing of a knife or an offensive weapon into a dance hall, dance marquee, cinema, theatre, recreation hall or amusement hall or any club premises in which food or drink is served to the public.  I commend that section of the Bill as a really worthwhile section.  Unfortunately, we know certain serious offences are committed in dance halls where people go to enjoy themselves because people carry these offensive weapons.  It is to our discredit that many assaults and rows apparently arise in dance halls.  I think it is vital in the interests of public safety and the protection of the public in general that the carrying of those knives in dance halls or marquees&mdash; which have become very common all over the country&mdash;or in publichouses, clubs or restaurants, should be prohibited and this Bill proposes to prohibit them.</P>

If he is charged on indictment and brought before judge and jury in the circuit court he is liable to a fine of £200 or two years imprisonment.  A definition section defines a flick-knife &mdash;I think it is necessary to put that on record&mdash;and says that in this section a flick-knife means a knife (a) the blade of which opens when hand pressure is applied to a button, spring, lever or other device&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I bow to your ruling and I shall not go into detail.  The Minister has stated that the Fine Gael Party are responsible for the fact that we have no effective legislation on the Statute Book to deal with the problem I have been dealing with and I want to prove that is not so.  He referred to Deputy Michael O'Higgins's obstruction of the <Col N="1650" /> Criminal Justice Bill in this House. On May 7th, 1969, Deputy O'Higgins, in dealing with the Criminal Justice Bill stated:</P>
      <P>I think it is due to the determined effort made by Deputy Liam Cosgrave in campaigning for such legislation that the provisions of sections 22 and 23 have been introduced in this Bill.  I want to make this offer to the Minister.  If he will bring in a new Bill or another Bill, a short Bill containing sections 22 and 23 of this Bill&mdash;and I am fully authorised by my Party to state this&mdash;my Party are prepared to give him all Stages of such a Bill in one day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,500,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1970, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an ArdChláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous grants and certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate before the House arises from adjustments in <Col N="1651" /> the course of the year in levels of remuneration for certain health authority staffs, including general and psychiatric nurses, as a result of arbitration awards and Labour Court recommendations.</P>
    <P>These awards had retrospective effect in most cases and the expenditure resulting from them in the current year includes a substantial amount of arrears.</P>
    <P>The awards for nurses account for the bulk of the provision mainly by reason of the numbers involved; about 4,500 psychiatric nurses, and 4,300 general and public health nurses benefited from the improved scales.</P>
    <P>The total additional expenditure arising in 1969-70 is estimated at £2,830,000, of which the Vote for my Department will meet just under 56 per cent.  The additional provision now sought is based on this percentage.  The remainder of the additional expenditure, that is approximately 44 per cent of £2,830,000, would, in the normal course, fall to be met from local funds. To a considerable extent, this expenditure would emerge in the form of debit balances in the accounts of health authorities to be carried into the year 1970-71 and to be covered by the rates in that year.  As I have already informed the House, however, I am providing in the grants from the Health Vote for next year a sum of about £2½ million which, with the statutory and existing supplementary grants, will enable the health rate in each area to be maintained at not more than 2/-above the rate for the current year.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to Deputies that the supplementary funds which I am seeking reflect the upward trend in remuneration generally.  In the health services, the remuneration element is of special significance.  As working hours are shortened and rates of pay improved and as the services become more highly developed, this feature becomes more marked.  The services are, of course, by their nature labour-in-tensive, and they are continually becoming more complex as medical science advances.  It must, therefore, be clear that if we are to have the best services that can be provided from our resources the administering authorities <Col N="1652" /> must keep them under constant review so as to make the best possible use of manpower and equipment.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I should explain that in not giving Deputies a wider review of the health services in a token estimate debate, and in not circulating the customary statement of health statistics and information, I am influenced by the fact that comprehensive debates have taken place in the recent past on the Health Act and also that I will be seeking an early debate in the post-Easter Dáil session on the 1970-71 Estimates of my Department.  As Deputies will be aware, expenditure in relation to the new health boards and hospital boards in respect of the period during which they will exist but not be functional is being borne entirely on the Health Vote.  The same applies to the initial expenditure involved in the establishment of a system for paying retail chemists for prescriptions dispensed by them for lower income group patients. These will be novel charges on the Vote and will require approval of the Dáil before expenditure can be incurred. Consequently the Estimate will have to be taken very early in the new financial year, and in advance of its introduction a comprehensive statistical statement will be circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>I want to add in this connection&mdash; perhaps I have not made it sufficiently clear&mdash;that, as we did have very prolonged debates on health last year and the debate on the Health Bill and as the debate on the Estimate will have to take place literally within the first week of Easter in order that I can engage in fresh expenditure arising from the now signed Health Act, I did not really feel that the Deputies would want prolonged debate this evening.  They will have all the information and all the opportunity necessary to debate the health services very shortly after the Easter Recess.  I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary to give me time and I think he will give me time in the first week of the session after Easter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can sympathise with the Minister in his desire that the debate this evening should not be too prolonged because we have had what might be called a surfeit of discussion on <Col N="1653" /> health matters.  We did not always reach agreement and I suppose we seldom if ever will.  We are unlikely to reach agreement this evening on the few matters we will discuss, although there are some on which we may not find any very large area of disagreement.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that needs to be said and the Minister has said it.  It is that this Supplementary Estimate is mainly due to increases in pay for the nursing and medical and other staffs of health authorities.  The fact that it is £1,500,000 is not something about which we should make any complaint because there is no use expressing sympathy with the nurses unless that sympathy is supported with the hard cash necessary to pay them in accordance with their skills and with the dedication and application which they bring to their very onerous duties.</P>
      <P>When I say there is no use in expressing sympathy for nurses without giving the support necessary to translate that sympathy into benefit for nurses I address my remarks not merely to the members of the Government or to all the Members of this House but to the Irish people in general.  They will have to accept that if Ireland is to have the nursing service which it has had in the past it will have to pay Irish nurses in accordance with the standards which their skills and duties deserve.  That is a humanitarian obligation which we must not hesitate to shoulder any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also an economic necessity because if it is not done we will continue to suffer from the considerable drain from this country of qualified nurses and of girls who are about to be qualified as nurses.  We seldom thought that we would see the day when nurses would be in short supply in this country.  I think it was because of the assumption on the part of administrators down through the years that that would never occur that the levels of remuneration and the conditions of employment generally here were very much below what applied in other progressive countries.  That temptation to trim because of the supply of nurses the rewards given to them may have kept down the level of remuneration in the past; but that can <Col N="1654" /> no longer be accepted by even the most niggardly administrator or politician because today nurses will simply not stay in the service of Irish hospitals, voluntary or public, unless the remuneration given to them is at an adequate level.</P>
    <P>It is not, of course, only a question of remuneration which brings 3,000 nurses walking to the gates of Leinster House today.  It is a question of getting reasonable conditions of service, so that they may have some of the enjoyment and the leisure available to people in other walks of life.  It is also a demand that recognition be given to nurses for their qualifications and experience and that we end the system whereby what are termed &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; nurses&mdash;in many cases married nurses&mdash;are obliged to accept remuneration well below the rate commensurate with their qualifications and experience.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in the Department of Education the Minister had to accept that if married teachers were kept out of the teaching service the necessary standards would not be maintained.  There must be a similar and unbegrudging acknowledgment in the Department of Health that all nurses are entitled to remuneration according to their experience and qualifications, irrespective of whether they are classified as temporary or as married.  This requires a break with tradition, a departure from the rules and regulations so much beloved by the bureaucrats, but it must be done. To treat nurses any longer as a class apart is a practice which will have to end once and for all.</P>
    <P>When all other sections of the community are enjoying shorter working hours it is regrettable that nurses are obliged to work long and arduous hours.  The Irish Nurses Organisation have asked that the 40-hour working week be introduced: this is not a revolutionary request but a most reasonable one.  At present this House has before it a proposal from the Department of Labour that the maximum number of hours people be asked to work in any occupation should be 42½ hours.  That standard is not a generous one.  It is regarded as the <Col N="1655" /> very maximum beyond which it would be intolerable to ask people to work, but nurses by the very nature of their duties work under constant and unrelenting pressures to which many people in other walks of life are not subjected.  They must work also at night and they deserve to have reasonably limited hours of work so that they can give of their best.  A tired nurse is unlikely to be a good nurse; she may be giving of her best but when she is tired she cannot be as efficient as she would normally be.</P>
    <P>In the structure of our hospitals, where many are run and owned by religious, opportunities for promotion of experienced lay nurses are very limited and this is causing a considerable amount of disquiet, disappointment and frustration among the nursing profession.  Some years ago it was strongly recommended to the Department that they establish a new career structure so that there would be deputy or junior ward sisters.  This would be of some relief in the present unsatisfactory promotional arrangements but there has been considerable reluctance on the part of the successive Ministers to introduce such a small measure.  I hope, therefore, that the orderly and disciplined protest today on the part of the nurses organisation will have its effect in showing the Minister that the nurses are intent upon getting this and other reasonable reforms.  It must be some consolation to the Minister to know that the demands of the nurses have, so far as I could ascertain, been acceptable to all Members of the House with whom I discussed the matter and I do not think the Minister would have any difficulty in getting from the House the money necessary to give better conditions of service to the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the nursing profession which the Department overlooked is the considerable benefit which could flow to hospitalisation and nursing activities in general if the necessary work study and research were conducted.  Efforts have been made to get the Department to undertake this work but very little has been done, in fact, the Department's main <Col N="1656" /> contribution in this field has been to discourage others from engaging in work study and research.  Ten years ago the International Labour Office pointed out that systematic measures should be taken by the responsible authorities to apply and extend work study, occupational research and job analysis in the nursing field.  This activity has also been strongly recommended by the World Health Organisation. They have stated that research into improvements of nursing care should be promoted as an essential part of the planning of health services and that opportunities should be provided for nurses to be prepared in research methodology through such means as training grants and fellowship studies.</P>
    <P>The present Minister is a man who is inclined to this type of activity and he has pursued it in the other Departments for which he was responsible. One hopes that under his jurisdiction the Department of Health will embark upon an intensive course of work study and research.  This would bring immense benefit to the people we must primarily consider&mdash;the sick and disabled&mdash;but it will also have the attraction of making nursing more personally satisfactory.  There is nothing more frustrating than to be qualified for a particular professional activity and then find you are unable most of the time to apply the skills and learning because you have to perform duties not pertinent to the qualifications you hold.  Many of our nurses have had to pay dearly for learning the skills of their profession and one hopes that the day is not far distant when an Irish hospital will not dare to charge for training pupils nurses.  If we continue on this downward slope we will find ourselves perhaps in the position of the Scandinavian countries and the United States and have to supervise our sick people in hospitals by means of television sets and computers rather than with the human and skilled touch that nurses alone can give.</P>
    <P>The Minister has emphasised that we shall be having a longer debate when we are dealing with the main Estimates after Easter.  Therefore, I do not wish to chase after many other matters that are provoking me but there is a point I recently raised in <Col N="1657" /> the House and one I would emphasise again today.  It is the problem of dermatitis and skin irritations developing from the use of detergents.  The Minister indicated his information was that this was not a considerable problem and he was not inclined to accept my suggestion that there should be very careful tests conducted on all detergents and washing powders before they are made available on the market.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to invite the general public to notify him if they had experienced dermatitis or any other skin complaints as a result of having used these detergents but the Minister said he was afraid to issue such an invitation because it might produce a wrong result.  Apparently, he was not afraid that it might produce a right result. Within the past week or fortnight I, from my inferior position by comparison with the position of the Minister, issued such an invitation and the results have proved worthwhile for me personally and, perhaps, may prove worthwhile for the Minister because I suggested that people might convey their complaints directly to him if they did not wish to convey them to me.  I have already forwarded to the Minister any correspondence that I received up to last Sunday but I can tell the Minister now that I have received twice as much since then.</P>
    <P>The results which I received give a clear indication of the allergies that can be attributed to the use of detergents and this danger appears to be multiplied with the growth of biological or enzyme detergents.  Of course, the Minister gave very good advice to people when he told them to wear gloves or other protective covering on their hands while using these powders but I would urge the Minister to request that this advice be printed on all detergent packets.  This advice will not discourage the use of detergents because people will still be as anxious to keep clean in the future as they have been in the past, but it is a precaution.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the reasons why the Minister and his Department do not know more about this problem is that most people keep it to themselves and hesitate to bring it out into the open.  There have been a few cases <Col N="1658" /> in the civil courts of people who sought damages against the manufacturers of certain detergents or soap powders but they were unsuccessful because of a point of common law which says that if a manufacturer of a product is able to show reasonable care in the production of the product, he is not responsible if somebody suffers as a consequence of having used it.  From my own experience as a solicitor, I can say that many people have consulted their lawyers for the purpose of recovering damages against manufacturers of detergents and soaps but have been advised because of the position of the law that there was no point in taking the case further.  The result of this is that most of these cases do not come to the notice of the Minister or his Department but only come to the notice of general practitioners or, perhaps, specialists in allergies and, occasionally, to the notice of the family lawyer.</P>
    <P>The incidence recently of more powerful detergents which are whiter than white and which eat dirt has, apparently, aggravated this problem. One of the letters which I have received and which I have passed to the Minister was from a lady who had experienced difficulty in the past.  She took the precaution of wearing rubber gloves but latterly she has discovered that the enzymes or biological activity is so powerful that it is causing a disintegration of the protective qualities of the gloves so that her hands are again directly affected.  I have no wish to be an alarmist in this respect and I particularly do not wish to make any accusations about one particular product more than another.  However, I wish to say that the letters I have received have named a multitude of washing powders, soaps and detergents and were not confined to any particular brand.  That should be said in case there might be any general misunderstanding of the position.</P>
    <P>May we express our disappointment that legislation to improve arrangements for the control of drugs and poisons was not introduced during this session of the Dáil which is now coming to a close.  Last year the <Col N="1659" /> Minister promised that we would have such legislation and, therefore, it is very disappointing that it did not come during this session.  A fresh promise was made by the Minister on the 5th February when he said that he would introduce the legislation during the next session.  We are very anxious that he should do so and I can assure him that if his proposals are reasonable and if they are helpful, we, in Fine Gael, will certainly expedite the passage of any such legislation through the House.</P>
    <P>Recently we have had discussion on the considerable shortage of maternity beds on the north side of Dublin city. The Department of Health are moving rather slowly in relation to the provision of maternity beds in the northern region of Dublin.  This is something which does not arise so acutely on the south side of the Liffey, although at times it can present its own problems there, but it is presenting a very severe problem on the north side.  I would urge the Minister to take all steps possible to ensure that there is ample provision of pre-natal, natal and postnatal beds on the north side of the city because it is in this region that the growth centre is at the present time.  If we do not provide the necessary facilities there may be some serious and embarrassing consequences. Any other remarks I wish to make might better be kept until after Easter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>With his short statement, the Minister has, as Deputy Ryan says, determined the kind of debate which we will have here tonight. I have a tremendous amount to say about health in spite of the fact that we had a very recent debate on the subject during the passage of the Health Act, but I accept the Minister's suggestion that on this occasion we should confine ourselves.  It is quite obvious that the only fruitful debate one could have would be a debate after one had heard the Minister's views on the various subjects which I proposed to raise on this Estimate. I fully appreciate that the Minister has just taken over the Department and that, probably, he is only now formulating <Col N="1660" /> his views on the various subjects which I will certainly raise on the Estimate later.  However, in fairness to the Minister perhaps the longer he has to think about the problems facing him in this very important Department, the more valuable will be whatever comments he has to make when he is introducing his main Estimate and the more useful will be our criticims and comments on that Estimate. If I were to continue without first hearing the Minister's views I might find later that I had been taking a line on which the Minister would agree so I shall wait until I hear his speech as I do not wish to unduly waste the time of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister gives me the impression at times that he has become rather impatient of us questioning him in the House on health matters but he has the advantage of having spent all his life in Government whereas I spent virtually all my life in Opposition with the exception of three short years.  The Minister must understand that if we are to contribute usefully to his Department's Estimate we must have reliable information on which to act. It is by listening to what he has to say and inquiring through the medium of Parliamentary questions that we can create our own belief in order to deal with the matters the Minister puts before the House.  This is something which might be obviated by a better secretariat on the part of the Opposition, or some other method, but, for the time being, I hope the Minister will appreciate that all I am trying to do eventually is to make a helpful contribution to his very difficult task in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say at this very early stage that I am impressed with the apparent energy with which he approached his work and any implied criticism is not a criticism of him&mdash;it could not be because he has only taken over&mdash;but a criticism of his predecessor who must, I think, have been the most irresponsibly inept Minister for Health we have ever had.  It is clear from the answers I get to questions that, in a general way, nothing was done about this very important subject of psychiatric <Col N="1661" /> services despite a most comprehensive and valuable report produced as far back as 1966.  The advances have been minimal.  Here, again, of course, I am not blaming the permanent staff of civil servants&mdash;it is not their business to initiate policy: their work is to implement policy&mdash;but I am blaming the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Seán Flanagan, for his failure to discharge his responsibilities during his period in office as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The main subject of debate tonight is the remuneration for certain health authorities' staffs, including general and psychiatric nurses.  The Minister said: &ldquo;...the remuneration element is of special significance.  As working hours are shortened and rates of pay improved and as the services become more highly developed, this feature becomes more marked.&rdquo;  The Minister is without any doubt facing a crisis in practically every aspect of the health services, not alone in the aspect discussed by Deputy Ryan but in all the medical and para-medical services because of the tremendous shortage of staffs of all kinds, but particularly nursing staff.</P>
    <P>I think only those with a real vocation go into nursing.  The hours are appalling.  The work is very demanding, very responsible and frequently very distasteful, physically and emotionally, making enormous demands. The training is hard.  I cannot pretend that this is the first time I have concerned myself about the welfare of the nursing profession.  The first ever struggle I engaged in was on behalf of the nurses many, many years ago.  As one who has had a fair share of ill-health. I have a particularly high regard for the nursing profession and I sincerely hope the Minister will look into the whole establishment of the nursing services as a matter of grave urgency.  The impression I have is that girls are driven out of nursing.  They are certainly discouraged from going into nursing.  The conditions under which they train are reminiscent of the Victorian presumption that the youngster is a juvenile delinquent and must be treated as such.  The discipline is out of date.  This is damaging because <Col N="1662" /> it discourages girls from going into nursing.  The young girl who comes to town and works as a shorthand-typist in the Civil Service, or elsewhere, can live her own life.  There is this <i>&ldquo;in loco parentis</i>&rdquo; to justify the Victorian discipline in so many of our nursing homes but girls do not have to put up with that kind of thing any more.</P>
    <P>Fewer girls are going into nursing and one of the things which will alter even the present poor intake into the nursing profession will be free secondary education.  Despite what Deputy Ryan said, there is access to the profession without a fee.  If one goes to Britain one can qualify as a nurse reasonably easy.  With free secondary education girls in future will go into other forms of employment and there will be a serious shortage of nursing staff.  That is already developing.  There was a serious shortage in Britain about 20 years ago and now the whole attitude in Britain in the training hospitals is completely different.  That was not engendered because the hospitals became more enlightened; it was engendered because they realised that the methods they were using were discouraging girls from going into nursing. Conditions have altered considerably. Today nurses in Britain can lead normal social lives.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the attraction of Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Australia.  Anywhere in the English speaking world nurses are gladly received and very well paid. The Minister is competing against that. Nurses are going abroad in their hundreds.  I do not know how or where the Minister will find the money he will need to improve the living conditions here for our nurses, to shorten their working hours and increase their pay.  He will have to compete with the enormous salaries they can command abroad.  I do not think nurses in Britain are as well paid as they should be but the recent 20 per cent increase there will be a powerful magnet drawing off nurses from this country, thereby increasing the Minister's many difficulties.</P>
    <P>He is in a dilemma because, of course, he, in fact, does not control voluntary hospitals.  I do not know <Col N="1663" /> what he is going to do about this.  It is a problem.  He will hear about it on the Estimate.  We have got to face this merger of the local authority and the voluntary hospitals.  How far will the Minister go?  How far will he carry it? The local authority hospital is now in most cases providing just as good service as the voluntary hospital.  The old day when the voluntary hospital predominated and provided a magnificent service, and the only magnificent service, has gone.  In the last 50 years whatever defects there are in the public health service, there has been a great improvement in many of the country hospitals, the regional hospitals, in the provision of the peripatetic specialists, radiologists, gynaecologists and so on. So, we can now say we are providing just as good a service as the great old private hospitals, St. Vincent's the Mater, Dun's, the Adelaide, and so on.</P>
    <P>The voluntary idea is completely gone.  The Minister pays their deficits from hospital funds or through taxation or rates.  The central authority is now really paying for these services. How far will the Minister go?  Will he say: &ldquo;I am paying for the services.  I must now be permitted to lay down certain conditions under which my employees will be employed&rdquo;?  I remember away back coming to that realisation of how little power I had as Minister for Health when I was told that I could not send an inspector into a voluntary hospital, except as a matter of courtesy, in regard to something that had happened and that needed to be investigated.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister going to try to impose what he considers are enlightened views where these enlightened views are needed?  There are a number of voluntary hospitals which have very good nurses' homes and very good attitudes to their nurses.  They are not all the same.  Some are better than others.  Is the Minister going to attempt to impose any kind of uniformity so that they do not continue with their outmoded practices and in that way discourage young people from coming into the nursing profession?  This is a very delicate problem, one with regard to which I got very badly hurt many <Col N="1664" /> years ago in my attempt to create the right of the lay nurse to move up the line in a hospital run by a religious order.  I was, of course, accused of try-being a communist and accused of trying to drive religious orders out of Ireland, and so on.  The Minister will be in much the same dilemma if he attempts to&mdash;&ldquo;interfere&rdquo; is the word, I suppose&mdash;to change this in any way but they are the majority of the training schools.  He will have to do something, whether he can do it through An Bord Altranais, whether he sets up a separate college of nursing, whether he gets them in and asks them to face his dilemma in trying to keep the public health services staffed as they expand, as they are expanding continually and will greatly expand under the Act next year, whether he gets them in and asks them to realise that they must provide incentives for youngsters to go into the nursing profession rather than continue the many serious disincentives which exist in many cases.</P>
    <P>The only reason a young Irish girl really goes into one of our training schools now is that her mother will not allow her to go to England.  It is virtually true to say that.  It is understandable. Most parents would prefer that their child could be trained here. Equally, there is the point referred to by Deputy Ryan of the fee-paying, which is abused.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious problem.  The Minister would be well advised to go into it as rapidly as he can, as soon as he can.  On his Estimate I will deal with the other matter of the relationship on the doctors' side &mdash;that is another very important question&mdash;the whole system of appointments to the voluntary hospitals to carry out services paid for by Local authorities; the need for the Local Appointments Commission rather than a continuation of an appointments system which we believe is not as efficient.  With all its defects, and the Local Appointments Commission has many defects, it has the reputation of integrity.  It is a system which has been accepted by everybody for a very long time.  It can be improved. This is another very difficult problem <Col N="1665" /> with which the Minister will have to deal.  It would be wrong of him not to face up to it.  The voluntary hospitals will have to be told by the Minister: &ldquo;I have to provide a certain quality of service, whether it is a nursing service, a medical service or a paramedical service.  I must be certain that I am getting the quality that I am paying for and I can only be sure of that if I have a system of appointment which I can trust&rdquo;.  I shall take that matter up later on in greater detail.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to hear today that the Minister is doing something about the question of conciliation and arbitration for local authority employees.  He did not have the time.  It is some years since this question of changing the structure, remuneration, conditions of service, and so on, was first entered into and the managers had simply done nothing about it until relatively recently when, it appears to me at any rate, the Minister intervened effectively and with his colleagues is now going to provide some sort of central organisation which will facilitate and expedite the activities of this whole machinery of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>Delay in the consideration of salary and pay increase of one kind and another is one of the things which have led to the very serious difficulties the Minister is facing in posts like occupational therapists, psychiatric social workers, psychologists and to this problem that he has in the psychiatric service where has has so many temporary employees, and so on.  All of these things stem from this basic problem of conditions of service, hours of work and remuneration and, in the matter with which we are dealing now, he is faced with competition from very wealthy countries who can offer twice and three times as much as anything he is offering at the present time to most of these types of people. Therefore, the Minister should not underestimate the enormous complexity of the job that is facing him if he wants to provide a proper health service and to provide the staff with which to run it.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister come to any decision <Col N="1666" /> about the demand for a 40-hour week which the girls are making?  It seems to me to be a reasonable demand. When I was in the Government I was amused on an occasion when the hours of work of the judiciary were being fixed.  They were miniscule.  I think two or three hours were the maximum because after that they got tired or felt they were not discharging their functions as efficiently as they should.  It certainly was the tiniest output of work or labour one could ever conceive.</P>
    <P>This applies very much to the nursing profession.  Regard should be had to the fact that the work is so responsible and so demanding, that it requires such a higher and higher level of technical skill and knowledge, and that shorter hours of work will lead to a better nurse and a better nurse will lead, of course, to a better service. The Minister has asked for money for the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little that I can add to what has already been said by the two previous speakers.  I want to join with them in paying tribute to the dedicated service given by nurses over the years.  I do not think we have to impress this on the Minister. We do not have to impress on him either that if we are to continue to get this service we will have to pay <Col N="1667" /> for it.  As Deputy Dr. Browne has just said, if we do not improve conditions and salaries we just will not get the staff required in the hospitals.</P>
      <P>At present there is quite an acute shortage of nurses in the various hospitals all over the country.  There are some hospitals here and there that feel happy enough about the situation, but there are many hospitals that are very much under-staffed, very much under strength, and this places quite considerable extra strain on the reduced number of nurses.  Unfortunately there is nothing much that the people in the hospitals can do about this except to call on the reduced number of nurses to put in that extra effort and do the best they can to look after the patients.</P>
      <P>There are one or two small items I should like to draw to the attention of the Minister.  Deputy Ryan drew his attention to the unrest in the nursing profession that has been manifested this evening by the large number of nurses who marched from Parnell Square to Leinster House.  He described this as a protest.  It is not exactly a fair way to describe it.  Nurses are not given to protesting in that way because the last thing they want to do at any time is to leave the job, so to speak, or upset the patients or anything like that. They are endeavouring in this way&mdash; it is one of the ways nowadays by which attention can be drawn to what can be described as grievances&mdash;to draw attention to the fact that for some considerable time they have been making a case for certain improvements and apparently these requests for consideration have not been taken too seriously, or certainly not taken as seriously as they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of a 40-hour week.  At present they work a 42½-hour week.  There are many hospitals and institutions in which nurses are really being called upon to do much more than this.  They feel they cannot walk out in circumstances in which nurses are in short supply.  One of the matters raised with me on numerous occassions in that nurses here, like everybody else, should be entitled to be paid overtime for work in excess of the <Col N="1668" /> normal working hours.  Because of the shortage of nurses there are many occassions on which they would not object to working these extra hours if they were paid for them as they should be, and as people in all other walks of life have to be paid.  It is no harm to draw the attention of the Minister to this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned that something was being done to improve the system of arbitration and conciliation. I take it he was referring to the circular sent out by the Minister for Local Government in which he says he is setting up a secretariat&mdash;I think it is best described in this way&mdash;to deal with claims coming from the local authorities to the Department, and coming to the various Departments and also going to the Labour Court.  It is essential to do this because it is not easy for people on a voluntary basis nowadays to prepare their cases as they should be prepared, and must be prepared if there is to be any hope of success unless this sort of machinery is in existence.</P>
    <P>There is a serious flaw in the proposal and that is that the Minister for Local Government will select and appoint the members of this organisation or the staff of this organisation. I do not know which he would like to call it.  The Minister will appoint the people who will make the case to fight for better conditions from him. The Minister for Health will see in this something that would give rise to suspicion and, if a claim were not successful or was only partly successful, a feeling that their case was made by the Minister's own friends and they were let down.  I would ask the Minister to have a word with his colleague before this is pursued to the point of setting up an unsatisfactory secretariat or machine for the processing of applications for improved pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>In connection with the unrest referred to this evening it might be no harm to draw the attention of the Minister to one aspect of it.  The present position is&mdash;and this is agreed by the Irish Nurses' Organisation&mdash; that promotional outlets are filled by open advertisement, so to speak, and <Col N="1669" /> all are free to compete.  They want that procedure to continue but, at the same time, they want the positions to be advertised for particular hospitals or institutions.  That is being done. What they are dissatisfied about is that when a health authority advertise and the interview board is set up, the members of that board are entirely selected from the health authority concerned and there are no outsiders on it.  The nursing organisation would be much happier if several members of the board were selected from outside, from the voluntary hospitals perhaps, qualified people but not members of the particular health authority.  There is a feeling of possible partiality.</P>
    <P>Another thing nurses complain about is the system of marking.  Where you have nurses working for a considerable time as geriatric nurses a very strong feeling exists that they are marked down because of this and that where there is promotion in a hospital marking should be weighted in favour of geriatric nursing.  In the particular hospital which has given rise to the present unrest the feeling is that this was not done, that there was not sufficient recognition of this fact in this specialised chest hospital.</P>
    <P>Small improvements of this kind could lead to much more satisfaction. The whole thing could be smoothed out easily.  If only because of the acute nursing shortage, it is essential that the pay and conditions, the promotion system and the career structure of nurses, should get the closest examination at the earliest possible date by the Department and by all the people concerned with ensuring that there will be an adequate supply of nurses in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the constructive character of their remarks.  I am glad they co-operated with me, knowing there is to be a longer debate after Easter.  I want to say, first of all in relation to the big procession that took place today, that I got information of this only 24 hours ago and therefore I could not possibly have examined all the matters that were <Col N="1670" /> referred to.  There is normal machinery for negotiation between the managers and the nursing organisation on these matters.  At the same time I am always willing to see the Irish Nurses' Organisation if they want to talk about major problems in relation to nurses. I intend to see them later and to study the various proposals they have made. I also intend to examine a report from the Dublin Health Authority.  An Bord Altranais are examining the various questions in relation to the vocation of nursing in this country. They have a number of matters under review.  I will be talking to them in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputies in praising the splendid vocation of nursing.  I am very glad nurses have been able to improve their position in the past few years and I will always be willing to examine sympathetically any claims they may have.  The question is: at what rate can progress take place in relation to the total cost of the health services? We always have to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister for Health I was glad to notice that nurses had been able to secure some considerable improvements in their remuneration and conditions during the past few years.  Prior to the last British award, the maximum of the nurses' scale in Great Britain was marginally lower than here but in Britain the scale of increments was shorter than here.  So until the recent British award the actual pay of nurses there bore some reasonable relationship to the pay of British nurses.  In recent years the 90-hour fortnight has been reduced to 85 hours.  Nurses in geriatrics get special allowances and TB nurses receive £40 a year additional to the scale.  This applies also to theatre nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to remuneration, some considerable progress has been made. The maximum of the general nursing scale, including long-term increments, has been increased in the past two years from £879 to £1,120, an increase of £241 in one year, or 27 per cent, apart from special payments for geriatrics and other special services. Nobody can say that there has not been considerable improvement.  Nurses <Col N="1671" /> have been able to secure an increase in remuneration which would be greater than average in the community. I agree that the increase at the lower end of the scale was less, but at entrance it was 20 per cent. I am always willing to take sympathetic action towards claims of this kind which I think are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne likes to speak very forcefully and I know many of the problems he raised will be with us, but I do not think it is true to say that girls are being discouraged from going into nursing here.  Our nursing schools have far more applicants than they can accept.  Nursing has been part of our tradition here.  It is true to say that conditions of student nurses may not be by any means perfect but neither are they by any means what they were up to a few years ago. Some of the restrictions on student nurses have been relaxed.  What more can be done I do not know because I have no control over the voluntary hospitals.  However, the attitude towards student nurses is more liberal than it was a few years ago.  A great many second and third year student nurses now live out altogether.  I cannot agree with Deputy Browne that nurses who train here do so because of their mothers' influence.  That is an exaggeration. A great many of them train here because they want to be in this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to whatever we can do for professional staff, people engaged in nursing and medicine, quite obviously there must be some comparison between the amounts paid in neighbouring countries such as Great Britain and here, even though we have only half the income per head of the British people; but we never can compete with American salaries and scales.  No matter how much we can improve the salaries for the medical and nursing professions, in the end we will have to rely on the hope that with reasonably good conditions there will be a great many Irish people who will want to live in this country, even though perhaps the opportunities for promotion and the rates of pay are not likely to <Col N="1672" /> reach the level they have in certain other countries.  Industry is growing, The economic growth of the country is continuing.  No doubt we shall be able to afford more remuneration as the years go by.  I think it is true to say that even at this moment there is a very large number of people who would not for any reason leave this country but who, if they did leave it, would get better opportunities for promotion and higher salaries than they can get here.  While we want to go on improving these conditions we must bear these facts in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton spoke about their being a shortage of nurses.  The evidence in my Department is that the shortages of nurses can be found in the hospitals in certain areas but there is no acute shortage of nurses in the generality of hospitals, taking the State as a whole, I am glad to say, although I recognise we have to look at the position very carefully and bear in mind the present position of the nursing profession.  Perhaps Deputy Ryan does not know that recently there was sanction for the payment of increments up to five years to married nurses joining the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>At least it is an improvement. One cannot do everything at once.  I was very glad to see that, because I think married nurses should be able to make the same kind of progress as other nurses when they join hospital staffs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan also referred to the necessity for work study.  I absolutely agree with him, and I have instructed the secretary to set up a work study unit in my Department.  We have to have an officer trained in that work. The object is to try and reduce administration costs and increase the efficiency of work in hospitals.  It is not a question of asking people to work in a more exhausting way but of having more work done more effectively without undue effort.  That, of course, is the purpose of all good work study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton made a number of points in regard to the method of appointment of ward sisters in one of <Col N="1673" /> the Dublin Health Authority hospitals. All the matters he mentions can obviously be discussed: the question of whether there should be some outside members on he board; the question of whether the marking for geriatric and chest hospital nursing experience is something which should be revised.  I am quite willing to receive the nurses' organisation to hear their point of view. At the same time, I would hope the Dublin Health Authority and the nurses' organisation can engage in fruitful negotiations on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has not concluded his total examination of the question of the new arbitration and conciliation machinery.  I think he is aware of the various points of view of the organisations concerned, but he has not made any final decision about it.</P>
    <P>In regard to detergents, I doubt if we have the legal power to compel manufacturers to print a notice on detergent packets advising people to wear rubber gloves.  From what I know of many friends of mine, they are already perfectly aware that they must use gloves.  Many people are allergic to these detergents, but Deputy Ryan seems to think there should be more publicity about it.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards indicates that all reputable manufacturers should, in their own interest, test their products adequately before putting them on the market.  Otherwise they might find themselves sued for damages in civil actions.  Deputy Ryan has mentioned what might happen in that case.  Perhaps warning notices should appear on the packet advising users to rinse their hands after use at least or else to use gloves.  Modern detergents seem to be effective and the use of gloves seems to prevent dermatitis from taking place.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I need say at this stage.  There will be very adequate notes prepared for the House on the Estimate with a great deal of statistical matter which I hope will prove helpful.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Browne, I do not really object to questions being asked but they have been enormously numerous. <Col N="1674" /> I could not help feeling that some of them perhaps were matters that could have been raised on the Estimate. Nevertheless, it is quite evident that the answers to these questions have given Deputies quite a compendium of information in advance of the Estimate.  Therefore, if it enables Deputies to discuss the Estimate more constructively, I am delighted that these questions have been asked.  As I say, they have been overwhelming in number and it takes up the time of the staff to a considerable extent.  We are very pressed for time in order to see that the Health Bill comes into operation by 1st April, 1971.  I am very glad in so far as the answers to a great many questions did reveal in advance of the Estimate a good deal of the policy advocated by myself and by my predecessor for an improvement in the health services.  They also revealed a number of the problems we have to face.</P>
    <P>Once more may I say I am always willing to examine any problem put before me by any organisation representing the staffs engaged in health services. At the same time, I do believe very strongly that, in the interests of the trade unions and the organisations themselves, the normal means for negotiation should be utilised to the fullest in order that the nurses' organisation and other organisations can work most effectively, in order that they can have meaningful negotiations with the health authorities themselves. A balance must be maintained in relation to this and I think my predecessors have found that it was best to ensure that the normal negotiations continued. On a good number of occasions they have made it clear they would be glad to accept certain proposals that were put forward; in other cases they thought it wiser to wait until the proposals were authorised by the negotiating authorities.  There has been a continuous pattern of this kind.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, there have been tremendous increases in remuneration over the past three or four years in quite a number of segments of the health services, and we have to think about this in an intelligent way.  We must do the best we can for the <Col N="1675" /> improvement of services while, at the same time, bearing in mind the effect of such improvements on the cost of living and on the capacity of people to bear the extra taxation involved.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1970, for the expenses of the maintenance, etc., of patients in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
      <P>The additional grant to meet the running expenses of the Central Mental Hospital in the year ending 31st March, 1970, is due almost entirely to a sharp increase in the patient population which over the year will now show a daily average of around 135 as against an original anticipated daily average of 115.  The various costings upon which the original estimates were based related to that figure.  It will be readily appreciated, therefore, that the cost of providing foodstuffs, clothing, medicines and the special staffing arrangements which are necessary and incidental to the running of a hospital of this kind will now be more than was provided in the original Estimate. The total extra grant required is £6,500 bringing the provision for the hospital for the year 1969-70 to £103,000.</P>

      <P>My remarks on this Supplementary Estimate are mainly investigatory.  I was going to ask the <Col N="1676" /> question which Deputy Dr. Browne asked but as that was answered I want to say that we appear to be reaching a dangerous level when we are at almost maximum occupation.  What is the average cost of maintaining a patient in the Central Mental Hospital? I want to compare it with the utterly inadequate average allowance of £4 per week paid to voluntary institutions maintaining mentally handicapped persons and the allowance of £4 a week which is sometimes given in respect of people who are mentally handicapped but living outside.  I would expect that the figure which the Minister is obliged to pay to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum is probably in the region of £10 per week per head, certainly a great deal more than is provided outside. It is because of the utterly inadequate allowances paid outside institutions that we have such calls on institutional care from time to time. Has the Minister in mind any plan to increase the accommodation in the Central Mental Hospital?</P>

      <P>I understand from the Minister he has not.  There is an immense capital programme ahead of the Department of Health and really I think, with genuine sincerity, I can say that the Minister has not yet given to the House any really solid indication as to what steps will be taken to provide the capital.  It would want to be a good deal more than what was estimated in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Expansion.  My reckoning of the situation is that the amount required is three times greater than that allowed for in the Third Programme.  If, for instance, the suggestions in the FitzGerald Report are to be implemented, and no regard has been paid to this, an immense building programme, must be embarked on in relation to mental care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear that the number of people in the Central Mental Hospital is so high. I understood that it tended to drop over the years.  I am interested in the matter because I think I was responsible for changing the name of this <Col N="1677" /> place from the Criminal Lunatic Asylum to the Central Mental Hospital. My attitude was to regard the person called a criminal as a sick person requiring care in a hospital and, therefore. I felt this was the more appropriate designation for the place.  Obviously, that is a point about which there could be great argument and I do not want to go into it now.</P>
      <P>If the hospital is so fully occupied with a complement of 135, how does that fit in with the recommendations of the commission in regard to its use for the different kinds of person we cannot carry in the general psychiatric hospital, particularly the aggressive psychopath, the non-aggressive psychopath, the drug addict, the alcoholic, and the very difficult people to handle, the homicidal type of seriously ill person? Whatever may be said about the adult psychiatric problem&mdash;and I hope to say a lot more about it on the Estimate &mdash;at least there are facilities of a kind available varying in degree from very good in a few places to very bad in others, but the problem of the use of the Central Mental Hospital as a high security unit for the care of the young psychopath, the juvenile delinquent, the difficult young adolescent is a very difficult one.  The Minister may recall I asked a question about the appointment of a director to take over this whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probation officers, the Garda, the judiciary, the legal profession and clergymen do their best to deal with the problem but nobody seems to have found any solution at all in regard to the difficult adolescent, the juvenile delinquent, the young criminal psychopath or whatever name you put on him.  This is a matter of very grave urgency.  Everybody passes them on. The courts send them to us.  We send them to St. Patrick's.  They then send them out to an establishment on the Bray Road and they probably end up in Mountjoy.  Mainly we tend to pass them from one to the other and nobody is really treating this problem at all.  We hoped some action would be taken to convert this hospital into an establishment for the care of this kind of patient.  That is why I feel there is a great urgency about this question <Col N="1678" /> of the appointment of a director of forensic psychiatry.</P>
    <P>The Minister may remember I asked him about this.  I happen to know that the person they have in mind is a particularly talented person, a particularly suitable person.  Most of us in ordinary general psychiatry are more than anxious that a person of this calibre should come into the service in Dublin and take over this whole question of the difficult problem of the adolescent who finds himself in trouble with the courts and the police.  At the moment such a person is really getting no treatment at all.  We also hoped that this centre could be used for research into this terrible problem in respect of which no psychiatrist will say he has the answer.  I think there is one in Copenhagen, Denmark, that goes nearer to trying to deal with this problem, but most people are prepared to admit there is very little which can be done for a number of those people.  Something can be done for some of them but very little for many of them.  There is an urgent need for the establishment of this unit.  I think the Minister knows that the recommendation was that it should be based on the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.</P>
    <P>That will require a great increase in the staff.  This highly skilled staff are very difficult to find.  In the whole sphere of medicine there is no one more difficult to treat, with the exception possibly of the drug addict, than the young psychopath.  Most people are prepared to concede that point, both from the medical and nursing point of view.  I do not know whether the Minister has had time to consider this problem.  I can assure him it is a problem of great urgency.  If possible the Minister should try to secure the high-quality type of individual whom I believe is available.  The Minister should do everything in his power to get such people in order that a service could be established for these very pathetic, sad youngsters.  They create great anger among the public and the community generally when they go around smashing things and sticking knives in one another or taking drugs <Col N="1679" /> and indulging in various sexual perversions or alcoholism.  They make the community very angry indeed.  That is one of the problems in treating them. Even a trained therapist finds it difficult not to get angry with them.  These patients are essentially very pathetic people who need help very badly.  We do not give them such help.  There is no separate service for them in Dublin. We lock them up in St. Patrick's, in Mountjoy or in the new establishment on the Bray Road.  We have not provided a service or the personnel to deal with them.  I would be glad to know what the Minister has in mind in this regard.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that many people have come to us asking for help.  They have come from all sectors of society&mdash;the Judiciary, the Garda and the other groups previously mentioned. The general psychiatrists are most anxious to have this matter dealt with most urgently.  These young people tend to drug addiction, alcoholism, male prostitution and criminality of one kind or another.  The position with regard to the young girls is similar.  It is sad and tragic.  I would be very grateful to the Minister if he would look into this matter.  There is no problem about which we, in the general psychiatric service, feel more impotent.  I have raised it now because the Vote is in respect of this particular hospital which I understand to be the base.  There is great need for skilled psychiatric and social workers of various kinds.  Above all, there is need for a key individual to set up this service to deal with this very serious problem in Dublin.  We tend to ignore the existence of the problem.  The Minister would be greatly shocked if he knew the number of youngsters who require help of a very highly-skilled type.  We are not giving them such help. Because we fail to give them help they go from bad to worse and end up as recidivists, continually returning to prison.  They become the enemies of society&mdash;society hating them and they hating society.  We have no objection to the Estimate.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister, in replying, would tell the House <Col N="1680" /> whether the increase in patient population in this institution is, to some extent at least, due to the fact that certain types of drug addicts are now being treated or cared for in this institution and whether this relieves another institution which looked after this type of patient previously.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Clinton, I would say that very few persons are in the Central Mental Hospital because of drug addiction.  They would not account for the increase.  I understand the increase is due to the fact that more attention is drawn in the courts to the element of insanity.  That would be the main reason.  The people in the Central Mental Hospital are those who are placed in custody and certified as of unsound mind, those who are on remand and are awaiting trial, those who are undergoing sentence either in a local or convict prison or on conviction in St. Patrick's or in an Army detention barracks, those who are either awaiting the pleasure of the Government having been found insane by a jury on arraignment, or awaiting the pleasure of the Government having been found guilty but insane by a jury, or people sent there under section 207 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  Those are the classes of persons in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Dr. Browne, I must say I have not made a particular study yet or secured advice on the position of the psychopath.  My first efforts are where there is a shortage of psychiatrists to take an interest in those parts of the mental illness report which relate to reducing the number of patients in the mental hospitals and to improving conditions there.  A first priority with me is the establishment of short-stay psychiatric units in general hospitals and in trying, so far as possible, to have much more co-ordination between the general hospitals and the mental hospitals.  This is being done.  I wish to improve the general therapy applied to those who are mentally ill in the mental hospitals and to develop domiciliary care for mentally-ill persons and their treatment by the day, where possible.  I am interested in the training of psychiatric nurses who would go out into the country and <Col N="1681" /> cities and visit psychiatric patients to try to help them in their homes and to see that they take whatever medicines are prescribed for them.  These are the first priorities as I see them.</P>
    <P>I have not studied the position of the psychopath.  I understand there are different theories about the nature of his malady.  I understand it has been found recently that on applying an encephalogram to many of these psychiatric patients the wave pattern showed peculiar and unique features.  I understand in certain types of criminals it has now been found that they have an additional X-chromosome in the nucleus.  There are many things being discovered about these patients.  I have not yet had an opportunity of undertaking a serious study of the matter.  I have no doubt that when the Central Mental Hospital is absorbed and administered by the Eastern Health Board it will be regarded as part of the mental hospitals of that board and that it will then be possible to give more attention to the matter Deputy Dr. Browne has mentioned.</P>
    <P>I agree that these people are most pathetic and desperately need help.  I think the Deputy will agree with me that I have read enough about the experiments that are being tried and in so many cases we find people who were apparently cured regress even under the best circumstances.  I do not pretend to be even in part expert in this matter.  I have not studied all the material available on this subject and all I can say is that the subject has my sympathy.  I have given to the House what I regard as the more attainable priorities and even there we face shortages of staff.  This will be a serious matter in the future.  I do not think that any country in the world has realised that in another ten years there will be more and more a feeling that two-thirds of the medical problem will become a mental problem.  Perhaps I am exaggerating but I am beginning to have the grim feeling that this will be true and that there are not half enough people trained to face that appalling reality.  I refer to the growing number of people in an affluent world and with good conditions, quite apart from the underprivileged, <Col N="1682" /> who appear utterly unable to face the stresses of life without psychiatric help and who are more and more disturbed by difficulties they have to face in life which were not regarded as peculiar or extraordinary ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go further into this argument and I think everybody knows what I mean.  I happened to read a report by Professor Derek Dunlop in the Royal College of Surgeons publication, in the last number, in which he said that 45 million prescriptions for sleeping pills, antidepressant pills and tranquilliser pills were supplied to the British people in 1968 and that he reckons that one out of every ten hours of sleep in England was under hypnotic influence.  That indicates the kind of problem I have in mind when I speak of the growth of interest in the mental side of medicine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,644,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1970, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of a grant in aid.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the main Defence Estimate for the present financial year was, in common with a number of others, passed without debate shortly before last Christmas. The sum for which that Estimate provided&mdash;£12,852,000&mdash;has already been spent and I am now coming to the House for this additional sum of £1,644,000 by way of Supplementary Estimate, necessitated principally by the second phase of the eleventh round pay increase and by recent events in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not elaborate on the eleventh <Col N="1683" /> round pay increase which was common to the public sector generally.  The House has already debated the events in the Six Counties, but it is appropriate for me to refer to the tasks allotted to the Defence Forces in caring for those who came here from that area for refuge.</P>
    <P>Within twenty-four hours of the Government's decision to establish field hospitals and refugee centres, five field hospitals and two refugee centres were established and operating.  About a month later a further refugee centre was opened.  In the weeks immediately following their establishment many casualties were treated in the field hospitals.  The peak occupancy of the three refugee centres was reached on the 23rd August last when a total of 720 refugees were being cared for. About 640 of these were women and children.  The number is now down to 54, all housed at Gormanston Camp.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are co-operating with the Garda Síochána in protecting certain installations of national importance.  Selected members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil have also been asked to undertake brief tours of military duty at week-ends and during courses of training.</P>
    <P>The permanent Defence Force responded magnificently to the demands made on it during this very difficult period.  It is gratifying, too, that there was such a ready response to the call-out of the First Line Reserve last August.  The number of its members on full-time service has, of course, been reduced considerably since then.  It is also a source of satisfaction that so many members of the FCA have attained such a degree of efficiency that they have been regarded as fit to stand in for duties ordinarily carried out by the permanent Defence Force.  I think that the country has reason to be grateful to the members of all the components of the Defence Forces at all levels.</P>
    <P>The whole operation has been a costly one and is one of the major factors responsible for the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>In the main Estimate provision was <Col N="1684" /> made only up to June for the allowances payable in respect of service with the United Nations peace-keeping force in Cyprus.  The Supplementary Estimate includes a sum to cover the balance of the year during which units have been maintained in Cyprus.  The 13th Infantry Group, 420 men of all ranks, has been there since last September. As well, 20 Irish officers are serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East.  In all theatres of operation the Irish officers and men continue to maintain a high reputation for the manner in which they perform their duties.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also provides for an additional sum of £20,000 for the Irish Red Cross Society to ensure that the society will have sufficient funds to continue its existing relief commitments in Nigeria.  Substantial contributions in supplies and money have been made and medical personnel are still being maintained within Nigeria.</P>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross personnel have earned a reputation for hard work and the thanks of all members of the House are due to them and to all who support the Society in its relief efforts.</P>
    <P>Under subhead Z, appropriation-in-aid, Deputies will notice a deficiency in receipts from United Nations of £263,000.  That does not mean that we are not going to get this money.  There is just a doubt that it will arrive before the end of the financial year.  If it does come before the end of the financial year, well and good.</P>
    <P>There is also a Supplementary Estimate for the sum of £10,000 in respect of Army Pensions before the House. The original Estimate of £3,112,500 was voted without debate before Christmas as also was a Supplementary Estimate of £17,500.  Pensions expenditure is generally calculated rather tightly for Estimates purposes. There is just a possibility, at this present point of time, that expenditure for 1969-70 will slightly exceed the amount already voted.  That is why I am taking the precaution of asking the House for this additional £10,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>These Supplementary Estimates add up to a fairly substantial sum and they are spread out over most of the activities of the Department of Defence.  In this way I suppose they could open up a fairly wide-ranging debate involving most of the Department but, since the Estimate discussion is still to come and since most of the money required here is for salaries and pensions and other allowances, I do not think there is any point in having a prolonged discussion. If we are to have an Army we must pay them and we should pay them well.  As well as that we should make adequate provision against illness and accident.  This is the least that should be expected from us.  The money now sought is sought mainly for this purpose, speaking very generally.</P>
      <P>It is right to say that all of us are proud of the men who serve in the forces, in all ranks and at all levels, both at home and on peace-keeping duties overseas.  Our people overseas have at all times given a particularly good account of themselves.  While saying that, it is also fair to say that one finds a fairly widespread attitude &mdash;and something should be done about this&mdash;that money spent on defence is money down the drain.  A good deal needs to be done to dispel this attitude and one of the things that is essential is that the Army should be more closely integrated in the whole fabric of our society.  If we are to have an appreciation of the men in the Army, especially in peace time, they must be seen to be assisting more in social and economic development.  If people do not see some sort of direct return in goods or services they are inclined to say: &ldquo;What is this all about?&rdquo; and they are reluctant to pay for it.  If the Army were playing the part that I believe they could play in society in peace time there would be a more sincere appreciation of the worth of the Army.  I know that this is a policy matter and more appropriate to the Estimate as a whole. Perhaps when we come to that we could develop this aspect of defence policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the year I asked a number <Col N="1686" /> of questions and I am surprised that the Minister did not make any comment on them this evening.  I asked questions for instance about when there had been any adjustment in the grants to the front line or to the FCA. The replies indicated that no adjustments have taken place for a very long time.  Last week I asked a question about overseas allowances and the reply indicated that there has been no adjustment there in the past ten years. There seems to me to be no justification for this.  I was extremely surprised at the Minister's attitude.  He seemed to think that these allowances were adequate and that there was no need whatever for him to take steps to have them improved.  The cost of living has rocketed for everyone and it continues to rise.  This should be recognised in the case of the Army just as it has had to be recognised in every other Department of State.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which there is some complaint is that when married men are transferred there is no compensation. In many other fields of employment, which I do not want to discuss in detail, there is compensation for this kind of disturbance.  There should be something on this line in the Army.  If a married man has to take up his roots and go to a different part of the country it costs him money.  I know his furniture is removed but he will be involved in a change of house and there will be general disturbance. Perhaps it will mean taking members of his family away or putting them into schools.  There is a variety of expenses at a time like this and there should be some recognition of this.</P>
    <P>I understand there are gratuities for commissioned officers but there are no gratuities for NCOs and other ranks. This has been a matter for complaint for a considerable number of years. There has been a good deal of agitation to get this position improved and if a start could be made, even in a very small way, if the right was recognised even in a small way, these ranks would be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Living conditions in the Army are not good and a good deal could be done to improve them and to improve <Col N="1687" /> married quarters.  There is a great shortage of married quarters.  There is also the great difficulty that when a man has served in the Army for a long time nobody wants to house him. I raised this matter on the Estimate for Local Government and I suggested that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Defence should get together on this.  It is a great slight on people who have served the country for many years that when they leave the Army nobody wants to house them.  There seems to be some sort of argument here.  I know that the subsidy given for the housing of Army people was not as large as the subsidy given for housing other people in overcrowded conditions.  For this reason local authorities did not want to house these people.  I hope the Minister for Defence will take this up with the Minister for Local Government and try to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with Army pension schemes and, therefore, I am not in a position to say whether they are adequate or not but I have recently seen a great deal of criticism of pensions of Army widows which it is said, are not comparable with the pensions of Civil Service and other widows.  I should like the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <P>Quite a substantial part of this Supplementary Estimate relates to the recent troubles in the north of Ireland. It is fair to say that one could question the various moves that were taken by the Government at that time.  It would be very easy to criticise the Government and to criticise the Minister for Defence for moving troops to the Border and setting up first aid centres. However, I am not in a position to say that that move or the decisions made by the Government were wrong decisions at that time.  Neither am I in a position to say what we would have done if we were in Government in similar circumstances and with the same amount of information that was then available to the Government and which was not available to us.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I feel very strongly about, however, and it is that I do not think a decision of this kind <Col N="1688" /> which was an issue of grave national concern to all the Irish people should have been taken by the Government on their own and without previous consultation with the Opposition Parties. This is a matter which concerns all the people in the country and the decision was taken by the Government representing only half of the people. This was too serious a move and something for which the Government should be condemned.  I am making this comment now because the position in the north of Ireland is still extremely serious.  The position there could explode at any time.  I do not think we have seen the end of this or anything like the end of it.  My own belief&mdash; and I feel very strongly about the North of Ireland&mdash;is that we should have set up in this part of the country an all-party committee which would constantly review the situation in the north and if a grave decision, a very serious decision had to be reached, it should be an all-party decision.  I would like the Minister to give serious consideration to this.</P>
    <P>In relation to the refugee camps, the right thing was done.  We could not have done otherwise.  They are Irish people; there was a great fear among these people and they fled from conditions that were impossible to endure. It was therefore only right that we should give them hospitality until conditions had stabilised.  It is comforting to find that so many have been able to return and that we now have only a small number left.  I should like to join with the Minister in expressing thanks to those people who have come and coped with this problem in the excellent way they did.  I should like also to join in paying tribute to the first line reserve and to the FCA for the way they rose to the occasion and did their job.  There was a certain amount of dissatisfaction, particularly among the first line reserve and among members of the FCA who were called up, because some of them suffered a loss of income and there was always the possibility that in the event of a prolonged call-up their promotional prospects would suffer.  I know the Government have intervened with employers who were not inclined to compensate such people for loss of income <Col N="1689" /> and it is right to say that on the whole this situation has been fairly met.</P>
    <P>There is a general feeling that the time has long passed when these grants should be improved and it should be more attractive for people to remain in the reserve and to come in when needed.  We still have a serious situation in the North of Ireland&mdash;a situation that calls for continuous review and it should be treated very seriously. We will have an opportunity of speaking on Defence later on and, as I admit my knowledge of Defence is limited, I shall leave it to other members of the House who may wish to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me compliment Deputy Clinton on his knowledge of Defence because for one who has not had Army experience he seems to know quite a lot about it.  He made one slight mistake, however, when he stated that we shall have an opportunity later on to discuss this subject on the main Estimate.  The next main Estimate on Defence will be when we are discussing the 1971 Budget.  We passed the Estimate for Defence and this Supplementary Estimate was introduced for two reasons: first, to give us an opportunity of discussing the main Estimate and, secondly, of discussing the items covered here.  I do not think we will have another opportunity of discussing this Estimate this year.  I think I am correct on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister admit that; I thought he might say something different.  However, that will give us another day and will shorten my contribution very considerably. The sum involved is large and the Minister has referred to the fact that this is due to the eleventh round wage increase and the Six County troubles.  This is rather extraordinary because everybody knew the eleventh round wage increase would be at about a certain figure.  Perhaps it is all right not to include it in the Budget but I was under the impression that it had been originally included.</P>
      <P>So far as the expenditure on the north is concerned, I should like to echo what Deputy Clinton has said. We both come from that part of the country north of the Boyne and news trickles through of what is happening on the other side of the Border.  If the information coming through to us is correct, and I am sure the Minister has better sources of information than I have, it appears a very large amount of arms has found its way into Northern Ireland in the past few months.  The agitators, both orange and green, seem to be stoking up and it is not just for the 5th November Guy Fawkes celebrations.  My impression is that we are in for serious trouble again: political activities in the north seem to be heading towards another flare-up and if certain gentlemen get elected to Stormont it appears there may be a change of leadership there which will almost certainly result in the hardline being reintroduced in retaliation by those who have been oppressed for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Clinton, I think an effort should be made this time to find out what is happening and to be prepared. We cannot claim that we were prepared the last time, although I give <Col N="1691" /> full credit to the Department of Defence for the speed with which they got their field hospitals into operation and their preparations to receive refugees.  I am a little intrigued by the Minister's reference to the fact that in the weeks immediately following the establishment of field hospitals many casualties were treated in the field hospitals. Perhaps the Minister would give us the exact number because the information I got was that there were not so many casualties&mdash;people who had been actually injured in the trouble.</P>
    <P>The Gormanston Camp was the clearing house for the refugees and the Minister says their number is now reduced to 54.  Perhaps he would give us a breakdown as to the composition of these 54 persons&mdash;men, women and children.  Have we got a group in Gormanston Camp who are not refugees in the real sense of the word, who are not there because they have no other place to go, but who are just in the camp because it is more comfortable than where they originally lived and who are not so anxious to return to the Six Counties for one reason or another? Perhaps the Minister might also tell us when the last refugee group were taken in from outside.  Is it true that a man, his wife and family were taken from a private house in Skerries since Christmas and lodged at Gormanston Camp while they are awaiting the building of a house?  If that is so then we have the solution for many who are awaiting the building of houses in that area.  If it can be done for someone from the Six Counties it can be done for many people in our own area who require accommodation.  The question of how comfortable it was was commented on by me in the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think Gormanston Camp was the ideal place to which refugees should have been brought.  The Minister may say that it was not possible to find an ideal place and that it was the best that could be found at the time but it is not a comfortable camp. As far as I know, most of it was built during the 1914-18 war.  The huts are still there and many of us know that they were not very comfortable 20 or <Col N="1692" /> 30 years ago and I am sure they have not become any more comfortable since despite the efforts of the Department to make them habitable for these families. One of the reasons why I objected to their use for the purpose of accommodating the families was that the only toilet and washing facilities were located outside and several hundred yards from where the people were sleeping and living.  Because of that I would object to the camp being used as a permanent basis for housing families. There are other barracks in the country which, I believe, are much more comfortable in which these people could have been housed.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which I am annoyed is that the soldiers looking after these people and doing everything from gardening to babysitting did not receive any extra consideration. These soldiers had to report in the mornings at about 7.30 and could not leave again until 11 o'clock at night.  It would have been only fair if they had been better treated.  If extra duties are imposed on them they should have received extra remuneration. However, they would be the last people in the world to complain.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of whether it was a good idea to do what was done at the time, there is one matter which must be considered and I think that this is the Estimate under which it should be considered.  I agree entirely with Deputy Clinton when he says in relation to the Six Counties that this House should have been recalled at the time and there should have been a discussion at all-party level.  The Taoiseach is a man for whom I have great respect but it was wrong for him to make a statement at the time which he must have known would do two things.  First, it would give certain people in the Six Counties the impression that the Irish Army were waiting across the Border to help them and, secondly, it would give the impression to certain impressionable people that they were about to be invaded and that they should attack before the other troops arrived. Perhaps any of us in a similar situation would have done the same thing at the time although I do not <Col N="1693" /> think so.  It is my belief that the approach was wrong and it is only correct that this view should be expressed here.  That statement may have been responsible for a lot of the burning that took place subsequently in Belfast.  We all know that it would have been the easiest thing in the world to go into Bogside and give assistance but getting into the Falls Road area would have been a different matter.  At the time, perhaps, the approach seemed correct but, looking back, it would appear that a wrong move was made.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the first line reserve and the FCA having been called up.  These men did a good job but there are a couple of matters to which I should like to refer.  One is that people called from the first line reserve were taken from their jobs, some of them from one-man jobs.  Some were men who had built up small businesses over a number of years and suffered serious losses as a result of having been called up.  It is fair to say that if they knew this was likely to happen they would not be in the reserve but, at the same time, some effort should have been made to be a little more selective in endeavouring to call people who could afford to be called at that time.</P>
    <P>The other matter concerns arrangements for paying wages to those men. In many cases it was agreed to pay some wages to them but this could not be done unless they produced a certificate from the Department of Finance stating what money had actually been paid to them.  They had to go looking for these certificates, whereas they should have been given them at the end of each week or months.  This would have made it very much easier for them to get correct payment from their employers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the FCA it is true that they helped a lot as did a number of other organisations like, for instance, the Red Cross and Civil Defence.  However, as the Minister is probably aware, there is a nark in Gormanston about what actually happened.  It appears that when Gormanston was being prepared for the reception of the refugees, the Red Cross people came from <Col N="1694" /> Dublin.  As everyone knows, Gormanston is in County Meath and there are adequate Red Cross and Civil Defence services in that county to deal with any such emergencies but they felt that they had been slighted when they went along to help.  While they were not actually told to go to hell it was made clear to them that the Red Cross people from Dublin were handling the arrangements and that they were not wanted.  This matter has been referred to in some of the documents which they have since produced.  There should be more co-ordination and if there is a local unit of any of the services that local unit should be employed.</P>
    <P>In connection with the FCA and with anybody who is employed on the protection of installations which are of national importance, I should like to know what recompense they are getting and if it is ensured that their service will not interfere with their civilian employment.  Also, something must be done to prevent people coming across the Border, as they appear to be doing with impunity, and blowing up certain installations and then going back across the Border.  Not one of these people has yet been intercepted. Therefore, something more must be done in this regard.  It is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that every effort is made in apprehending these people.</P>
    <P>If they come across here then they must put up with the consequences. When the traffic was the other way round all the people who went across the Border in an effort to carry out raids did not come back.  As a matter of fact many of them were killed in their efforts and, while I have very little sympathy with people from one side of the Border or the other who carry out raids of this kind, at the same time it does appear as if the people in the north are very lucky or else we are not taking the precautions we should take.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows my views on peace-keeping.  While it was a great thing to take part in the UN peace-keeping mission in Cyprus, at the same time I think we were caught on the wrong foot because, when we needed extra people, we had to go out into <Col N="1695" /> civilian life and bring them in while the cream of our Army was in Cyprus. This country is doing more than its share and, because of the reception given to the suggestion that a peace-keeping force should be introduced in the Six Counties, the Government would be perfectly justified now if they said they had reached the stage at which they had completed their commitment and withdrew the troops they have attached to the UN forces.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we get a refund of the money spent.  As Deputy Clinton pointed out, no effort seems to have been made to increase the overseas allowance and slightly over a quarter of a million not paid to date means a fairly heavy interest outlay eventually to be carried by the Irish taxpayer.  The men out there are doing a very good job, as are those engaged in the Middle East, but this is something which can be taken a little bit too far and, in view of the very small number we have in the Army, we should fill our own defence needs first.</P>
    <P>The question of gratuities has been referred to.  I have asked numerous questions here and I have given details about the non-payment of gratuities to privates, NCOs and unmarried officers. We have long passed the stage when something should be done about this. Perhaps the present Minister has a better knowledge of the Army than any of his predecessors and perhaps he will make an effort to try to ensure that this matter is attended to without further delay.  In addition to that, a man who spends 21 years in the Army qualifies for a pension.  If he stays on &mdash;if he did not the Army would be pretty small now&mdash;all he gets for his extra service is one shilling per year extra pension.  This is too ridiculous for words.  I have suggested that men who are leaving the Army should be trained for civilian employment.  There should be opportunities for training these people for some kind of job. There are apprenticeship schemes for young men to train as tradesmen but there should be some scheme for training the middle aged for civilian employment.</P>
    <P>The grants to the first line reserve <Col N="1696" /> and the FCA have not been increased for a very long period.  The Minister might have a look at these grants.  He should also have a look at the system of computing the payments in relation to the continuous ration allowance.  To suggest, as was suggested last year by the Minister's predecessor that, because the Army can buy certain types of food in bulk for a lower amount than was paid the previous year, the continuous ration allowance should be reduced by one penny per day is too ridiculous for words.  The soldier's wife does not buy meat, or bread, or cheese, or anything else by the half ton.  She buys in pounds, the same as everybody else does.  Surely it is only reasonable to suggest that the cost-of-living index should be used for the purposes of CRA rather than the cutdated system of bulk buying used at present? This is something that needs a fresh approach.  The Minister may be the man to make that approach.</P>
    <P>What success has the recruiting drive had?  I was amazed to see a half-page advertisement in one of the local papers in which it was suggested that a young man who wanted to get on in the world should join the Army where he would get the magnificent sum of £8 per week.  Does the Minister seriously suggest this will attract the best type into the Army?  I do not think it will.  No man anxious to get on would think of joining the Army for the princely sum of £8 a week and his food.  If we want the right type we will have to pay them.  It may have been all right to pay soldiers with buttons during the Emergency; the money was not there at the time. But it is not all right to pay buttons today.  That advertisement will do nothing to build up the Army.  If those who have completed their 21 years service were to opt out of the Army tomorrow we would have a very small Army indeed, and it is small enough at the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to arms, the serving soldier was issued with the Lee Enfield and the FCA with the 300.  I notice this was changed and the Lee Enfield is now issued to the FCA.  I do not know what the others are getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to place on record my appreciation of the change in outlook with regard to the Army. It is not so many years since people outside and inside this House were inclined to think the only purpose the Army had was as a kind of refuge for ne'er-do-wells who could not make an honest living or could not be trusted to make an honest living in ordinary civilian life.  They were sent into the Army.  By the tone of those who spoke before me on this Estimate, and I am sure they were echoing the sentiments of 99.9 per cent of the population, that image has completely changed.</P>
      <P>Often in the past the question was asked was the Army necessary, was it a waste of money to have a civil defence force in view of the fact that in nuclear warfare no one survives.  In the last 12 months we have seen how necessary it is to have the Army, the civil defence force, the Red Cross and the ancillary services for the preservation of life and order in the community. Although I would go a certain amount of the way with Deputy Tully as regards our commitments to send troops to foreign lands, at the same time in my view it is a worthwhile exercise.  It is a good thing for the Army to have had this experience. The personnel who served abroad and those who stayed at home are changed as a result of that foreign service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that tribute should be paid to the Army for the manner in which they conducted themselves abroad.  They are the best ambassadors we could have.  Irishmen who go <Col N="1698" /> abroad are judged sometimes on trivial incidents.  There is the minimum amount of complaints and the maximum number of good reports in regard to the behaviour of our troops in the Congo, Cyprus, the Middle East and anywhere else they have served.  That is a source of great satisfaction to all of us.</P>
    <P>The Army, while perhaps not the greatest career a young man could choose, is certainly a worthwhile career for an unskilled young man who wants to make something of himself.  The Army trains apprentices in crafts, trades, and so on.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Clinton mentioned the social activities and integration with the community.  There is no better section of the community for helping any worthwhile cause, charitable or social, than the personnel in Collins Barracks, Cork.  They are outstanding. They are at the beck and call of the community.  They go on committees.  They take part in the International Choral Festival and the Film Festival.  The Collins Musical Society fills the Opera House to capacity for a fortnight.  There is no better musical society in the country.  Army personnel take a full part in community activity.  That, as Deputy Clinton suggested, is one way in which the Army presents an image different from the one that was presented years ago.  The Army certainly deserve thanks for this.</P>
    <P>The Red Cross are now affiliated to Civil Defence.  I am sure that Deputies are gratified by the response from the FCA, the first line reserve, Civil Defence and the Red Cross when help was needed recently.  Their members took leave of absence from their jobs and went to centres where help was required.  Perhaps they were not all needed this time but on an occasion like this it is good that they should do this.  We do not know what we will be called upon to do tomorrow or next week or next month.  It is well that we can have confidence in the personnel of the Army and the ancillary forces.</P>
    <P>There is one problem that I would put to the Minister in relation to Army personnel.  I sympathise with a man <Col N="1699" /> who served 30 years in the Army, who is living with his wife in barracks, whose family have gone away, who cannot get a house outside the barracks and because of that is denied his pension.  That is very hard luck.  I can quite understand the anxiety of the Department of Defence to get the house that he is occupying for a serving soldier but if that man has done everything possible and cannot get a house outside, especially in places like Cork, Dublin or Limerick where houses are at a premium and are usually given to persons with young families, it is hard that at this hour of his life he cannot get his pension as a result of that.  I would suggest that if the Minister cannot give the full pension he should give half of it and withhold half until that man gets a house.  This would show sympathy with his position and he would know that he would get the pension to which he is entitled as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I just wanted to put on record my appreciation of all that has been done by the Defence Forces.  The people of this part of the country have confidence in them and in the way they will behave should a crisis arise in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to supplement some of the remarks made here about the valuable work done by the Army during recent months, particularly the manner in which they received the refugees.  When visiting the camp in Gormanston I heard, as other Deputies heard from those who were catered for there, that they greatly appreciated the sympathetic, kind and agreeable manner in which the Army personnel looked after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right to refer to the matter that has been referred to by Deputy Clinton and Deputy Tully.  While it is not entirely a matter solely for the Minister for Defence or the Defence Vote, it is a question that concerns the nation as a whole, that is, the possibility of continuous activities on the part of the Defence Forces.  The fact that at present Army personnel and FCA personnel are guarding certain installations, and may have to continue to do so, naturally poses a <Col N="1700" /> number of major questions that possibly on a Supplementary Estimate may not be discussed in full.</P>
    <P>While events such as those which occurred last August occur quickly and in a period when it may not be possible to discuss the matter in the House, it should be realised that this is a national problem, that all parties are concerned in it and that the House and the country should be made aware of the general reasons behind decisions. On the whole, while there are often risks in having a debate, in general Deputies are responsible and realistic in their approach to these matters. Possibly it is better to have a debate, whatever the risks may be, in order that the country may understand the full reasons behind decisions and so that the decisions taken reflect the attitude of the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is important to consider&mdash;and it is appropriate to mention it now&mdash;the whole question of Defence expenditure.  It is quite likely that Defence expenditure in the future may be higher than it is at present and than it has been.  Therefore, a realistic plan and policy on Defence should be adopted and implemented. Since the war we have acted on the illusory assumption that a peacetime defence force as laid down would be sufficient but in fact it has never been reached.  As the three Deputies who spoke before me rightly said, conditions have changed and the old time attitudes on Army personnel and pay are outmoded.  Wages and salaries outside the Army make it less attractive compared with civilian employment.</P>
    <P>I want to re-echo what was said by Deputy Clinton, Deputy Tully and Deputy Healy in favour of the setting up of a commission or a body to consider the whole question of Army pay. As I understand it, two years ago the Defence Council discussed this and my information is that they recommended that such a body should be established.  It is no reflection on the Civil Service staff to say that the old time attitude that pay and conditions should be decided by contact between the civil servants in the Department of Defence and the Department of <Col N="1701" /> Finance, with the ultimate decision being taken by the Government, is not adequate in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect people nowadays to be satisfied with the old time pay and conditions which people were prepared to accept in the past in the Army.  In many cases people are now better educated and those who join the Army are coming out of homes in which, despite housing difficulties and so on in many parts of the country and particularly in the cities, there are services available now which were not available before.  Most of the Army barracks are very old and in many cases incapable of being properly modernised.  Deputy Tully touched on one important point.  The Army personnel did the best they could in Gormanston to look after the refugees but I am sure the Minister, his officials and the Army authorities concerned are well aware that it was fortunate that those events occurred at a time when the weather was relatively mild. Gormanston Camp would not be capable of catering for a large number of refugees at this time of the year or in inclement weather.  The huts there are possibly suitable enough for Army personnel but certainly there would be real danger if families, and particularly children, were housed in these huts with fires or stoves being used as they would have to be used at this time of year. Therefore it is important to make a careful and realistic appraisal of the situation so that adequate facilities will be available if they have to be provided again.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a strong case for the suggestion I made.  It has been adopted so far as the Garda are concerned. A commission of some sort should be appointed.  I sometimes think that setting up a commission postpones a decision but at least the Army should be adequately represented in any question in respect of pay and emoluments, conditions, uniforms and so on.  While some improvements have been made there is no doubt that in many cases the standard of the uniforms is not up to what people expect nowadays.</P>
    <P>I want to endorse what was said <Col N="1702" /> about the need for paying gratuities to NCOs and men.  I have advocated this before.  Not merely is this overdue and justified, but there is the extraordinary anomaly that if you are a civilian employee working in an Army barracks you get a gratuity, but if you are an NCO or man serving in the same barracks you do not get a gratuity when your time is up.  The gratuities for officers are not as favourable as those which apply in respect of civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one distinction and Deputy Tully probably mentioned it.  The pension provisions apply after shorter service in respect of officers and I suppose one has to be equated with the other.  That brings me to another aspect of this problem. Are we getting the best return for the expenditure involved in training Army personnel?  I have been a strong advocate for years of re-integrating and re-settling Army personnel in civilian life.  I advocated this years ago for people in the Air Corps in relation to Aer Lingus.  My experience in the Army reinforced the view that a number of people hold this opinion.</P>
      <P>I was glad to have had the opportunity when I was acting Minister for Defence at one time, as a result of discussions with the then quartermaster general, to initiate the establishment of the Army Apprentice School in Naas for reasons similar to those which Deputy Healy gave.  Few Army corps have trained personnel whose training fits them for civilian occupation subsequently.  In the main, Army personnel are trained in the sense of discipline and order, and those with long service, if they have not been engaged in a technical corps, are too old when they leave the Army to be trained in technical skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I believe there should be an established plan for resettlement. The QMG, who was a member of the Supply and Transport Corps, is familiar with the valuable work those in that corps can do and how readily men who serve in it can find work <Col N="1703" /> outside in the motor and similar businesses.  The training now provided in the Army Apprentice School is most valuable.  It will not merely help the Army personnel in Army careers but it will fit them for civilian careers afterwards.</P>
    <P>In many other countries they have resettlement arrangements in which the bigger firms outside participate through an agreed procedure.  There must be realisation that Army training is good training, that in the modern world in all countries the great difficulty is lack of discipline.  Army training gives this discipline and therefore Army training must react favourably not only on the men who get it but on the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we must embark on a scheme of resettlement for Army personnel on a national basis.  Such a system is in operation in Britain where, admittedly, much larger numbers are seeking resettlement.  In this country many officers and men leave in advance of their time because they are offered good positions.  I am sure this could be extended to all men of all ranks.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the FCA and the Red Cross.  The FCA deserve our thanks and the thanks of the country for the response they gave in presenting themselves and serving in the various posts to which they were assigned during the past few months. The fact that so many Army and FCA personnel are still protecting installations of importance such as ESB plants, water supplies and so forth indicates the extent to which they have given their services.  The amount of time they have spent doing this work is an indication of their willingness to do this work.</P>
    <P>The Red Cross members also did very good work at short notice.  In that connection, some people were concerned about one matter.  Money was subscribed here to the Red Cross for relief in the Six Counties and there was some doubt as to whether the money was distributed up there.  I do not know if the Minister has any information on it.  Certainly the Red Cross here played <Col N="1704" /> their part, but many people were anxious that the money and other gifts which were given should be devoted to the purposes for which they were donated.</P>
    <P>I now move to the question of Army accommodation.  In the modern world, when people expect different standards, a new look should be taken at Army barracks.  We have only two really modern barracks, the barracks at Kildare and Clancy Barracks with some new quarters on the Quays which are more modern than the others, but the remainder are completely out of date. I appreciate that efforts have been made to re-equip and reconstruct them but they are still by no means what they should be.  A general policy should be adopted on this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with other Deputies in regard to rehousing of Army personnel.  This problem is not one peculiar to the Department of Defence: the Department of Local Government have a large share of responsibility.  After long years of service, Army personnel may find themselves in great difficulty for many reasons.  They may have been a long time in married quarters, their families may have grown and gone away leaving only man and wife, or they may not be long in a particular place.  The local authority will not consider them for alternative accommodation.  It is most unfair to penalise men who have given such long service.  I appreciate the Army's difficulty: they have to get possession of the married quarters. However, a number of people have suffered considerable hardship mainly due to red tape or regulations, partly Army, partly local government.  There should be serious consultation between the interested parties in an endeavour to solve this problem as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>What has been said here this evening reinforces the general view Deputies had that unless pay and conditions of service in the Army are improved it will not be possible to recruit sufficient numbers of men of sufficiently high standard to keep the Army up to strength.  In general, the standard and the conduct of Army personnel has been outstanding.  This high standard <Col N="1705" /> of conduct and integrity has been reflected in the tasks to which they have been assigned.  The type of service they give epitomises the best qualities of our people.</P>
    <P>If we are to maintain that standard we must offer attractive pay and conditions, comparable with those in civilian life.  It is essential that the Minister for Defence should take up with the Minister for Finance and the Government this whole question not merely of pay and conditions but of <Col N="1706" /> accommodation, uniform and so on, plus the vitally important question of resettlement subsequently in civilian life.  I appreciate that any one of these questions will involve expenditure.  If we are to be involved in increased expenditure, we should see that we get the best value for it.</P>
