      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) for himself and (b) for the Parliamentary Secretary the cost of officially provided Christmas cards and greetings sent in 1969; if the postage was provided free by his Department; if so, the cost in each case; if he will give an estimate of the cost of cards on order for this year under each heading; and if the cards will be sent free.</P>

      <P>The cost of official Christmas greeting cards sent by me in 1969 was £293.  As postal charges on officially-provided cards are largely recouped to the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on the basis of estimates prepared by that Department for all departmental correspondence issued, it is not possible to give the exact cost of postage in 1969, but it is estimated at £31.  It is estimated that the cost of official Christmas greeting cards this year will be £300; the cost, together with the cost of postage involved, will be borne by my Department. Cards for my private use are provided at my own expense; I also pay the postage on such cards.</P>
      <P>As regards my Parliamentary Secretary, the cost of Christmas cards sent in 1969 was £56 and the postage is estimated at £6.  It is estimated that the cost of cards to be sent in 1970 will be £21.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 9 together.</P>
      <P>At 31st December, 1950 there were 85 male and 12 female patients in the Central Mental Hospital; at 31st December, 1960 the numbers were 81 males and seven females and on last Friday there were 106 males and 30 female patients in the hospital.</P>
      <P>Fifty-five of the present hospital population of 136 in the Central Mental Hospital have been transferred there from district mental hospitals by order of the Minister for Health under the powers conferred on him by section 207 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945. Action in such cases rests with the Minister for Health following a special court hearing in a district mental hospital on a patient charged with an indictable offence and where, in the opinion of the justice, there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the person charged has committed the offence and if placed on trial would be unfit to plead.  The justice in such circumstances certifies that such person is suitable for transfer to the Central Mental Hospital and following consideration of a report from the inspector of mental hospitals on the mental condition of the patient the Minister decides whether to make an order transferring the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision has been made in the <Col N="448" /> recently enacted Health Act, 1970, which will permit of the transfer of the administration of the Central Mental Hospital to the new Eastern Health Board.  This transfer will, it is expected, take place next year when the Eastern Health Board get under way.  This arrangement will facilitate the staffing of the Central Mental Hospital and its development along the lines recommended by the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness.  To this end, Dublin Health Authority is already in the process of recruiting a clinical director in forensic psychiatry.  The question of transferring homicidal and very violent patients from district mental hospitals to the Central Mental Hospital as a result of medical certification rather than as a result of judicial procedure is a matter that will be considered in forthcoming amending legislation of the Mental Treatment Acts.</P>
    <P>The Central Mental Hospital at present has three full-time officers.  All are qualified psychiatrists but none has specialist training in forensic psychiatry. The head male nurse is a qualified psychiatric nurse and the matron has both psychiatric and general nurse qualifications.  There is no psychiatric social worker employed.  The hospital engages a psychologist on a consultant basis as and when required.  As I mentioned earlier, the taking over of the administration of the Central Mental Hospital by the Eastern Health Board will facilitate the staffing of the hospital.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a general opinion on comparability of the services in the Central Mental Hospital with those of the local authority psychiatric services.  The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness expressed the opinion that a district mental hospital, in most cases, is not a suitable place for a patient, if for reasons other than the type and degree of his mental illness it is expedient that he should be kept in confinement.  The commission recommended that the Central Mental Hospital should be retained as a special hospital for certain patients.  I accept the need for a centre such as the Central Mental Hospital and the question of whether a particular individual can be better treated in the Central Mental <Col N="449" /> Hospital or in a district mental hospital, has to be determined on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the unit for the treatment of drug addicts in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital will deal mainly with detained patients but provision for voluntary patients will also be made.  The unit will be separate from the Central Mental Hospital proper and will be operated by the Dublin Health Authority until such time as the Eastern Health Board take over their functions.  The Dublin Health Authority will at the same time also operate a centre in its new premises at Ushers Island which will deal with the treatment of drug addicts who can be treated in a more open environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear from the Minister's answer that the facilities available at the Central Mental Hospital, without any disrespect to the personnel there, are not as satisfactory as the facilities at the Dublin Health Authority institution at St. Brendan's? Is it not a fact that this Central Mental Hospital was criticised as far back as 1966 for deficiencies in these treatment facilities?  Is it not also a fact that no significant change has taken place in relation to these treatment facilities?  Is it not a fact that the hospital was established as, and still is, an institution which is concerned not with the treatment or care of these people but with the segregation of persons who have committed serious offences?  Is it not further a fact that a person who is transferred from Mountjoy to this hospital becomes labelled as a criminal lunatic?  In these circumstances, would the Minister not inquire into the circumstances surrounding the transfer of young Dolphin to the Central Mental Hospital where it is by many people believed he has been transferred because of his dissident political views and not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is very serious public disquiet that this particular individual who is <Col N="450" /> acting in a very honourable tradition of refusing to recognise the institutions of this State, an attitude which is a long time in existence in Irish history&mdash; there is a possibility that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  I am advised that the said person is being properly looked after and should have been transferred.  However, I do not propose to say anything else about it because the case is <i>sub judice.</i> In regard to the rest of the Deputy's questions.  I have admitted that we still have to make progress with the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital and that we can do this when it comes under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Health Board because it will be possible&mdash;it is possible&mdash;to have psychiatric staff on a basis of being given periods of employment in this hospital. There must be a good deal of custodial care; so, the staff employed on purely custodial care is of a different variety from that which could be employed if the hospital were linked with the Eastern Health Board and the Dublin Health Authority Mental Hospital.  We still have to appoint a clinical director of forensic psychiatry.  We have not yet implemented the whole of the proposals in the mental illness report.  I have given a clear picture of the progress we are making&mdash;which is as rapid as I hope, under the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The all-in cost of building and furnishing the new Saint Vincent's Hospital is estimated at about £4.3 million, of which approximately £3.7 million has been met to date by capital grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  The site for the new hospital was provided free of charge by the Irish Sisters of Charity.  The old Saint Vincent's Hospital premises fronting on Saint Stephen's Green remains the property of the order, but <Col N="452" /> other properties which formed part of the old hospital complex are to be transferred to the State as a further contribution towards the cost of the new hospital.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister, in view of the fact that public money was spent on the building of this institution, care to comment, and to condemn or to criticise, the very bigoted and sectarian speech made by the chairman of the board, Dr. John Charles McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin, at the opening of the institution in which, by implication, he excluded members of the religious minority of the nursing and medical profession from employment and also those of the minority who fall sick in this State and who have as much right to access to this hospital as anybody else and to treatment in accordance with their religious beliefs?</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into this in detail.  I could not possibly do so in answer to a question.  The proposals of the Fine Gael Party were not based, I think, on viable grounds.  On the other hand, the question of providing a contributory system was extraordinarily complex from the point of view of ensuring that the burden would fall in an equitable way on the different sections of the community with their differing incomes and to relating that to contributions to the rates and to general taxation.  Any scheme would be extraordinarily difficult to devise which would ensure that the burden would be distributed equitably.  The Fine Gael proposition was one that, in my view, left as many questions to be answered as were answered.  I am not necessarily saying that, for that reason, it was not <Col N="454" /> sincerely brought forward.  It is a most complex matter and it still is under examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on the result of the recent referendum among doctors regarding his offer of fee per item of service with free choice of doctors under the new Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed yesterday that the result of the referendum conducted by the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union on this offer has resulted in a rejection of the terms which I had offered.  It is regrettable that this is the outcome.</P>
      <P>I should explain to the House that my two predecessors as Minister for Health were involved in talks with the profession on this matter and since I took up office there has been a considerable volume of discussion involving myself, my officials and representatives of the medical bodies.  Most of the important points on the form of the scheme and its administration were agreed during these discussions.</P>
      <P>In the beginning, the discussions related to a scheme in which payment would be on a basis whereby the doctor would be paid a flat sum per year for each patient, plus an allowance for practice expenses&mdash;a capitation system.  When, however, the representatives of the profession indicated to my predecessor at a meeting in April, 1969, that they were unwilling to accept the capitation system which had by then been developed, he agreed to establish a study group, representative of the Department and the organisations, to report to him on the manner in which an acceptable fee-for-service method of payment might be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of this group were unanimous.  They proposed a simple system of fees for attendances <Col N="456" /> with controls to prevent abuses.  I accepted these recommendations and, having studied the existing levels and patterns of remuneration for general practice in this and other countries, I suggested a scale of fees to the organisations last January.  This was accepted by them as a basis for discussion and following clarification and consideration of a number of points, I made an improved offer on 28th May last.  As it was clear then that the basis for fixing fees could not be finally determined until statistics were available from the actual operation of the scheme, I proposed that an arbitrator should review the scale after one year's operation, with power to make a retrospective adjustment if that should appear then to be justified.</P>
    <P>After the medical organisations had considered this second offer, I met them again and as a result made a further substantially improved final offer in July.  This offer was notified to the House on 29th July last and is contained in the Official Report, Volume 248, columns 2399 and 2400.  The bottom of the range of fees offered is 15s for surgery services in normal working hours &mdash;including such calls as for repeat prescriptions.  The surgery fees outside these hours are £1 2s 6d up to midnight and £2 5s after midnight.  Fees for calls to patients' homes range from £1 2s 6d up to £5 5s.  In putting it to the organisations, I pointed out that, in comparing the fees with those in private practice, their members should bear in mind that the fees would be payable for all patient contacts, including such calls as for repeat prescriptions&mdash;except for certain attendances solely for social welfare certificates&mdash;that fees for public patients would be payable on the basis of a single monthly claim, and that bad debts would not arise.  I also reiterated the offer of a subsequent adjustment by arbitration, retrospectively if appropriate.</P>
    <P>This is the offer which has been rejected by the members of the organisations. I am satisfied that the terms offered are fair to general practitioners and compare favourably with the remuneration of general practitioners participating elsewhere in the public services. Furthermore in drawing up my <Col N="457" /> proposals I have had regard to the general level of incomes prevailing here and I am satisfied that, in that context, my final offer to the doctors is entirely equitable.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this issue, I have always had in the forefront the aim of this House, as expressed in section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, to offer, as far as is practicable, a choice of general practitioner to the lower income group. In all aspects of the proposals, I have been willing to go far to meet the wishes of the profession.  It is thus a great disappointment to me that the present situation has arisen but since, as I have said, I regard the offer made as entirely equitable, I cannot make any further offer.  Accordingly, I regret to inform the House that 1st April, 1971 will not see the commencement of this highly desirable change in the health services.  The existing dispensary system will, of course, continue to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is important that the free choice of doctor be implemented as from April?  Would it not be a good idea for further meetings to take place as soon as possible and at as frequent intervals as possible to ensure that some form of agreement can be reached so that we can have this free choice of doctor for medical card patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not now avail of the situation to embark on a comprehensive survey related to the reorganisation of health services on the basis of insurance, instead of tinkering with the problem? This effort to provide a choice of doctor was an effort merely to bolster up the existing dispensary system. Would the Minister not now consider, if that is not possible, that the entire question of providing a national health service based on insurance should be considered afresh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to complicate the two questions, the choice of doctor service and an examination of the contributory insurance principle.  In reply to Deputy Dr. O'Connell, I would naturally take any opportunity of getting in touch with <Col N="458" /> the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union if I thought it possible that they would accept the offer I have made, which is the final offer.  I would remind the Deputy that the proposal to appoint an arbitrator included a proviso that the arbitrator will have before him what we consider to be the average number of services per patient, choosing any one doctor; he will have before him what we consider to be the number of services carried out per day by a doctor engaged in the choice of doctor service as between his private and public patients and also any other matters relevant to the general question of what the fee for service would be.  He would also have before him the computerised record of all the fees for services paid to doctors over a period and, based on his judgment and what we consider to be a reasonable income for the doctors concerned, he would be empowered to make proposals to me, the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union for a revision upwards, if necessary, of the fee for service on a retrospective basis if our assumptions in regard to the number of services per doctor <i>et cetera</i> proved to be an over-estimate.  That seems to me to be a very important part of this offer which, if I can recall rightly, is certainly in my experience rather unique in relation to all questions of remuneration&mdash;to have an immediate retrospective examination based on certain provisos in respect of incomes. This is quite an unusual way of arranging for a settlement and I think the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union should have had more regard to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will not start an argument on these lines.  Surely we can agree in all parties that there has never been-not that I know of, at any rate-in any European country, a method of job evaluation that would prevent anomalies in payments arising, or prevent the consideration of salaries or wages, or whatever it is, on what might appear to some people to be a fair basis.  We have never had job evaluation conducted in such a way that what the Deputy says could be an obviously relevant factor in deciding what a fee for service would be.  The Deputy should know that the incomes of professional classes in certain categories may not compare with the salaries of certain types of super-craftsmen.  That is a fact of life.  I simply could not take it into account in debating such a matter as what the fees for the services of doctors should be or I would get lost in a jungle of comparisons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Following is the statement: The information available to us from the authorities of the countries concerned is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Belgium</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are no restrictions on the purchase of land by non-nationals in Belgium but non-nationals who wish to engage in the business of farming must obtain a work permit.  The law which imposes this requirement is a general one applying to numerous self-employed activities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>France</i>
    </P>
    <P>Non-nationals are free to purchase land in France subject to exchange control regulations which apply equally to nationals resident outside France.  Where a non-national who has purchased land wishes to establish himself as a farmer he must request authorisation to do so from the competent authorities.  A non-national who is able to satisfy the authorities that he has been resident in France on an uninterrupted basis for at least three years and who was less than thirty-five years of age on entering the country, may apply for a &ldquo;privileged residence card&rdquo;.  After ten years residence with the status of privileged resident, a non-national is entitled to receive permission to exercise his profession throughout France.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Federal Republic of Germany</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Federal authorities apply no restrictions or conditions which discriminate against non-nationals in the field of land purchase.  In the Laender of Baden-Wuertemburg, Bavaria, Berlin, Lower Saxony, the Rhine Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein, non-national &ldquo;juridical persons&rdquo;, i.e. foreign companies or firms, require permission in certain circumstances, but &ldquo;natural foreign persons&rdquo;, i.e. private non-national individuals, do not require permission to purchase land.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Italy</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are no restrictions on the purchase of land by non-nationals in Italy and no conditions discriminating against non-nationals are imposed on such purchases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" />
      <i>Netherlands</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are no restrictions on the purchase of land by non-nationals in the Netherlands and no conditions discriminating against non-nationals are imposed on such purchases.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Luxembourg</i>
    </P>
    <P>Non-nationals are free to purchase land in Luxembourg but those wishing to engage in horticulture require a permit.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Denmark</i>
    </P>
    <P>Persons, without discrimination as to nationality who do not reside in Denmark or have not previously resided there for a period of at least five years in all, may acquire title to real property in that country only with the permission of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Norway</i>
    </P>
    <P>Access to ownership of land is governed by permits granted by the Minister for Agriculture in four categories of land.  In the case of forest land, arable land and mountainous land a permit is required by nationals and non-nationals alike.  In the case of moorland only non-nationals require a permit.</P>
    <P>
      <i>United Kingdom</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are no restrictions on the purchase of land by non-nationals in the UK and no conditions discriminating against non-nationals are imposed in such purchases.</P>

      <P>The Council of the European Communities is at present discussing proposals made by the Commission in relation to the recommendations in the report of the Werner group on the realisation by stages of economic and monetary union in the Community.

      <P>Before we leave this question, is the House to understand from what the Minister said that in relation to the Werner proposals the position is that decisions in principle may be taken which will subsequently be called guidelines.

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will now initiate discussions with a view to removing the need for Israeli citizens coming to Ireland and Irish citizens going to Israel to have visas from the country being visited, particularly having regard to the fact that most European countries no longer have such a requirement; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle.  I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the visa requirement is to regulate the admission of foreigners. Where tourist, business or other traffic warrant it, we have made arrangements for the abolition of visas in respect of visitors from certain countries usually on a reciprocal basis provided there are no considerations which would render this course undesirable.</P>
      <P>With regard to travel between this country and Israel because of the unsettled political situation in the Middle East the present is not the most propitious time to initiate discussions for a visa abolition agreement unless there should be a clear need for it.  This has not yet become evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the only countries in Europe which have a visa requirement with Israel are three of the Mediterranean countries&mdash;Italy, Spain and Portugal? How is it that all other countries in Europe have seen fit to abolish the visa requirement when, in fact, there are as many, if not more, Irish citizens going to Israel and to places in the Holy Land as there are people from other parts of Europe and business is increasing between this country and Israel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the experience of the Department of External Affairs goes there has been no demand for this recently and with an unsettled political position in the Middle East it would not be the time to start negotiations for a visa abolition agreement. We are not relating what we do to what other countries do.  We are <Col N="469" /> just acting according to what we think we should do ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that Israel has asked for the abolition of these visas and we have maintained the attitude that we will not do it?  Why will the Minister not accede to the request of Israel, having regard to the fact that all European countries, with three exceptions in the Mediterranean area, have already abolished the visa?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the very high financial demands imposed on applicants who seek the installation of power from the ESB; and if, for the purpose of ensuring that rural electrification may go ahead unchecked, he will make funds available to that corporation and enable the claims of applicants to be met reasonably and economically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are already providing funds for rural electrification.  In the current financial year, the ESB are spending £3 million on extending and strengthening the electricity supply to rural householders and the Government are contributing <Col N="473" /> £1.8 million of this sum by way of rural electrification subsidy.</P>
      <P>Some rural consumers have had to pay special service charges in addition to their normal fixed charges because of the very high capital cost of connecting their houses.  In mid-1968, however, the Government arranged for substantial reductions&mdash;up to two-thirds in some cases&mdash;in the higher special service charges.  I am satisfied that the charges now payable by rural householders are the lowest possible.</P>
      <P>It may be that what the Deputy has in mind is the ESB practice of seeking capital contributions from unconnected householders who are unwilling to wait until the Board's rural electrification post-development scheme reaches their areas.</P>
      <P>This scheme is being carried out on an area by area basis so as to keep the cost of the work to the lowest possible level and thus ensure that the maximum number of connections are made with the capital available.  The board are, on occasions, pressed to make connection out of turn and, in cases where this is physically possible and where it will not divert staff from planned work, the board will offer to extend supply but only on payment by the applicant of the full cost of the work.  If, therefore, some rural householders wish to be connected out of turn, they will have to provide the capital themselves initially.  Otherwise, some one or more householders who are already in the planned scheme must lose their place until a later date. Persons who make capital contributions in these circumstances are reimbursed when the planned scheme reaches their areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that some cottiers have been asked for as much as £1,000 for the installation of electricity?  Is the Minister further aware that they have been told that the money will be refunded when the area comes to be developed? Surely it is not beyond the power of the Government to float a loan or to do something to tide those people over the time which remains?  Under the present system, despite what the Government <Col N="474" /> are giving or not giving, people have to wait years for electricity.</P>

It is only those who are well endowed with the world's goods who can meet such demands.  Would he not think it is completely unfair that the man in rural Ireland who has not the capital to provide this money to the board must wait whilst his well-to-do neighbour, whether he comes from Ireland, England or the Continent, gets the supply without difficulty?

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that it is their policy to utilise the resources available for connecting new rural consumers on the basis of an orderly programme, planned and executed on a rational basis.  Only in this way can the overall cost, and the cost of individual connections, be kept within reasonable limits, though it necessarily involves a wait for many applicants, including dairy farmers, until their areas are reached under the programme.  To give priority to unconnected dairy farmers irrespective of the the areas in which they are situated would seriously interfere with the orderly progress of the planned <Col N="475" /> programme and would increase costs significantly.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The High Court made an order on 7th December confirming the petitions of the creditors for the compulsory winding up of the Hibernian Transport Group of companies and appointed two liquidators for this purpose.  The provisional liquidator who had earlier been appointed had asked staff members of the group to accept employment on a weekly basis pending clarification of the overall position.  I understand that the liquidators now appointed will retain staff in employment during the period of the liquidation to the extent that remunerative occupation will exist for them.</P>
      <P>I am informed that of approximately 500 employees of Hibernian Transport about 80 have to date left the employment of their own accord and about 70 have had their employment terminated last week-end because there was no further work available for them.  It is believed that the majority of those who left have since secured employment elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour is concerning himself with the implications of the loss of employment for the employees concerned and the question of entitlement to redundancy payments; his Department is making arrangements to interview workers who become disemployed and who have not secured other jobs themselves.  Officers of that Department will make every effort to find jobs for those employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met representatives of the trade unions concerned, including the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, on 19th and 20th November.  I undertook to have inquiries made about the position of the group.  Unfortunately, my inquiries did not disclose any good prospect of achieving the objective of continuing the group, or any part of it, <Col N="477" /> in activity as a going concern for any appreciable length of time.</P>
    <P>CIE investigated, in consultation with the provisional liquidator and the creditors, the prospects of salvaging such of the group's operations as might prove to be viable but due to the lack of adequate information as to liabilities and trading prospects and in the absence of financial backing to provide working capital and protect the rights of creditors it was not found possible to take effective action.</P>
    <P>I have no statutory powers which would enable me to hold an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the close down of this group.</P>

In regard to actually taking over the operations of some sections of the group this is a matter which will have to wait for further elucidation because the very complex arrangements in which the various sections of the group are entwined have not been unwound to the satisfaction of anybody who might view the prospect of going in on a business basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the three Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>Let it be perfectly clear at the outset that the Government have interned nobody.  The statement issued by the Government on Friday last did not say that the Government had decided to introduce Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, or to use powers of internment.  The statement, the text of which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be included in the Official Report, referred to the gravity of the situation that had arisen and went on to say that, <i>unless the Government become satisfied that the threat is removed,</i> internment will be introduced.  The purpose of the statement was not to give advance notice of a decision to use internment but, on the contrary, to ensure that, by removing any doubt as to the Government's determination to act, those concerned would have a final opportunity of drawing back and thereby obviating the need for internment.  The Government hope that the statement will have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the fullest consideration and the strictest possible examination the <Col N="485" /> Government believe that the reports from the Garda are absolutely reliable. Details of these reports will not be given.  If the information available could be used as a basis for criminal prosecutions, such prosecutions would be brought.  As matters stand the information cannot be so used because:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the persons giving the information cannot be compelled to come forward and give evidence since so to compel them would expose them to grave personal danger.  The courts have always recognised the privilege of a witness to refuse to give evidence which would expose him or his informant to the risk of such danger;</P>
    <P>(b)  the evidence of these persons could not of course be given otherwise than by themselves directly, under the law of evidence in this country.  It could not be given in court by members of the Garda who received it.</P>
    <P>To give details of such information in the Dáil would be gravely improper for the following reasons :&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to give details of information or any information which might identify source would be open to the same objections of exposing persons to grave personal danger which the courts would hold to warrant privilege.</P>
    <P>(b)  to name or identify a person as a suspect for an offence would be likely to be held to prejudice the fair trial of such a person should evidence become available subsequently which would warrant his being charged and could be presented in court.</P>
    <P>(c)  To give details in the Dáil would prejudice the work of the security forces of the State and achieve no desirable end.</P>
    <P>I might add that the European Convention on Human Rights clearly acknowledge the right of a State to arrest a person suspected of being about to commit a crime and bring him before a competent legal authority with a view to detention in order to prevent the committing of crime.  We do not have such legislation and I am <Col N="486" /> advised that it would be contrary to our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The only course open to the Government in the circumstances in order to ensure safety of life and property was therefore to adopt the course we did.  To fail to take action in the light of the reports received would have been a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>While there is no obligation on the Government to make in the Dáil a statement such as that referred to in the questions, it was hoped to do so last Thursday but this did not prove possible because of the need to give the matter careful and extended consideration and to take appropriate action quickly.</P>
    <P>The Government considered all the repercussions, north and south, that might flow from the warning given. The Government have set their face against violence either north or south and have made this clear on every suitable occasion.  The warning should have no repercussions in terms of similar action in the north as it is directed against a specific plot here.  I would take this opportunity once again of stating the Government's abhorrence of violence in any part of this country and of their intention to confront it.  Those who would engage in violence against the stated views of the Government will be responsible themselves for the consequences.</P>
    <P>Here I wish to state unequivocally that neither the Government nor any member of it had any consultations whatever with any other government or with members of any other government on the subject matter of last Friday's statement prior to or since its issue.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government got a mandate from the people of Ireland in June, 1969, to pursue their progressive policy of economic, social and cultural development and for the peaceful reunification of our country.  We do not intend to put these objectives into jeopardy.  Neither do we intend to allow the trust reposed in the Government to be delegated to or arrogated by any minority group who think they have the right to take the law into their own hands and to act without <Col N="487" /> respect for life or property.  While the voices of such people may be heard in the outcry against the Government's warning a certain amount of responsible reaction is understandable as the possibility of internment is not a pleasant prospect but the Government's statement was made only after deep and mature consideration.  We were conscious, on the other hand, that it would provide an opportunity for some militant groups to raise their voices in support of civil rights and against the Government for, as they allege, suppressing those rights.  But what is conveniently forgotten by such groups is that they themselves are the cause of the Government having to contemplate taking action of this nature.  The Government intend to protect and defend the lawful rights and liberty of our people no matter how unpopular we may become in doing so. This is the least that any government worthy of the name can do.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed the Government that reliable information has come into their possession to the effect that a secret armed conspiracy exists in the country to kidnap one or more prominent persons. Connected with this conspiracy are plans to carry out armed bank robberies which the police believe may well involve murders or attempted murders.</P>
    <P>The Government view with deep gravity the situation arising from this information which has been carefully checked.  They have given the fullest consideration to the problems that this gives rise to and they have decided that, unless they become satisfied that this threat is removed, they will bring into operation, without further notice, Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, which provides for internment.</P>
    <P>The Government have given instructions that places of detention be prepared immediately and the Secretary-General, Council of Europe, is now being informed of the Government's proposals as these proposals will involve derogation from certain provisions <Col N="488" /> of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>This is a serious situation.  The Government trust that those who are most directly involved will appreciate just how serious it is and just how determined the Government are to take effective action when they have already gone to the stage of informing the Council of Europe that derogation from an international Convention is in prospect notwithstanding the gravity of that step.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply and in view of the gravity of the matter referred to in the announcement of Friday last and in the statement made today by the Taoiseach, would he consider affording time for discussion of the position?  I should make it clear to the House that, since the establishment of the State, this party have been opposed strenuously to crime of any sort, including crimes described as political activities.  No one can expect support from me for illegal activities in any form.  At the same time, can the Taoiseach inform the House if the ordinary courts have been found inadequate to deal with the situation and, if so, can he give instances; and secondly, if in those circumstances, it was decided to give advance notice of the intention to reintroduce Part II of the Offences Against the State Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Taoiseach talks in his reply about a specific plot and, I assume, particular people, does he not realise that if Part II of the Offences against the State Act of 1940 is brought in by regulation, it can be applied to any single citizen of this State?  The Taoiseach may have an intention in regard to a certain group which he regards as illegal, but is it not a fact that if any Minister, without consultation with the Taoiseach or the Government or any of his colleagues, takes it into his head to sign a warrant, this can be applied to a farmer, a shopkeeper or a trade unionist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order, I hope.  As for the ordinary process of law, I think the House will be aware that when it comes to plots of this nature there is great difficulty in producing evidence and I have indicated already we do not have the means whereby persons can be brought before a legal authority with a view to detention for the purposes of avoiding the committing of a crime.  The Government's statement of last Friday was directed specifically against people who have these acts in contemplation, for the purpose of avoiding these acts and therefore avoiding the necessity to introduce Part II of the Offences Against the State Act.  The statements in some newspapers about a more widespread application of that part of the Offences Against the State Act are purely speculation and completely unfounded.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that this matter has caused the gravest possible concern to people outside this House whom this House represents, that it is a matter of the utmost relevance to the functioning of our democracy and to the functioning of this House?  In these circumstances may I make the very sincere appeal <Col N="491" /> and suggestion to the Taoiseach that this House, if it is to function at all, should debate this matter fully?  The Taoiseach has mentioned the business before the House, but there is nothing more important to this House than the proper functioning of this State and of our democracy and I would urge therefore that time should be made available for a debate.</P>

Why, if as he has suggested, the best evidence is available, such persons have not been named by him and why such persons have not been involved in the normal processes of the law, and why he should adopt such an ambiguous attitude to a public debate on this matter?</P>

I think it is well known that our legal system as operated in normal conditions is based on the requirement that the prosecution must discharge strictly the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that an offence has been committed under the ordinary rules of evidence, and the rules of evidence in this country are more strict than those in many other countries in this respect.</P>

      <P>I have indicated the difficulty, first of all, of procuring legal evidence that would justify the bringing in of a prosecution in cases like this.  The Deputy will appreciate that as well as I do.  It is because of that difficulty we took what action we thought necessary in the circumstances. We did not want to wait until some person was kidnapped and perhaps subjected to danger because it would then have been too late.  We do not want to see that happening in this country.  Already some of the militant organisations have said they do not propose to carry out kidnappings or the other matters to which I have referred and if this is evidence of the success of the Government's warning I welcome it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, with regard to the motion that was given to you, Sir, and signed by all the members of the Labour Party, I should like to make the following comment: during a long period in this Parliament I have always shown as much respect for the Chair as any other Member.  It is not my intention to abuse the privileges of Parliament but I feel so strongly about the motion the Labour Party put before you today that I must insist, if I can, that this House be given time to debate the statement issued by the Government last Friday in which they threatened to introduce Part II of the Offences Against the State Act.  I trust that in the interval you, Sir, and the Taoiseach have had time to think about the matter and that you have changed your minds with regard to having an immediate debate.  It was not my intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With due respect, Sir, in accordance with Standing Order 29, you had discretion to decide whether there would be an adjournment debate on the subject matter of the motion we are discussing.  It was not my intention, nor is it my intention, to talk about the merits or demerits of the Offences Against the State Act but merely the merits of the motion that was put before you.  I wish to submit, because of the seriousness of the Government statement of last Friday, that Members of the House&mdash;the Parliament of the 26 Counties&mdash;should be given an opportunity to make their contributions, whether they be for or against the implementation of Part II of the Offences Against the State Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
