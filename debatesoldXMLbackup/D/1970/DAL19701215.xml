      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health why he did not circulate the report of his consultants to the members of health boards before their meetings; when such reports were available to him; and if he proposes to circulate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Copies of the report of the consultants on management in the health boards were not received in my Department until 27th November, 1970, and then only in limited numbers.  The reports were circulated to all members of health boards as soon as possible after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, while the matter of the administrative and headquarters units of health boards was dealt with in that report, one health board decided where such an administrative unit should be sited without having had adequate time to look at this efficiency report?  Since the Minister had this report at the luncheon he gave on the Thursday previous to the Monday on which the decision was made, does the Minister not think he should have circulated the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be meetings later of the health boards to discuss management structure.  The report deals with management structure and powers of delegation to the chief executive officers.  The report deals with those matters and no others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the management structure would deal with the siting of administrative units?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was clearly stated in the Act that it was a matter for health boards to decide.  If health boards find difficulty in securing offices they can presumably rescind their resolution and choose some other location.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that there is a very long waiting list for school children who require dental braces to be fitted; and that as a result many of these children will not be able to avail themselves of this service; and what measures can be taken to rectify this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to school children who have been recommended for orthodontic treatment under the school dental service.  As I have already explained in reply to a recent question, in most areas this specialised form of treatment is available only from the Dublin Dental Hospital.  However, some health authorities have been able to make arrangements with private orthodontists to provide local sessions for children in their areas and the Local Appointments Commissioners will advertise, soon, the post of wholetime orthodontist for the Dublin area, the area in which I assume the Deputy is particularly interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is satisfied that the present school dental service is adequate; and, if not, what proposals he has for improving the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the school dental service, at present, is not adequate to provide comprehensive dental treatment for all pupils of national schools found to be in need of such treatment following school health examination.  Dental services for these children are provided mainly by wholetime dental officers employed by health authorities.  In recent years, a special effort has been made, by means of more attractive salaries and conditions of appointment, to recruit additional wholetime dental officers and this has resulted in an appreciable improvement in the overall staffing position.  Continued efforts will be made to increase the staffing of the school dental service to a reasonable level. <Col N="912" /> In the course of the present week the Local Appointments Commissioners are advertising a further 29 posts of permanent dental officer on terms of remuneration which, so far as I am aware, compare favourably with those of similar posts in neighbouring countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he will consider, in the interests of prevention or reduction of blindness in this country, the establishment of a national register of the blind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some consideration has been given by my Department to the establishment of a national register of the blind.  While no final decision has yet been taken, it is not clear from the preliminary examination of the matter that the benefits to be derived from the establishment of such a register would justify the allocation to it of the financial and staff resources which would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate how extensive was what he described as &ldquo;some consideration&rdquo;? How extensively has the matter been considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking into it.  The object would be to identify the prevalence and incidence of blindness and its various causes, but we have other means of doing that and I do not think it will be necessary to have a register from the social welfare point of view&mdash;incidentally that would be a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;to ensure that everybody who should get a blind allowance is, in fact, getting it.  I cannot see the necessity for that.  The only other reason would be that having such a register might make is possible to warn people of some of the avoidable causes of blindness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate the object of my question is to suggest that in the interests of the eradication or prevention of blindness such a register might be significant because it might help to isolate the causes of blindness</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The time available up to the end of the transitional period should suffice for the industries in question to prepare for Common Market conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the principals of both industries have indicated that there will be grave trouble in these industries if we do not get special terms for them?  Does the Minister not realise that the terms of the Anglo-lrish Free Trade Area Agreement may seriously affect the position even before the Common Market affects it at all?  One of the safeguards should be special terms for the boot and shoe industry and the electrical goods industry.  Is the Minister aware that, where the electrical goods industry is concerned, there was a very high rate of redundancy in other countries in the Common Market and, if we do not get special terms, as we continue with our reductions in tarrifs, which we seem to be doing, we will have serious trouble in this industry so far as employment is concerned?  As well as asking for special terms in the jute and car assembly industry we should ask for special terms for these two as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The transitional period is expected to be about five years.  It is expected there will be a <Col N="914" /> period of two years before we get in. That will give us seven years from now during which time such industries will have an opportunity of working towards full free trade conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is far too serious to let it go like that.  Surely if there was a serious situation in the jute industry and the car assembly industry, the figure of seven years mentioned by the Minister refers to them also and, if there is danger in the case of these two industries, why do we not take up a special bargaining position as other continental countries have done in the Common Market situation, and ask for special terms for these two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what bargaining position to adopt is primarily a matter for the negotiators. There is provision under article 226 of the Rome Treaty for special protective duties to be imposed in the interests of any industry which may suffer during the transitional period.  That particular article can be invoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to wait then until the suffering has occurred?  Is that the Government's line?  If we can ask in the case of the jute and car assembly industries, why can we not ask in the case of the other two?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that preferential treatment was secured, and rightly so, for certain Irish industries?  Is it not an amazing state of affairs that, in respect of the boot and shoe industry, which was known to be vulnerable in free trade circumstances, the terms were very much worse?  Is the Minister not further aware that, since the abolition of the quota last July, there has been an increasing volume of imported footwear, resulting in serious dislocation, closures, redundancies and unemployment and, in those circumstances, would the Minister ensure that immediate steps are taken to stop the flood of foreign imports?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The footwear industry is in an entirely different position compared with the jute and car assembly industries.  The latter faced complete elimination whereas the footwear industry has faced up to the free trade conditions since 1966, to such an extent that current exports are running in the order of £3.5 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, if the present trend continues in imported footwear, some 2,000,000 pairs of boots and shoes will be surplus before the first year is out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>Irish emigrants qualify for British health, social security and other benefits on the same basis as the rest of the population in Great <Col N="916" /> Britain.  The Irish Embassy in London arranges for the repatriation of Irish persons who are destitute and unfit for work by reason of ill health and who may not qualify for hospital treatment or benefits under the British health services or national insurances because as new arrivals they have not yet registered.  The cost of repatriating the wives and children of such persons is also borne by the embassy. The embassy also repatriates young persons and expectant unmarried mothers and unmarried mothers within six months of the birth of the child.</P>
      <P>The embassy maintains close liaison and collaborates with the Irish welfare centres in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool and with several diocesan welfare societies, and reimburses to such centres and societies expenditure incurred by them in arranging the repatriation of persons in the categories referred to above.</P>
      <P>The embassy also co-operates with the children's departments of local authorities in Britain and with the British probation services in cases affecting the welfare of young persons from Ireland and arranges their repatriation where necessary.</P>
      <P>The embassy maintains close liaison with Irish organisations and groups throughout Britain and through its contacts with these organisations and groups and with local clergy the embassy is able to have distress cases promptly investigated and advice or assistance provided where this is called for.</P>
      <P>The embassy does everything possible to inform emigrants in Britain of employment opportunities in Ireland as compiled and publicised by the Department of Labour and provides relevant information for those wishing to return to Ireland.</P>
      <P>A special officer was appointed to the embassy in 1961 to keep contact with Irish organisations and groups in Great Britain engaged in helping Irish emigrants.  In 1968 an officer with the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary was appointed to the embassy for the same purpose.  The Government are considering further ways in which to assist Irish emigrants in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The Goverment foresaw the possibility of a situation developing in which they would be obliged to take measures derogating from some of their obligations under the Convention and felt that, in the interest of maximum co-operation, they should inform the Secretary-General not of an intention to derogate from the Convention but of the possibility of their being obliged to do so.  Copies of the letter to the Secretary-General from the permanent representative and of the reply have been placed in the Dáil Library.  In the event that the Government do in fact take measures in derogation of the Convention they will of course inform the Secretary-General as required by article 15 (3) of the Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if it is his Department's policy that State-sponsored companies should ascertain, before placing large and valuable contracts, that Republic of Ireland tenderers have had every opportunity to quote fairly and arrange or vary detailed items, so as to place themselves in a competitive position; and, if so, if this happened in the case of every large tender of £1,000,000 or more placed by State-sponsored companies in the recent past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy and also the established practice in the State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department to afford every opportunity to Irish firms to compete for contracts.  The State bodies are very conscious of the desirability of using Irish materials and products and they allow for an element of preference in favour of Irish firms in their purchases and contracts.  When drawing up specifications with a view to inviting tenders, the State-sponsored bodies, in order to make the maximum use of Irish materials and contractors, take full account of the necessity for specifying works and materials in a form convenient for tendering by Irish firms. These factors were taken into consideration in all recent large contracts placed by the State bodies with which I am concerned.</P>

On the commencement of the rural electrification scheme, it was decided, with the agreement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was then responsible for the ESB, that all connections except those in towns of over 2,000 population, and in some smaller towns which already had supply before the commencement of the scheme, would qualify for subsidy. The position still obtains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of keeping rents of Dublin Corporation dwellings low in 1969-70 was about £3,800,000 of which £1,900,000 came from the Exchequer.  Rent income in the same <Col N="932" /> year was about £2,600,000.  The average subsidy per dwelling was about £78, borne in approximately equal proportions by my Department and the rates. The total subsidy represented an average of about 59 per cent of the total running costs of corporation housing in the year in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The management and allocation of purchase houses are matters for the local authorities concerned. I understand that Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Corporations have allowed purchasers who so wish to occupy some such houses under caretakers' agreements, pending the finalisation of the sale of the houses, in return for payment of amounts necessary to cover loan and other charges which have to be met by the local authorities in respect of the houses.  The arrangement is one between the local authorities and the purchasers and I have no function in the matter.  I have had no complaints about the agreements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the lack of proper statistics on (i) the number of homeless people in Dublin and other major towns, (ii) the number of people living in substandard accommodation and (iii) the number who do not qualify for inclusion on housing lists, he will consider setting up a body to investigate the true situation with a view to determining the real housing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is a lack of proper statistics regarding these types of housing needs. The Housing Act, 1966, imposes on housing authorities the obligation to make an inspection of dwellings in their functional area at least once in every five years and to ascertain the number of houses which are unfit or unsuitable for human habitation, and the amount of overcrowding which exists.  Having regard to this information and any other relevant information they are required to assess the adequacy of the supply of housing and the prospective future demand for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> In assessing their housing needs, the authorities must have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the following primary objectives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the repair, closure, or demolition of houses which are unfit or unsuitable for human habitation; (b) the elimination of overcrowding; (c) the provision of adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons&mdash;including elderly or disabled persons&mdash;who, in the opinion of the authority, are in need of and are unable to provide such accommodation from their own resources; (d) the provision of adequate housing accommodation for persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>The first assessments of housing needs under the Act were made by local authorities generally in respect of the period ending 31 st March, 1971. These assessments were examined in my Department and the Government's considered views are set out in Chapter 1 of the White Paper <i>Housing in the Seventies.</i> Further assessments will now be made in respect of the period to 31st March, 1976.</P>
    <P>The information obtained in the course of these assessments is supplemented from time to time by advertisements issued by individual housing authorities requesting families in need of housing to apply to them.  Dublin Corporation in particular are at present completing a comprehensive review of their approved waiting list, and when this review has been completed, they will have a full picture of the circumstances of current applicants for corporation housing in the Dublin area.  I do not consider it either necessary or desirable to set up yet another body to investigate housing needs.  I regard the local housing authority as the body best qualified to do this.</P>

      <P>There are various ways of assisting and enabling the local authorities to acquire land besides giving them a loan direct from the <Col N="940" /> Local Loans Fund.  We allow them to carry overdraft accommodation.  The cost of the land can be merged with the cost of the housing scheme when the scheme is about to start and can be met then by a comprehensive loan out of the Local Loans Fund in that way.  The local authority can arrange bridging finance.  It is purely a matter of arranging their finances.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the total number of postal votes on the current electoral registers in Donegal-Leitrim and South County Dublin; if he is aware that the political parties generally are aware of the precise number of such votes cast in the recent by-elections and of the total number of such votes cast for each candidate; and if he regards this practice as being in accordance with current electoral law and in the public interest generally, more particularly as members of the Garda and Army are directly involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of postal voters on the current register of electors for the constituency of Donegal-Leitrim is 142 and for the constituency of South County Dublin is 411.  My attention has been drawn to the statement which appeared in some Dublin newspapers on Thursday, 3rd December, purporting to give detailed results of the postal voting at the by-election in the Donegal-Leitrim constituency.  I do not know the source of this statement.  In accordance with the electoral law all the ballot papers, including postal ballot papers, for a constituency are thoroughly mixed before the votes are counted and there is no question of counting the votes cast by postal voters separately or of ascertaining and announcing a separate result in respect of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The electoral law prescribes an elaborate procedure for dealing with postal voters' papers designed to preserve the secrecy of the postal ballot and at the same time eliminate any abuses. Among other things this procedure requires the returning officer at some time between the close of the poll and the start of the count to check the documents returned by postal voters&mdash;that is, the ballot paper, ballot paper receipt and ballot paper envelope&mdash;to ensure their authenticity.  Agents of candidates are entitled to be present at this process. I agree that publication of statements of the kind referred to is not desirable and returning officers have been advised to carry out the check of <Col N="943" /> the postal papers in such a way that the trend of the postal vote is not apparent to agents present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I take it the Minister agrees that the counting of postal votes is totally different from the counting of others because there may be only 30 or 40 votes from a known group of people. The Minister should see to it that these votes are checked strictly in accordance with the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to add to any great extent to that which I have already said.  I should, before concluding, however, like to say that in common with other speakers I am not happy with the situation where CIE are looking for £5½ million, where in the city of Dublin they carried 7,000,000 fewer passengers, even though the number of double-decker buses they had last year has been increased. This is a situation which cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>It is a rather sad development that former arteries of transportation such as rivers, canals and railways, are hindering the solution of the Dublin traffic problem.  A canal and a railway, both of which contributed much to Dublin transport in their day are now retarding normal development.  In so far as CIE are the inheritors of these canals and railways, there is an obligation on them to exploit as far as possible these two means of transport.  I know that in times of conservation it may be regarded as sacrilege for me to say that I would not be opposed to the suggestion that the Royal Canal, up to a point beyond Binn's Bridge, should be closed and that, instead of the canal, we would have there a roadway which would help service the north city and, in the future, to service the expanding areas around Castleknock and Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>I would suggest, too, to CIE, that the cost of providing on the existing railway there a passenger service for people travelling in from Phibsboro, Cabra, Ballymum and out to Ashtown and Blanchardstown would not be very great and would help very much towards relieving the road congestion problem on the north side of the city.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the House for a very constructive debate on this Bill which at times was very wide ranging and raised many matters which are not directly related to the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> The Bill is a quite straightforward one.  It is to increase the annual grant for the current year to CIE, in addition to the grant of £2.65 million to add £2.98 million as subsidy for the current year.  Side by side with this I mentioned in my opening speech that we have now initiated a very close examination of the whole structure of CIE and in particular of the railway side of CIE in conjunction with independent consultants.  These consultants were appointed during the debate last week.  They are McKinseys Ltd., one of the leading firms of international consultants in the world who have already given us very valuable advice on the organisation and management structure of the ESB which we have implemented in the past six months and which has been greeted with satisfaction all round within the ESB.  One of the problems there was to devise a management structure on which responsibility would properly devolve.</P>

      <P>There is to be an urgent and immediate study of the whole railway structure.  I hope to have the result inside the next three months with a view to assessing precisely what we will do in regard to the railways in the coming years.  It will include an investigation into the operations of CIE as a whole.</P>
      <P>Some suggestions were made during the debate as to what should be done in this regard.  I should like to clear the air with regard to one or two matters about this aspect.  As far as the operations of CIE are concerned I can quote from the very latest figures which show that all the operations of CIE, other than the railway system, are commercially profitable operations. This must be emphasised and it cannot be emphasised enough in order to put the record right.  Although this has been stated by me on several occasions already, obviously there was wrong information in the minds of some Deputies about this.  I will just quote the very latest figures, which are for 1969-70.  The situation is that the Dublin city road passenger service showed a surplus of £61,000 in 1969-70. The provincial road passenger service showed a profit of £633,000.  The tours and private hire aspect showed a profit of £133,000 and the road freight section showed a profit of £84,000. The hotels and catering end showed a profit of £193,000 and the railways showed a loss of £4,212,000 in the same year.</P>

      <P>For 1969-70.  I will not go through the figures for 1968-69. Suffice it to say that the very same pattern is evident there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us what he knows about 1970-71 up to the present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another day's work.  Suffice it to say that this has been the pattern for some years and it was pretty well duplicated in 1968-69.  I have no reason to believe that a similar pattern will not emerge in 1970-71.  The canals showed a loss of £95,000 in the current year.  In regard to the canals we are at present discussing with the Office of Public Works the question of absorbing the canal system into the overall Shannon navigation system operated by the Office of Public Works as a service to the community, to maintain the canals as a tourist amenity and as an attraction for boating and holidays.  It is an undoubted attraction and this obtains particularly with regard to the Grand Canal, which is the sole link to the east coast from the Shannon waterway system.  It is my view that the Grand Canal must be retained&mdash;CIE are under statutory obligation to maintain it at present&mdash;and while I do not see any great future for it as a commercial waterway I do see a tremendous future for it as a tourist amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The complaint of people who boat on the canal is that there are no petrol stations on the canal and this is a source of irritation to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as this is in the hands of a commercial carrier such as CIE I do not see that it can be developed in that way.  What we propose to do is to enable the Office of Public Works&mdash;and this will require legislation&mdash;to assume control of the Grand Canal and the canal system generally along with the development of the Shannon which they are doing at the moment in conjunction with Bord Fáilte supplying buoys, better navigational aids, signs and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net problem of the railways remains.  Many ideas were advanced in the debate as lo what should be done: <Col N="956" /> whether the other component parts which were showing a profit should be established as independent companies, whether the railway system should be isolated and given a definite subsidy by the House, whether it would be in the interest of the community to retain a rail system as a social service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  If the other aspects of ClE's activities, the bus services, the tour services, the hotel services and the road freight services were established as independent commercial companies, I have no doubt they would continue to make money. However, I want to emphasise that there are savings involved under the present system, whereby you have a single management structure, a single personnel department, etc., so that to that extent there is a saving under the present system.  You might find the railways system being still further burdened by being isolated in that way. That is one of the problems involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of investigation towards which I have directed the <Col N="957" /> minds of the consultants.  They will come up with the options which would be open to us and then we can have a full debate here.  It is a matter which requires a full debate.  Leaving aside the commercial operations of CIE, we have to consider the pros and cons of maintaining the railway system in the community interest and decide whether it is good or bad for the community to maintain a rail system.  That is the type of debate we should have.  As far as I am concerned I think we must continue to maintain the railway system, having regard to the road congestion problem.  It is necessary, in the long run, to have an alternative method of transport if only because of the overall, social cost saving of congestion of roads, time wasted on roads, and the possible massive investment required on roads if railways were to be abandoned.  Many of these factors will have to be taken into account in order to come to a proper decision on that aspect but I should like to see it isolated and displayed fully for the problem that it is and the community have to pay.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not <Col N="958" /> admit that.  In the context of the time it was the right decision.  Even if the line were reinstated it possibly would not be in the best location.  Other living areas in the city have developed at a greater rate, including Ballyfermot, than the area formerly served by the Harcourt Street line.  The view of CIE is that even if the Harcourt Street line was reinstated it would not make money because it is not in a growth area in regard to population or business potential.</P>

      <P>A peripheral bus service on route 17, Dolphin's Barn and Blackrock, was introduced this year and on route 18, Ballyfermot and Sandymount Green.  These new peripheral routes are proving very successful and CIE are doing everything they can to increase this sort of business because it is obviously desirable to have these routes between shopping centres, housing estates and working areas out in the periphery instead of bringing buses through the centre of the city. The idea is to diminish centre city bus traffic as far as possible.  A number of steps have been taken to remove terminal points from within the city centre area.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that that is a matter which the men can negotiate with CIE themselves.</P>
      <P>I shall take up in correspondence the points of detail mentioned by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy O'Donnell in their speeches.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney referred to private bus operators.  CIE have no function in regard to whether a licence is given to a private bus operator or not; that is a matter for me.  I consider what CIE have to say about the matter but I do not follow ClE's line in every respect.  I welcome private bus operators and I am looking at ways and means of liberalising further in that direction, as we are doing on the road freight side under the Road Transport Bill currently before the House.  Competition is welcome and I am certain CIE will face it both on the road freight side and on the bus passenger side.</P>
      <P>Complaints have been made about increases in fares and it is a fact of life that fares have risen in the past six months.  I have made comparisons with cities in Britain, Europe and America and substantial increases have taken place which put their fares ahead of ours.  Public transport systems in every city in the world are finding it difficult to make themselves pay.  The pattern of reductions in numbers of passengers on the Dublin city services is paralleled in every city in the world.  It is primarily a reflection of improved standards of living and more private motoring rather than increases in fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a contract for carriages being placed by CIE with an outside company has also been mentioned. This matter has not yet been finalised and I am glad to say that the CIE management and the trade unions concerned are making real progress in their <Col N="960" /> talks about having finishing work in relation to that contract executed in the Inchicore Works.  I want to thank the trade unions for their co-operation in this matter.</P>
    <P>The question of having a committee system of the Oireachtas on the lines of the Public Accounts Committee has been mentioned and I am in favour of it.  The Minister for Finance is investigating the implications of this at the moment.  This recommendation was made in the Devlin Report and I am fully in favour of it.  I have discussed the matter with various executives of State bodies and members of the boards of State bodies.  Many of these people felt there was a lack of information about what they were doing and about what they were not doing, what sort of policy line they were working on and what was the policy thinking behind decisions made by them.  They felt there was a lack of information and liaison between themselves, public representatives and the public generally and apart from the interests of the House in inquiring into their activities in the interests of taxpayers. They welcomed the idea, from the point of view of their own image and standing <i>vis-à-vis</i> this House and the public, of coming before such a committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>The Minister for Finance is going through the Devlin Report point by point.  He has set up a separate administrative structure in the Department of Finance to deal with personnel and human relations.  This section has now been separated from the part of the Department of Finance concerned with budgetary matters and economic development.  The main recommendation in the Devlin Report was that a separate department be established on the administration side. A further development is that State-sponsored bodies should be brought within the ambit of committee control, as Departments are at the moment, under the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

As I said in my opening speech, this is an <i>ad hoc</i> measure to deal with an immediate problem.  By the time the Estimate debate comes around we should have the preliminary report on the rail system, which I mentioned.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to continue the Exchange Control Act, 1954, in operation for a further period of four years.  That Act is due to expire on 31st December, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exchange control has been in force to a varying degree since 1939, when sterling ceased to be freely convertible into other currencies.  The imposition of restrictions on the convertibility of that currency made it necessary for us, in common with the other sterling area countries, to control our payments to and receipts from non-sterling countries. This control was necessary to help safeguard the foreign exchange reserves of the sterling area to which we have access for our requirements of foreign currencies.  Foreign exchange has been readily available to Irish residents for all bona fide current payments for a number of years but control <Col N="963" /> of capital transfers continues to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Exchange control was first operated under emergency legislation.  This was replaced in 1954 by the Exchange Control Act.  The Act was expressed to expire on 31st December, 1958, as it was hoped that the need for control would have ceased by that time.  As this hope was not realised, the operation of the Act was extended in 1958 and again in 1962 and 1966.</P>
    <P>The 1954 Act gives power to control:&mdash;</P>
    <P>payments to and payments on behalf of persons resident outside the sterling area;</P>
    <P>dealings in gold and foreign exchange;</P>
    <P>dealings in and the export of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities;</P>
    <P>dealings in sterling area securities on behalf of persons resident outside the area;</P>
    <P>the export of currency notes and the manner of payment for goods exported outside the sterling area. </P>
    <P>The Act also empowers the Minister for Finance to specify foreign currencies which must be sold to a bank so that they may come into the common pool.  It further contains power to require the deposit of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities with an authorised depository but it has not been found necessary to bring these latter provisions into operation.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for the grant of exemptions by regulations from compliance with requirements of the Act and for the giving of general or limited permissions to carry out transactions. These provisions are being operated so that, as I have said already, all current payments may now be made by Irish residents and such supervision as is applied is designed to ensure that current transactions are not used as a cover for unauthorised capital transfers.</P>
    <P>As regards capital payments, persons wishing to make direct or portfolio investments outside the sterling area are not generally permitted to transfer capital for this purpose at the <Col N="964" /> official rate of exchange.  Investment currency may be purchased for the purpose but this currency usually stands at a substantial premium over the official exchange rates.  Sales of foreign currency securities are permitted but are subject to compliance with certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The day-to-day administration of exchange control is in the hands of the Central Bank to which it was delegated in 1965.</P>
    <P>The House may expect me to comment on exchange control in relation to the EEC.  There is nothing in the legislation to prevent us from meeting the obligations of membership of the EEC.  The Treaty of Rome requires member states to abolish progressively restrictions on capital movements between themselves to the extent necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the Common Market.  The progress in this direction to date by the Community has not gone greatly beyond what is permitted under our current exchange control practice.  The EEC have, however, liberalised certain transactions which are still subject to close control under our practice.  The principal transactions which they have liberalised are direct investment in business undertakings and the purchase of publicly quoted securities.</P>
    <P>Under our exchange control legislation as it is proposed to continue it in the Bill we will be able to give effect to EEC liberalisation measures as desired. This can be done by making suitable amending regulations and giving necessary permissions.  As far as can be foreseen at present, the legislation should be adequate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC. It may, however, emerge that changes will be necessary or desirable in the light of the terms settled for entry into the Community or of developments in the Community itself.</P>
    <P>Whatever the future may hold, there is no immediate prospect that sterling will become freely convertible on capital account.  It is clear that we need to retain the 1954 Exchange Control Act. I am asking the House to agree to its extension for a further period of four years and I recommend the Bill for approval on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great <Col N="965" /> objection to this Bill, save in one respect.  There is control under the present exchange control arrangement over dealings in gold where ordinary citizens are concerned.  In a single short paragraph the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>The day-to-day administration of exchange control is in the hands of the Central Bank to which it was delegated in 1965. </P>
      <P>I have no objection at all to that.  The truth is there has been little or no exchange control as far as the ordinary citizen is concerned for quite a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak now about the sale of gold by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has control and, having that control, it proceeded to sell about £25 million worth of our gold reserves, if my memory serves me correctly, over a period of about 18 months. These are not the sort of people to whom I would give this power, not for one moment.  The ordinary citizen cannot buy or sell gold and, because of that, there is the inference to be drawn that gold is a very valuable commodity. The belief in gold by humanity did not start yesterday or the day before, whereas the belief that we are going into the EEC did start a year or two ago.  I do not know why the greater part of our gold reserves, small though they are, are being sold for paper to other countries by the Central Bank. They might at least have waited until they were quite sure of the outcome of the present international struggle which goes on continuously and in which the International Monetary Fund was on the verge of being defeated by the French two years ago. We might criticise how certain things are put in the Bill but people are entitled to put things as they wish to put them; it is not a matter to which I object greatly.  I would have much more faith in the Central Bank of Ireland as exchange controllers if they did not sell at a price, in terms of dollars, which was fixed many years ago.  They would be quite within their rights to sell that gold on the free market; they would have got a substantially higher price for it.  I am objecting to their parting with our <Col N="966" /> small gold holdings just the same as the Bank of Ireland parted with the previous Irish gold reserves.</P>
    <P>We are told that we got 7 per cent on the money and that the price of gold would need to double over 14 or 15 years to cover that kind of &ldquo;loss&rdquo;. Other countries talk about their gold reserves; it is a matter of continuous comment.  Therefore, in my opinion it is a most serious matter.  If the balance of payments should go really wrong, it would be very important indeed for this country, in certain circumstances, to have even £25 million worth of gold. It might be worth £50 million or £100 million within the next decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donovan that there is no objection to this Bill and that the power sought should be given to the Minister.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that, as far as can be foreseen, legislation should be adequate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC. I do not know what is in mind in that regard.  Discussions are taking place and probably decisions are being aimed at in relation to the whole monetary policy inside Europe.  Not being members of the EEC, we can take no part in these discussions and certainly we can play no part in whatever decisions may be arrived at.  It is well to appreciate that the aim of the present discussions is the making of tentative decisions&mdash;apparently to be guide lines for the future.  As a candidate country for membership, we should seek the fullest information as to the nature of these discussions and the nature of the proposals with regard to monetary policy as it will effect Europe and inevitably affect us should we become members of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not satisfactory to have a position, as disclosed in this House last week by the Minister for External Affairs, that we have not sought even observer status at the Werner Commission discussions in progress at the moment arising out of the Werner report.  I should like to feel that the Government are carefully watching developments.  They are aimed at providing eventually in Europe liquidity of money and of capital.  That may be a desirable aim but the manner in which it will be achieved is necessarily <Col N="967" /> of concern to us.  Pending such a situation, the need for continued exchange control exists.  As the present Act expires at the end of this month, I do not think the four years now sought is unreasonable and certainly this Bill will have our agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing that the present Act will expire at the end of this month, why did the Government wait until this 11½th hour to introduce this Bill?  Next, what is the reason for a period of four years?  The Minister says it would be easy to bring in amendments if we got into the EEC. It would be much better for us not to get into the EEC but, if Britain goes in, we have no option.  If we go in, what arrangements or what proposals are being made to try to streamline the exchange control?  There is a big fight going on in the EEC over finance in general&mdash;the system of currency and, indeed, the system of exchange control in the various countries.  Surely the Minister should have told us the difficulties so far as what is happening in the EEC at the moment is concerned <i>vis-à-vis</i> our plans?  What measures does he propose to take to streamline, if that should be necessary?</P>
      <P>If this Bill is not enacted before 1st January, 1971, it could cause quite an upheaval in this country.  Anything could have happened to prevent its passage through this Parliament.  It is rather peculiar that this Bill should come before us at the last minute.  Is there some peculiar reason for this procedure?  On the face of it, this is not good enough; it should not be presented at the last minute with the warning that it must become law within the next two-and-a-half weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has said that gold does not earn interest, and that is all they are interested in.  It seems a very illogical argument.  Why do we not sell all the gold reserves in that case?  What is the balance of gold reserves held by the Central Bank on our behalf?</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about foreign banks located in Ireland and about whether controls are exercised over capital transfers through foreign banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> Are we satisfied sufficient control exists?  I also wonder is it an offence to sell gold coins.  The Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputies will, perhaps, be aware that gold coins are constantly being sold at auctions in Ireland.  Is this an offence and, if so, what is being done about it?  I am also wondering what gold we made available for gold medallions that were sold to commemorate the 1916 Rising and which were £50 or £55 at the time and which are now fetching over £130 and which are being sold regularly in Dublin.  If selling gold coins is an offence the law is being ignored constantly because these coins are being bought and sold every day of the week. Also, how much of this gold used for medallions and so on is going abroad and is there control over it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in a number of points in connection with this matter as a member of the Executive of the Irish Council of the European Movement and, particularly the section which relates to the Treaty of Rome and the obligations we shall have when that Treaty arises.  I am glad the Minister made the observation, which indeed the House would expect him to make, as to the effect of this legislation in the context of the European money market when that position arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that there is nothing in the proposed legislation to prevent us from meeting the obligations of EEC membership and he states that the treaty of Rome requires member States to abolish progressively restrictions on capital movements between themselves to the extent necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the Common Market.  I was very glad to hear the Minister make that comment because that was one of the particular considerations I was asked to bring forward when this matter came before the House.  A number of my constituents were concerned about it.  The situation is not altogether clarified in the Minister's statement but at least we know that when we have to meet our obligations under the legislation provided by the Treaty of Rome, <Col N="969" /> capital and its movement will be well taken care of.</P>
    <P>I should also like to have some comment on the powers which the 1954 Act gives to control payments to and on behalf of persons resident outside the sterling area, dealings in gold and foreign exchange.  I do not pretend to be an economist but when I heard Deputy O'Connell mentioning gold, particularly sovereigns and so on, I agreed with him in that there is a movement or some sort of attempt being made to allow those sovereigns or their equivalents out of the country and I think this is wrong.  The Parliamentary Secretary might not have the full facts at his disposal now but there should be an answer to Deputy O'Connell's questions which would answer mine also.</P>
    <P>In regard to dealings in, and the export of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities on behalf of persons resident outside the State, this Act empowers the administration to specify the sort of currency that must be sold to a bank to come within the common pool.  The Act contains power to require the deposit of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities with an authorised repository.  This is another question that might give rise to an answer which the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to give when replying. I am not addressing him because I am sure the House understands it may be difficult for him to do so but, what is an authorised depository within the meaning of this legislation?</P>
    <P>It is fair to point out that this legislation covers dealings by Irish nationals and makes clear provision that if they seek permission to indulge in or operate in the foreign currency market they must seek this permission.  There should not be too much restriction in that regard.  It is important also that there should be a reply to this question. The State takes control of the day-to-day administration of exchange control which is in the hands of the Central Bank.  This was delegated to the Central Bank in 1965.  I assume the present legislation leaves control with the Central Bank.  That is as it should be.  I should be particularly glad to have clarified, not necessarily now but in the <Col N="970" /> very near future before we must enter into very serious obligations under the Treaty of Rome, the full effects these obligations will have on the Irish £1. This is a very serious consideration which should be given serious thought as should the answers to this question. I did not intend intervening on this Bill which is not in my line, so to speak, but a number of my constituents were worried in regard to it and, apart from any general interest which Deputies like myself might have in this very important legislation, that is why I decided to speak.</P>

      <P>A number of very delicate and difficult matters were raised regarding international exchange control.  Deputy O'Donovan commented on the sale of gold reserves and Deputy O'Connell asked what our present gold reserves are.  They are of the order of £6.7 million.  It is fair to point out with regard to gold, as has been stated by the Minister on an earlier occasion in the House, that it does not give any income.  In fact, the Central Bank instead hold dollars and other foreign currency which give a substantial income but there is more to it than the income.  It is also desirable for the diversification of our assets with regard to the international market.</P>

      <P>Of course, and also other currencies are of certain standing on the international market.  While the Minister has already explained it I trust that meets that particular point.  Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Andrews rightly raised the question of the implications with regard to the EEC monetary policy and whether or not this takes into account the development of that monetary policy.  Although I accept the necessity for Deputy O'Higgins's commendations and warnings I am sure he will appreciate that the monetary policy in the EEC is only in its early stages.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to hear that realistic assessment from the Deputy.  We will, of course, as full members, also be consulted with regard <Col N="974" /> to any changes in monetary policy.  As far as we understand, in the meantime there is no change in exchange control foreseen.  Deputy Dr. O'Connell was concerned about the question of buying and selling gold medallions and matters of that sort.  It does not need to be said specifically in the House but we are all aware&mdash;if not from our own personal experience possibly from that of some of our friends who are interested in antiques and matters of that sort&mdash;that it is not, of course, an offence to sell or to deal internally in antique gold or medals or anything of that sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some qualifications to what I have just said. It is perfectly legal to deal in antique gold here but if permission is required to export gold&mdash;the Central Bank deal with all such applications&mdash;any dealer who is concerned with the export of gold must first make application to the Central Bank.  I can assure the Deputy that, as far as I have ascertained, the dealers have always complied fully with that requirement.  I do not know whether the Deputy would suggest that we should or should not&mdash;it is not relevant on this Bill in any event&mdash;amend our regulations in regard to the internal sale of gold and gold coins.  This is a matter which can be clarified later, although I understand there are no such internal restrictions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews expressed concern with regard to the EEC effect on our currency, which I have already dealt with.  He also wanted to know who is, in fact, an authorised depository.  We have no such person here but in England an authorised depository is apparently accepted as being a stockbroker or a bank.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In line 12 to delete &ldquo;1970-71&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;1971-72&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> The object of this amendment is to remove from section I the period in which this Bill takes effect.  Section 1 proposes that the section should operate for the year 1970-71.  I propose that we should substitute the year 1971-72.  My reason for doing so is that section I is the taxing section and, while not altering the rate of income tax, its effect is that in relation to income tax payable by companies the former relief available on corporation profits tax is being removed with the result that under section 1 in respect of income tax and corporation profits tax a company will now pay 58 per cent of its profits instead of 50 per cent. That is an increase of 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>This may be justifiable and defensible in relation to a normal trading year.  A case may be made by the Minister for Finance in relation to a company that has due notice in relation to its trading position and that carries on its activities knowing what the score is.  A case may be made to justify an increase in taxation of this dimension. It is a very significant and considerable increase to take from the trading profits of a company 16 per cent more by way of taxation.</P>
    <P>Under the section it is proposed to apply that position in respect of income tax for the year 1970-71.  It seems to me, on the information available to me, that the section as it stands would result in a very significant imposition of extra taxation on many companies.  I refer in particular to a company with an accounting year ending on 30th April.  That seems to apply to one-third of all Irish companies.  That is a very large number of companies.</P>
    <P>Under this section as it is drafted, such a company will be faced with the following position.  It will already have paid corporation profits tax because corporation profits tax is paid as the profits are earned.  It will then find that it has to deal with its income tax position. Income tax is necessarily paid in arrears as opposed to corporation profits tax which is paid immediately.</P>
    <P>A company with an accounting period ending on 30th April, 1969, will be due to pay income tax in January, 1971, although it will already have discharged <Col N="977" /> its corporation profits tax liability in January of this year.  Having paid its corporation profits tax in January of this trading year, January, 1970, in its accounts for the year ending in April, 1969, provision will have been made for corporation profits tax and income tax at 50 per cent.  The same will have been done in respect of the trading year ending in April, 1970.</P>
    <P>Following from that, the shareholders will have received their dividends and their statement of accounts and the position will have been reached whereby a company, knowing its profits and dealing with its total tax liability, dealing with its position <i>vis-à-vis</i> its shareholders, will have declared an account.  Now this section comes into operation and that company is fixed with the fact that it has made an under provision in respect of tax liability of 8 per cent for each year, for the tax years 1969 and 1970.  In other words, it will have made an under provision to the extent of 16 per cent in respect of its tax liability.</P>
    <P>In 1971 such a company will have to do a number of things.  First of all it will have to make tax provision in 1971 for a new tax liability at 58 per cent instead of 50 per cent of its profits. It will have to deal with the taxation position in respect of the trading year 1969.  It will be due to pay that income tax next month.  It will now find that it has made an under provision to the extent of 8 per cent in respect of 1969 so out of its profits next year it must provide in addition another 8 per cent in respect of 1969.</P>
    <P>It will also have to provide next year in respect of the tax liability for the current trading year and that will be another 8 per cent.  This involves one-third of the Irish companies.  On the information available to me under this section one&mdash;third of the Irish companies will have to face up to a tax liability next year which may represent a total of 74 per cent of their profits.  That is a serious imposition.  It is no good for the Minister for Finance to say, as he did say glibly in some Press interview, &ldquo;Of course, that is all right in a normal year.&rdquo; When does one achieve a normal year?  One cannot apply in a section of this kind a stipulation providing a change in the income tax laws in <Col N="978" /> respect of 1970-71 and just say: &ldquo;That is all right.  It will be all right eventually.&rdquo; It may be all right eventually.</P>
    <P>The only way in which an imposition of this kind can be prevented from falling on a company is to change the year in which this new imposition will take effect and the purpose of this amendment is to give at least a year's notice to companies.  They have already declared their trading position this year.  In relation to their position next year they can make provision.  They will have to do it, and I am not saying they should not do it, at the expense of their shareholders by probably declaring a smaller dividend and retaining more in respect of tax.  That is as it may be, but they should be given the opportunity of knowing a year ahead that they will eventually have to face a new tax position.</P>
    <P>If this is not done a large number of companies will face a total tax liability of 74 per cent next year.  Some of them will be able to do it&mdash;very, very few.  If they are in a buoyant marketing situation, if their profits are rising and so on, they will be able to ride this particular obligation.  Far too many companies in this particular period have a static profit position, with pretty well the same profit story in respect of each of the recent trading years.  Such companies just will not be able to face this imposition.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister to consider sympathetically this amendment which I do not think could destroy the broad design of his Bill but will avert possibly an intolerable hardship on many trading companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Higgins on this.  It is a perfectly valid point.  On the Second Reading, I made this exact same point.  I gave the Minister an instance of a company.  When we met the Federation of Irish Industries we were told of one company that had been promised a grant of £250,000 from the Government to build a new factory and they had put aside £360,000 from the previous year's trading.  They then found that they were in a position to build the factory and have done so.  Having done it, they are now billed with £360,000.  The <Col N="979" /> Official Report said that I said it was the tax on £360,000; but it is a tax of £360,000, which is a heck of a different thing.  It means that, in fact, that firm now have to beg, borrow or steal £360,000 odd after building a new factory in an effort to keep going. They are a strong firm and I am quite sure they will be able to do it.  What worries me is this: how many smaller firms who have made an effort to modernise their factories and equipment and who are giving big employment will find themselves on the verge of bankruptcy because this Bill applies to the year 1970-71?</P>
      <P>I do not know whether this point was fully considered by the Government before they introduced the Bill. I have no objection at all to taxation of this sort being applied in a sensible way, but it is no answer for the Minister for Finance to say that because they are paying tax a year in arrears they are getting away with it.  They are getting away with nothing.  The point which Deputy O'Higgins has made and which I should like to stress is that it is not a good idea that a progressive firm giving a lot of employment&mdash;they are needed in this country at present&mdash; should be dealt with in the way in which this section proposes to deal with them, by taking away money which they have put aside for the extension of their business.  It may be said: &ldquo;That is all right but we are after the people who actually take it out in profits.&rdquo; It appears that, in this case, in an effort to catch certain types of people, we are being most unfair to others.</P>
      <P>Like the Prices and Incomes Bill&mdash;I do not know whether it is in or out at present&mdash;this is the type of retrospective legislation which is attempted.  It does not work out.  I would suggest that the Minister should, before it goes through, look at this aspect in order to prevent a lot of damage being done, as I believe can be done.  I have no objection to the introduction of it with effect from the following year; but to introduce it this year and to ask those who have already earmarked that money for something else to produce it whether it is there or not is not a good idea.</P>

      <P>Because that is what the Deputies opposite are seeking to do, to have a play on the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo;.  I want to come to the basic purpose of the measure as explained by the Minister : in order to achieve a situation at the end of the financial year where there will not be excessive borrowing to meet the deficit these taxation measures have to be brought in.  It is quite clear that the estimated deficiency of £14 million, if it had to be met by borrowing to the order of £12 million, which would in effect be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in the amendment means that the yield from the budgetary proposals would be reduced from £5.3 million to £1.8 million and it could only be offset then by borrowing which would come to the figure of £12 million.  It would be very bad financing to rely on borrowing to meet a budget deficit of that kind.  The limit of £8 million is what prudence would allow.  Anything of the order of £12 million would just not be &ldquo;on&rdquo; for financial prudence.  For that reason the deficit to be met is to be met by taxation as set out in the section and in particular by the increase in company taxation of £3.5 million for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the situation would be even worse in the coming year if what is suggested in the amendment were done because it would then reduce the estimated yield for 1971-1972 to £4 million approximately.  I must therefore, in the interest of good financing and good budgetary procedure and in the interest of having this deficit met in a way in which a balance is struck <Col N="982" /> between borrowing and taxation, reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talks about the way we use words.  He has been talking about the &ldquo;interest of good financing&rdquo; and &ldquo;good budgetary procedure&rdquo;.  The present year's current budgetary expenditure is £491 million and the Government solemnly sit around the table and decide that it will be all right to borrow £8 million but it would not be all right to borrow £11½ million in relation to the £500 million.  This is micro-analysis and anybody who can suggest to me that this type of micro&mdash;analysis can be done by the crowd over there on the front bench better go off and go asleep because he will not make any impact on me.  There is no man left on those benches who would make any impact on me in relation to a matter of this sort.  What this side have been asking for is perfectly fair and reasonable: it is that people should not be cut short.  That is what is being done to them.</P>
      <P>Certain people on the other side say that we are supposed to be socialists, yet here we are defending capitalists. Why should we not defend people against injustice no matter who they may be?  I make no excuse for defending them.  Both this amendment and the next amendment are very fair: that the Government get this for one year.  The Minister says that this is not retrospective because it relates to the present year.  It is retrospective.  The Revenue Commissioners always go on like this. They make me sick the way they define a cat as a dog and a mouse as an elephant and all this kind of thing and they do this continuously in the Finance Acts.  Some day somebody will take them by the scruff of the neck to the Supreme Court and they will be battered insensible.  The trouble is that most people who do it cannot afford to do it and the people who can afford it are gypping them so much that they dare not do it.  This is the truth.</P>

      <P>I am just saying what applies here.  I do not believe in injustice; I believe in fair play and <Col N="983" /> decency.  I would have no objection to giving this to the Government for the coming year but I do object to its being brought in at this stage of the year and in fact throwing it back to, in the case of most companies, 1968-69.  All for what? To get £3½ million.  A few days ago the House without question voted an additional £3 million subsidy for CIE.  I have no criticism to make about that subsidy but it is unreasonable to push people around and the only people who will be pushed around are the people who are progressive and used the money in their company.  The people who pushed it out to their shareholders are not going to be caught at all in the same way.  Those who put it into machinery or bricks and mortar, and perhaps borrowed money, are now going to be in a difficulty.  No matter how we argue there is an Alice in Wonderland aspect in this thing, of people having to run to stay in the same place&mdash;they will have to do more than run if they have committed themselves to expenditure.  The Minister for Transport and Power spoke about good financing and good budgetary procedure and this is from a Government who are spending £500 million in the current year.  Who do they think they are trying to cod?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Transport and Power, who has now left, was doing a spoofing operation on this House in defence of the section as it stands, but it appeared very much like it.  He said that this was not retrospective but that is in the teeth of the meaning of the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo;.  As a result of the section, as it stands, in the month of December, 1970, a company find that in relation to their trading position, already declared and finalised, they have to face, for the previous year, a new tax liability next month. Of course, this is retrospective because it removes a deduction which was part of the tax code when the company were declaring their final net profit position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that was declared last April the position was that under the law they had to provide 50 per cent of their profits in relation to tax.  They are <Col N="984" /> now told under this section: &ldquo;We are very sorry.  Although you have declared your profit position, you now have to find another 8 per cent in respect of each trading year already concluded.&rdquo; It is not only retrospective. it is retro-active.  This kind of taxation is symptomatic of the lack of policy and the lack of any clear programme which is demonstrated time and time again by this Government.  Deputy O'Donovan, Deputy Tully and I are not concerned primarily for companies with a fat and strong profit position; we are concerned with the effect this kind of measure will eventually have on industrial employment and about the instability it is going to bring into the employment market.</P>
    <P>Irish companies, doing their best at a time of growing competition in the home market, have to face a tax situation and they look to a situation in which there will be one Budget each year.  In relation to the Budget introduced in May of this year they were entitled to expect that that Budget represented the score for this financial year, but as has so often happened in the past, because of the persistent incompetence of members of this administration, who cannot even plan 12 months ahead, another Budget had to be introduced.  By October it was perfectly clear that another Budget was going to be introduced.  After a period of six months, in the dying days of the calendar year, companies have to face another completely unanticipated tax liability which may work out in relation to a third of the companies to an additional tax liability of 24 per cent of their profits next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power blandly told them: &ldquo;Oh, think nothing of this.  Forget about it. It happens everywhere.  It is not even retrospective.&rdquo; Were they to expect this to happen?  Are we to have a situation in which no person engaged in business, using resources in order to provide employment, can be certain as to what the position is going to be in one month's, two months or three months time?  If that is to go forth from this Government at this time, it will have a disastrous effect on Irish industry, on the development of our own resources <Col N="985" /> and the provision of employment for our people.</P>
    <P>I think this is a disgraceful provision. It is utterly indefensible.  I have little doubt that a stand by the Minister on this section, as it is proposed, can only result in a considerable feeling of loss of confidence by the business community in the position of the Government and in Government policy. The case has been made for this amendment.  It stands clearly as a proper and worthwhile amendment.  I certainly did not gather anything from what was said by the Minister for Transport and Power which causes me to change my mind in relation to the merit of this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to dwell at too great length on this because I did deal with this point on Second Stage.  Whatever meaning one takes out of the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo; the fact of the matter is that this Bill proposes to change the income tax liability of companies for the year 1970-71 in respect of tax payable next month.</P>
      <P>If Deputy O'Higgins's logic is to be accepted then it would be true to say also that any change whatever in the income tax rate at any time of the year would be retrospective in respect of some companies, depending on their accounting year.  If that is his contention, and if because of that the tax rate cannot ever be changed because it would be retrospective, it is a proposition I cannot accept.  He seemed also to be making the proposition that because people did not expect or should not have expected a supplementary Budget they should not therefore have been exposed, in the case of companies at any rate, to additional taxation.  This again is a proposition which I could not accept and which Deputy O'Higgins, if he were in Government, could not accept either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, as far as my recollection noes, I think he was a member of a Government which at one time introduced a very substantial number of import levies in the middle of the financial year.  They had a much more disturbing impact on the operation of Irish business than this Bill will have. He would defend, and I would defend with him, the right and duty of any <Col N="986" /> Government to take such steps as are necessary to manage the economy whenever it is necessary to do so.  This is not to say I recommend there should always be supplementary Budgets.  I think they are to be avoided if they can be, but I could not accept the proposition that we cannot ever have a supplementary Budget and that seems to me to be the logic of what Deputy O'Higgins is saying.</P>
    <P>The fact that companies are taxed on their earnings in the previous year is a matter of administrative convenience. It is certainly very convenient for companies and it has the effect that many of them, for a period of up to 20 months, have in their possession moneys which they would otherwise have paid over to the Exchequer and in many cases the value of that concession is far more than the imposition of this tax.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I must say I find it difficult to have sympathy with the case being put forward.  I would remind the House again that many companies make provision for a tax equalisation reserve because of this very position.  They can only calculate tax on the basis of existing tax rates. Therefore, inherent in the calculation they make is that, if there is a change in tax, that provision may either be too large or too small.  They know this when they make that provision and consequently many companies have, as I say, a special reserve fund to deal with this kind of situation.  To say that because companies do not do that they are being subjected to retrospective taxation in an unfair manner seems to me to be twisting the facts far beyond anything that logic would enable one to do.  I could not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am just defining something now: time makes a thing retrospective.  It is not nearly as complicated a definition as the way the <Col N="987" /> Revenue Commissioners frequently write into a Bill that, &ldquo;the word `prospective' in this Bill shall mean `retrospective' &rdquo;.  This is something they do regularly.  The Minister talked about companies getting a concession by being assessed on last year's profit. That was the way since the system was set up.  It was not set up as a concession. It was set up in that way because it was the only way the blooming system could be worked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they would not because this will be calculated on the figures for 1968-69 depending on when <Col N="988" /> the financial year of the particular companies ends.  This is what makes it retrospective.  In May, 1970, the figures for 1968-69 were in an entirely different position as compared with the position they are in towards the end of their second accounting year.  That is the problem.  My own opinion, for what it is worth, is that this was brought in as a counterblast to the Prices and Incomes Bill to show that the Government were being fair as between all sections of the community. Frankly, so far as the finances of the country are concerned, it is a mere bagatelle.  To use another metaphor, it is the merest fleabite in relation to the yield of tax on incomes of all sorts. What this side has been concerned about all the time is that this could get a certain type of company which was in a particular development phase into serious difficulties and no amount of argument about words will alter that position.  However, I have no doubt at all that there will be no change because, once a Minister commits himself nowadays to something, unless he feels there may be political consequences, he sticks to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In lines 12 and 13 to delete &ldquo;or for any subsequent year of assessment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a fair test of the bona fides of the Minister for Finance. When the announcement was made last month that, in order to deal with inflation, a package deal would be put into operation, the Minister for Finance envisaged the freezing of wages, of prices, of dividends, of fees, and so on. He made it clear that these decisions would operate merely for the year ahead-1971.  This Finance (No. 2) Bill was tabled in tandem with the Prices and Incomes Bill and the Minister for Finance described it as part of the package deal.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances when one reads in section I that in order to deal with what one hopes is a temporary inflationary period the Minister proposes, on account of that situation, to alter the tax position of companies not merely in respect of one year but to apply the altered taxation to all subsequent years, one sees this is contrary to the package deal he announced.  It seems to be an effort to impose a permanent increase in the tax liabilities of Irish companies arising from an emergency situation.  It tests the bona fides of the Minister at this stage.  In an emergency situation, in a supplementary Budget, to increase permanently, as this measure proposes to do, the tax liability of companies is in my view utterly wrong.  It is contrary to what the Minister had announced and beyond the exigencies of the economic situation with which he was dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add that under the section as it stands not only will Irish companies have to face this year and next year, by reason of the operation of the income tax code, a situation in which they have to provide in a normal year 58 per cent of their profits for tax purposes, but this will continue to be an imposition which they must bear.  That comes at a time when they are competing on the home market against British companies which now enjoy in relation to Irish companies a far better tax position.  English companies retaining their profits have a total tax liability of 42½ per cent and they will trade in the Irish home market for the Irish home market against Irish companies that have to pay 58 per cent of their profits in tax.  This is utterly absurd. It seems to me to be selling Irish companies down the river.  It may be an understandable measure in relation to an emergency situation for a specified period and it was in that way it was <Col N="991" /> introduced and understood but in this legislation it appears as a permanent measure.</P>
    <P>I said that British companies retaining their profits, ploughing them back into development, enjoy now an increasingly advantageous tax position. One way in which they can retain their profits is by utilising them for advertising, by putting their profits into press advertising beamed at the home market or into television or radio advertising beamed at the home market.  They can do that and they will get a preferential tax position when they do it and in doing it they are at the same time making it more difficult for Irish companies to compete particularly when these Irish companies have to pay a 16 per cent higher tax liability&mdash;in fact, a 30 per cent higher liability.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong, and I think the Minister could agree to this amendment without in any way minimising the strength of the measures which he put forward designed to deal with a temporary situation in an emergency atmosphere.  If he agreed to this amendment it would help considerably to stabilise the position and restore some confidence to the industrial sector of the economy.  Quite frankly, they are utterly confused by what is now taking place and feel that improvisation is taking the place of planning and that considerable damage may be done to our industrial fabric.  I, therefore, urge this amendment on the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points.  First, did the Minister mean it when he said that this was a one year only effort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I misunderstood the Minister and not for the first time. It appears that over the last couple of weeks the whole country has been misunderstanding him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would quote what he misunderstood?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What I thought the Minister said was that this was a <Col N="992" /> special tax and that all the measures were for the purpose of providing money which had to be obtained this year; that a sum of £21 million had to be found of which a certain amount would be provided by economies and the balance by borrowing or by this means.  That is what I understood, and that it applied to this year.  The only trouble I see is that when any type of taxation is written into legislation it is extremely difficult to get it out again. The Minister need not have included those words if he did not want to do so. Deputy O'Higgins made that point: he need not use those words; he could put them into next year's Budget and that would be that.  Therefore, putting them in when it is unnecessary to do so in my opinion is wrong.</P>
      <P>Secondly, this appears to be penal legislation against Irish companies because we cannot catch foreign companies in the same way.  They are able to get out of it.  This is a mistake.  I said, and so did Deputy O'Donovan, that if companies have the money to pay we do not object to their being taxed.  We did object, in the case of the amendment before this, because we felt it was retrospective legislation.  This is different.  At least this gives them warning that in future they will have to pay this tax.  Is there a danger of companies being unable to continue because this is written into legislation, a danger that it will cause unemployment? That is my only objection to it. Otherwise, I see no reason why people who have a good deal of money should not be made pay their share of fair taxation.  Therefore, I would be glad if the Minister would explain why specifically he includes those words in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In response to the second last point made by Deputy Tully&mdash;I said it before but perhaps I should say it again&mdash;I have no evidence that the imposition of this tax will have the dire effects which have been suggested by some people.  I do not say Deputy Tully suggested it but some people have suggested that various factories would close down and people would be put out of work as a result.  I have no evidence to suggest that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> First, let me say I did use the phrase &ldquo;package deal&rdquo; in relation to this Bill and the Prices and Incomes Bill taken together.  Perhaps Deputy O'Higgins will recall that the Labour Party at least was not prepared to treat it as a package deal and would not take the two together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you have taken our advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You can withdraw the other Bill and perhaps you will withdraw this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did use the phrase &ldquo;package deal&rdquo;.  What I intended to convey was that the Prices and Incomes Bill was endeavouring to deal with an inflationary situation so far as it could be dealt with in the matters covered by that Bill.  To do that and at the same time have in prospect a very substantial deficit in the current Budget, which would of course be inflationary, would be an indefensible position for the Government.  Therefore, to that extent those two Bills were part of a package deal attack on inflation. However, it may be that some people misunderstood what I said, although I venture to suggest the misunderstanding was not very widespread. I should like, in particular, to quote from the Official Report what I said in relation to this tax when introducing the Supplementary Budget, Volume 249, No. 1, column 73:</P>
      <P>The change will come into effect this year and will increase the amounts of tax due for payment by companies on 1st January, 1971.  It will yield an additional £3.5 million in the current year and £6 million in the year 1971-2. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That states specifically that it will not be confined to the current financial year.  As further evidence of the fact that I do not think Deputies were unduly misled let me point out that there are no amendments down in relation to the other taxes being imposed in this Bill to provide that they will only apply for the current year.  This suggests that Deputies did not think that the introduction of those taxes was <Col N="994" /> being accompanied by a statement to the effect that they were only to apply in the current year.  I want to say, having said that, it is possible and conceivable in the next financial year that this tax might be taken off or might be modified in some other way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or increased.  The Deputy just took the words out of my mouth.  It is a possibility.  All of those things are possibilities in relation to any tax.  I do not think any Minister for Finance could undertake in advance that he would not increase, reduce or modify in any way any particular existing tax.  I could not undertake to tie my hands in that way.  As I said, I made it clear when introducing the Supplementary Budget that in fact it was intended to go on in the next financial year as well and in those circumstances I do not think that the case that has been made for the amendment stands up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister put in &ldquo;for any subsequent year&rdquo;? Could he not have included that in subsequent Budgets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that could be done, but it would mean that in every Budget you would have all sorts of resolutions covering any new tax introduced.  I made it clear, as I quoted, that it was intended to apply in the subsequent year as well.  I gave the estimated yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with the corporation profits tax increase on the relevant section and therefore, in order not to be repetitive, I will not deal generally with its application now. I want to refer to the question of the package deal.  There have been many changes since.  As far as the Government are concerned we could refer to it as the striptease period of Fianna Fail politics.  In the first instance there was to be a freezing of the 12th round increase, but this was changed in 36 hours.  Various other things have happened since.  It is like the seven veils. We are not so far from the seventh and then we shall be entirely naked before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> In the Prices and Incomes Bill workers, and indeed shareholders, who are not all rich people and directors of companies were asked to accept certain strictures.  Shareholders were asked to accept the fact that they could not have their remuneration by way of dividend, by way of directors' remuneration or any other remuneration increased for a certain period.  As I understood it, part of the package deal was that business was to accept strictures as well.</P>
    <P>I intend on the section to deal with the bad effects this will have.  Surely, if it was a package deal, then the position was that this stricture was to be on the general body of people.  One section of it has been removed already because of the declaration by the Government that they are not proceeding with the Prices and Incomes Bill at this moment.  This means the House will adjourn this week and we will not see again until some date late in January or perhaps the first week in February any legislative action on that Bill.  The other side of the package deal is being pressed on by the Government.  The Government will not even accede to Deputy O'Higgins's request that they would come back to the House at a later date if they decided that the provision in relation to company taxation was in the interest of the nation.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why Deputy O'Higgins's amendment could not be accepted.  Then, if the Minister wished, he could come to the House at a later stage and provide for this in an ordinary Budget.  This legislation does not transcend an ordinary Budget.  I do not understand why, if one section of the package deal has been frozen or set aside, another section is to be proceeded with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important point raised by Deputy O'Higgins on his amendment has not been answered by the Minister, that is that Irish companies have to pay 58 per cent taxation as against 42 per cent by British companies.  This is a vital point which the Minister for Finance, who holds a very important <Col N="996" /> office, should answer.  We are at the moment negotiating for entry to the Common Market.  We are not in too happy a position industrially in regard to a free trade area because we are not advanced enough industrially for that. If we have to go in, surely it will be a heavy load around our necks <i>vis-à-vis</i> our British competitors, who are our closest neighbours.  The Minister, when replying, did not refer to this vital point.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt with the case made by Deputy Donegan and I do not propose to go over it again.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Esmonde, I dealt with this in some detail on the Second Stage.  I will not go over that again but I would briefly point out that there is an important difference between the method of taxation here and that in Britain.  When companies pay their tax here that is the end of the matter as far as the shareholder is concerned, but in Britain the shareholder is again taxed when he receives his dividend. If you make a comparison on that basis you will find that the tax rate here is a constant 58 per cent, but in Britain in the case of a company which distributes all its profits the tax goes up to 65 per cent, although I agree it can go down to 42½ per cent where there is complete retention.  I also pointed out a number of the very important concessions which are made to Irish companies in respect of their profits invested in the way of depreciation allowances, export tax and other reliefs. I detailed them on the Second Stage and that is why I did not deal with the point again when Deputy O'Higgins raised it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am looking at is the trading position of the company. The shareholder may draw an income from the company and the shareholder's tax position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his own personal income is a matter for him and it is aggregated with whatever other income he has, but the trading position of the company, the company's own liability for corporation profits tax and income tax where there is retention in England, is recognised as justifying a preferential tax position.  The tax liability of such a company is limited to 42½ per cent of its profits.  That company has a trading advantage on the Irish market and, indeed, on the British market too.  It has a trading advantage in relation to any Irish company which has to face a 58 per cent profit tax liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can put this any further.  The position is as I have stated it.  There is a difference between the way this matter is treated here and in Britain.  If you want to make the comparison between the two, as Deputy O'Higgins was doing, you must compare like with like.  The only way to do this is to have regard to the total tax which is paid.  Here, when the <Col N="998" /> company has paid its tax, this comprehends the tax on the dividend, but in Britain the company pays its tax, the dividend is paid out, and then the further tax is applied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we want to encourage Irish companies to plough back their profits?  There is no question about dividends.  An Irish company that wants to expand will be taxed on its profits to the extent of 58 per cent under this proposal, although they are going back into expansion, while an English company competing against it and also following the same policy of expansion is taxed only in relation to 42½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If you wanted to make that comparison you would have to go further back on the scale because what is taxed here at 58 per cent is the income of the company which is liable to tax.  To arrive at that you would have to take account of the various allowances which the company would get including, as I have said, the initial allowances and the export tax reliefs, and so on.  You would have to compare them with those in Britain if you wanted to make an exact comparison. I do not think it can be done on the basis Deputy O'Higgins suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would agree that the British company has a greater margin of profit because they can plough back more into the firm and have a greater opportunity of expansion than any Irish company will have in the future. What earthly chance has any company, if its gross profits are being taxed at the rate of 28½ per cent, of ploughing anything back for further expansion and, if you like, further employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is <Col N="999" /> mistaken because the assessment of tax arises only after the various allowances I have mentioned are given. It is not the gross profits, as such, that are taxed at 58 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to suggest that we have got better initial allowances on capital expenditure, better depreciation allowances on machinery and better, what I might call without using the proper tax word, initial allowances of all kinds but, at the same time, this is opening up a field of very detailed comparison which, if one wanted to debate it, would take up an extremely large file and keep the Minister until 10.30 tonight.  In the case of the two companies mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins, both following the same policy of ploughing back profits as capital expenditure, I do not think that the difference between 42½ per cent and 58 per cent could be made up by any differences there are in the case of the initial allowances and the various other allowances to which the Minister has vaguely referred.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give us a list of the essential and important differences in these allowances, but there is this factor which must be remembered. In this country most companies are young by British standards. Many British companies have reached the stage where their rate of capital expenditure is much lower and their re-investment of profit is much lower than is demanded of young companies here which are growing and which must, as every growing company must, restrict the profits they give to their shareholders or proprietors and plough them back as capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that situation there are more companies here in Ireland in the industrial sector paying this 58 per cent than there are in Britain.  Many centuries of industrial operations there have meant that there is not the same necessity for companies to plough back their profits.  I agree that there is a difference in relation to taxation on unearned <Col N="1000" /> income but the top of the scale mentioned by the Minister would, perhaps, include shareholders in the absolute top surcharge class in Britain.  On the other hand, we have no such people. I think it was Deputy Haughey who limited them to less than 200 people. Therefore, in my view, it is quite clear that this is a heavy imposition on Irish industry.  It was a package deal which was meant to end on December 31st, 1971, according to the spoken word and policy of the Government, which at the moment are not worth a two penny ticket.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now refusing to accept Deputy O'Higgins's amendment knowing full well that, if he accepted it, it would only mean that he would have to come back to the House with a Budget or a Supplementary Budget and seek power to continue it after 31st December, 1971.  It is a sad business that one section of this package deal, namely, the prices and income policy, is in mid-air and the other section is on the ground, with the Minister stonewalling to see to it that the normal approach indicated by his package deal is not adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said this before but let me say it again.  If Deputy Donegan heard me he knows that I quoted from what I said when introducing the Supplementary Budget.  I made a specific statement on the yield in 1971-72.  In the face of that, I do not think Deputy Donegan is entitled to come in here and cast doubts on my word on this.  I made it quite clear to the House and I also pointed out that Deputies on the other side tabled no amendments of a similar nature in regard to the other taxes.  Did they think they would end in the current year or not?</P>

My opinion is that this Bill is sister legislation to the Prices and Incomes Bill. which has since been suspended in mid-air. <Col N="1001" /> I submit that the measures contained in this Bill should only have the same duration as those contained in the Bill suspended in mid-air.  The heavy strictures imposed on Irish industry are improper and incorrect.  I do not give a two penny ticket what the Minister said on any previous stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  This section shall not, in relation to any year of assessment, apply to a company which establishes that it has in that year ploughed back or retained for investment in the company the major portion of its profits&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>We have covered this amendment in the discussion we have had.  I propose to add a new subsection providing that the paragraph in section I which imposes an increase in tax liability from 50 to 58 per cent should not apply in relation to any year of assessment to a company which establishes that it has in that year ploughed back or retained for investment in the company the major portion of its profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go back over what we have said but under the section as it stands, with the increase from 50 per cent to 58 per cent, this represents a tax increase of 16 per cent and will <Col N="1002" /> result in a general fall in Irish company earnings of 16 per cent in companies paying tax at the standard rate. It follows that dividend cover for all companies paying the standard rate of tax will fall by 16 per cent.  If dividends are maintained, as they may be in some companies, retentions will undoubtedly fall and if retentions fall then expansion will be in danger.</P>
    <P>In England, under British taxation, they have recognised the importance to be attached to the encouragement of expansion in all companies, particularly trading companies.  They have recognised the necessity for that by giving a benefit or preferential treatment in relation to taxation.  Here, up to this, we have not recognised that, and whether a company regards immediate and future expansion as being more important than paying an increasing dividend to a shareholder, so far as taxation is concerned they are all regarded in the same way.</P>
    <P>I do not think that in present circumstances we can continue with that kind of outlook and policy.  We are on the threshold of Europe.  We are certainly facing now the full effect of trade liberalisation.  We are facing a situation in which Irish companies are finding it more and more difficult to fight for their own markets, not to mind expanding into other markets.  It is essential that our tax code should be a nice balance, a constructive balance, aimed at encouraging expansion.  I do not suggest that my proposal in itself will bring a wonderful change, but the proposal carries with it an important principle: that the taxation policy should recognise and benefit the company that has a large retention factor as its permanent policy.  If our taxation recognises that and recognises its effect on future employment, on the creation of job opportunities for our people in the future, that is an important thing.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to consider favourably this amendment.  I have no doubt that, no matter how it is worded here, the sense of the amendment is constructive and would be helpful to the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which makes a lot of very good sense particularly because at present there <Col N="1003" /> are so many companies going to the wall and looking to the State for help to keep going.  Surely an effort should be made to give those that are doing well and prepared to expand some extra incentive?  The Minister will read out the incentives they are already getting but so are those which had to get substantial financial help from the State. I believe that the effect here will be that many smaller companies that were giving big employment may find it difficult to expand or to keep going at all if the full effects of this legislation are applied to them.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable suggestion.  I am not sure whether the wording of the amendment exactly covers the point, but it is something the Minister should seriously consider.  After all, we do hope that there will be an effort made by companies that are doing well to take up the employees from the companies that have been going out and the big numbers leaving agriculture must be employed somewhere.  If extra incentives are being given to new companies starting up, is there any reason why an extra incentive should not be given to old established companies which are being hard hit?</P>
      <P>One of the things I have commented on over the years in regard to the encouragement of industry is that the old firms which have been in operation for many years seem to be the ones to which the State are not prepared to give any assistance at all.  I saw in my own constituency a number of them going to the wall mainly because the Government, while they were prepared to give financial assistance and tax remission of every kind to new companies starting up and ones in regard to which there was no guarantee that they would give substantial employment, were not prepared to lift a finger to help the older firms that had given employment down through the years. This is one thing which requires attention from the Minister and I would appeal to him to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the case of a firm which had done everything possible not only to give employment but to get export orders <Col N="1004" /> and while they had done that and had achieved substantial export orders the State, through one of its subsidiary bodies, refused to give that company the money they required to carry on. I do not know what the situation of that company will be but this is the sort of thing which seems to be repeated in this section.  The Minister does not intend that.  No more than we do, he does not want any company to go out of production, but this is something which is well worthy of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear what Deputy Tully has been saying. There are companies which have been operating on the home market&mdash; and they would be operating under pressure too&mdash;who have been paying their workers for perhaps generations &mdash;a lot of them have been notable for the fact that there was never a strike in them&mdash;but these companies have not perhaps the attraction for a politician or a Government which a new company has.  Neither have they available what is available across the water, namely, a large money pool from which debentures may be sought or from which a fresh investment may be sought so that the necessary blood transfusion can be effected and without which a lot of companies would go to the wall.  In the next two years we are going to face a pretty severe credit squeeze which means that the pool of money available for investment in companies will be severely restricted.  Here we have a situation whereby those people who are retaining their profits and ploughing them back will be at a disadvantage as far as their overseas counterparts are concerned.  Deputy O'Higgins in his well-thought-out and well-considered amendment seeks to set this right.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how the Minister can say that the sort of company referred to by Deputy Tully&mdash;and it is important that he saw the type of company that would be deeply affected by this type of legislation&mdash;can get this sort of incentive which is so necessary here.  I should like to remind him that the defence of existing jobs in parlous circumstances in industry is just as important, job for job, as the creation of new ones.</P>

      <P>I have never seen any study of a comparison between the State assistance made available to new industry as against that made available to existing industry but a lot of people might be surprised at the results of such a study.  There are very many schemes in operation which in practice apply, in the main, only to existing Irish industry and do not apply to new or foreign industry.  This is overlooked when the comparison is being made, as we heard in the last few minutes.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment, I have doubts as to whether the proposition that a company who retain profits <i>simpliciter,</i> irrespective of what they do with them, should get special tax concessions. I have some doubts as to whether that is a proposition which I should accept.  Certainly I would not be willing to accept it in advance of the results of the study to which I referred some time ago, the study into the structure of company taxation which is going on.  I think what Deputies have in mind is that there should be an advantage for a company who retain profits and plough them back effectively into the expansion of the business. That, in fact, is not what the amendment provides; it may have been intended but it is not, in fact, what it provides.  Under the amendment as it stands, if it were accepted, a company could say they were setting aside a certain amount of profit for the purpose of reinvestment or re-equipment and could, the following year, change their minds and distribute it.  The administrative difficulties of assessing tax on the basis of what a company say they intend to do with their profits are very considerable.  As I say, the principle I mentioned earlier is one I am doubtful about and I would not be inclined to accept it until I get the results of the study.  Apart from that, on the practical aspect, the administrative difficulties would be enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would not like Deputies to overlook the substantial reliefs already provided under existing law in respect of investment in plant and machinery, industrial buildings, scientific research and acquisition of know-how. These reliefs are given in respect of expenditure actually incurred on <Col N="1006" /> these purposes and not merely by reference to money put aside for investment. That is a fair indication that the kind of things Deputies have in mind are covered to a great extent in existing legislation.  I do not say they could not be improved, but they are substantially covered by existing legislation. Certainly at present I would not be prepared to accept the proposition which seems to be emerging from this amendment that the mere retention of profit as such would qualify for some taxation advantage.  It may be argued on economic grounds that this is advantageous, I do not deny it, but certainly I am not convinced of it yet and I do not think that that is what Deputy O&rdquo;Higgins really had in mind when he put forward this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to take up the Minister's words &ldquo;the mere retention of profits&rdquo; and direct the Minister's attention to the fact that Deputy O'Higgins's amendment says &ldquo;shall not, in relation to any year of assessment, apply to a company which establishes that it has in that year ploughed back or retained for investment in the company the major portion of its profits&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In a continuing company, of course, if one must make a statement through one's auditor of intention to carry out certain capital expenditure that would be brought up by the Revenue Commissioners in the following year if one did not do it.  Therefore I do not see the administrative difficulties in regard to this.  The new industries set up for export get complete freedom from taxation for a long period on all profits on their exports.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  These new companies are very often satellite companies of parent companies abroad and they have come here for that tax concession. Let us be blunt about it.  They may lose it in Common Market conditions with results about which we can only conjecture.  I am thinking about the existing company who have employed people for a considerable period of time, who very often are a family <Col N="1007" /> company, who never took out any profits and were, in fact, in a low profit trade where the profits were insufficient to provide the new investment that was necessary.  I am thinking of a company existing only on bank overdrafts and not on any new investment for capital expenditure. This company is going to be affected by the situation and Deputy O'Higgins's amendment seeks to look after that position.  The Minister would be well advised to accept this amendment. I feel it will have bad effects all over the country in relation, as I said in my previous contribution on this amendment, more to the struggle to retain existing jobs than in the creation of new ones, where life can be made very easy for the honeymoon period. A lost job is just as bad as not providing a new one.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section I stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section imposes taxation on companies and it is meant to provide £3.5 million in the remainder of this financial year and £6 million in a full year.  I want to suggest to the Minister and the Government that in their efforts to collect this money they have created a situation whereby the withdrawal of funds from Irish industry to parent bodies overseas will be even greater than it has been.  They have produced hurried legislation which will not have the desired effect from the taxation point of view, namely, the collection of the sums I have indicated, and will have a very bad effect on employment and on industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I use as evidence for saying that the fact that the largest sums in taxation collected from companies here are collected from companies which are subsidiaries of parent companies overseas. I waited until the section to make this general observation on taxation.  Parent companies overseas who have subsidiaries here have considerable power and considerable control.  With very few exceptions the raw materials are supplied by parent companies overseas and if they are not supplied there <Col N="1008" /> are always charges for services and advertising so that the degree of profits indicated to the Revenue Commissioners here by any of these large subsidiary companies is a movable figure, one that can be moved up or down by the accountants dealing with the parent company overseas and the subsidiary companies here.</P>
    <P>Large oil companies can, if they wish, pay their tax in Kuwait instead of here.  There are three large oil companies operating in this country, and as it is not a practice of mine to mention the names of companies in this House I shall not do so, but the tax paid by one of these companies in respect of the sale of almost 50 per cent of the petroleum products in this country, last year was £6,000.  The parent companies abroad made millions and millions of pounds, and without exaggeration they paid millions of pounds of taxation; yet this Government decided by the stroke of a pen to try to create a situation whereby tax can be collected here and at the same time money will be invested here by companies.</P>
    <P>This is not so because parent companies can raise, on subsidiary companies here, charges for advertising, know-how, management and other services which will reduce the tax payable here, if it is more advantageous to pay tax abroad.  Whatever way the Minister has succeeded in answering us from a personal point of view, I think we have indicated from a company point of view that it will pay companies who have that choice to pay their tax abroad.</P>
    <P>I am certain, and I have good authority for saying this, that the result of this legislation will be, not what is intended by the Government who produced it in about ten days, but the paying of less tax here and the paying of more tax by parent companies abroad where the rate of taxation is lower.</P>
    <P>There is an even more serious situation. If profits are declared here there is then the situation that the parent company abroad might use those retained profits, if they retained them, for capital expenditure.  I have discussed before now the necessity for <Col N="1009" /> natural investment here to keep our people employed and also, as Deputy Tully stated, to employ the people who leave the land and school leavers.  We have put ourselves in the position where companies will be withdrawing moneys because there is a more advantageous tax position abroad.  This will mean that less profits are declared here and consequently there will be less profits to retain.  This is one of the great weaknesses of this legislation.  If a company wants to invest in capital expenditure it has to produce the necessary capital from one source or another but if the tax rate was more advantageous here it could pay tax here, retain its profits and re-employ that money in capital expenditure thereby maintaining existing jobs or creating new ones. I remember describing a piece of legislation relating to taxation on beer, which was introduced by one of the Minister's predecessors, as a man with two club feet walking over a flowerbed. I shall liken this legislation to a man with three club feet walking over the same flowerbed.</P>

      <P>I do not feel I should allow this section to pass without making one comment on it.  I understand the Minister's difficulty and the urgency of getting money.  I do not agree with the amendments which were put forward and have been dealt with but, when all is said and done, it is unfortunate that this additional taxation should be imposed on companies at the present moment.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister when he says he finds it difficult to differentiate between profits which are actually employed in a business and profits which are distributed.  Nevertheless, there is a very important distinction. Where companies make profits they do not distribute them all; a large part of what is called &ldquo;profit&rdquo; is necessary for the continuation of the business.</P>

      <P>Ploughing back makes it possible for a business to keep up to date and expand.  Many companies at the present moment are facing an extremely difficult situation, as I think I mentioned when speaking <Col N="1010" /> on the Transport Bill when I was dealing with the problems of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Companies which are faced with the problem of inflation and rising costs, particularly where they have to import the material from abroad where costs have also risen, are further faced, and have been further faced, with a great increase in tax liability for several years past.  Some of these companies are able to pass on that increase to consumers but, passing on the increase has an inflationary effect.  The companies which cannot pass on the extra burden have to carry the burden themselves and are thus far inhibited. As I said, there are certain companies which are getting very near to the &ldquo;back to the wall&rdquo; position.  They find taxation a major problem in their costs and, for that reason, I think we have to have a provision of this nature.  I am not now talking about particular problems; I am talking about profits on a year's trading and the proportion of those profits ploughed back into the business for its future continuance and future expansion.</P>

      <P>And of necessity, I agree.  While I do not go the whole way with the amendments put forward to this section I think that the points of view which have been expressed are points of view which should have been voiced.  This is unfortunately a continuance of a policy which is bearing very hard on companies and which will quite possibly, and even probably, only add to inflationary effects because, when all is said and done, if the further increase in taxation results in putting costs up, and that is the only effect it can have, the company has either to find revenues to meet the extra taxation or, if it cannot do that, it fails and one then has to face social and employment problems.  If, however, the company tries to find revenue, the only way it can do so is by putting up prices and so, in the last analysis, this type of taxation is undesirable socially.  If a company tries to recover the extra revenue it can only do so by increasing its own revenue and it can only increase its own revenue by increasing prices.  In the particular situation in <Col N="1011" /> which the Minister finds himself he probably has to get the money, but it is no harm to express this point of view.</P>
      <P>We can all of us, if we wish, make very persuasive arguments when it comes to details and statistics, but I do not know that that helps us.  The Minister says he has no evidence that this will have any adverse effect.  I do not know if the Minister sought any evidence, but I greatly fear the evidence will be forthcoming and I believe that the pressures will be towards inflation rather than in any other direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Donegan's contention that international companies will always minimise their tax liability by reference to the profits of their subsidiaries, they have always done this.  It is their constant aim. There is nothing new in this and they will continue to do this.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is in regard to the comparison made earlier between tax rates here and those in Britain, 42½ per cent in Britain and 50 per cent here.  I dealt with the fallacies in that comparison but, for the purpose of the argument, if one accepts that as true, there was a disparity between the two tax rates but that did not mean people would not invest here or were withdrawing their investment here.  What we are saying is that an increase of 8 per cent will drive them out.  I do not think anybody can say with any degree of certainty that that will be the case.  There is, in fact, plenty of reason to say it will not be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties put forward by Deputy de Valera but I would point out to him that any addition to overheads presents problems and I have heard the argument made in regard to this additional taxation also made in relation to certain wage increases granted by companies.  The argument did not always turn out to be true because companies found that the method of dealing with the additional overheads was not always simply a question of increasing prices.  In some cases prices had to be increased; when, however, they found they were really up against it they discovered they could become more efficient and could absorb all or a great deal of the additional impost <Col N="1012" /> on their overheads.  I am not saying every company will be able to do this.  I am saying that the increase in the taxation involved is not so enormous as to make a substantial difference. We have heard about small companies being hit by this tax.  I pointed out the other day&mdash;perhaps I should point it out again&mdash;that in the case of a company whose taxable income amounts to £2,500, the additional taxation involved here is £65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could but at that stage he might leave the realm of fact and enter the realm of fantasy which, in my view, this legislation entered before ever it reached the draftsman.  I want to know why the Minister says that a company operating here and abroad, which can declare profits here, pay tax on them and retain them for capital expenditure, will not be affected in its decisions in the boardroom by a heavier rate of tax when that rate of tax must be compared with the rate of the tax abroad.  To me, it is as clear as crystal.  Nothing will convince me but that, if you increase the rate here, the position will be that the man sitting on the two boards&mdash;on the board of the parent company abroad and the subsidiary here&mdash;will advise whether or not extra charges are made for raw materials from the parent company or for the other things I mentioned and a profit declared abroad rather than here.  Surely one of the sources of reinvestment is profit and it is from that source the reinvestment so necessary for the creation of new jobs and the maintenance of existing jobs comes.  I do not say the Minister deliberately twisted my words, but either he did not get the gist of what I was saying or else he is not prepared to answer.  It is quite clear that the parent company in Britain and the subsidiary company here will compare the rates of tax in each case and, if there is to be a source of capital expenditure in the retention of profits, then the degree of tax they will have <Col N="1013" /> decisions and this particular piece of legislation will be a disincentive to the declaration of profits here.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in a small way in business over the years.  There have been many occasions when an employer has said in the Labour Court, and so on: &ldquo;This is the end of the Company.  The extra wages which we shall have to pay will cripple us&rdquo;&mdash; and yet it turned out not to be the end of the company because extra prices, as a result of the extra wages, balanced up the position.  The Minister's comparison is not valid.  When you come along from your trading account and bring across your gross profit and raise your charges in the profit and loss account what comes out is the net profit.  Wages affects net profit.  To compare charges made in relation to extra wages to a charge made in relation to extra taxation is invalid.  Extra taxation reduces your net profit.  Extra wages do the same thing but it is at a stage where you have to come back to the trading account, look at your prices and apply for higher prices so that you afford the wages.  You can do nothing about extra taxation.  Your auditor and accountant will not tell a lie.  He will certify your accounts when he is absolutely certain they are correct.</P>
      <P>The Minister made my argument rather than his own argument.  This Bill and this section are a disincentive towards profits for capital investment in Irish industry.  In Britain, there is a huge money market where the interest rates are very high at the moment.  Because of the size of that money market, investments are always available to good, thriving companies. Just look at the size of the Dublin Stock Exchange.  The only place they can get their money for re-investment is from profits, after tax, retained, and if they are less here than they are in Britain where a parent company can move from one place to another, it is a disincentive to the employment of Irish people in Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The provisions of the foregoing subsection shall not apply in any case where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that a caravan (including a mobile home) has been or is being purchased by or on behalf of a person either as a permanent home or as a temporary home while such person is awaiting housing or rehousing.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister looked around for luxury goods to tax he must have thought about caravans in the sense of items which are used by people on holidays rather than as homes where people are glad to live until they can get a house.  These are not people who use their caravan as a second home at the seaside and live in it at the weekends. Caravans are to be seen behind rural cottages and, in the cities and towns, behind small houses and in gardens.  These are not brought there for safe keeping during the winter. Families where some of the older members get married frequently have to help out in the matter of accommodation until the married couple can get a house.  The only way many of them to pay in each place will affect their <Col N="1015" /> have of solving their problem, in a temporary or a permanent way, is to build on the piece of land adjacent to their house or on part of their garden or to provide a caravan, temporarily, on a plot or in the yard or the driveway. The married couple are thus able to use the facilities of the home for family living.  I do not think the Minister imagined he was including such people whose chance of getting a local authority house is very slender for years.  Their only way out is to buy a mobile home or caravan.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister to add these words to the section so that this type of person is not further hurt.  The pressure on people in overcrowded houses is great enough without the addition of taxation of this kind which would mean a very large outlay and would undoubtedly cause hardship to young people.  It is reasonable to suggest that these words be added, thus allowing people unable to set up permanent homes to buy caravans or mobile homes so that they will, at least, have some independence, if not the complete independence we should all like to see them have in permanent homes, while they are waiting to be selected from the housing list or accumulating sufficient money to build their own homes.  We appeal to the Minister not to take advantage further of this very bad situation in housing. Only this weekend the Minister for Local Government admitted that if he had £10 million or £20 million he would spend it on housing.  The Minister should exclude those people from the Bill so as not to increase further the hardship of their condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this amendment.  I represent an area where these caravans and mobile homes are all over the place at licensed and unlicensed caravan sites.  They may be regarded by the Minister and by local authorities as unauthorised structures, but unfortunately they are necessary as homes for the people.  Far too many people cannot buy houses for themselves at present prices with the present loans and grants that have remained static for a very long time while prices have increased enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Houses are now costing £5,000 or <Col N="1016" /> £6,000 while the maximum loan through the local authority is £3,000. People are no longer able to use the Local Loans Fund to finance house purchasing and the incomes of these people are insufficient to qualify them for loans from the normal building agencies.  In these circumstances, people are forced into mobile homes and caravans.</P>
    <P>Last week, I inspected an unauthorised site where there were about 25 mobile homes.  I was very impressed. These homes cost £2,500.  They are entirely constructed of timber and in my view would be liable for the full 20 per cent tax.  You could have £500 taxation on these people who are unable to buy a more expensive home, but they have been able to secure through a hire purchase agreement, and perhaps their own savings, a home that is comfortable and even centrally heated, and provided with normal sanitary facilities.  These homes, in present circumstances, enable people to live and rear families.  They told me: &ldquo;This home will suffice for some years until we have saved more money and are able to provide a deposit for a permanent home.  Then we can trade this in, so to speak, towards the cost of a permanent dwelling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister did not foresee that in bringing in this Bill he was putting extreme hardship on many people by this extra taxation, over and above the price of these mobile homes.  The same applies to caravans which are lower-priced but the people who are buying caravans at a lower price have that much less money and are less well able to buy homes for themselves. Local authorities are not providing houses fast enough.  This applies particularly in the Dublin area.  I do not have to tell the Minister this.  Every time he tours the suburbs of Dublin city or county he will see a very large number of caravans and mobile homes because there is insufficient local authority housing and because people cannot meet the cost of the present SDA loan type of house.  It is beyond their reach. The Minister should bear this strongly in mind.  I appeal to him to accept the amendment in the names of the Labour Party Members.  I am glad they thought <Col N="1017" /> of putting down the amendment which is a very worthwhile one and deserves the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated earlier that I was delighted to support Deputy Tully on this matter.  His amendment is an excellent one.  It certainly excludes people who want mobile homes for holidays or such purposes and at the same time includes those mentioned by Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Clinton.  I need do no more in supporting the amendment than give some examples that have not yet been given.  They involve the use of mobile homes by the local authorities to house people that they are unable to house for, perhaps, years to come.  When I drive into Dublin city from the north side I see many mobile homes when I come down by the Four Courts and these are provided by Dublin Corporation for old people who can remain there until the corporation are able to rehouse them.  This began when houses were falling down on the people because the Government had not built new houses for them.  There was a disgraceful situation where families were housed in Griffith Barracks and I cannot refrain from repeating this because it was such a terrible situation when husbands were allowed to see their wives and families for one hour in the afternoon each day.  Many of these people are now rehoused in temporary dwellings or mobile homes by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, I mentioned that I was chairman of Louth County Council, an interesting if arduous political exercise, and I want to mention a certain operation of that council also.  There was a decent old woman living in a caravan at Clogherhead because she had nowhere else to live.  The caravan was deteriorating as all timber structures do and would scarcely last another year.  Members of the local development association sent a deputation to Louth County Council asking us to rehouse this old woman.  Our county medical officer of health verified that what they said was correct.  We had no house for the woman but the council decided to provide her with a mobile home.  We provided this mobile home.  If we were to do so after this <Col N="1018" /> legislation we would pay 20 per cent tax.  I am proud we did this.  In the scheme of houses we are providing in the field beside where this lady now resides we are including a certain number of permanent houses for old people. Until those houses are provided that old lady will get comfortable accommodation in her mobile home.</P>
    <P>In the list of luxuries which the Minister has sought to tax at the rate of 20 per cent, plus of course turnover tax, he has made no exception in relation to mobile homes for those purposes and the purposes very properly indicated by Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Clinton.  Is it a fact, if the Minister is not accepting this amendment, that everything his Department tells him and everything which comes from the official side of the House is right, and, <i>ipso facto,</i> everything else from this side of the House, of whatever merit, has to be wrong?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister knows that Deputies from all sides of the House here are a cross-section of the people of Ireland, elected by the people of Ireland? Those of us who live in various parts of the country and who conduct our political and business affairs, must surely be people of experience and perception. If we perceive and from our experience decide on the reasonableness of an amendment of this sort, which will only cost the Government a drop in the ocean, but which will provide at a cheaper rate mobile homes for unfortunate people of the various types indicated by the three Deputies here, then surely in the Minister's wisdom it is his job to accept Deputy Tully's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan knows that I have demonstrated on a number of occasions in the past in this House, and in the other House, where an amendment is put forward, for which a reasoned case is made and which is feasible, that I have been prepared to accept it no matter which side of the House it came from.  In regard to this particular amendment we discussed it on Second Stage and I indicated to the House that I certainly favoured the idea which was involved in it but I also indicated that I foresaw difficulties in implementing it.  Unfortunately that <Col N="1019" /> is the position.  When I investigated it I found there are what seem to me to be virtually insuperable difficulties in implementing this.</P>
      <P>I should explain, first, that caravans and mobile homes are sold mainly by retailers and garages and not infrequently by private people. None of those people is normally eligible for registration for wholesale tax purposes.  Wholesale tax on the caravans sold by those people will already have been paid by their suppliers before the articles are offered for retail sale.  It would normally be impossible for those reasons to determine the precise amount of the tax element in the retail price which was paid.  It is obvious it would not be practicable to consider a relief at the point of wholesale sale since the ultimate use to which the caravan or mobile home might be put would not be known at that stage.</P>
      <P>There would, apart from those difficulties, be a great deal of difficulty about controlling a scheme of relief on the lines suggested by this amendment. If the scheme were adopted the price of a caravan or mobile home would have to be adjusted by the seller or a refund would have to be made to the purchaser by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of the purchaser's representations that he intended to use it as a home for himself or some person awaiting rehousing.  In those circumstances it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to prevent a person buying a caravan or a mobile home at a lower price on the basis of those representations and subsequently either using it for pleasure purposes or, more difficult to deal with, selling it to somebody else.  in which case you would find it almost impossible to follow him up.  Therefore, for the two reasons I have mentioned, I am afraid I cannot see how this amendment could be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed the Minister is unable to accent this amendment.  I believe he could have cot around the difficulties. The Minister mentioned insuperable difficulties but I do not think they are <Col N="1020" /> insuperable.  One way this could have been done is if the people on the housing list of councils or local authorities purchased those mobile homes or caravans and indicated to the Revenue Commissioners that they were doing so, and that they were on a housing list, this should be sufficient evidence to the Revenue Commissioners to allow that deduction.  If the Minister accepts there is a problem of housing here, then he should make a better effort to look for a way around the difficulty he feels there is in implementing this amendment.</P>
      <P>A reasonable case has been made on this amendment for people who feel they must get a home of their own. Even if it is only a caravan, it is better than living in overcrowded conditions with in-laws or in the very bad housing conditions we have not only in Dublin but also in places like Wicklow, where I believe there are at least 1,000 people in need of homes.  I am disappointed the Minister has not made an effort to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were in the Minister's shoes&mdash;convinced, as he is, of the injustices of this tax on a large number of people and knowing full well the immense hardship it will impose on people in unfortunate circumstances&mdash; I would say to my advisers: &ldquo;I want this done and your job is to find a way.&rdquo; I have no doubt a way would then be found.  We come up against this thing regularly in this House.  We are told something is too difficult to administer.  People are paid to find a way to administer what is justice for the people.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister considered at all that a mobile home costing £2,500 could carry £500 tax, whereas a permanent home costing double the figure will carry only £150 tax?  Surely this is not justice and surely the Minister must see that a way must be found not to impose this increased burden of taxation on the unfortunate section of the people who are compelled because of lack of means to do better for themselves and have to accept those standards? Surely we should not put this additional load on the backs of those people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about ways of <Col N="1021" /> recouping those people and giving them the money back.  Surely it should be possible to identify those people.  We know that many of them can be certified as having lived for years in those circumstances because they have not been able to get out of them.  There would be some satisfaction for them, even if they had to wait for some period to qualify for reimbursement of the money they had paid, if they knew at the end of that period the money would be recouped to them.  I can see the mobile home costing £2,500 going up to £3,000 as a result of this tax. I know that is not the Minister's intention, but this tax is imposed right across the board regardless of the fact that it takes into the net those people who have made such an effort to provide themselves with homes.  You will have more and more of those caravan sites and more and more of those mobile homes throughout the country before we have half solved the housing problem.</P>
    <P>We know what has happened in Britain and we know what must happen here.  The local authorities are only now becoming really conscious of the need to provide caravan sites and places where people can have mobile homes because they cannot find the amount of money required for a house.  The loans which are granted from the Local Loans Fund are insufficient, and the grants are insufficient to enable them to provide their own homes.</P>
    <P>We are just seeing the beginning of this.  People are getting married younger now and more and more homes will be required.  This type of accommodation is quite good for a few years after they are married.  It is quite acceptable to many people.  They are at an age when they can endure a certain amount of hardship, and they are prepared to put up with the inadequacies of this type of home.  If the Minister is going to saddle them with £400 or £500 extra in taxation, when they are relieving him of his responsibility to provide them with homes&mdash;it is the responsibility of local government&mdash; something is wrong.  The Minister is not happy with this type of legislation and.  if he is not happy, he should say to his advisers: &ldquo;Find a way.  It must be done.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister ever hear of an application to the Revenue Commissioners for a licence?  That is standard practice.  Deciding on whether or not to give a licence might add to the work of the Revenue Commissioners, but this is a point of principle. The Government have failed to house the people and they cannot house themselves.</P>
      <P>This is merely an interim measure. There is no reason why people should not be able to get homes without having to pay this selective wholesale tax of 20 per cent.  It is totally unfair and improper.  There is no reason why the Revenue Commissioners should not do this by licence, and there is no reason why it should not work.  The person residing in the home could be subject to a further call from the Revenue Commissioners in six or 12 months time.  People have been caught using the wrong type of diesel oil in their cars.  When people are caught under this it will be found that there will be no such thing as evasion, or certainly not any great degree of it.</P>
      <P>This was supposed to be a package deal right across the line.  I have already said that the Prices and Incomes Bill is now in Limbo.  It was part of the package deal.  This is probably the hardest and most restrictive provision in this legislation and yet it is being retained and is being bulldozed through the House.  The Minister is insisting on getting this legislation. The restriction on dividends which was part of the package deal is now in Limbo.  The restriction on certain increases of remuneration for directors is in Limbo.  It is not wanted during this session and, in fact, it may never be wanted if the Minister and his advisers reach agreement in certain other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters to which I may only make a passing reference but, under this provision, a poor old person who has not got a house will be charged an extra 20 per cent taxation on the purchase of a mobile home just because some bod, if I may use the expression, in the Revenue Commissioners has decided that this is not workable while to every ordinary observer it clearly is workable if a little trouble is taken.  This indicates to me <Col N="1023" /> that the Government are round the bend, a non-Government, and that they have not got the needs of the people at heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from tea a few moments ago I was talking to somebody who thought it was impossible to get something done and I said that where there is a will there is a way, and that if a thing is tackled in the right way it can be done.  This is something which can be done if it is tackled in the right way.  I am very surprised at the Minister's objection to this and I think he has either got the wrong idea about what we are asking for or he is being badly advised.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he cannot exempt these people.  A few weeks ago I made the request that firemen's earnings should be exempted from income tax and I was told that it could not be done.  Yet it was found possible to exempt artists who may have a very large income from something else, and their earnings on what are by certain people considered works of art will be exempt from income tax.  It was found possible in that case to differentiate without any difficulty but it is not found possible here.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister &mdash;I suppose it would depend on the speed of the car or the amount of attention he was paying to what he was passing&mdash;realises the number of mobile homes and caravans that are being used as homes throughout the country, and the number is increasing.  A few weeks ago a man told me he had got married and he was looking for a house because he was living with his mother- and father-in-law and 15 of their children in a county council cottage.  Unfortunately, the county council could not wave a wand and produce a house for him immediately.  Eventually he decided he would buy a caravan.  After scrimping and saving and borrowing everywhere he could, he went to buy the caravan and found it would cost him about £1,800.  If the Minister now proposes to put another £350 on top of that, the purchase of a caravan will be completely out of the reach of people like him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> When this matter was being discussed on Second Stage the Minister said that the people who make the caravans had been talking to him about it and were very anxious, I assume, to ensure that this type of person was exempt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>And mobile homes, and distinguishing between them.  There could be a different import duty involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking mainly about caravans which are made in this country.  Quite a number of excellent caravans are made here.  Many people are finding it impossible to get their own homes.  We need only go out to the Naas Road to see the number of people who are living in caravans because they cannot produce the necessary down-payments on a house, apart from people who are trying to rent a house.</P>
      <P>I am particularly anxious that the Minister should accept this amendment because, if he does not, the tendency will be to rent caravans instead of buying them.  Those of us who know people who are renting caravans as homes know that exorbitant rents are being charged, amazing rents.  When a man has to find some place for himself and his wife, he will agree to pay more per week than he can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really a simple matter.  Either the Minister understands the position or he does not.  Does he understand that there are literally thousands of people who have no houses to live in? I would include in those all the young married couples who are living with their in-laws because, with very rare exceptions, the home of the in-law is the last place any young married couple <Col N="1025" /> should settle down.  Even with the most decent people in the world, something may arise between them, there is a row and the next thing the young people are out and have nowhere to go. This is the only solution I can see as things stand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh commented to me while Deputy Donegan was speaking that people occasionally extend their houses to provide accommodation for young people until they can get their own accommodation.  What is a caravan except an extension to a home?  It is a temporary accommodation.  I would not like to see anybody condemned to live in a caravan all his life.  It is true that many people are now finding that they must get some place to live and are falling back on caravans and mobile homes.  It is relatively easy in a country district to get a site for one of these.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could say to us that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, had a scheme which he proposed to introduce on 1st January to supply a house for everybody who needs one and cannot provide one for himself, then I could understand what he is doing.  I cannot understand what he is doing in view of the fact that he knows that is not so.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Joe Dowling is not here.  He is the man who was prepared to say that there were &ldquo;only&rdquo; about 4,000 people in Dublin looking for houses.  One could reasonably double that number and claim that there are at least 8,000 people who are not properly housed, which amounts to the same thing.  Go to any town or village in the country, go to any TD or county councillor and ask him how many people have visited him within the last few months asking him what is the possibility of getting somewhere to live.  One will be amazed at the number that will come up.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this is a very reasonable thing.  All we are asking is that the unfortunates who cannot get a home for themselves at present should not be saddled with another £200, £300 or £400 which will go into the State funds when they try to provide even temporary accommodation for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This ought to be kept in perspective.  One could be forgiven, in listening to the debate, for thinking that the only people who occupy caravans or mobile homes are those who are otherwise homeless.  It reminds me of something I read the other day in a slightly different context where a writer referred to the fact that the moment one talks about restricting dividends all the recipients of dividends turn into widows and orphans.  Of course, we know that very many people are using caravans and mobile homes for luxury purposes.  I do not quarrel with them for that, but I do say that it is a suitable item on which additional revenue can be raised.</P>
      <P>What we are concerned with here is the question of people who require mobile homes and caravans as permanent houses.  I have explained that I would be anxious to assist these people if such a thing were feasible.  I should, however, point out that some of the figures that have been quoted in regard to the effect of this Bill are quite inaccurate.  Deputy Clinton referred to an extra £500 in taxation on a mobile home costing £2,500.  If that is so it is not because of this Bill.  He must be taking the whole of the wholesale tax.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is not an extra £500.  Deputy Donegan said something similar.  I want to point out that these items have been subject to wholesale tax.  Nevertheless, I would be prepared to avoid the incidence of this taxation in this Finance Bill on those kinds of people if a feasible way of doing it could be devised.  I have explained to the House what the difficulties are.  I have explained the two main difficulties.  It is not sufficient simply to say to one's officials: &ldquo;Solve it.&rdquo; That is very often just a way of passing the buck.  I am quite willing, if <Col N="1027" /> anybody can devise a method of doing this that overcomes the difficulties I have outlined, to implement that.</P>

The Minister will admit that that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the House that there are two main difficulties. There is the question of the wholesale tax.  These things are normally sold by such people as retailers, garages and even private people.  Those kind of people are not registered for wholesale tax purposes, so therefore they would have paid wholesale tax before they sold it to the consumer.  What one would have to do, then, is to provide that such a person would get a refund of the wholesale tax.  That is the best one could hope to do as regards that part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only one aspect of it and even then to determine the precise amount which they should get &mdash;and people will want to be treated fairly if they are to get this&mdash;is not as simple as it looks because one is dealing with somebody on the basis of the retail price he paid for it.</P>
      <P>Apart from that aspect there is another question.  If people are to either have the price adjusted by the seller, or the Revenue Commissioners are to refund the tax, this has to be done on the basis of the purchaser producing some certificate that he is using it for the purposes envisaged in the amendment.</P>

In the circumstances I have described, how can you ensure that the person who gets such a refund or gets the price adjusted to correspond with the wholesale tax will not subsequently use it for pleasure purposes or, as I said before, more difficult from our point of view, sell it, because there is a substantial market for these things, and the amount involved, if they were exempt from the whole of the wholesale tax, would certainly be substantial and would encourage people to do that.</P>

I do not care how the Minister kicks this amendment around as long as he ensures that homeless people who buy either mobile homes or caravans to live in do not have to pay this tax.

      <P>Would it not be sufficient for the Revenue Commissioners that a person should be on a registered housing list of a local authority?  There is very great depreciation on these, a depreciation which is far in excess of that relating to any other type of home.  There would be no question of a re-sale.  Anybody selling a caravan or a mobile home after a year would find that the loss from depreciation was considerable.  I do not think there would be a question of a person making money on it.

      <P>Some of us on this side of the House do an immense amount of local authority work and we are brought into contact with the type of hardship we have described.  Deputy Tully sees a good deal of this but be does not see half as much as I do because my constituency is strewn with this type of person who will have to <Col N="1031" /> endure this hardship which is being imposed by the Minister.  The Minister has repeatedly stated that he is convinced of the injustice of this taxation on this whole group of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have produced evidence that with this added taxation you can have these mobile homes, which are now costing £2,500, carrying £500 in taxation.  The Minister said that this extra bit is only putting on £125 but it is the extra straw that is going to break the camel's back.  I am sure the Minister does not want to do this to these people who cannot afford to do better for themselves under <Col N="1032" /> the present inadequacy of Government loans and grants for houses and where we have such an enormous backlog of housing needs, for which the Government must take full responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the only reason he is doing this is because he cannot single out these people, that it is a difficult job.  As I said, it is his job to be able to overcome difficulties. I see no difficulty in identifying these people.  Anybody who is prepared to live in a mobile home or caravan for a winter is not doing that for luxury living but because circumstances compel him to do so and because he is unable to provide himself with a permanent home.  He may be a man whose salary may increase to the point where someday he may be able to provide a permanent home for himself.  I know many of these people who are using this as an interim measure for five, six or seven years until a family comes along and until their incomes are large enough to enable them to buy a more adequate home.  We are only at the start of this and we are going to see many more of these homes if we are not to see more and more people leaving the country.  People are anxious to get married younger.  If the country is doing well they are in jobs and they want to get married and this accommodation is good enough for them for a number of years when they are able to take hardship.</P>
      <P>We are deliberately setting out to impose taxation of £500 on this type of person, whereas a man able to buy a house double the price of a caravan pays only £150 taxation.  This is deplorable. I am very surprised and disappointed to hear the Minister for Finance blandly say that he cannot find any way round this difficulty.  It is the easiest difficulty any man could be asked to solve.  Any Minister who says this difficulty cannot be solved is not fit to be Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>As I am associated with this amendment and I spoke about the matter on the Second Stage.  I do not go around the outskirts of Dublin very often but I have seen these homes on all roads out of the city.  They are on the road to Naas, the road to the airport, which the Minister might know <Col N="1033" /> better than I do, and they are on the road to Bray.</P>
      <P>People who want to buy one of these homes&mdash;it may not be a permanent home but a place in which to live when they first get married&mdash;should be able to buy one without paying heavy taxation on it.  The people who buy these mobile homes are either people who cannot get a corporation house or cannot afford to pay the kind of deposit now required on a permanent home.  What horrifies me about this situation is that the Revenue Commissioners want to collect 20 per cent on these mobile homes.</P>
      <P>During the recent election in South County Dublin I went round Dundrum Heights and there were any number of these caravans parked in the front gardens of the houses there.  We are not interested in people who obviously have these caravans for the purpose of going on the summer holiday; we are concerned about the people living on the outskirts of Dublin in conditions which are genuinely sub-normal.  These people should not be taxed 20 per cent on the price of a mobile home.</P>
      <P>The amendment, as we put it together, was the best way we could concoct it.  We were trying to be fair in every way.  We were not trying to let anyone off paying taxation who should pay taxation; we have no intention of that sort.  We feel the evidence is coercive.  Any person who travels out of Dublin, particularly along the Naas road, can see all these caravans parked along the left hand side of the road.  I do not know if the Minister has seen them; I take it he occasionally goes to Cork.  Taxation at the rate of 20 per cent on this kind of effort by human beings is intolerable and should not be put up with in any community.  I do not believe people would be expected to pay this kind of tax in any reasonable community on a fundamental commodity such as a home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not interested in what the Revenue Commissioners tell the Minister. I know the way they are built.  There is nothing in this which could not be dealt with at the drop of a hat.  The Minister knows this as well as I do. I believe the Revenue Commissioners are not prepared to abrogate any part of their function or the system they <Col N="1034" /> believe in.  There is no difficulty in assessing this situation.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>While it appears possible that I shall have to vote with the Minister, if a vote takes place, I come from a county where we have something like 4,000 bad houses.  I admit this Government have built more houses than all other Governments put together, but at the same time we have to be realistic.  Deputy O'Donovan is being reasonably fair.  It would be unfair to impose any kind of penalty on people who buy caravans as a form of housing, just as it would be unfair to impose a penalty on any other kind of housing.  Even if the recipient of a house did not have to pay it, rate-payers would end up paying for it, because county councils would be paying for these houses.</P>
      <P>We should not put a tax on houses. It is hard enough for the richest man to build a house, but the ordinary man finds that a house which could be built for £150 forty years ago, now costs something in the region of £3,000.</P>
      <P>Many people are not in favour of caravans, but it is very difficult to get contractors for conventional homes.  In my own part of the country I have to ask people to take caravans and prefabricated houses.  Am I to take it there is a tax on prefabricated houses?  If there is, I think it most unfair and I do not agree with it.  The main point is that we must provide people with a roof over their heads.</P>

    <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  The provisions of the foregoing subsection shall not apply in any case where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that a caravan (including a mobile home) has been or is being purchased by or on behalf of a person either as a permanent home or as a temporary home while such person is awaiting housing or rehousing.</P>

      <P>It is very wrong that taxation should be imposed on any material used in the construction of houses.  It is even more wrong to impose taxation on caravans and mobile homes.  Nobody knows more about housing than I do.  Instead of putting an imposition on these things, we should do everything possible to give people an incentive towards providing their own homes.  I can see no reason why we should not do that.  There are fairly good houses in my county, but in places like west Limerick housing conditions are very poor.  In times of by-elections one sees the real conditions. By all means let the Minister tax luxury articles.  No one can object to that.  There are luxury fittings in houses. Some lady paid £600 for a two-seater bath.  I would have no objection to taxing that lady.</P>
      <P>We are the first who offered to pay the full cost of housing the itinerants and I congratulate Fianna Fáil on that policy.  It is vital that people should be provided with homes.  I go the whole way with the Minister in taxing luxuries</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a tax on luxury goods.  It is a tax on a necesity. The Minister for Local Government is reported as saying that he is prepared to pay the full cost of housing the itinerants.  That is not true; he is not prepared to pay the full cost of building houses for itinerants or for anybody else.  I got that straightened out yesterday in reference to something being done by my own county council. Different interpretations can be put on words, but this is not the place to take that up now and so I shall not develop the particular argument.  If that were true, then the same thing should be done for those who are unable to provide houses for themselves.  I appeal to the Minister to use his ingenuity in trying to bring in an amendment in the Seanad which will cover the points we make.  I think the Minister realises from what was said on this side of the House and what was said from his own benches that the problem is a serious one.  We all believe there is a solution to it and I ask the Minister now if he would be prepared to bring in an amendment to cover the points we made.  He himself said he believed the problem should be dealt with and, if he is prepared to bring in an amendment, then we are prepared to withdraw our amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin) Gerry Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) (No. 3) Scheme, 1970, prepared by the Minister for Defence with the consent of the Minister for Finance under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, and Section 4 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938, and laid before the House on the 11th day of December, 1970, be confirmed. </P>
      <P>This scheme amends the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, 1937 to 1970, so as to provide improved retirement benefits for certain officers, non-commissioned officers and privates of the permanent Defence Force.  It also amends the schemes in other respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes do not follow a conventional pay-related superannuation pattern. This is because of the particular nature and circumstances of military service, which involve such things as retirement at earlier ages than apply to the public service generally and facilitating officers to retire on pension after relatively short periods of service.  A pay-related pensions scheme would have administrative advantages and it may come about later, but there are difficulties for the reason I have mentioned. In the course of an examination of the matter which has been taking place between the civil and military sides of my Department, certain points emerged in regard to which the improvement of the provisions of the schemes seemed <Col N="1039" /> desirable.  These are now incorporated in the present scheme, and are generally effective as from the 1st June, 1969, the effective date of the pay increases which arose out of the Army pay review.</P>
    <P>The officers who hold the highest posts of responsibility in the Defence Forces&mdash;the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General, the Assistant Chief of Staff and the Officers Commanding the Commands&mdash;are paid at the regimental rates appropriate to their ranks and in addition receive responsibility allowances.  Hitherto these responsibility allowances have not been reflected in their retired pay.  There is already in the schemes a precedent for the inclusion of the allowances for retired pay purposes, in that officers in receipt of additional pay in respect of professional qualifications receive a percentage increase in the normal rate of retired pay&mdash;20 per cent in the case of officers of the Army Medical Corps and 10 per cent in other instances.  It is proposed to apply this percentage increase to the officers I have mentioned&mdash;a 20 per cent increase in the case of officers retiring while holding the appointment of Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General.  Quartermaster-General or Assistant Chief of Staff and a 10 per cent increase for Officers Commanding Commands.  The necessary provisions are contained in article 5 which also makes provision for some special types of circumstances that may arise.</P>
    <P>At present the maximum gratuity which an officer may receive on retirement in addition to retired pay does not reach the maximum of one and a half years pay which applies in the public service generally.  On the other hand, officers may retire on maximum retired pay and the present maximum gratuity at ages at which public servants generally would be eligible for neither pensions nor gratuity.  It is now proposed, however, that where an officer makes the Army his career and serves to the end.  so to speak, he will be eligible, in addition to retired pay. for a maximum gratuity of one and a half years pay.  An officer will commence <Col N="1040" /> to qualify for an increase in the present gratuity once he is within five years of the retiring age appropriate to him and will be eligible for the full gratuity if he serves up to within two years of retiring age.  This is the effect of article 6.</P>
    <P>With regard to soldiers, the amending scheme of 1947 provided a pension increment of Is a week in the basic 21-year pension for each year of service over 21 years and not exceeding 31. This increment is now being increased by the average increase in the pay of the various non-commissioned ranks since 1947.  The table to article 9 shows the amounts of the increases, which vary with the date of discharge.  For soldiers discharged on or after the 1st June, 1969, the increase will apply as from the date of discharge.  The effective date of increase for soldiers who were discharged before the 1st June, 1969, and who were not affected by the Army pay review will be the 1st April, 1970.  I should emphasise that the amounts shown in the table are additional.  For instance, a soldier discharged on or after the 1st January, 1971, with 31 years service will become eligible for a total increment of £3 5s a week in his basic 21-year pension instead of the present 10s&mdash;5s 6d multiplied by ten, plus the present 10s.  When a man becomes eligible for an old age pension or retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts, he will revert to the lower rate of increment.</P>
    <P>It has long been felt that soldiers should be eligible for gratuities in addition to pensions, and article 10 now provides that a married long-service soldier discharged on pension on or after the 1st June, 1969, will receive a gratuity of one week's ordinary pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 31.</P>
    <P>A few examples of what these pensions will mean may be of interest to Deputies.  A married private leaving the Army after 21 years service, when he might be still only 40 years of age, will be eligible for a pension of £7 18s.  3d a week and gratuity of £467 5s.  A married private with 31 years service will be eligible for a pension of £11 3s 3d a week and a gratuity of £689 15s.  A married <Col N="1041" /> sergeant with 21 years service will be eligible for a pension of £9 Is a week and a gratuity of £554 8s, and a married sergeant with 31 years service will be eligible for a pension of £12 6s a week and a gratuity of £818 8s.</P>
    <P>Under the existing schemes, a condition for the payment of an additional married pension to a soldier is that he be in receipt of marriage allowance at the date of discharge.  Marriage allowance now being incorporated in the married rate of pay, the married pension will, from the 1st June, 1969, be payable if a soldier was in receipt of the married rate of pay at discharge. It will also be payable to a widower soldier on discharge, as a soldier now retains the married rate of pay if his wife dies.  Consequently, the married pension will, in the case of a solider discharged on or after the 1st June, 1969, also be continued if he becomes a widower after leaving the Army.</P>
    <P>There are a few other unconnected provisions of the scheme to which I may refer before concluding.  Reserve officers called out on full-time service in August, 1969, had their retired pay suspended under article 17 of the principal scheme for the duration of such service.  Article 7 of the present scheme revokes article 17 and will thus enable the officers in question to receive their retired pay for the relevant period.</P>
    <P>A contributory widows' and orphans' pension scheme operative as from the 23rd July, 1968, is being introduced for the widows and orphans of deceased officers on the same lines as the contributory scheme for the widows and orphans of civil servants and local authority officers.  Article 8 provides that the existing non-contributory pensions payable under the scheme to the widows and children of deceased officers will not be payable in cases where the contributory pensions are payable.</P>
    <P>Article 12 provides for the reckoning, for pension purposes, of service in the Army Nursing Service before retirement on marriage of a widow who is reappointed to the Service.  Any marriage gratuity paid will be deducted from her pay or from her pension on final retirement.  The article also provides for the aggregation of separate periods of service in the case of a particular member who resigned for <Col N="1042" /> domestic reasons but was subsequently reappointed to the Service.</P>
    <P>I feel that Deputies will approve wholeheartedly of the provisions of this scheme, some of which represent a considerable breakthrough.  They represent, for the period from the 1st June, 1969, to 31st March, 1971, a cost of £350,000 and an estimated annual cost thereafter, based on current rates, of £230,000.</P>

      <P>I got the instrument outlining the scheme only when I came to the House this afternoon and it was not possible for me to examine it critically so that I could comment intelligently on it.  We know the scheme was promised a considerable time ago.  It is, indeed, a long time since we had the announcement about the improved pensions and gratuities it was hoped to provide.  Many of those in the Army to whom this scheme applies felt that they would have got the improved pensions and gratuities long since.  From representations made to me I know that much of the money is already spent. I am sure the Minister is well aware of this also.  Many of those people have already entered into commitments covering the full amount of the gratuity provided in this scheme.  I thought the Minister would have brought in this legislation earlier, but what I and those concerned hope and expect from earlier announcements is that it will be possible for the Minister when he gets a quick passage of this motion through the House&mdash;I have no doubt he will get this&mdash;to have these gratuities paid before Christmas.  The Minister has had representations on the subject.  I have put down parliamentary questions about this and I have written to the Minister in individual cases.  There are many more cases that I have been able to reply to on the information the Minister gave me in regard to his intentions about the payment of these gratuities. I hope he will not let down these people and will make their Christmas that much happier by ensuring that payment is made before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the date on which it will be possible to make this legislation effective as 2nd June, 1969, a date when rates of pay and salary in the Army were increased generally.  Is <Col N="1043" /> that a just way to decide the date for improved payment or gratuities?  I think of the people who retired the previous week or month; they will live with a grievance for the remainder of their lives.  Obviously, there are no improvements for them. This is very sad for people who have given long and valuable service to the country.  The Minister may see some way around this.  In one of the provisions in the scheme he does meet the case to some extent, but when we consider men who are retired for a long time they do not get anything like the improvements enjoyed by people retiring in 1970 or 1971.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions here represent only justice and the fact that Army personnel were so long deprived of benefits already enjoyed by other people in the public service is a reflection on the Government and may be one reason why it is so hard to keep the Army up to strength.  It is a long time since Army strength was at such a low level as it is at present.  We find it difficult to recruit for the Army.  Anything that can be done to make Army life more attractive or make people give longer service in the Army is to be welcomed by all in this House. Everybody here will welcome improved conditions for those serving in the armed forces.</P>
    <P>Provision is made here also for improved pensions and conditions for Army nursing personnel.  Heretofore, a nurse who got leave of absence from the Army was regarded as having broken service and did not rank for pension purposes.  If such leave is now given to a nurse and if she comes back to the Army this is aggregated with previous service and is eligible for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this with which any of us would disagree.  I was absolutely shocked when I first learned that if a man stayed in the Army for longer than 21 years his pension only increased by Is.  a year from then on. I know of many experienced soldiers who left the Army because of this and took up jobs in civilian life.  Many of those men would have stayed the extra <Col N="1044" /> ten years if it made any significant improvement in their pensions.  This improves that situation somewhat.  If we calculate it on the level of what those men were previously getting, this could be described as an enormous improvement. It has reached a point where it may induce some people to remain on in the Army.</P>
    <P>I was shocked to learn only last week that even the normal increases in pay granted to nurses throughout the country several months ago have not yet been given to Army nurses.  This is something of which the Minister might take note.  It is hard enough to get people when you treat them properly but if this type of neglect goes on over a period of years it is no wonder the Army is not regarded as attractive to many people who would otherwise join and give excellent service.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say whether those improvements will bring Army pensions and gratuities up to a point where they will compare favourably with similar benefits enjoyed by public servants in civilian life.  The Minister referred to the peculiar circumstances of Army life and the fact that it could not be evaluated in the same way as ordinary civilian employment.  He told us about the advantages which Army people have of early retirement, but there are many disadvantages in this. I am sure the Minister was not anxious to outline those disadvantages but they can be listed.  This provision, however, contains welcome improvements, which are long overdue.  I hope the Minister will ensure that they are paid before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a case I came across recently which it is hard to believe could happen.  I refer to the case of a soldier who was in the battle of Niemba who was retired from the Army on a small disability pension of between £6 and £7.  He lived in a wooden hut on the perimeter of this city.  I was approached to see if I could possibly do anything for this man who was living in such deplorable housing conditions.  It is hard to believe that type of man could be left in that way.  I took up his case.  I said I could do nothing for him with regard to housing him but I would see if I could get <Col N="1045" /> him a job.  I succeeded.  He was shell-shocked but was able to do a job. There was nobody in the Army to take up this case.  I understand a deduction is made in his pension because he gets a disability allowance.  This is something this man earned before it came to the time of his pension.  This is unfair treatment.  The Minister recited the case of a few top-level people in the Army where this sort of thing arose and where he has now introduced in this legislation a provision which will overcome this.  I hope he will be able to see a way to deal with a soldier who has been rendered unfit or partially disabled because of his service in the Army, that his disability allowance will not be taken into account and his pension eventually will not be reduced as a result.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Cosgrave, the leader of our party, raised this at Question Time a few days ago.  I am sure he may deal with this before we finish here because he is more intimately acquainted with this type of case than I am.  This man should have been looked after better by the Army.  If we do not look after our people in the Army better than we have been doing we will have no Army.  The Minister has a responsibility, which I know he takes seriously, to ensure that not only do we keep the people who are there already but that we increase the number in the Army.  We need badly to strengthen the Army and it is up to every Deputy to support any piece of legislation which will improve conditions, whether they be pensions, gratuities or allowances of any sort, in order to make Army life more attractive for more people.  I would like to support this amendment scheme which the Minister has had to introduce in order to implement those improvements which are put before us this evening.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will explain, when replying, why it has taken so long to introduce this amendment scheme.  It is becoming more and more the practice of the Government to announce a year ahead improvements which they intend to bring in. They leave people imagining that the following week, the following month or the following couple of months they will enjoy those improvements and <Col N="1046" /> benefits which have been announced. The Government live on that for several months and the people are not aware that legislation is necessary to do all this.</P>

      <P>When we announce improvements in pay, pensions and benefits of any kind we should indicate more or less how long it will take before they can be implemented, and if it requires legislation to be passed in this House that also should be indicated because people are left expecting these improvements soon.  They enter into commitments on the strength of it.  All of us have had endless representations from disappointed people who require those things and who are waiting for them far too long already.  When this sort of thing is on its way in future I hope there will not be the long delays people have had to experience on this occasion.  I welcome the amendment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say to the Minister that this suggested change is something <Col N="1047" /> which some of us on this side of the House have been fighting for for a long time because, not alone did we put down numerous questions, but I put down a motion, which was debated here several years ago, suggesting some of the things which are included in this scheme.  I regret it was bitterly opposed by the Government and was beaten, on a vote, by them. The fact that they have now found it possible to do some of the things suggested and, indeed, other things which were not suggested at the time, is a welcome change.</P>
      <P>However, I am afraid that the trouble with this measure, as indeed with a lot of other things which the Government start doing, is that it does not go the whole way.  In fact, it falls very far short on a number of items. I wonder why, for instance, some effort was not made to give the same as what a civilian who retires would get.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>It also amends the schemes in other respects.  The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes do not follow a conventional pay-related superannuation pattern.  This is because of the particular nature and circumstances of military service, which involve such things as retirement at earlier ages than apply to the public service generally and facilitating officers to retire on pension after relatively short periods of service.  A pay-related pensions scheme would have administrative advantages and it may come about later, but there are difficulties for the reason I have mentioned. </P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister, without being discourteous, that they are rather flimsy reasons.  There is no reason at all that I can see why an effort should not have been made to try to make them pay-related.  This would have bad a startling effect on pensions and gratuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have with me a table of pensions which have been given in other services. The local authorities superannuation scheme of 1948, which was amended in 1956, is perhaps the best. There is a recent one which has been agreed on with the public service and the Government Departments.  As a <Col N="1048" /> matter of fact, it has not been signed yet because the Department of Finance have not seen their way to getting somebody who knew how to sign a document to sign it.  This also is an effort to improve matters because it gives a pension and gratuity, with this marked difference, that it does not insist on the person being married.</P>
    <P>There has always been a regulation in the Army that to get a gratuity the officer must be married.  This is continued and it includes gratuities for private soldiers and NCOs, which we have been looking for for a long time, but again they must be married.  Is there any reason why a private soldier, an NCO, or an officer who has aged parents or, perhaps, other responsibilities, such as an invalid brother or sister to look after, should be treated in a different way, having served the same number of years as his married comrades?  Is there any reason for that except the fact that by providing that married people only get it a lesser number get it, and automatically all those who are not married are excluded from getting the gratuity, and therefore it is cheaper on the Army.  I think this is a mistake and it should be recognised by the State.</P>
    <P>There is something else which I find rather peculiar, to put it mildly.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The officers who hold the highest posts of responsibility in the Defence Forces&mdash;the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General, the Assistant Chief of Staff and the Officers Commanding the Commands&mdash;are paid at the regimental rates appropriate to their ranks and in addition receive responsibility allowances.  Hitherto these responsibility allowances have not been reflected in their retired pay. There is already in the schemes a precedent for the inclusion of the allowances for retired pay purposes, in that officers in receipt of additional pay in respect of professional qualifications receive a percentage increase in the normal rate of retired pay&mdash;20 per cent in the case of officers of the Army Medical Corps and 10 per cent in other instances.  It is proposed to apply this percentage increase to the officers I have mentioned&mdash;a <Col N="1049" /> 20 per cent increase in the case of officers retiring while holding the appointment of Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General or Assistant Chief of Staff and a 10 per cent increase for Officers Commanding Commands. </P>
    <P>Would the Minister care to comment on why, in addition to the difference in the rates of pay which the officers get, it has been decided to have a difference in the percentage increase?  Surely if it was 20 per cent in one case it should have been 20 per cent in the other?  I do not grudge what the senior men get, but surely the same thing should apply all round?</P>
    <P>I often wonder how the people at Army command level who draw this up think.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>At present the maximum gratuity which an officer may receive on retirement in addition to retired pay does not reach the maximum of one and a half years pay which applies in the public service generally. </P>
    <P>Having said earlier on that he did not refer to or comment on the public service, here he comments on the fact that this is not what is done in the public service.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, officers may retire on maximum retired pay and the present maximum gratuity at ages at which public servants generally would be eligible for neither pension nor gratuity.  It is now proposed, however, that where an officer makes the Army his career and serves to the end, so to speak, he will be eligible, in addition to retired pay, for a maximum gratuity of one and a half years pay. </P>
    <P>Let us leave that for a moment and come to what the Minister is doing for the NCOs and private soldiers:</P>
    <P>It has long been felt that soldiers should be eligible for gratuities in addition to pensions, and article 10 now provides that a married long-service soldier&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I assume he has served to the end</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;discharged on pension on or after the 1st June, 1969, will receive a gratuity of one week's ordinary <Col N="1050" /> pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 31. </P>
    <P>That is 31 weeks pay for the NCO and man and 78 weeks pay for the officer.  The Minister might be able to comment upon that because it appears to be the old question of the more you have the more you get.  I am sure the retired NCO or man will have a harder job to resettle himself in civilian life after 20 or 30 years in the Army than the retired officer.  He certainly will not be able to live on the pension which the Army will give him.  Therefore, he will be looking for a job.  If he got 18 months pay, as is suggested in the other case, he would find it much easier to get employment because he would have the necessary wherewithal to survive until he got a decent job.</P>
    <P>What about the officer, NCO or man who dies in harness?  In civilian pension and superannuation schemes provision is made for this.  If a man has been in the service of an employer for a reasonable period and then dies, his next-of-kin get one year's pay at a minimum. Perhaps there is provision here but I cannot find it if there is.  Do the Army make any provision for a gratuity of a year's pay to be given to the next-of-kin of an officer, NCO or man who dies while serving as a soldier?  That is a fair question and I should like to get the answer to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Reserve officers called out on full-time service in August, 1969, had their retired pay suspended under article 17 of the principal scheme for the duration of such service. Article 7 of the present scheme revokes article 17 and will thus enable the officers in question to receive their retired pay for the relevant period. </P>
    <P>I had a question to the Minister the other day about the officers, NCOs and men who were called out and as a result of being called out suffered very severe financial loss.  As I know personally, some of them lost little businesses.  They had built up these little businesses since they left the Army and because they could not give them their personal supervision during the period they were called out, they <Col N="1051" /> suffered severe financial loss.  Officers who had to go out when they were called left their jobs, some in State employment.  They had to use their own cars and travel long distances. There was a complete disruption of their whole life.</P>
    <P>Some of them who were in State employment got their salaries from the State Department together with their Army pay, but after a few months they got a peremptory summons to return it.  An attempt was made to explain that they should not have got it, but is was given to them.  They had to pay it back again.  Some of them were foolish enough to think they would be paid on the double.  They got a very rude shock.  Some of them who had suffered financial losses because of being called out had used this money and they found it extremely difficult to pay it back.  In one case an officer who was called out&mdash;I suppose he would have died anyway&mdash;died of a heart attack very shortly after being discharged.  His widow had a sum of £488 deducted from her gratuity when she came to claim it.  Although she had eight small school going children she still was asked to pay this sum and, when she could not pay it, it was deducted from the amount of money which was due to her.  That sort of thing might be all right in certain countries.  It is not all right in Christian Ireland.  I would ask that this sort of thing be looked at in a different way.  The fact that the State owed and still owes money to that woman's late husband, which should have been paid to her, made the matter even worse, money which he was due because of a disruption which had occurred and for which he should have been paid.</P>
    <P>I am being severely critical of certain points of this scheme while at the same time admitting that it is a very big improvement on anything that has gone before it.  When the Department <Col N="1052" /> started to deal with something like this they should have gone the whole way and made a final job of it and not have left loopholes which can be commented on in this way.</P>
    <P>I shall quote from page 4 of the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>Article 12 provides for the reckoning, for pension purposes, of service in the Army Nursing Service before retirement on marriage of a widow who is reappointed to the Service. Any marriage gratuity paid will be deducted from her pay or from her pension on final retirement. </P>
    <P>Would the Minister care to comment on why that has been put in?  She has served, she is qualified for a marriage gratuity, she has got married, she has been paid the gratuity.  Her husband dies and she re-applies.  If she were another person there would be no question of this happening.  She is not likely to look for another marriage gratuity but if she goes back she must pay back the marriage gratuity.  How is it proposed to deduct it?  Will the same thing happen as happened in the case of the widow I mentioned earlier?  Will the whole lot be taken out of the first few months salary she earns?  Will it be spread over a period?  Why not spell it out?  I do not think she should have to pay anything back, but if she does have to pay some back let us know how it will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have perfect answers to most or all of the matters I have raised.  I do not deny that.  I have three documents here and, like Deputy Clinton, I only received them when I came into the House.  That is not the fault of the Department of Defence.  Having gone through them I have commented on them as I found them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Statutory Instrument itself I note that the additional increases are being given as follows:</P>

      <Col N="1053" />
    </P>
    <P>Perhaps this is not an intelligent question but I am sure the Minister will let me have an answer.  Where did these dates come from?  How are these dates related?  Why were those particular dates picked out?  I am sure it will confuse the retired men who will get this just as much as it is confusing me. I cannot understand it and I would be glad if the Minister would explain it. There is something else in this Statutory Instrument to which I object very much.  It reads:</P>
    <P>An increase payable by virtue of this Article shall cease to be payable when a soldier reaches the age of 70 years or becomes otherwise entitled to a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1970, as amended. </P>
    <P>Is that not a great social charter for the Department of Defence?  This is what we objected to in regard to CIE and the GNR over the years.  Give the fellows a few bob and when they reach 70 years of age they will not be eating so much so take it back off them again. Why should anybody in the year 1970 decide that that sort of thing must still be included?  It is very neatly worded, because it says:</P>
    <P>... when a soldier reaches the age <Col N="1054" /> of 70 years or becomes otherwise entitled to a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts. </P>
    <P>Whether he gets the pension or not, when he reaches 70 he loses it! As bad as CIE were, they only took the pension back when it had been paid.  The extra 6s. 8d. which made a pension of 13s. 4d. for the retired CIE men was taken back if they got the pension.  The Minister will do it whether they get the pension or not.  This is a mistake.</P>
    <P>I know there must be a date of operation for all these, and there is probably a good reason for the dates that have been picked, but Deputy Clinton referred to the people who retired before a certain date.  It is hard luck on men who have given long service in the Army and retired a couple of days before the scheme of gratuities came into operation.  I have in mind a man who spent 27 years in the Army and finished up as a Quartermaster Sergeant.  He retired a few days before this came into operation.  Therefore this gratuity is out for him.  I am not suggesting to the Minister that he should go back to the day when the first soldier retired.  Perhaps I should because in my opinion this should have applied all along, and therefore it <Col N="1055" /> would be quite consistent for me to say that.  However, I feel that could not be done.  But the Minister could have gone back a little further than he has gone.  I think 1st June, 1969, is the date which is given here and that is not long enough.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the number of years service which a man can have and for which he will get a pension. Originally it was 21 years and after that up to 30 years he got a shilling per week per year.  It has now been changed and it is a big improvement, but why stop at 31 years?  If there was time I would, and possibly I will, Le cunamh Dé, in the next session, put down a question to find out how many serving soldiers there are with more than 31 years service.  If the Minister is saving a lot of money by this perhaps he could justify it, but in my book a man who serves 32, 33 or 34 years is just as good a man if he is there when he is required as if he served under 31 years.  Why include those little things which spoil something that is reasonably good?  It is like the story of the cow that gives the bucket of milk and then kicks it.  It seems to be the same type of idea.  I know of one old man who served for 35 years.  If he were alive today his 31 years would count but the last four would not. I am quite sure that he would be puzzled, as I am, to know if he was any worse for the last four years than for the other 31.</P>
    <P>I am glad this improvement has been put in and I would ask the Minister, whenever he is making a change again &mdash;and let that not be too long&mdash;to include married and single personnel. He should not confine it to married people.  There are many people who are treated in this way by the income tax authorities, by the Department of Social Welfare and now by the Department of Defence.  If you are single you have no responsibilities.  This is entirely wrong.  I know many single people who have much bigger responsibilities than married people because of ill or aged parents, brothers or sisters, and who are trying to keep the family together even though they are not married. Because these people are doing this <Col N="1056" /> they are keeping these aged or ill people out of county homes and out of places like that.  They are doing more than their share for the State and the State is repaying them by saying: &ldquo;Well, you are not married and therefore you do not count.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This arises particularly in regard to social welfare and the Department of Defence should not have followed this lead.  They should have said: &ldquo;If you are giving a gratuity, give it to all those people.&rdquo; Let me say, as one who served in the Army, that I did not see many single persons after ten, 15 or 20 years.  At that stage nearly all soldiers are married.  Therefore the amount of money being saved is relatively small.  I feel that this is a disservice.</P>
    <P>The Army is something of which we should all be proud.  I repeat what I said before, that we have a tendency in this country as in other countries only to realise that soldiers are important and should be respected when there is an emergency or when there is a likelihood of requiring their services. Then they are important people and everybody makes way for them. At other times they are people in uniform and therefore they are just not up to the mark.  That attitude should be killed and the more the Department of Defence can do to raise the status of the Army the better job they will be doing for the soldier.  I would like to see our Army well paid, well drilled and well dressed and when men come to retire they should get a good gratuity and pension from the State which most of them have served so well and for so long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme is a move in the right direction.  The only general comment I would make is that it is encouraging to see that at last there is a move towards treating the Army on the same basis as other servants of the State.  Deputy Tully raised a number of points which are well worth raising.  I do not know what the answers to them are because, like him, I cannot say that I have all the information that is required.  This document like all schemes emanating from, in effect, the Department of <Col N="1057" /> Finance, is rather difficult to interpret and needs a great deal of correlation with similar documents relating to other parts of the public service.  For that reason I hesitate to make direct criticisms.</P>
      <P>To take up a couple of points to which Deputy Tully has referred; there is this question of the soldier reaching the age of 70 years.  The document states:</P>
      <P>an increase payable by virtue of this article shall cease to be payable when the soldier reaches the age of 70 years or becomes otherwise entitled to a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1970, as amended. </P>
      <P>Now, at first glance one can see the logic and the rationale of this.  To me it means that at that stage, but for this section, the soldier who has a pension would under these other Acts &mdash;since he is a civilian at this stage&mdash; get automatically the additional benefits of the old age pension, for instance. Am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But it does say whether he gets the pension or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was the third point to which I was coming. In fairness to the people who drafted this or were concerned with it, we must concede that there is a point, if there was to be an automatic increase from another direction at the age of 70 for that retired solider; but granting that there is, is this provision justified?  To answer that question I suggest the three following points might be adverted to.  On the merits, here is a man who has given service to the State in a not too exalted but rather important service, for which he was not overpaid.  Therefore, whatever he is getting will not be very great. Is there any reason in equity why he should not, even at that age, obtain the benefit, particularly in the case of the private soldier?  If there was a question of big sums coming in at another level, but then I do not think there are, there would be means tests unless they were contributory.  I think that is a fair statement.  If the scheme was contributory there would of course <Col N="1058" /> be no deductions, but if it were non-contributory it would be at a low level. Therefore, should we not face it: if the man does get a little extra benefit at 70 why should he not get it?</P>
      <P>My first point then is, on the merits, might it not be wise and just to let the matter take its course with the individual case?  After all, there will not be such a lot involved.  I do not think the numbers involved will break the State.  My second point I will put in the form of a question because of my lack of information.  Indeed, I should like again to advert to Committees of the House at which Deputies could study these things in depth and in detail and which would make their work more constructive.  I made this point on the Transport Bill and I will make it at every available opportunity.  In the absence of detailed information I cannot be dogmatic.  The question I want to ask is: is this on a par with the rest of the State service?  Are we acting here on a par with the Civil Service, with any other branch of the State service? If we are, I am content; but if there is discrimination I am not content.  I should like the Minister to answer that question.</P>
      <P>In the past&mdash;and many years ago I was able to quote chapter and verse for this statement&mdash;there was a tendency to cheesepare, if I may call it such. I am not dismissing prudent economy and I am not asking for the impossible but where the Army was concerned there was a tendency for cutbacks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity.  It has been there for a long time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the order because it is moving in this direction.  It would be wrong to say it is anything other than a great improvement and I compliment the Minister on this.  I am very glad that this Minister is able to begin his term of office with a constructive approach to some of the Army's problems. Nevertheless, I want to press the point made in the Minister's speech, where he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... is being introduced for the widows and orphans of deceased officers on the same lines as the <Col N="1059" /> contributory scheme for the widows and orphans of civil servants and local authority officers.</P>
    <P>would ask here that the principle which rules on all these matters be made uniform so that a soldier of any rank, a member of the Garda Síochána of any rank, a State teacher and a local authority officer be treated the same.</P>
    <P>If we are moving into a socialistic age, where the State is going to set patterns and organise things, let us have a uniform pattern.  All I am asking here is that the Army be treated <i>pari passu</i> with the rest of the service and then I shall be content.  There will have to be differentiations with regard to the nature of the service, pay and length of service, but the principles governing pensions, general remuneration and so forth should be uniform.</P>
    <P>The principles touching widows and dependants should be on a uniform scheme.  I welcome this provision as a move in that direction.  I take this opportunity to urge that this principle be pursued to its logical conclusion. I want to emphasise that I am not saying this in a critical spirit; it is in a spirit of satisfaction that these views are now being made.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Tully that the lower paid have to be looked after because there is a survival limit.  I would place that survival limit much higher than Deputy Tully.  In his criticism of the treatment of officers holding the rank of Chief of Staff, Adjutant General, Quartermaster General and Officers Commanding Commands, there is a definite point in regard to rank to be made here.  Deputy Tully failed to appreciate, although I am sure he will when I put the point to him, that normally the officers appointed to these ranks get no promotion in rank.  In the British Army and bigger armies like that an officer promoted to such a post would also have a rank promotion.  What happens in our Army is that a Colonel takes a higher appointment with much more responsibility, without getting any increase in rank, he merely gets responsibility pay.</P>
    <P>In the thirties there were three <Col N="1060" /> Major General Officers in the Army and the rest were Colonels.  In a sense two of the three Major Generals were supernumerary in that they had carried on from ranks held in an earlier period.  During the war there were still three Generals although not the same three, and the rank of Chief of Staff during the war was put up to that of Lieutenant General and two Major Generals commanded the Divisions. Since the war the situation has varied but at the present moment, if my memory serves me right, there is only one General.  The post of Adjutant General, Quartermaster General and General Officers commanding the commands are held by Colonels.  We have no Brigadier rank but it would probably be appropriate to the commands. A case could be made for the rank of Major General for the Adjutant General and Quartermaster General and the Assistant Chief of Staff but that has not happened.  What I am saying is that a man who is put into those posts is in effect promoted without getting a promotion of rank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy not agree that it would be better to pay him more equitably to do the job and relate his pension to what he was getting when he retired rather than give him 10 per cent or 20 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy, but he is putting his finger on a difficulty.  Supposing a Colonel is made Adjutant General today and carries on in that capacity for a period of years and then reverts back to another position, and that kind of thing can happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have overlooked that.  I was going to make the point if in fact it had not been provided for in this scheme.  This is a promotion but there is no increase of rank going with it.  It is defensible to include such a provision.  Obviously, I disagree with <Col N="1061" /> Deputy Tully.  I do so on the grounds that it should have been a promotion in rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little more than the rate for the job in an Army command.  Deputy Tully is oversimplifying the matter.  This is one of the great difficulties in Deputy Tully's approach to remuneration: the rate for the job.  I know I am straying from this Estimate, but I cannot resist the temptation of saying to Deputy Tully that I would go the whole way with him if every single man was treated the same and there were no differentiations, but unfortunately we are not all the same and certain elasticity is necessary.  The community benefits from those who have more to give to it, just as the community loses by carrying those who have not enough to give to it.  With that qualification I will accept Deputy Tully's contention of a rate for the job, but we are entering into the area of what one might call higher status for executive responsibility, not only in the Civil Service but in all human activity.  It is somewhat outside the scope of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the Estimate for the Department of Defence and I should not seek to enlarge the debate.  Neither should I cloud the fact that this scheme is a great improvement.  It is to be welcomed and I heartily congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Tully&mdash;perhaps to his surprise&mdash;in his argument in regard to a widow coming back to the Army Nursing Service.  There are not that many widows.  If a widow gets a gratuity when she leaves the service why take that back from her if she returns?  It may be that a change in <Col N="1062" /> this condition might affect the entire public service and so I shall content myself with merely joining with Deputy Tully in raising the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about the importance of the Army and how the Defence Forces are neglected in peacetime and petted when they are needed. All I say on that is let us make sure that, when they are needed, they will be there fit for the task for which they are needed.  In the last emergency we were in a parlous position at the beginning. We got by largely because we were providentially saved from involvement in the war.  That is something for which the country should be grateful.  Had we not the time and that providential protection I shudder to think what would have been the fate of this country in 1939 and 1940. Every single penny that had been spent on the Army in the previous years would have gone down the drain.  We are spending money on the Army now.  We must ensure that that money is well and properly spent for the purpose for which it is provided, and that purpose is to ensure that the Army is in good shape.  Adopting the principle I have outlined of treating the whole Army on the same basis as a public service will be very beneficial to morale and I hope that we are initiating now something which will be pursued in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Giving gratuities to NCOs and men has been something we have advocated for a long time.  It is.  I think, a criticism of the attitude adopted over the years that it is only now this is being done.  I qualify my approval of the scheme by endorsing the comments that have been made in the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago in a Budget Statement the principle of pension based on pay at retirement was accepted. That principle always applied in superannuation schemes in the past but, when it was originally adopted, the cost of living was stable and money held its value.  At the time the statement was made the Minister for Finance accepted that the aim should be to bring pensioners who had retired earlier up to those who were retiring in <Col N="1063" /> the current year.  That was accepted as the principle to be aimed at and it was understood that steps would be taken to implement it by amending legislation or schemes.</P>
    <P>Many pension increase Acts have been passed here over the years since the war giving increases to different categories of public service pensioners. In almost all cases pensioners who had retired in earlier years were brought up to the current rate of pension but the gap in some cases has not been closed.  Because of the fall in the value of money we have always advocated that pensions should be related to pay at the current rate.  That has been the aim in recent years in a number of European countries.</P>
    <P>This scheme introduces a number of improvements, but there are still defects in it, relatively small defects when the aggregate sum is considered but of considerable significance to those concerned.  I want, first of all, to deal with the limiting of the gratuity to one week's pay for every year of service up to a maximum of 31 years.  The effect of that will be that a number of soldiers who might serve on their full term&mdash;is it nine years?&mdash;will be lost to the Army.  They are experienced, trained personnel and it is illogical&mdash; and, I believe, bad nationally&mdash;to allow people of their experience to retire after 31 years instead of giving them some inducement to serve an extra nine years.</P>
    <P>The proposed gratuity makes no differentiation between senior NCOs, other NCOs and soldiers.  The position of a sergeant major is a pivotal one. Sergeant majors have long been regarded as the backbone of an army. In fact, all NCOs play a most significant part.  The number of sergeant majors or company sergeants is relatively small.  They are persons of skill and experience and there is a strong case for giving them some higher rate of gratuity as compared with those given to men who do not attain that rank.</P>
    <P>The other defect in this is that it is not based on the same scheme as applicable to the public services generally. It is an improvement in some cases but, <Col N="1064" /> as I understand it, if an officer dies, his widow gets a gratuity based on nine months salary of the officer whereas, in the Civil Service, a widow gets a gratuity of a full year's service.  Why introduce this?  It is time the Army asserted itself. It is one of the reasons why I and others here have advocated a special commission to inquire into Army pay and conditions, comparable to the Conroy Commission that dealt with the Garda.  I am an unrepentant advocate of proper treatment for the Army and the Garda.  I join with other Deputies who have expressed their support of this because I believe we have never sufficiently recognised the contribution which the Army and the Garda make to the welfare of the people generally. It is, of course, always recognised in a time of stress or emergency, say, when some difficulty arises&mdash;not necessarily of a military character.  Some years ago&mdash;indeed, it was around this time of the year&mdash;there was very serious flooding in the Shannon and other areas.  Our Army did magnificent work by way of rescuing people, bringing supplies, and so on, which was outside their normal scope: it demonstrates the contribution they make in other than a military sense.  The amount involved here is relatively small.  There should be no differentiation, in terms of gratuity, between widows of ex-Army personnel&mdash;widows of officers or men&mdash;and widows of civil servants.</P>
    <P>There are certain other anomalies but, because of the short time which we have had to examine it, it was not possible for me, or for other Deputies, to go into it all.  As the scheme is drafted, an officer is entitled to a full gratuity provided he serves to within two years of his retirement or a graded gratuity to within five years of retirement. A case has been brought to my notice concerning two officers of the same rank: one will shortly retire at 58 years of age after 30 years service; he will get the full gratuity.  His fellow officer, who is 50 years of age, has 32 years service&mdash;two years of service longer&mdash;but, because he is not within five years of the age of retirement for the rank, he will not get the full gratuity.  This is an anomaly that should not exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> I come now to this question of special percentage increases for designated ranks.  I think nobody begrudes the people concerned the increases but there should not be a different rate of increase for special appointments and a lower rate for others.  The picture as presented here does not accurately tell the full story.  As the scheme is drafted, the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General and the Assistant Chief of Staff get a 20 per cent increase: it says. the same as the medical corps.  The officers in other corps get a 10 per cent increase.  This has always been a bone of contention with other corps. They have argued that, because of their technical and special qualifications, they are entitled to the same treatment.  The only reason the medical corps get it is that not merely had they to fight for it but they had to bring a test case against the Minister for Finance about 25 years ago.  That is what established the preferential treatment for the medical corps.  Otherwise, they would not get it.  They had to force it.  I think I am right in saying that the case had to go to the Supreme Court before the Minister for Finance was compelled by a Supreme Court decision to give this.  The medical corps took a test case because of an earlier arrangement, succeeded in it, and, since then, that has operated. This should not be the case, first of all, because they fought for what they were entitled to get and eventually extracted it.  The same treatment should be meted out to all.  If one is entitled to 20 per cent they should all get 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer here is what was referred to earlier and that is the abatement of pensions.  This, again, is a legacy from another era altogether.  It cannot be justified.  What makes it worse is that, in the case of an ex-Army person who has a service pension and a disability pension, his service pension is abated. A number of abatements have been substantially reduced over the years. In certain cases, I think abatement has been wined out altogether.  This is an inequitable proposal from any point of view.  An officer or a soldier earns <Col N="1066" /> a service pension.  He is entitled to that because of his Army service and, depending on retirement and length of service, it is a fixed pension which he has earned because of his service. Because, during his Army service, he incurs a disability&mdash;mainly, in the past, the usual case was that they contracted TB because of exposure to weather or something else&mdash;during the Emergency or, in more recent times, because of service elsewhere, he is granted a disability pension.  The pension awarded in that case is awarded by a medical board because of disability contracted during Army service. It varies with the amount of disability and is graded according to the appropriate disability rate.</P>
    <P>The service pension on the one hand and the disability pension on the other hand are awarded because of service and disability or possibly accident. There is no justification for abatement. I am convinced a large sum of money cannot be involved in this.  I believe that this abatement should be looked into again carefully to see that the anomaly is wiped out.</P>
    <P>The personnel who will benefit under this amendment will benefit considerably compared with their fellow soldiers or officers, who retired at an earlier date.  I have here a figure in respect of a person who retired at the rank of commandant.  His gratuity was £1,360.  Now, a commandant who retires will get a gratuity of £3,000.  It is disproportionate in the case of soldiers.  Then there is this anomaly that I mentioned of two officers in the same rank, one of whom is longer in the Army, but, because he is younger, he will get a lower rate of gratuity.</P>
    <P>My final point is one which I think the Minister should discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government. It concerns the procedure under which pension is deducted from married personnel who overhold a married quarter.  This is a most unfair deduction.  I sympathise fully with, and understand, the Minister's difficulty. There should, however, be some reasonable approach to this.  In most cases, the married personnel who are overholding married quarters apply for <Col N="1067" /> and have their names down for housing with the appropriate local authority. Many of them apply to Dublin Corporation if serving in Dublin; some apply to the local authority where they originally lived or some apply to the local authority in the command area where they are stationed.  In nearly all cases they are people who are married for a number of years and some of the family will have reached adult stage, married and gone away.  Because of their age, obviously they will not have any more children and because of the small number in the family, in some cases only husband and wife, they are not eligible to be rehoused by the local authority or, if eligible, not on a priority list.  It is entirely unfair and improper to make a deduction from such a man's gratuity or to withhold pay emoluments, as is done or, worse still, if they are denied consideration for State jobs because they are in this position.  This is a considerable hardship on the people concerned and some consideration should be given to it in consultation with the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>This scheme is an improvement.  I have been advocating payment of a gratuity to NCOs and men for years. I agree with Deputy Clinton and Deputy Tully that there is no justification for differentiating between a married and a single man.  The enactment of this measure will remove some grievances which many of these people have held for a long time.  I hope that once this is passed&mdash;it is only dated 11th inst and I think it was circulated only today and it has not been possible to examine all the points in it&mdash;there will be no delay in getting pay orders issued to those entitled to them in time for Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to record my appreciation of the performance of our armed forces.  I have observed them at home and in foreign lands and, since their conduct has been mentioned in this debate, I can say that nothing I could do as Minister would be good enough for our forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the comments and observations <Col N="1068" /> of the different speakers.  The scheme has been very well received. A certain amount of criticism is inevitable but generally it is clearly accepted that this is a wonderful advance in Army conditions which is welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned early payments. I hope the gratuity cheques will be issued this side of Christmas.  That is the intention of the Department and we shall make every effort to ensure that this will be done.  Despite the comprehensive nature of this scheme we concede that there are some aspects that could be improved on.  Deputies have commented on the operative date for pensions and said they should be brought back to take in the hardluck cases of those who retired prior to the operative dates.  There had to be a beginning and a fair attempt was made to be as retrospective as possible and cover the situation in a satisfactory way.  This was done by making the retrospection date the same as that of the Army pay review, that is, 1st June, 1969.</P>
    <P>I shall try to cover some of the points raised in the debate.  The matter of different dates for the increase in pensions was raised.  These are tied to the dates of various pay increases</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned the Army Nursing Service and commented favourably on the fact that service for reappointed personnel is being aggregated with previous service for pension purposes.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the undesirable feature of abatement, but this runs across the whole line of public service in general and at this stage it is not possible for me to change the position.  The matter of differential in responsibility allowance, that is the 20 per cent increase in the case of the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General and the Assistant Chief of Staff and a 10 per cent increase for Officers Commanding Commands, was widely mentioned.  It must be seen that benefits are made in terms of degrees of responsibility. It is reasonable to give the men with the higher responsibility the higher percentage increase and that principle has been applied in this case.</P>

      <P>There are things we would like to do and things that could not possibly be done.  It was also suggested that unmarried personnel should get the same gratuity as married personnel. The whole purpose of the gratuity is to help retiring officers and men to set up homes for themselves.  While we would still like to extend the gratuity to single men and officers we consider that we have gone a long way by providing for married personnel.  I hope that in the not too distant future we shall be able to alter the scheme to include single officers and men.</P>

      <P>The question of the curtailment of pension when the recipient reaches the age of 70 was also mentioned.  While I should personally like to allow the full pension, it must be realised that all serving Army men are covered by the Social Welfare Acts and will qualify for a contributory pension which is partly paid for by the State and it is because of this that the principle of reducing Army pensions on the attainment of old age pensions comes into play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dissatisfied with the reply given to me by the Minister for Transport and Power today.  I asked the Minister:</P>
      <P>If it is his Department's policy that State-sponsored companies should ascertain, before placing large and valuable contracts, that Republic of Ireland tenderers have had every opportunity to quote fairly and arrange or vary detailed items, so as to place themselves in a competitive position; and, if so, if this happened in the case of every large tender of £1,000,000 or more placed by State-sponsored companies in the recent past. </P>
      <P>I do not want to weary the House by reading out the full text of his reply, as it can be read in the Official Report. I assure the Minister I am not taking this out of context when I read the last part of his reply which stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When drawing up specifications with a view to inviting tenders State-sponsored bodies, in order to make the maximum use of Irish materials and contractors take full account of the necessity for specifying works and materials in a form convenient for tendering by Irish firms.  These factors were taken into consideration in all recent large contracts placed <Col N="1072" /> by the State bodies with which I am concerned. </P>
    <P>Recently in this House a question was raised about a contract for boiler vans and brake vans by CIE.  I did not find it possible to have a question down because of the Rules of this House and the fact that I was, as the Minister was, engaged in the by-election in Donegal.</P>
    <P>After I returned I availed of the opportunity of putting down this question.  I want it to be clear that I put down the question after having received information that the contrary to the answer given by the Minister was true, that in fact detailed information on all the variations that could have occurred on a recent large contract were not afforded to Irish tenderers nor were Irish tenderers in the position to know all those variations and therefore to make different quotations for different items.  I want also to point to the fact that I am informed, in relation to this contract which was a £2½ million contract secured by British Rail Engineering Ltd., Derby, England, that the first tender which was sent out was for 40 steam heating boiler vans.  I understand that the actual purchase ended up with 22 steam heating boiler vans and 11 electric generator brake vans.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to let me know in reply whether or not this is true, because this would make a great difference to any tenderer.  There is also the question of the quality of goods supplied within this tender.  I understand the contract did not give the opportunity to specify ancillary equipment. Apparently in this type of trade what you might call ancillary equipment is not really ancillary equipment at all. It is highly expensive and a very large portion of the cost of the tender.  I understand that the bogeys on which the rail vans are built vary in price very considerably, by as much as 50 per cent in some cases.  One tenderer was S. &amp; S. of Dundalk.  I am not dealing with them alone but also with whether or not this work should have been done in Inchicore.  The Dundalk tender was for only portion of the work. Nevertheless, it is important to realise that on the question of the supply of those bogeys there can be this variation in the cost.  I do not know what the <Col N="1073" /> situation was as far as the works in Inchicore were concerned, but I know the bogey which was to be supplied from the firm in Dundalk was in respect of what one would describe as the Rolls Royce type of bogey.  There was no opportunity afforded for a variation here and a quotation for a different type if such different type were supplied by the British firm.</P>
    <P>Electrical equipment in those vans accounts for a very large proportion of the cost, and again there is this great variation.  I do not know about the Inchicore works but I know as far as the Dundalk firm were concerned the very Rolls Royce of electrics, namely Stone Platt electrics, were specified and no opportunity was given to vary the price of the electrics by in fact providing a cheaper type of electric.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the variation here is also of the order of 50 per cent.  When one realises that the cost of these vans is approximately divided as to 50 per cent on materials and 50 per cent on labour one starts to realise just what the difference would be if one were to go for the cheaper component parts as against the dearer component parts.  If the opportunity was not afforded to the Irish houses, if I may so call them, to quote like for like, then in fact justice was not done and injustice was done.</P>
    <P>My contention in this regard is further fortified by the statement of the Tanaiste in this House when questioned before I had time to put down my question.  He stated that the Irish tender was so high compared with the other, that there was no question of unfairness of opportunity.  If the opportunity to vary contracts was not afforded to the Irish houses, and particularly the one on which I have the information, namely the Dundalk house, S &amp; S, like was not compared with like and whether a grade variation in price occurred was more a question of quality than of a successful tenderer or an unsuccessful tenderer.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tender of the Dundalk firm I can inform the House that this was based on ten smaller vans which were produced some time ago. At that time the cost of those vans <Col N="1074" /> was something under £25,000.  Based on this a pricing was done on the other vans.  There was no reply to the Dundalk firm as to variations in the quality of component parts.  The successful tenderer was the British Rail Engineering Company Ltd. of Derby, England.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries as to the practice in America in relation to State-sponsored firms or firms who have, shall we say, access to the public purse. In most States in America, the practice is that when a contract reaches a large figure, or even £½ million, the successful tenderer and the amount are announced to the public.  I understand this is not available to us today.  We are talking about the expenditure of £2.6 million.  The firm to which I have referred quoted approximately £1½ million.  As I said, the successful tenderer was the British Rail Engineering Company Ltd. of Derby, England.  The loss to the Dundalk house was 100 men in employment for two years.</P>
    <P>Let us now discuss the successful tenderer.  It is not even a subsidiary of but is part and parcel of British Rail.  Everybody knows the sort of losses that have been made by British Rail over the past ten years.  Everybody who has addressed himself to the situation knows that there was a change in their accounting system and in their subsidy system from the Government. I am sure this is available in the Library but I want to refer the House to two letters in <i>The Economist.</i> The first is from a correspondent who did not give his name.  He merely gave his initials and his point was that British Rail had done very well.  I dislike quoting people who do not give their names and for that reason I merely refer the House to that letter.  I want to refer the House to the letter of Mr. Dennis F. Taylor in <i>The Economist</i> and I want to quote from that letter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the date because it is a photostat copy I have. If the Chair wishes me to ascertain the date I will do so.  It is from a recent copy of <i>The Economist.</i> There was a change in the financial structure of <Col N="1075" /> British Rail and the manner of subsidy by the British Government and, therefore, this letter could have been printed only recently.  I am sorry I cannot give the exact date but I will now quote from the letter:</P>
      <P>Compared with previous years it would be more realistic to express British Rail's financial performance as a £132 million deficit because that is the way in which it affects the taxpayer; approximately the same as for 1963, 1965 and 1966 and considerably more than it was ten years ago when it was for approximately double the manpower, number of stations and considerably more mileage. </P>
      <P>That means that a subsidised British firm came in here and, whether you take it on the quotation of the Dundalk firm of S &amp; S or on the ability of our own works at Inchicore to do the work, removed from here work to the value of £2.6 million, work for 100 men for two years in the Dundalk firm.</P>
      <P>I am deeply hurt and pained at having to speak in this way but I want to refer the Minister to Article XI of the Anglo-lrish Free Trade Area Agreement. I want to quote from the Related Agreements, Exchanges of Letters and Understandings which were laid by the Government before each House of the Oireachtas in December, 1965.  Article XI deals with dumped and subsidised imports.  Paragraph (1) of this Article permits each country to take action on its own initiative against dumped or subsidised imports consistent with its other international obligations.  The action may take the form of duties, the level of such duties to be limited to the degree of dumping or subsidisation. Paragraph 22 of the Record of Understandings states:</P>
      <P>In the period preceding the accession of Ireland to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade it is the intention of each party in regard to dumped and subsidised imports from the territory of the other to act as if Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were binding upon it in relation to the other. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this arrangement is to limit action to dumped or subsidised <Col N="1076" /> imports which cause or threaten to cause material injury.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Minister's answer today was entirely inadequate.  Whether you take this as something which could affect one place of employment or another, it will cause material injury.  The injury can be measured in respect of my information in relation to, I suppose, about two-thirds of the contract quoted by the Dundalk house.  I do not want to be parochial and I do not want to be taken as wanting one place to vie against another, but it is quite clear that this falls within the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  If they so desired, even at this stage, the Government and the Minister could conduct an investigation into the affairs of British Rail Engineering Co. Ltd. of Derby and find that they are highly subsidised and are part and parcel of and not a subsidiary of British Rail.  I have read out an opinion that their deficit is £132 million.  I wonder was it £½ million, or £¼ million, or £1 million, that was used to remove jobs from Irish people.  I want a considerably better answer from the Minister now than he gave us today.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to make one particular matter quite clear.  It is better that we get this aspect out of the way because it was the second matter raised by Deputy Donegan.  The main burden of his case related to the tender placed by the Dundalk firm.  I want to refer, first of all, to the question of the Inchicore works.  I am very glad to say that negotiations have been taking place in recent weeks and that CIE management have made certain proposals to the trade unions to overcome the shortage of skilled staff at Inchicore and I am hopeful that they are now about to reach an agreement that will enable some of the work contracted for by the British firm, referred to by the Deputy, to be sub-contracted and done in Inchicore.  Arrangements are in train between the British firm and the CIE management in Inchicore and the trade unions concerned which caused the initial problem&mdash;the question of lack of skilled personnel due to a regrading system that could have been improved <Col N="1077" /> and on which agreement has now been practically reached between the management of CIE and the trade unions.</P>

I want to emphasise for Deputy Clinton that negotiations have not just been going on in recent weeks but have been going on over the past 12 months in regard to this matter.  I shall not ascribe the blame to any particular side in this matter.  Suffice to say, and I am very glad to say, that agreement now looks likely to be reached and that as much of the work as can be done in Inchicore will be done on a sub-contracting basis with the successful tenderer in Britain and that the successful tenderer in Britain, CIE and the trade unions look like coming together to a successful outcome as far as Inchicore is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Dundalk is concerned, the problem fundamentally is that there is <Col N="1078" /> a preferential advantage given to Irish firms tendering of between 16 to 18 per cent.  There were five tenderers for the contract for carriages and six for the heating vans.  The only Irish tenderer was the Dundalk firm and they only tendered for the contract relating to the heating vans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, step by step. The Deputy raises matters concerning components of the equipment in which there was a variation made subsequently. I want to assure the Deputy that I have discussed this matter in detail with CIE.  They have told me that the only significant variation related to numbers and that as far as the components concerned in the particular railway carriages and in the particular heating vans were concerned there was no significant variation in regard to these components.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy rightly makes the case that if there was a substantial variation allowed to a tenderer in regard to components this would be a cause for concern.  All that <Col N="1079" /> happened was that eventually there were separate tenderers agreed upon for 62 railway carriages and 33 heating vans.  In regard to the 33, originally a different quotation was sought for steam vans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the components of all the categories&mdash;the railway carriages and the heating vans &mdash;there was no difference whatever. There was an ultimate variation in the actual numbers of heating vans and a change from steam to electric in the case of 11 of the heating vans.  That is all.  There was no variation in regard to the components.</P>

      <P>This means that, as far as CIE were concerned, they were perfectly consistent all through in that they did not allow any resubmission of tender or variation in regard to the successful tender by reason of components that the successful tenderer may have been allowed to introduce. Substantially the tender submitted was not changed except the amounts in regard to the individual carriages and individual heating vans, whether electric or steam heated.  The individual amounts relating to each particular category were not changed. There was a slight variation in the total numbers.  That is all.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Did the contract for which the people tendered specify the brand of electric component?  Did it specify the people who were to supply the components?  Because the difference in quality in these components, I understand, can be as much as 50 per cent in cost and you can have one that <Col N="1080" /> will last five years or you can have one that will last 15 years.</P>

      <P>I shall quote from the final paragraph of the actual letter from CIE to me, dated 7th December, in which they set out the case as far as they are concerned:</P>
      <P>In the case of the recent contract for railway carriages and vans, tenders were sought by public advertisement. Five firms submitted tenders for the carriages and six firms submitted tenders for the vans. The three lowest tenders were from firms who had submitted offers for both carriages and vans, and as these offers were very close to one another, it was necessary to examine them in detail and to discuss the technical specifications with the three firms involved.  It was finally decided to place the contract with British Rail Engineering Limited on the basis of a modified specification.  This was done without conceding any competitive advantage to British Rail Engineering Limited.  There was, therefore, no necessity to seek fresh tenders or to consider the higher tenders which were not competitive. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that that is the situation.  If the Deputy wishes to put down a further question, I can amplify on that aspect. The modified specification relates to the fact that the numbers sought in heating vans changed but the actual individual items did not change significantly. Even allowing for what the Deputy would wish, the actual tenders submitted by the Dundalk firm were so way out and beyond the highest of six tenders submitted and away higher than the fifth one submitted that there was no question of any investigation as to the different numbers of heating vans being pursued beyond the three <Col N="1081" /> front tenderers who were near enough to each other that investigation did take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter entirely for the initial tendering and in regard to the initial tendering if certain people priced themselves away out because of the prices of components that is their business, provided they were in accordance with the specifications. What I am assuring the House is that the components tendered in respect of the successful tender accorded with the initial specifications and were not varied in the subsequent variation which arose purely in regard to the numbers tendered for and eventually contracted for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic change was from the numbers; the final number was not the same as originally tendered for and there was a change also from steam to electric provision in some of the cases in relation to the heating vans.  The problem, as I say, is resolved in regard to Inchicore. I met the people from the Dundalk firm and their main anxiety&mdash;and I want to tell Deputy Donegan this&mdash;was that they were genuinely interested in finding out where they went wrong in the tendering.  We had a very constructive discussion on that in my office about three weeks ago.  I interrupted the by-election campaign to see them and I saw them before any question was tabled by Deputy Donegan.  We had a very fruitful discussion.  I saw all the principals of the firm and the chief executive and they made no such case as has been made by Deputy Donegan.  They were anxious to know if I could ascertain in what way they went wrong.  They appreciated that they were away out in their costings and this was a source of concern to them.  They made no attempt to suggest that in the event of the low tender which had been received that it was in any way wrong that the tender should go in that direction if the differential in regard to price submission was as high, and as substantially high, as I outlined to them.</P>
