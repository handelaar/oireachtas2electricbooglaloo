    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to Seanad amendment No. 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the fourth line after &ldquo;total,&rdquo;<Col N="2617" /> to insert: &ldquo;reduced by such amounts as are disregarded by resolution and by amounts deposited with the authority under a housing deposit savings scheme and,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know there is only one hour allowed for the discussion and I do not want to have a Committee Stage debate on this.  It is suggested in the Bill, as amended, that the local authority would have the authority to fix certain sums in regard to income limits, but in fact instructions are sent from the Department of Local Government as to what, in effect, they should be able to take into account when fixing the income limits.  I suggest that, in order to give the local authority the right to do this properly, my amendment should be accepted.  This does not need any explanation.  The Minister understands what it is aiming at and in order to save time I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I accept this amendment any local authority could pass a resolution reducing the assessable income by a specified amount for the benefit of individual applicants or certain categories of persons.  This would lead to too wide a variety of income limits applicable to different individuals and these would be different in different local authority areas.  It would lead to a great many anomalies in the administration of income limits.  As Minister, I believe the Department must retain control because of the obligation on the Department to provide the funds to enable local authorities to pay these grants.  I could not accept the amendment suggested by Deputy Tully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the section says: &ldquo;the total, determined by the housing authority, of the income of the person...&rdquo; In effect, as it stands the local authority has no right to determine; the Department of Local Government determines.  Either the wording of the section is wrong or the local authority should be entitled to determine the income.  Like the Minister, I do not want to see certain local authorities deciding to allow somebody, for whom they have a special regard, <Col N="2618" /> to get into the scheme, who would otherwise be debarred, but I think it should be possible to accept this amendment and depend on the good sense of local authorities to make a general determination which would cover the eligibility of applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This disregarding of &ldquo;by resolution and by amounts deposited with the authority under a housing deposit savings scheme&rdquo; would enable a person with an income of £3,000 a year and with £2,000 in this savings scheme that is proposed to qualify for supplementary grants.  The whole purpose of the payment of these grants is to enable persons of modest incomes to build their own houses.  I do not feel it would be justifiable to extend the income limit to persons having an income of £3,000 because this is not the category of person that we are anxious to cover and to whom we are anxious to see local authorities paying supplementary grants.  It would also create difficulties because it would be difficult to assess the cost of this scheme in advance.  My main objection to it is that it would allow for an extension of grants to persons of much higher income.  This is not the purpose of paying these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Not without the authority of the local authority.  The local authority would have to determine from time to time.  I imagine they would do it perhaps at the beginning of the year.  The Minister is suggesting that if somebody saves money and puts it on deposit for the purpose of building a house&mdash;and young people nowadays are doing this to a great extent; saving the deposit for a house before they get married&mdash;there should be a special way of preventing these people from becoming eligible.  I do not agree with that.  As regards somebody with a high income being allowed to get a grant, I do not think that would happen because we all know of local authorities who, when money became scarce, changed the scheme in such a way as to allow in only those who would normally be eligible&mdash;the worst cases they could find, so to speak&mdash; and when the money became more free they improved the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to be contentious <Col N="2619" /> with the Minister.  I am sure he is as anxious as I am to see the scheme applied properly but there is no point in having a rubber stamp.  Let us say the Department of Local Government will decide what the income limit will be, which is, in effect, what the situation is now, but do not let us say in this Bill that the local authority shall determine the amount and then say: &ldquo;But, of course, they cannot.  We shall tell them what the amount will be.&rdquo; Either one thing or the other is right.  Both cannot be right.  Possibly this matter should have been dealt with earlier but I shall not hold up the House.  If there is any way in which the Minister can meet me on this point, I shall be grateful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department fix the income limits and it is up to the local authority then to deal with individual cases, keeping within the limits set by the Department.  The questions the Deputy has raised about persons making savings before marriage will be dealt with on the Deputy's second amendment, but there is provision made for those persons who have earned exceptional income in years leading up to marriage, and directions have gone to the local authorities asking them to exclude this exceptional income earned usually on overtime by persons anxious to purchase a house in the years shortly before they get married.  It is not possible to accept this amendment as the Deputy has it here, as it would divert the sources to an indeterminate amount into subsidisation, thereby reducing the amount of money available for the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is being fair to the local authorities. What he is saying is that he cannot trust the local authorities to do their own job.  In fact, he says the amount is so-and-so.  The local authority, the Minister says, work within the income limits set.  Frankly, I do not know what he means there because if the limits are laid down by the Department the local authorities cannot go beyond them and everyone eligible under them could come in.  However, if the Minister will not accept the amendment, I <Col N="2620" /> do not propose to have a trial of strength, knowing what the result would be.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2 to Seanad amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In the fifth and sixth lines to delete &ldquo;income&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;regular income (but excluding non-recurring income)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment which does not require very much debate. This situation has occurred time and again where people who have considered themselves eligible have been excluded because of having arrears of wages paid to them.  Perhaps, a wage increase has been in operation and they are given a lump sum of £100, £150 or £200 during the period for which the eligibility is considered, or they may for one reason or another have got a considerable amount of overtime for a particular period, a bonus for some job they have done. This has been used again and again by local authorities all over the country to declare people eligible who would normally be eligible.  It has meant that these people must sit back for 12 or 18 months until they think they have become eligible again.  Some of them never do.  I think it is a reasonable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to support this amendment proposed by Deputy Tully, if it is necessary.  The principle problem here is overtime.  A person might earn an exceptional amount of overtime in one year and that might put him over the prescribed limit for a loan.  It is basic or normal salary that should be taken into account, and I think that probably can be done at the moment, notwithstanding all that Deputy Tully says.  I should like the Minister to clarify that.  If this amendment is necessary it certainly should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amendment is necessary.  As I have explained to Deputy Tully, we have circularised local authorities, and I shall give him the references so that he can check it out.  If to his knowledge there are local authorities who are not <Col N="2621" /> taking the recommended attitude I shall be pleased to hear about them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 14th April, 1967, circular H.5/67, as amended by circular H.H.68 of 13th May, 1968. Basically what this circular contained was advice to the authorities that exceptional or windfall receipts in a particular period might reasonably be excluded from its estimate, and that also supplementary earnings such as overtime or commission should not be excluded in all cases because of the danger of creating anomalies between persons whose incomes are approximately the same but made up in different ways.  A liberal interpretation of overtime earnings is asked for in marginal cases where a person may have earned an unusual amount of overtime in a particular period in order to accumulate funds for the initial deposit on a house or for marriage.  I think that covers the situation fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This point arises in relation to Army personnel other than officers.  I had occasion lately to apply on behalf of Army NCOs for a housing loan and they have been refused on the ground that the total figure as given by the Department of Defence exceeds the income limit.  The figure given by the Department of Defence is under three headings: Army pay, ration allowance and wife's supplement. All these things are taken into account by the local authorities.  There is the ridiculous position of which I have had experience lately of a corporal in the Defence Forces being refused a housing loan by the local <Col N="2622" /> authority because his income was too high.  I would ask the Minister to direct local authorities to exclude ration allowance and wife's allowance. Just to highlight how ridiculous it is, if this man decided to live in barracks the ration allowance would have been excluded and he would have qualified for the loan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has agreed to accept Deputy Cooney's point.  The Minister referred to a circular which says &ldquo;windfall&rdquo;.  A windfall is something you get for nothing.  On the question of arrears of wages, someone has money coming to him and it happens occasionally that he does not get it, for instance, an employee of the State or local authority.  Deputy Lenehan was talking about someone in Mayo who did not get arrears due to him from last year.  Anyway, arrears of pension or wages cannot be counted as a windfall and I know a number of local authorities do not exclude them when assessing income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second point is that of overtime. The Minister says in his circular that overtime should not be taken into account but should not be excluded in every case.  I am afraid local authorities are saying that, if a man has overtime over eight or nine months in a year, it is his regular income, when in fact it may be for a particular year.  He may not have got it the previous year and he may not get it the next year. The local authority have no way of knowing that this will not continue and therefore they will count the overtime as part of his regular income.  I <Col N="2623" /> can assure the Minister that any complaints I receive will be poured on to his desk.  If he is satisfied, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the income relates to one year only and is outside the general pattern of the person's income, then it could, in my estimation, be taken to be exceptional income.  The direction we have given to take a liberal interpretation would apply and it would be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain local authority employees will receive overtime rate or special income because they are doing a special job for three or four months in the summer.  They will get that every year.  Would the Minister consider that a regular income because they will not get it for the remainder of the year and therefore it cannot be counted out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have explained the Department's attitude and the advice we have given to local authorities.  I do not want to go into individual cases, as the Deputy is now leading me.  The House can take it that, generally, our approach to this and our direction to local authorities is not to be strict and severe in their interpretation of these income assessments, but to be liberal and generous in deciding what is the assessable income of the applicant for the purpose of qualifying for the supplementary grant.  This is our advice to local authorities and this, I hope, is the manner in which it is being interpreted and operated locally.  I would prefer not to go into individual cases.  I have told the Deputy I shall consider anything he brings to my notice.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When the Minister said that, if the pattern was that the overtime was rather consistent for a number of years, I gather he said it would then be taken into account.  The only case I had recently was a patently clear one because the basic salary was about £1,100 and the overtime brought it to £1,300 but in the previous year the total earnings were less than £1,000. This was a clear case.  But if the basic salary had been £1,100 and if for three <Col N="2624" /> years running the overtime brought it up to £1,300, would the Minister think that was a case in which the grant should be paid?</P>

What I am suggesting is that, if the grant has not been paid out in full in respect of an application for supplementary grant received by the authority before 1st August, 1970, and provided that the grant was not paid in full before that date, the person should qualify.  It would appear to me from the reading of the Bill that it is intended to exclude people who have received any part of the supplementary grant before 1st August, 1970.  If that is not so, then I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully's amendment does not make this clear but I think I understand now what he is getting at&mdash;persons who have applied for the supplementary grant before 1st August but who have not got any decision from the local authority.  If these people have not commenced building their houses before 1st August they will qualify.  Even if they have had a decision from the local authority refusing them because of being in excess of the income limits they can reapply before 1st August provided they have not commenced the building of the house by 1st August.</P>

      <P>Why should the building of the house have any bearing on it?  It is not completed anyway.  Building is in progress.  The day after tomorrow is 1st August so it would be almost impossible for people to reapply before that date, or for people who have decided they would not qualify to apply.  This is only a small point which will affect many people.  It will never recur.</P>

The concession is something which was desired and I have gone quite some way.  I am afraid I cannot go back, as the Deputy <Col N="2626" /> would wish me to.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, if a person has applied for the State grant and has not been paid in full and the House is still being built it is unfair for the Minister to say that he will not qualify, whereas, if the application was made after 1st August, the person would qualify.  Only a matter of weeks is involved.  If this had gone through the House a month ago&mdash;let us not quarrel about who is to blame for that&mdash;this situation would not arise.  Because it is a question of days the smart fellow who gets information on what is happening here and dashes in to his local authority and makes application this evening qualifies. The normal man in the same situation will not qualify.</P>

      <P>It would make it most convenient in future years if we could alter the amount without having to introduce a Bill here.  This would give the right to the Department of Local Government to alter by order, just as the consumer price index alters, the qualifying figure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment approved in the Seanad gives me the power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to fix income limits.  At present legislation is required to change these income limits.  It is very necessary that the Minister and the Government should have some control over the income limits and be able to fix them at any particular time.  It would be wrong to tie the hands of the Minister for all time by tying this to the consumer price index.  As well as that you would have to take a lot of other factors into account.  These would include trends in wages and salaries and particularly changes in building costs which might not necessarily be reflected in the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>On those grounds I could not agree to accept the amendment.  There could be a substantial difference between the variations in the price of building materials and the variations in the consumer price index.  The amendment gives the Minister the option of varying the limits as he sees fit in the circumstances that arise at any particular time, and the Department will now be able to keep the income limits under constant review and with the consent of the Minister for Finance vary the income limits.  I would assume that it would be an upward trend, that they would be increased as conditions allowed and as it was felt necessary to increase them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that they have the right to review them constantly but the object of the amendment was to ensure that they are reviewed constantly. We have had the ridiculous situation where this sort of thing has not been done and we have had, as the Minister knows, increases.  The Minister talks about increases in building costs.  There have been fantastic increases in building costs and neither grants nor loan eligibility have been increased in line with the drop in the value of money.  If the Minister was at my job for a while&mdash;I am sure he will pick it up quickly enough in his Department but not as quickly as if he had 20 years' experience as a trade union official&mdash;he would find that there is a pattern which runs right <Col N="2628" /> through the whole thing and if the cost of one aspect of living goes up then right along the line the cost goes up. It has been generally accepted that the consumer price index is an index on which most prices can be based and most costs and indeed the value of money if one goes to the trouble of checking it, comparing it with the changes in the consumer price index, and they have been running parallel for a long time.  For that reason the Minister should give himself the right and have the onus on his Department to alter them and not have us waiting for a number of years before somebody like the Minister, new to the job, comes along and says &ldquo;This has not been changed for a long time, I will change it.&rdquo; That is what has happened in this case.  When the Minister has been there long enough he might just fall into the groove and say &ldquo;It was good enough in 1970, so it is good enough in 1980; we will leave it be.&rdquo;</P>

I think it is much more practical to do as I have proposed, that the Minister should be able to influence changes without having to wait for housing legislation to do it.  This is an important step forward because it allows for greater flexibility for the Minister to ensure that if at any time he feels there is a genuine case for increasing the limits he can bring that proposal forward and having got the sanction of the Minister for Finance, go ahead by regulations as against by legislation as at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;resident in the dwelling&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to his licensee or invitee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to avoid the situation that would arise through the inadequacy of the amendment introduced in the Seanad.  That amendment certainly alleviates the position or improves the position created by the amendment originally introduced in the Dáil because that amendment was one under which anybody who entered under any circumstances on corporation property, after a tenancy had terminated, could be sent to prison, including, of course, the sitting tenant who might simply be a person who had failed to pay his rent and had been proceeded against on that account.  As the amendment was introduced in the Dáil a new principle was also introduced and to overhold would be a criminal offence for which one could be sent to prison.  The Minister tried to meet this by introducing an amendment in the Seanad to cover the case of a tenant in that position.  It is a good thing he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This shows the undesirability of hasty legislation.  A special procedure had to be adopted here to get this amendment into the Housing Bill and that in itself reflects the fact that this provision seems to have arisen from the <Col N="2633" /> feeling of the Government that they would not get their Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill through and they desired to get at least some of the provisions of that Bill into law.  They, therefore, adopted this unusual procedure, which required a special resolution of the House, to enable them to introduce an amendment in the Dáil. That procedure was undesirable; to introduce a new criminal offence by means of a Housing Bill is something which, I believe, has no precedent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for the amendment arises because of the fact that the Government acted hastily in order to get this amendment through here for their own purposes and, in acting hastily, the amendment was so badly drafted it now requires to be itself amended.  That is the point I am making.  It was foolish of the Government to tackle the matter in this way. One needs to think very carefully before creating a criminal offence.  It is now proposed to make it a criminal offence for anybody to visit a property in which there is a sitting tenant who has overheld and the person who visits can be sent to prison for doing so. Anybody who introduces a provision of that kind deserves criticism and criticism is necessary here because this was done in haste.  This is a wrong procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of people's rights in the matter of property is one about which the law is very careful. The law has always protected the occupier and has protected him against any forcible ejection, even by the landlord himself.  This is, in fact, one of the most striking provisions of the law of property in these islands.  A particularly striking feature is the fact that, whereas British legislation in this respect confines itself to penalising the landlord who forcibly enters property to put a tenant out, even if the landlord has a right to that property, the Forcible Entries Act in Irish legislation goes further and requires that the occupier, if ejected, be allowed to reenter. The reason for this is the undesirability <Col N="2634" /> of allowing people to take the law into their own hands or even allowing the police to act without the authority of the court in a matter concerning the ownership of property, even where that ownership may be in doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to explain why this amendment is necessary. It is necessary because legislation was drafted so hastily as to leave innocent people under threat of being sent to prison.  This should not happen.  It is undesirable to introduce a new criminal offence in a haphazard, thoughtless way, and, it is because that was done, that we are in the difficulty in which we now find ourselves.  The difficulty is a quite serious one.  It is true that the tenant who has not paid his rent and holds on cannot be sent to prison for so doing.  Let us think of the people who can be sent to prison under this amendment: anybody who enters can be sent to prison.</P>
      <P>What does entry mean?  There is no definition of entry in this hastily drafted provision.  There is no definition of entry in the Local Government code or in the legal dictionaries so far as that particular law is concerned. The word &ldquo;entry&rdquo; exists in the criminal law all right and there it is something which can happen very easily. One need not go into a building to actually enter it; under the criminal law the smallest entrance or trespass of the human body on the premises is sufficient.  Putting one's foot on the doorstep of a dwelling is sufficient to connote entrance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no special definition of entry here and so the interpretation that must be given to entry must be that in the criminal law already on the Statute Book.  If you put your foot on the doorstep you are committing the act of entry under this Bill as drafted. In those circumstances anybody who goes to the door of a house in which <Col N="2635" /> there is a tenant who happens not to have paid his rent and to be overholding&mdash;the tenant is protected from criminal proceedings by the amendment introduced in the Seanad&mdash;is committing an offence.</P>
    <P>The milkman delivering milk could be sent to prison for a month.  Supposing a cat strayed in and a boy followed it to take it out he could be sent to prison.  If someone is sick in the house and a priest comes to visit he can be sent to prison.  If a doctor calls to see a patient he can be sent to prison.  If a lawyer calls to advise the tenant he can be sent to prison.  If a TD calls to persuade the tenant to leave he can be sent to prison.  If a member of the St. Vincent de Paul Society calls, he can be sent to prison.  Even the postman could be committing the offence of entry by putting the mail in the letter-box. The postman and the milkman can be sent to jail.  The process server who calls to serve a writ can be sent to prison.  The man calling for the insurance contributions can be sent to jail; the man reading the gas or electricity meters or indeed relatives or friends, who may be invited to call, can be sent to jail.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive that it is the Minister's intention to fill the prisons with this varied selection of innocent people.  The fact that he threatens to do so is, I am sure, due to inadvertence rather than malevolence.  In view of the situation that has been created by the hasty drafting of the section and the decision to bring this matter within the scope of criminal law&mdash;which is itself dubious&mdash;I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>After six centuries of provisions in the law designed to protect the occupier of premises, I have grave doubts about making trespass into buildings a criminal offence.  It has never been a criminal offence in this country and I am doubtful about it now.  I recognise that a defence can be made for such provision in one instance only.  The reason the offence of trespass has not been a criminal offence is that by making it an offence it would involve sending people to jail over matters of disputed property rights and as <Col N="2636" /> property rights are often in dispute the use of criminal law is entirely inappropriate. It has only been used once in this country in a penal code against land agitation in 1851 by the British Government; even the British Government did not go so far as to apply it to buildings but only to land.  That is the Act under which anything that inhibits agricultural exports is a criminal offence, as well as the breaking of workhouse windows.</P>
    <P>In this instance we are dealing with corporation property, the ownership of which is not in doubt.  For that reason it is defensible, and, although I am not happy about it, I accept the Minister can make a case for making it a criminal offence because the ownership is not in doubt.  In those circumstances perhaps there is a case for making it a criminal offence, but there is no case for making it a criminal offence for anyone who legitimately goes into the house.  The Minister must realise that a mistake has been made through inadvertence and at least by accepting the amendment the mistake can be retrieved.</P>

      <P>This section is required to act as a deterrent to persons to take up occupation of local authority houses without the consent of the local authority.  The House is aware that this has been a practice, particularly in Dublin city, for quite some time, and it has created many difficulties for the officials of Dublin Corporation.  It has caused frustration to the legitimate applicants on the Dublin housing list. Had these persons not acted in an illegal manner qualified persons would have obtained a house from the local authority.  This kind of action cannot be justified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the law as it stood was not strong enough to act as a positive deterrent, it was felt necessary to introduce some legislation that would act as a greater deterrent.  The purpose of this section is to do that.  I think Deputy FitzGerald has let his imagination run away with him when he quoted cases of a TD calling on a house and as a result of entering the <Col N="2637" /> house without the knowledge of the local authority he commits a criminal offence.  The Deputy named a variety of persons who in the ordinary course of their work could have legitimate reason to call to these houses and it is naïve of the Deputy to expect that a case would be prosecuted in any court against persons acting in this manner. The section is not intended to operate against people who are going about their legitimate business; it is only intended to act against those who take up occupation of local authority houses without getting the tenancy from local authority.  It is not intended that it should operate against a person who had been living in the house with the official tenant who may have died.  The person remaining in the house could be said to be there without the consent of the local authority; but it is not intended that the section should operate against that person.  I am satisfied, as are my legal advisers, that this section caters for the kind of occurrences we are trying to prevent.</P>
      <P>There are some anomalies in Deputy FitzGerald's proposals.  The Deputy mentions the licensee or invitee but he would be creating a situation where the tenant could nominate his successor if he was about to relinquish the tenancy. If the Deputy's amendment were accepted it could act as an instrument for intimidation of the tenant by persons who were anxious to go in as squatters.  If those people were aware that the tenant was about to leave the house, they could intimidate him into saying that he had invited them in.  I could not agree to accept this amendment because of the extra difficulties that would be created.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty that tenants of corporation houses may begin to sublet certain rooms in the house.  In some cases local authorities permit this, but it cannot be done without the consent of the local authority.  However, it would be highly improper of the local authority to turn a blind eye to subletting that was creating gross overcrowding. Again, this would be covered by Deputy FitzGerald's amendment. These people would be invited in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment, as Deputy FitzGerald sought to make clear with his examples of what could happen, is to show that the section, as introduced, is inadequately drafted and leaves room for consequences not desired by the Minister.  The Minister has indicated the reasons for the section and they are <Col N="2639" /> commendable reasons.  You cannot have a situation where people take the law into their own hands and force entry into an unoccupied house.  That must be curbed.</P>
      <P>Why it happens is another thing. How to curb it is the point of this section and this amendment.  We are anxious that it will be curbed in a way that will be clear and that will not lead to any doubt as to the legal position. The section, as drafted, requires Deputy FitzGerald's amendment to ensure that innocent people will not be perhaps unwittingly prosecuted.  It is not an answer to say that, in a <i>bona fide</i> case, no prosecution will be taken. If the legislation were properly framed, that could not be said because it would not be possible to take a prosecution in a case where an innocent person might have gone into possession or a person not intended to be covered by the spirit of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts will have to be dealing with the letter of this Act and the corporation will have to enforce the letter of the Act.  As drafted, the consequences which Deputy FitzGerald outlined could follow.  I think he gave those extreme examples to highlight for the Minister the consequences that could follow.  As drafted, the offence can only be committed when there is no tenancy.  At what precise point of time a tenancy becomes a non-tenancy is something that gives rise to considerable doubt in the legal world.  Is it when notice to quit expires or is served or is it when a demand for possession is made consequent on such notice to quit?  The ordinary incidents of a normal tenancy are excluded to some degree in the case of local authority tenancies.  I can foresee a field day for lawyers in both the summary and superior courts in interpreting whether or not there was a tenancy in existence at the time the alleged offence was committed.  In order to remove that situation and to tighten the drafting, Deputy FitzGerald's amendment will go some way towards that end.  It is essential that, when a new criminal offence is introduced, the crime should be absolutely clear.  There should be no <Col N="2640" /> doubt whatever as to when it is being committed.  As drafted, this section does not make that position clear at all.</P>
    <P>You could have the situation where a person could be in occupation legitimately following the termination of a tenancy.  You could have the situation where a person took out letters of administration to a deceased tenant and it was necessary for that person to obtain access to or to enter the dwelling concerned in order to secure the assets of the deceased.  That person, technically, would be committing an offence under this Bill in performing his legal duty.  Again, a person without obtaining formal letters of administration might constitute himself administrator dissentor and, for that purpose, enter into possession.  Again, he would be technically, under this section, guilty of an offence.  It is not an answer for the Minister to say, in effect: &ldquo;But that person would not be prosecuted&rdquo;.  The point is that he could be prosecuted and, so long as he could, the section is badly drafted.  I submit strongly to the Minister that there is something very wrong in this, in any criminal offence, particularly in a novel and new criminal offence.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand the Minister to say that this section as drafted will leave subtenants open to prosecution and imprisonment. That is what he said.  I hope it is not so.  From his local authority knowledge the Minister will know that corporation and urban council houses throughout the country are full of subtenants, most of whom <Col N="2641" /> are related or inlaws of the legal tenant.  I hope the Minister does not intend to make it a criminal offence for a parent to bring his son and daughter-in-law into the house to reside with him or her because I think that is going much too far.</P>
      <P>I could see difficulties if Deputy FitzGerald's amendment were accepted exactly as it is here.  It could be difficult to enforce the section and there might be abuses.  However, the spirit of the amendment is correct and it should be accepted.  If instead of &ldquo;...or to his licensee or invitee&rdquo; words such as this were substituted, &ldquo;...or to his bona fide licensee or invitees&rdquo;, or words to that effect,&ldquo;or to a licensee or invitee who, in the opinion of the court, was a bona fide licensee or invitee&rdquo;.  That would get over the intimidation the Minister spoke about or it would get over bogus invitees or licensees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised so many points now, some of them very doubtful, that I think we must go back over this a bit.  The Minister opened by explaining that this was intended to deal with squatting. As I have pointed out to him several times in the House, in fact, squatting comes under the ordinary civil law and at present local authorities have no difficulty in securing ejectment proceedings against squatters. Sometimes they are loath to proceed but this does not change anything here. They will be even more loath to proceed if it is a criminal offence than they are when it is only a civil offence.</P>
      <P>I am not clear as to why the law has to be changed and a criminal offence has to be introduced.  The Minister should have regard to what was said by Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor of England, the conservative and Tory Lord Chancellor of England, the upholder of law and order there.  In an interview in the <i>Sunday Times</i> last Sunday week, when asked whether he intended to introduce criminal legislation to deal with these matters he said: &ldquo;Certainly not&rdquo;, that there was no need for it, that the civil law dealt with these matters and that it needed to be strengthened and improved. In England they have strengthened and improved it.  A new Supreme Court rule, No. 113 I think, has been introduced which enables them to proceed against people who are squatting on property even if their names are not known, whereas hitherto it was necessary to know their names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would fully support any measures to strengthen the civil law against squatting.  I would also support measures for local authorities to use these provisions, though I would wish <Col N="2644" /> them to be used humanely and I would hope that where people were squatting, not for political motives, not to cause trouble, but in desperation, they would, before being ejected, be offered alternative accommodation.  Incidently, that has been the practice of Dublin Corporation to my knowledge until today.  I understand at this moment an ejectment is proceeding in which the people have not been offered alternative accommodation.  It is the first time in my experience that this has happened.  This is a case in which people have been in a house for over a year.</P>

      <P>I did not want it to be suggested that on this side of the House we were in any way condoning squatting.  On the contrary, we would welcome any steps to deal more effectively with squatting although, in cases of genuine hardship, to deal with it humanely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not really follow the point about the subtenant.  Is the Minister suggesting that under my amendment the person who is overholding could invite someone in and make him a subtenant? I would have thought&mdash;and my knowledge of the law may be defective &mdash;that somebody who is an invitee or a licensee is not a subtenant.  I would have thought a subtenant was in a different category.  I would not have thought that a subtenancy would be valid as covering a licensee or invitee. Surely if a man became a subtenant he would no longer be a licensee or invitee.  Therefore, if a subtenancy were created by an overholding tenant after the point where he had ceased to hold the tenancy, it would seem to me the creation of that subtenancy in respect of somebody who had become <Col N="2645" /> a resident in the house, would withdraw the protection of my amendment from him because by becoming a subtenant he would cease to be a licensee or invitee.  On this, I would require legal advice.  The point was raised by the Minister.  I had not considered it.  I think it is open to question as to whether I am not correct in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has suggested an amendment saying a <i>bona fide</i> invitee or licensee.  I would accept that, if it helped.  I would accept any proposal from the Minister to meet my point. There is normal procedure for legislation in this House.  Legislation is prepared. The Opposition examine it carefully. They may find defects or loopholes. If there is a genuine defect or loophole, in particular if a law creates a criminal offence in respect of innocent people because of defects in drafting, it is the responsibility of the Minister concerned&mdash;a responsibility which most Ministers accept&mdash;to meet the point made.  The amendment drafted by the Opposition may itself be effective in some respects just as the original legislation was defective.</P>
    <P>That is met by the Minister saying&mdash; this is the normal procedure and the Minister must know this from his experience as a Deputy, even if his experience as a Minister has not yet been sufficient to bring him through this mill&mdash;to the Opposition Deputies, as the Minister said to me: &ldquo;Your amendment is too sweeping.  It has these defects.  However, you have a valid point and I propose to meet it by doing X, Y or Z.&rdquo; He then proposes a counter draft which, if it meets the point made, the Opposition accept, and the amendment goes in in the Minister's name and he is welcome to the credit for it.  That is how legislation is put through this House, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as you know from your long experience.</P>
    <P>In this case we have an extraordinary position.  The Minister made objections to my amendment which I think have some validity.  I do not quarrel with that.  I do not claim that it is a brilliant amendment.  It is designed as a means of dealing with the problem, but it is not necessarily the best means.  Having admitted that he is creating a criminal <Col N="2646" /> offence in respect of all the categories I have mentioned and that any of these people could be sent to prison, the Minister simply says that the law will not be enforced against them.  It is a bad principle to introduce legislation which makes criminal offences in respect of innocent activities and then promise it will not be enforced.</P>
    <P>That principle is one which no Opposition party could accept.  If the Minister were sitting on this side of the House and a Fine Gael Minister or a Labour Minister said this to him, he would be the first to protest that it was bad law, and bad legislation, and not the way to proceed.  The onus is on the Minister to propose an amendment to my amendment, or a modification of my amendment, or an amendment of his own to meet this point.  He has a duty to do that.  The House cannot accept that innocent people&mdash;a boy following his cat into the house, a postman delivering a letter, a milkman, a priest, a doctor&mdash;should become guilty of criminal offences but the Minister promises that the corporation will not prosecute them.  That is no way to proceed.</P>
    <P>If there is a genuine need for this provision, which I gravely doubt, because it is adequately covered by the civil law if properly enforced by the local authorities, it should be designed to meet the problem of squatting, whereas this legislation covers the whole field of anybody who enters. May I also make a point that the Minister in introducing this Bill to the House told us it was intended to deal with people who break into corporation dwellings?  That, of course, was misleading.  He misled the House. There is no reference anywhere to breaking into a corporation dwelling. The Bill talks about people entering. They do not need to break in.  I can quite see that there may be some kind of a case for making breaking into a corporation dwelling and occupying it a criminal offence but, that anybody who enters through the door which is wide open, at the invitation or behest of somebody who, as far as he knows, is the legitimate occupier of the house, should be guilty of a criminal offence is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2647" /> I have two other amendments down. I have some reason to believe that they may not be accepted as being in order. This may be a pity because one of them deals with this question of entering and suggests that the entry should be forcible.  That, in fact, is what the Minister in his opening speech on Committee Stage told us the Bill was doing.  He referred to the question of breaking into a house but that is not what this Bill does.  May I make this point, and it is completely relevant to the amendment?  If the word &ldquo;forcible&rdquo; had been used in relation to the entry, my amendment would be unnecessary because, obviously, the boy following his cat in, or the postman, or the priest, or the doctor, does not make a forcible entry.  Our difficulty here arises because the Minister in drafting the Bill did not implement his stated intention.  Had he done so, and had the Bill applied only to squatters who broke into a house, then my amendment would not be necessary at all.</P>
    <P>There is bad drafting from start to finish of this section, with its failure to implement the Minister's own stated intentions that it was to deal with people who break in, its failure to exclude those categories of people who would be completely innocent entrants of the dwelling, its failure to appreciate the need to define &ldquo;entry&rdquo; more precisely&mdash;because, in the absence of a definition, the criminal definition of &ldquo;entry&rdquo; would apply.  These defects in the Minister's handling of this Bill have got us into this difficulty.  It is not our fault.  It is the Minister who in these three different ways created the problem.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the Minister to propose to us the means to remedy it.  We clearly cannot accept, he cannot expect us to accept, he would not himself accept on this side of the House, a statement coming from the Minister that we are making it a criminal offence for all these innocent people to do these innocent things but we promise we will not enforce it.  That is something we cannot accept and the Minister knows we cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>Another point to <Col N="2648" /> which I wish to draw the Minister's attention is that certainly under Dublin Corporation corporation houses are left vacant for a long period and are a standing temptation.  Vacancies are not filled by ordinary tenants at the proper time so that in a situation of poor housing there is a temptation to unfortunate people to go into these vacant houses when they are vacant over long periods.</P>

      <P>There is a further point arising on the question of drafting and the uncertainty of the position of a defendant prosecuted for this allegedly criminal offence.  The Minister's amendment in the Seanad excepted from the ambit of the offence any person who was ordinarily resident in the dwelling at the time of the termination of the tenancy.  This phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; has not been defined and I think it defies definition. You would then have a situation where a person comes into court and says: &ldquo;I had gone in to live there and I was a week there but my grandmother died in England.  But for that I would be ordinarily resident in it for a longer period.&rdquo; Or he may say: &ldquo;My one day's residence in it constitutes the commencement of ordinary residence.&rdquo; It is being left to the individual courts to interpret what &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the law is satisfactory when somebody cannot look at a piece <Col N="2649" /> of legislation and say: &ldquo;If I do this I am committing a criminal offence.&rdquo; As it stands, a person will look at this and say: &ldquo;I might be committing a criminal offence.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have asked the Ceann Comhairle to allow me to make an explanation.  Yesterday afternoon when I was in the Chair at 5.30 Deputy Neil Blaney asked me who was listed to speak.  I pointed out that Deputy Desmond was speaking, Deputy Donegan was next and that there was no further speaker.  Deputy Blaney asked me to record the fact that he was anxious to speak which I did giving the time and noting that nobody was offering from Fianna Fáil.  Subsequently, I understand that Deputy Blaney pointed out that there was some implied promise that he would be allowed in next.  I do not want to become involved in any row between Fianna Fáil Members; it is a matter for themselves to decide who gets priority but I should like to point out in fairness to Deputy Blaney that he did ask me to record the fact that he wished to speak and it is recorded in the book in front of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think at this stage we can rule out the possibility of an autumn Budget.  Reading between the lines of the Taoiseach's speech and assuming that he is still Taoiseach and that the present Cabinet still holds power, I think we cannot avoid an autumn Budget.  The hard line on incomes expansion which the Taoiseach marked and which was pretty clear in his speech at the beginning of the debate was followed up by <Col N="2651" /> the Tánaiste, his acolyte on the incomes problem, and I have no doubt that all this points to a hard autumn budget.</P>
      <P>The Government have succeeded&mdash; how I do not know; the people will have to judge this for themselves&mdash;quite apart from their political problems of their own making in relation to their treatment of the north and their policy on unity, in managing things so that the economy has, in fact, stopped growing.  No further growth expansion this year is predicted and, at the same time, we have a very bad inflationary position in which prices are going ever upwards with wages following not far behind.  This is a situation which in other countries has been met by devaluation of the £.  Earlier this year I asked the Minister for Finance if devaluation was contemplated because it required no gift of prophecy early in the year to see the bad economic situation in the offing.  The newly appointed Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, proudly replied that there would be no devaluation of the £ as long as he was Minister for Finance.  Some people may say that it is unlikely but all I can say is that other countries in a similar situation have been forced to take this particularly drastic step.  It is a measure which on the performance of our economy at this time would appear to be one that could be considered here. It would not fall easiest on working people but it is a measure which the Government, by their incompetence in the management of our economic affairs, have certainly brought on their own heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever happens, in all probability we shall have an autumn Budget.  All of the Minister of this Government have called on the community to exercise restraint.  It is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; word for this Cabinet.  I am not one of those who takes a judgement from a man's private life and applies it to his public life and how he conducts himself in public. However, it is only fair to look at the style of the members of the Cabinet who are calling for such restraint from the community.  The Fianna Fáil Government have been in power for 13 <Col N="2652" /> years and ever since the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, was in office, the style has been one of ostentatious living and spending; this is the era of the big spenders, the era in which some of the notorious big spenders also happen to be Government Ministers.  I am aware&mdash;and I know politicians are no more exceptional than other human beings in this&mdash;of the kind of political criticism which, cloaking its envy seeks to give an ideological basis for an attack on those who happen to possess wealth.  I do not wish to take that standpoint this morning.  My point is that when members of the Cabinet make an appeal to their fellow citizens to exercise incomes restraint it is only fair that those fellow citizens should take a look at the living style of those Cabinet members.  Certainly it must cause indignation to their fellow citizens, that such representatives, such people, that they who call for incomes restraint, should also be the proud owners of high-priced horses at handicap meets around the country, that they should have the neck to appeal to the community for incomes restraint.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says he is not addressing his remarks on incomes restraint purely to workers.  There was a vague intimation in his speech that unless greed stopped elsewhere he might act there, too, but it was only to those who are unfortunate enough to earn their living on a wage basis that there was a specific threat.  The more we look at this Cabinet, the more we try to unravel the social programme of this Cabinet and the more we explain to people about their make-up, the better people will be able to see how seriously they should take this Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting we cannot take seriously any pleas for incomes restraint on the part of the Cabinet whose public and governmental style has been to hold themselves up to the population as the big spenders, saying: &ldquo;Spend now.  Do not save.&rdquo; I would say without any exaggeration that this is a Cabinet which is hooked on inflation and for these addicts of inflation to address themselves to other citizens on the subject of restraint is a very bad joke.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach's plea <Col N="2653" /> to the trade unions to exercise incomes restraint will be listened to.  I do not imagine any trade unions could listen to an appeal coming from the head of a Cabinet who have made so many errors in the management of the economy who, in their most recent Budget showed little concern about the problem of inflation.  We are all agreed about that.  Even their own apologists admit that the earlier Budget of this year was one which failed to tackle the problem of inflation which at that time was perfectly evident.  It was a Budget which threw kerosene on that inflationary fire which had already shown itself in a steep rise in prices.</P>
    <P>We remember the increase in turnover tax.  We pointed out that such an increase in the turnover tax must mean a sharp increase in prices.  Of course, this has now taken place.  We also pointed out that it was hypocrisy for the Government to claim that the increased social welfare benefits indicated that the Government had a tender social conscience, when in the period which would elapse before these benefits came in, these unfortunate people would be paying increased prices as a result of an increase in the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Any commentator on economic affairs will tell you that the Government which seeks to raise its revenue on the basis of a single tax, as this Government attempted to do in the last Budget, are a Government which are careless about the effects that will have on prices generally.  There is no better way to increase prices than to impose all your taxes under the one heading and seek to raise your revenue on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance only yesterday declared in the Seanad that he would be introducing a new value added tax next year.  The same Cabinet which are calling for incomes restraint are advocating the introduction of a tax which, as any economic commentator will agree, must lead to further inflation. For this very reason the introduction of the value added tax is being opposed at present in Britain because of its recognised adverse effects on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2654" /> There is confusion in this Cabinet as to how they will deal with inflation. The Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, said yesterday: &ldquo;Name a country which does not have a balance of payments problem.&rdquo; Nobody in this House ever suggested that other countries do not have balance of payments problems, but I would ask the Minister for Health to name a country which has a balance of payments problem of the magnitude of ours and which also, at the same time, has rising unemployment and rising prices.  That is precisely our situation.  Therefore, I would ask the Taoiseach, when he is winding up the debate this evening, to give us the name of the country that has these three maladies all going on at the same time.  I do not know of any country east or west of any curtain which has those problems.  There were more people unemployed here in May of this year than in any May over the past 12 years, leaving out the number of people out of work in the cement strike.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot blame any coalition for this situation.  Since 1957 this Government have been in sole authority.  They themselves are the authors of the disasters which are overcoming them on every front, economic, political and northern.  There is confusion about what is their policy.  They may devalue the £.  They may be forced to do that.  Their mistakes bring this possibility very near.  They may bring in an autumn Budget which would seek to add fresh taxes.  Quite obviously, they should have dealt with the matter of rising prices long before now. They needed no gift of prophecy to see it.  The Civil Service could inform them of the increases which everybody else could see around them.  They knew what was happening on the incomes front.  They did nothing.  They may now bring in this autumn Budget.  They have been very fluent on the threat posed by rising wages and at this stage their remedy for their economic problems is the very old-fashioned, conservative one of beating down the wage earners.  The Tánaiste's ideal world seems to be inhabited by docile trade unionists who do not eat, who do not look for wage claims, who stay at home doing what I do not know but certainly <Col N="2655" /> they are people who do not consume at all.  They obviously just exist, immaterial beings in the Tánaiste's own imagination.  They obviously do not consume because to consume one must seek increases.  These ideal trade unionists do not do any of these wicked things.</P>
    <P>The Government were lackadaisical when we pointed out the price increases. In question after question at Queston Time we told successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce that a sharp price increase had been registered in a certain series of goods and the Minister involved replied on several occasions that his inspectors were not aware of the increase at that time.  One cannot expect much from a Government with a Minister for Industry and Commerce who has inspectors to spot out price increases and when a Deputy brings, long after the event has taken place, these price increases to his notice he declares himself ignorant of such price moves.</P>
    <P>They are a Government, therefore, who have not shown themselves aware of increases when they have taken place and whose seemingly only permanent response to our economic difficulties is to restrain the wage earners in our community.  Their only response, in fact, boils down to one of:&ldquo;Contain wage demands&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach in his opening speech, in which he considered the serious threat posed to the economy by inflation, denied that, in fact, he was addressing his remarks only to wage earners but, in effect, the specific threats included in his speech are directed solely to wage earners. They do not enter other areas.  This Government are now back at the Lemass philosophy expounded originally in the pamphlet about the closing of the gap put out by Mr. Lemass when he was Taoiseach in the 1960s. That philosophy then announced and now unveiled once more is unchanged. It is that if the wage earners of the country can stop their demands for better conditions our economic problems will be settled.  This of course, in itself, is a very doubtful proposition.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have rising prices, a <Col N="2656" /> big increase in the deficit in the balance of payments with Britain, a slowing down of growth in the economy and the prospects for later this year in the matter of employment show no sign of improvement.  We had the highest unemployment rate for 12 years last May.</P>
    <P>What of the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement?  In the month of June our deficit on trade with Britain for the first six months of the year&mdash; and these are figures given out by the British Board of Trade earlier this week&mdash;was £5.23 million over the same period in 1969.  In June alone imports exceeded exports by £5.36 million as against £4.9 million in June of 1969. We are getting far more British imports into the country.  It is interesting, on the breakdown of these figures of Irish-British trade, that the biggest area of deficit is in manufactured goods so that our exports to Britain of manufactured goods amounted in June to £5.86 million and our imports for that month form Britain amounted to £9.96 million, nearly £10 million.  Of course we buy these manufactured goods in the shops at present, products of the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which the Cabinet opposite signed and which they told us would be ultimately for the good of this country. Now we are seeing here in the early 1970s some of the bitter fruit of that agreement, signed by Members opposite with so little heed of its future effects on the economy.  All these things, all their mistakes, are now pilling on their heads and their only concern is to get culprits, to get a way out, to scuttle away from the problems which only they have produced by their own lack of action over the years past.</P>
    <P>I was making the point, on incomes generally, that if any Government wish to speak on incomes they must have a certain moral authority if their advice is to be even heeded.  We all accept the complications arising from the attempt to introduce an incomes policy, complications which may not permit of one being introduced in the first place, but a Government's advice to be heeded or listened to, speaking in this delicate area of incomes, needs a certain moral stature.  I do not believe this <Col N="2657" /> Government have the moral stature for their advice in the area of incomes to be listened to, let alone acted upon. That is one of the problems the country faces.  At a time when advice and guidance and direction must be given in the area of incomes and in every other area, this is a Cabinet who will not be listened to, who will not command respect, whose advice will not be heeded.</P>
    <P>Prices may, before the end of this year, have risen by 10 per cent.  This is quite possible.  The Taoiseach&mdash;the innocence of the man is remarkable&mdash; in his speech at the beginning of this debate says:</P>
    <P>Price rises last year of more than 7 per cent were serious enough but according to many forecasts they are likely to rise by an even higher figure this year.</P>
    <P>It is as though he was reading news from another planet.  One would never imagine he was the Taoiseach of the Government which have been in power for 13 years.  It is as though he is detached from the whole business of price increases.  A very frequent trait in Government reports lately, when dealing with the economy and prices in general, is to share the responsibility more or less.  When things are going bad the method of the Cabinet is to share the burden but when things are going well they say it is all of their making.  Things are not going so well now, so the watchword is &ldquo;blame the community, the trade unions, the fitters, the cement strikes, the bank strike&mdash;blame anybody but, for God's sake, do not let anybody think it is our fault.&rdquo;  I do not think that will work.  It must be the job of the Opposition to ensure that it does not work because it is necessary, if there is to be any improvement, for people to recognise the kind of Government we have.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is increasing; prices are on the increase; the balance of payments situation is becoming worse and the Government are in retreat from all the real problems, but in that retreat they are fighting amongst themselves about the mistakes they have made in relation to problems in this <Col N="2658" /> country.  It is the type of Cabinet in which you could be talking to your best friend in that Cabinet today and next week a black maria might pull up at his door and a man in plain clothes takes your best friend to Green Street courthouse to answer serious charges.  Only last night we heard of the existence of a new branch of the secrt policy.  I am not the one to doubt the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on this point.  He was speaking evidently from the depths of experience when he said there was a new branch of the secret police in this very building.  I hope the Taoiseach will answer this charge. Some months ago the Taoiseach assured the House that none of our telephones was tapped.  Listening to Deputy Blaney last night it was obvious that he feels that his telephone is being tapped.  Presumably the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries speaks to the former Minister for Local Government and presumably Deputy Boland's telephone is being tapped. These former Ministers are entitled to a hearing.  They are entitled to call the Taoiseach's bluff and they are entitled to to a statement from the Taoiseach.  If the Taoiseach's told us in the midst of the last crisis that none of our telephones was being tapped and if Members of the House allege in this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, whom we all know to be an honest man, said that none of our telephones was being tapped and I take him at his word.  Admittedly I do not use my telephone very often but I would believe that my telephone is not being tapped.  Deputy Blaney said last night that his telephone is being tapped and Deputy Boland here says that it may not be legally tapped.  That is true but <Col N="2659" /> there are extraordinary powers obviously in the possession of some group, some group with extraordinary connections with the Minister for Transport and Power or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if some private group can set up a phone-tapping enterprise on their own outside of Government control or the knowledge of the Taoiseach. I hope the Taoiseach will answer this.  I know he has a very winning way of looking at the clock after he has talked about irrelevancies for threequarters of his speech and saying that he has no time to answer direct questitons. May I invite him tonight to clarify this position at the very beginning of his speech, to give us a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, is this going on or is it not?  We do not mind sitting until midnight or until tomorrow morning if he feels that he does not have sufficient time to explain all that he needs to explain.  The Taoiseach has used the rules of this House unscrupulously to avoid explaining some of the things that needed explaining over the last few months.  Last night Deputy Blaney complained, justifiably, about those who felt he had no right to speak about his attitude on the north while others with whose opinions he did not agree considered themselves free to speak on any and every occasion.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with him in that opinion because the man who attempted to prevent Deputy Blaney speaking here was the Taoiseach.  He is the person who has successfully muzzled every Member of this House, to prevent us discussing this important matter here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Blaney's gievance that he could not discuss this matter.  I am pointing out that Deputy Blaney and others who may sympathise with him in the Fianna Fáil Party need not look at the Opposition when they speak on this matter.  We sought a debate much earlier and the Taoiseach said that views expressed here might have inflamed the situation.  Whether he was referring to the viewpoints of Deputy Blaney, Deputy Boland or anyone else I do not know, but if there is anybody who is guilty of demeaning and undermining Parliament and of saying to the people that Dáil Éireann was not competent to discuss this matter it is the Taoiseach.  By his actions he prevented this assembly from discussing this matter over the past few months.  I have no doubt his attitude will be unchanged and whatever problems arise in the north during the summer, or whatever problems this country may face, I have no doubt he will still refuse to all this assembly back to discuss the situation because of his dislike for the views of certain Members of his party on this matter.</P>
      <P>As I said, this Government do not have the moral stature to speak on the matter of incomes because the public style of their own members renders them incompetent, does not give them credibility.  I am not suggesting that every Minister must wear a hairshirt or that the practice of politics means that we are exemplars before the people in every respect, but I am saying that, where a government concentrate in their whole message on the economy, on the matter of restraint in incomes, then the community may fairly look at the living style of the Cabinet and ask &ldquo;Can we take instructions from these men?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2661" /> Members of this Cabinet have shown themselves ostentatious spenders over the last 13 years.  There was a marked change in the public style of Cabinets here as compared with those headed by Mr. Eamon de Valera, the president, and those headed by Mr. Seán Lemass and since.  How can this Cabinet ask for wage and salary restraints when they themselves refuse to introduce a capital gains tax in the matter of land speculation and the vast profits made in that area?  How can they expect the ordinary worker to heed advice when that advice is tainted?  The advice is tainted because many of those who profit have accumulated a great part of their wealth on the basis of land development, development of which they had foreknowledge. How can they ask the people for restraint this year and next year in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>Time after time our call for a capital gains tax has been brushed aside as an irrelevancy, as mere socialist petulance. This Government, this Cabinet, would have a greater moral stature had they introduced a capital gains tax.  If the Taoiseach could say: &ldquo;I have acted in the case of those who have made thousands and thousands of pounds simply by selling one piece of land from one month to the next and I have brought within the scope of taxation the gains of those who profited, not by their own labour or any particular intellectual exertion on their part, but simply because of foreknowledge about what was going to happen to a particular piece of land&rdquo; then he would at least earn the right to have his advice heeded.  But that has not been the evolution.  The Government have refused to introduce such a tax.</P>
    <P>We had the remarkable exercise last night of the former Minister for Agriculture telling us that affluence had destroyed patriotism.  Two years ago that same Deputy as Minister for Agriculture talked loudly about what he and Fianna Fáil had done for their supporters up and down the country; he regaled his listeners with success stories.  He salvaged Taca.  Remember Taca.  Though certain people are not in the Cabinet at the moment they can still ensure that the Cabinet will take <Col N="2662" /> no action on a capital gains tax. Taca's writ still runs.  The power of those in Taca is still strong and, so long as this is the situation, so long will the trade unions ignore advice on incomes from this tainted source.</P>
    <P>This Cabinet do not merit a hearing. They sold out the home market under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and put men and women out of work by doing so.  We are asked why we are unreasonable about the Common Market.  Our experience here and elsewhere inclines us to look very deeply indeed at any measures proposed or any policies adumbrated by this Cabinet.  We were told in 1961 that the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement would be the answer to all our ills at that stage.  We were told of the marvellous bargaining.  The figures published by the Board of Trade show exactly how good that bargaining was. The Labour party voted against that agreement and we are no longer alone in our opposition to and criticism of that agreement.</P>
    <P>Now we are told that the answer to all our ills lies somewhere between Brussels and Bonn.  It is suggested we suffer from some sense of national inferiority because we criticise the Government's headlong march into the Common Market.  We do not consider the proposals put before us satisfactory and we will go on opposing entry especially when we know that no bargaining precautions have been taken. The approach seems to be that there is no objection to anything, no concessions to seek; it is simply a question of getting in as rapidly as possible.  In those circumstances this party have a duty to the people to oppose such a manner of approach to Europe and the Common Market.  If Britain becomes part of the enlarged Community some relationship must be devised between this country and the enlarged Community. This party will play a very full part, I hope, in devising that relationship so that it will redound to our advantage and not to the advantage of someone else.</P>
    <P>We know the state of Irish industry and it is because we do that we oppose entry.  We know the situation which will face many of our supporters if we <Col N="2663" /> join the Government in their romantic extravaganza on European unity.  We have been lectured to on our lack of patriotism and the need to have European connections.  But we are part of the Socialist International.  That is our connection.  In point of fact we are the only party with any international connections. We are the last who should be lectured about a lack of European connections.  I wonder with whom will Deputy Meaney, for example, affiliate when we enter the Common Market. Has Deputy Meaney any idea which party he will join?  There are certain innocent gentlemen who may think they can keep their own identity.  But that is not so.  Fianna Fáil will have to link themselves with some party in the European Parliament.  I wonder which it will be.</P>
    <P>In any society the manner in which a Government run their affairs and the affairs of the community affects all sections. So it is that Captain Brooke at Lisnaskea the other night could say &ldquo;One wonders what the liberal press of Britain would have said if any judge in Northern Ireland had seen fit to make the extraordinary remarks recently uttered in Dublin&rdquo;.  Captain Brooke was speaking about the Irish judiciary and their reluctance to try Deputy Haughey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Captain Brooke may speak of the matter in Lisnaskea but we cannot discuss it in Dáil Éireann.  I accept the ruling of the Chair.  Let us look at the position we have been brought to.  This Cabinet with their majority, have the most bankrupt reactionary in the Unionist Party pointing out for the edification of his bigoted audience the faults and failings of public life in Dublin.  If there was any sense of shame in the Cabinet surely they must feel it in the observation made by Captain Brooke&mdash;that he can in fairness point to our judiciary in this manner.  One of the basic reasons given for the justifiably high salaries of the judiciary is that their impartiality would be affected by anything less; the fact that it can now be <Col N="2664" /> affected merely to try a former Minister makes one wonder where the argument takes us.  I do not want to go into the rights and wrongs of that case but I protest vehemently that a member of the Judiciary should express himself in such a manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the remarks of Deputy Blaney last night, no one questions his sincerity but his grasp of the elements involved in the Northern Ireland tragedy must be questioned.  Throughout recent events in the north it was noteworthy that Deputy Blaney's sympathy was on the side of the Catholics.  There was no mention of any protestant deaths or casualties in his speech last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps his sympathy was sectarian?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be said that was the case whether he was <Col N="2665" /> aware of it or not because, apart from his obeisance at the end of his speech to Wolfe Tone, his sympathies were sectarian, as expressed last night.  There is a temptation for our 26-County politicians in dealing with this problem to use it for political consumption on this side of the Border to enhance our reputation and our popularity.  There are no laurels to be won on this side of the Border in attempting to be faithful to the facts and complexities of the situation.  One may say as a generalisation of the conflict that we are faced in that part of our country with a conflict of traditions, now showing themselves in the form of a dirty religious war.  The situation in the north can certainly put the Cyprus conflict in the shade.</P>
      <P>I do not go along with those who say Britain has no responsibility.  She has much responsibility for the institution of Partition, but Partition did not introduce sectarian conflict into Irish life.  It may have institutionalised it but the conflict between Catholic and Protestant and the differences that exist between them have been part of Irish life for the past 400 years and have deep historical roots.</P>
      <P>We have been learning belatedly about this problem in the past three or four years since events started to move of their own volition in the north.  We have here a Cabinet that have been in power since 1957 but they did not begin to absorb some of the facts about Northern Ireland until about a year ago.  Up to then they uttered a mixture of slogans, which were of popular appeal on this side of the Border, but they did not attempt to grasp the real problems that existed in the north.</P>
      <P>The problems of the north had been dormant in Irish politics for the past 40 years.  It had been used as a plaything of 26-county politicians and the problems of the north were used as pawns by politicians in the south.  However, when forces began to assert themselves in the north our politicians had to take note and to consider what could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept that there is no easy solution to his problems but the formula proposed by Deputy Blaney suffers from his initial lack of comprehension <Col N="2666" /> in the matter.  He has suggested the phasing out of British troops and British subsidies in that area.  Yet the absence of British troops did not prevent bloodshed outside St. Mathews Church.  We can say that bloodshed will not be averted by the departure of British soldiers from the north.  The conflict between Irish people in that part of the country will remain and the basis of this conflict has little to do immediately with the presence of British troops.  In fact, their presence is essential in order to confine that bloodshed.  After 40 years of asserting that this is totally a British problem, for solution by Westminister, all Irish people must go some of the road in accepting that a major contribution towards its solution must be made by us.  In the area under our control, a great deal can be done to build that secular republic which pre-figures the state of unity we all say we desire.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that it appears to take a fresh disaster in the north before the Taoiseach says he is ready to act.  It takes a fresh division in his own party for the Taoiseach to say that he is setting up an inter-Departmental Committee to consider the problems of the north.  I would prefer that the Taoiseach would instead of suggesting to the Stormont administration that this summer would be a good time for consolidating their legislation, initiate instead changes in our Constitution.  I should like the Taoiseach in his reply this evening to tell us what he has been doing in the past year in regard to this matter.  Each time we have asked him about these changes in the Constitution his stock reply has been that the time is not yet opportune.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the fact that changes in our Constitution are necessary, I believe that if we are serious about the unity of the whole country we should act right away and make whatever changes we feel to be necessary. The present Constitution is so defective in many respects that I think we need a new Constitution allowing for freedom of conscience, a new Constitution which would be the ideal receptacle for an all Irish Republic whenever that should come about.  We <Col N="2667" /> should not be in the position of awaiting fresh events before we do this or do that, nor should we consider making changes in our Constitution with the idea of making a bargain.  If it is right to do so then it should be done.  The Taoiseach has not shown any degree of urgency where this matter is concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be said, too, that the Taoiseach has shown no sense of realisation of the need of Dáil reform. Three years ago the Labour Party tried to reform these ancient procedures that we follow.  We have criticised the manner in which this Dáil is steadily being by-passed and becoming more irrelevant. I have a question for answer by the Taoiseach today on this matter. The elected members of the various parties in this House should come together to discuss what can be done to make this Dáil more relevant and to ensure that it will be seen to be the centre of national debate on any important question.  For the next three months the Dáil will be in recess.  This kind of leisurely harvest approach to the nation's affairs should be dispensed with.  The job of a national Parliament is an all the year round and continuing activity.</P>
    <P>Economically, the outlook is very bad.  I do not see that this Government have, within themselves, the capacity to take the proper measures.  I do not think it will have the co-operation of our people in any of the measures they deem to be necessary.  One essential measure would be an incomes policy. Neither the Cabinet nor the Government have the authority to seek this necessary co-operation from the Irish people at this time.  On the home front the Government must face the fact that we have rising unemployment and rising prices.  We have a growing imbalance of tarde between this country and Britain.  We have inner tensions in our Cabinet.  One could say that the outcome of a trial in the autumn will have more to do with the possibility of this Government's being here next year to deal with the Budget of next year, for example, than any other factor.  With regard to external problems, the Government and Cabinet <Col N="2668" /> have little to offer at this stage to the Irish people.  A Government of that nature at this time of crisis are suspect so far as the Irish people are concerned.</P>
    <P>Over the past few troubled months we have frequently approached the Taoiseach in a co-operative spirit in the desire to know exactly the real problems facing the Government at the same time declaring our desire to co-operate in maintaining democratic Government but we have been coldly received and rebuffed.  The Taoiseach appears at all times to consider his own political future and his own political good.  That is a lamentable approach.  I trust that this evening he will treat this House honestly and will not seek to evade necessary explanations or avoid necessary answers.  I trust he will utter something better than platitudes about our economic situation.  With regard to our Constitution I trust he will give us a schedule of the activity which will take place on this and other matters.  I trust he will be clear with the House if not with his own party.  If he evades his responsibilities once more and takes refuge in another speech that explains nothing then I think he is threatening his own future as Taoiseach to an appreciable degree.  After all, it is a very dangerous position which he occupies.  This is not a normal adjournment.  Even if he must depart as Taoiseach of this Government before we meet again, I hope he will tonight deal openly with the problems facing him as Taoiseach so that we may more clearly see the present economic and political position of our country.</P>

      <P>If the right of every Deputy to be heard is subject to there being nobody offering who is subject to the Whip of one of three parties in this House, may I point out that if that is ruling of the Chair it means that in a debate which has been limited in regard to time, by an agreement arrived at behind closed doors by the Whips of these three parties, it effectively excludes other Deputies from contributing to this debate, particularly when the Government party adopt the strategy that is obviously being adopted here today and which was admitted to be adopted to exclude Deputy Blaney from speaking yesterday.

I do not think it is unfair that, with those figures in front of the Chair, he should turn to the Government benches for the next speaker.

      <P>I suppose I will be expected, like Deputy Blaney, to deal mainly with the concluding part of the Taoiseach's opening statement.  This, in fact, I intend to do.  I hope that, when I have concluded, Deputy O'Leary will not be as confused with regard to my position as he professed to be when Deputy Blaney finished.  However, there are a few brief remarks I should like to make about the earlier part of the Taoiseach's opening statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that a decision has apparently been taken to tackle inflation as a specific problem.  I feel that everyone will agree with the Taoiseach's general remarks about the dangers inherent in continuing inflation and the hardships caused to some of the most deserving members of the community which cannot be guarded against if it continues, and about the national necessity to halt this dangerous trend if we are to maintain our population <Col N="2671" /> and its natural increase at a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat less happy about the indications the Taoiseach gave as to how this problem might be dealt with. I fully appreciate that, in a speech of this nature, there could be no attempt to spell out in detail the governmental action that will be necessary if the community as a whole does not voluntarily devise methods of curbing inflation. My personal opinion is that the matters involved are far too complicated to expect the many different interests in each sector of our society to succeed, even with the best will in the world, in working out, without Government action, a system or an agreement which would result in the avoidance of the inflation we have had.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Taoiseach said at the end of this part of his speech that the Government recognise that workers could not be expected to show restraint in wage demands unless other groups do the same, and unless they have some reasonable expectation that the rate of increase in prices will slow down.  He went on to say that some arrangement must be worked out under which the legitimate interests of particular groups would be reconciled to the national interest.  He did not indicate any way in which this could or should be done and this, of course, is the kernel of the problem.</P>
    <P>He was reasonably specific as to the voluntary action that could be taken by the sector whose income consists of direct remuneration for services performed. Indeed, he was reasonably specific in indicating the type of Government action that might have to be substituted for voluntary restraint.  It seems to me that there was an inadequate appreciation of the importance of such things as profits and expense account living in this whole problem.  I have no doubt that figures could be produced to show that this element has not contributed to inflation to the same extent as wages, and that profits have not increased at the same rate as employees' incomes.  There is no reason why they should.  In fact there is every reason why they should not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2672" /> It may be that the entrepreneur's share and management expenses comprise a comparatively small part of total costs, but that is not the point.  It is unrealistic and, in my opinion, unjustifiable to expect workers to restrain demands if they see spectacular increases in the wealth of a comparatively small number of individuals engaged in their own particular sphere of activity, and if they see ostentatiously luxurious living on expense accounts which are, in fact, financed largely by their labour.  It is true that comparatively little might be gained directly by restricting this sort of thing, but the elimination of the scandal, and the incitement it contains for excessive wage demands, is a matter of the greatest importance.</P>

      <P>If I ever was, I do not think my association could be much shorter than the association of some of the people in the Labour Party will be. I appreciate that the profit motive is of importance in the generation of economic expansion and I do not think <Col N="2673" /> we can afford to do without it.  I accept that the incentive of making money, as distinct from just achieving a reasonable annual income, must be retained. I do not accept that, in modern circumstances, the accumulation of large personal fortunes by individuals is necessary for further economic development. Many new undertakings are undoubtedly required but finance on the scale required must, in the main, be provided by the community as a whole, either through the banking systhem or more directly by way of State grants and loans.  I do not see, and never have seen, that purely personal capital on a substantial scale is of any great importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of any great overall, economic importance.  Of course it may be of importance to individuals.  The entrepreneur is necessary and I think the possibility of reasonable profits and of improved status and comfort are necessary but the accumulation of excessive wealth by individuals is not necessary and if we are to expect restraint and responsibility from the sector which now has the power to exact demands which although they may not be excessive in the case of individuals can have a disastrous effect on costs and therefore on employment and real living standards, then I think that the fiscal system should be seen to be designed to at least make it difficult for a small number of people to acquire an inordinate share of the fruits of the work of a great number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to accept that remuneration is a greater constituent of costs than profits but this does not mean that the need for restraint is proportionate to the contribution made to costs.  It is not necessarily equitable that these two things should increase at the same rate; in fact, it is much more likely to be inequitable that they should.  I acknowledge what the Taoiseach did say, in speaking of the general unwillingness to forego the shortsighted and selfish approach which pushes prices up, that he was not just talking about wages but I felt that he did not succeed in giving the impression <Col N="2674" /> that his mind was as clear as to how increases in other incomes might be limited in the absence of voluntary restraint.</P>
    <P>While I agree that wage claims in recent years have been, in many instances, excessive I am perfectly satisfied that it is only from this sector, the wage earners, that there is any reasonable prospect of voluntary restraint. In fact, it seems to me that it is only in this sector that an undertaking of voluntary restraint would be credible because it would be visible; it would be there to be seen whether or not it was being acted upon.  But the Government must obviously come into it on the other side.  Otherwise, nobody could reasonably be expected to believe that in fact any restraint was being exercised.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was quoted as having indicated that it might be necessary to put the brakes on public and private expenditure.  I hope that he is not contemplating agreeing to any restriction of the State's capital programme as part of the method of curbing inflation because, in my opinion, this is neither necessary nor desirable.  I hope it will be made clear when the Taoiseach is concluding that no effort will be spared further to increase the capital provision in particular for such essential purposes as housing and water and sewerage schemes.  There is a need for a continuously increasing capital allocation for these purposes and it would be intolerable that the allocation of capital for such vital needs as these should be regarded as an economic regulator.</P>
    <P>I thought it was rather remarkable that in his opening statement in the Adjournment Debate the Taoiseach made no reference to what was probably the most outstanding, although possibly not the most important, happening in the Dáil session that is just concluding.  In so far as his opening statement was concerned the midnight dismissal of two Ministers might be a commonplace occurrence.  In fact, it was unique.  I made my position clear in regard to this already.  I fully accept the right of the Taoiseach to hire and fire members of his Cabinet as and when he wishes and to decide who will be members of his Cabinet and how long they shall remain members.  I <Col N="2675" /> accept his right to change the personnel at any time he likes and for any reason, even for nothing more important than incompatability of temperament but, as I pointed out before, I personally would not be prepared to continue to serve in what should surely be a position of trust in the conditions that were outlined here yesterday by Deputy Blaney.</P>
    <P>But in this particular case the Taoiseach did something more than just exercise the right to hire and fire.  He gave reasons for his action and he sent his chief lieutenant, the Tánaiste, on television to describe the two dismissed Ministers as conspirators who had been purged from the Government.  I appreciate that only one of these cases has been disposed of and that consequently it is too soon to know whether, when the long majestic process of the law will eventually come to an end, the Taoiseach will see any personal implications in the result.  But I think it was surely a matter calling for at least some mention by the Taoiseach that it has been established conclusively that the information lodged with him and with Deputy Cosgrave in connection with one Minister has been proved to be false information and that it has been established that at least in so far as Deputy Blaney is concerned, the Tánaiste's statement that these were two conspirators who had been purged from the Government has been proved to be a false and malicious slander.</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled to say without any implications in so far as the undisposed cases are concerned that anyone with a sense of justice and fair play would reasonably have expected some reference to the fact that, despite the Taoiseach's own statement here in the Dáil and despite his summary conviction on television by the Tánaiste, despite the unimpeachable character of the joint informer who was available both to the Taoiseach and Deputy Cosgrave, it has now been established by the courts of law that Deputy Blaney did not, in fact, conspire.</P>
    <P>One might have expected some expression of regret, for instance, at the fact that Deputy Blaney had to expend a large sum of money to establish his <Col N="2676" /> innocence of the base charge that was preferred against him.  One might have expected some expression of regret at the unnecessarily dramatic and uncouth manner of his arrest, at the unnecessary distress caused on Corpus Christi morning to his wife and children.  One might have expected, in fact, an expression of relief at the failure of the vigorous effort made by the State to have bail refused and that this failure of the State in this instance at least has had the effect that Deputy Blaney has not spent five or six weeks in durance vile to expiate an offence he did not commit.  However, there are still other cases to be disposed of and perhaps when they are disposed of this can be gone into in somewhat greater detail.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach dealt with the Six Counties position in the concluding part of his opening speech and I think that if we are to deal with the Government's approach to this whole question this must be taken with his Eve of the Twelfth statement on television. Taken on their own, I believe most of the sentiments expressed in that statement were almost universally acceptable and they were very well put.  However, I found some ambiguity in the statement.  I found the general tone unnecessarily abject, and I found what appeared to me to be some disturbing implications.</P>
    <P>Anyone must agree that in the circumstances that existed, where an isolated minority in a large city appeared to be in imminent danger of suffering possibly greater violence than they suffered last August, the Taoiseach had, as a matter of duty to the Irish people, to concentrate, as he did, on making an effort to contribute to the averting, if possible, of this violence which appeared to be inevitable.  He did this very well and he did make a powerful appeal as head of the Government for the avoidance of violence on that occasion.  I do not think it was necessary, however, to create the impression that if there was violence it would be the nationalist minority that would be the aggressors.  As I said, I found some ambiguity in the statement. There were some things in it that I did not understand and that were not explained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2677" /> At the outset of the statement the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;We are on the brink of a great acheivement.&rdquo; I must confess that I did not know this.  I still do not know it.  Not alone did I not know we were on the brink of a great achievement but I do not know what the achievement is and I have not met anyone who does.  I do not know anyone who can tell me what is the great achievement on the brink of which we are.  I assume, in view of the context, that it has something to do with the division of the country.  I would have thought the Taoiseach might have availed of the opportunity of this debate to be more specific and to tell us exactly what the great achievement is, particularly in view of the fact that there are apparently people endeavouring to prevent the accomplishment of this great achievement.  It would be a help to those people, if they are not really maliciously motivated, if they knew exactly what the achievement was.  It may, of course, be of such great moment that it must remain a secret.  I can understand if that is the position, but I should like to know.  Is it some significant advance on the road to re-unification or is it merely the acheivement of a 12th July free from death and destruction through the deployment of massive British military might in the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>I should like to have some elucidation as to who exactly is trying to stop this great achievement.  In fact how can anyone be held to be trying to stop something when they do not know what it is.  I sincerely hope I am not listed among these subversives, because I certainly am not trying to prevent the accomplishment of any great achievement, but I must say I have the feeling that listeners were intended to believe that I was among the opponents of the achievement.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I want to make it quite clear once again that I am not going to be talked into the position of being an advocate of physical force for the re-unification of our country, and I believe my former ministerial colleagues feel the same.  To the best of my knowledge there is no Deputy in this House in favour of anything but peaceful methods for the <Col N="2678" /> solution of this problem.  It almost seems to me as if the Taoiseach really believes that continued innuendos by himself and slanderous allegations on television by the Tánaiste will eventually create the position of there being a number of Deputies in favour of the use of force in this connection.  This is not so.  It never has been so and I believe the Taoiseach knows this.  There is no need for the Taoiseach to be so diligently and consistently punching at this empty bag.  There is no opposition here to the policy of a peaceful solution to the reunification of our country, and there is no failure to appreciate the need to reunify the people of the country; nor is there any failure to appreciate what this involves and the long-term effort that is required.  I cannot see any point in people trying to insist that there is opposition to this policy when it is known that there is no such opposition.</P>
    <P>Again the Taoiseach stated in his statement that his Government was the second guarantor.  This was another point in the statement that puzzled me, because I must admit that I do not know, to this day, what this means. The Government is a guarantor of what?  I would like to know of what is the Government a guarantor and how will the guarantee be implemented. With regard to the complete acceptance of the <i>bona fides</i> of the British in this connection, I can only say that the Irish people might be more prepared to accept that the appellation Perfidious Albion is out of date if there were not recent evidence of the cynical breaching of the spirit of trade agreements.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's appeal for peace, restraint and forbearance in the face of provocation was very good as far as it went but the clear implication that any disruption of Her Majesty's law and order would be by the Nationalist minority indicated the adoption of the same &ldquo;Croppies lie down&rdquo; attitude which was set by Mr. MacEntee's most recent letter to the Press when he and the newspapers and the Labour Party seized upon the first biased reports of what had happened in the St. Matthew's area gleefully as <Col N="2679" /> something which they apparently thought could be represented as an indication of Fenian aggression in Belfast but which has since been shown to have been in fact a purely defensive action against an assault on the complex of religious buildings in that area.</P>
    <P>Peace can, of course, be maintained or at least the disruption of peace can be minimised if one side refused to fight irrespective of the indignities, injustice, and violence that may be suffered.  No doubt it is good and wise counsel to advocate turning the other cheek, to advocate reacting to murder only by burying the dead and praying for the assassin, to advocate reacting to the destruction of property either by repairing the damage in so far as it is possible and when it is considered safe to do it or by emigrating to some country or migrating to a part of the country where law and order prevails. That is no doubt good and Christian advice to give and the Taoiseach is very good at giving it.  I must say, in passing, that my own personal experience is that he himself is no better than other mortals at accepting the advice of turning the other cheek.</P>
    <P>However, it may be, as was implied I think in the speech taken as a whole, that there would be peace if no one resisted injustice or attempted to defend their lives and property when under murderous attack but I think it has been the experience that even when the masses of people do meekly accept their treatment they still often find themselves used as pawns in violent disagreements that they have not created themselves.</P>
    <P>Another thing I found somewhat disturbing was the unequivocal acceptance by the Taoiseach that this is an Irish quarrel and that there is no invader involved.  I feel that this, as he somewhat more than hinted himself, is an abandonment of what has up to now been the national position.  I cannot help asking is it the prelude to the acceptance of the recommendation of the Committee on the Constitution to ask the people to delete the vital Article 3 from that document.  I say that the statement that this is a purely Irish quarrel and that there is no invader involved in it is wrong.  The <Col N="2680" /> trouble in this country is a British machination and a total British responsibility.  They created this position, they continue actively to perpetuate it and it is their duty to set about ending it.</P>
    <P>Last year the culprits in the situation were Messrs.  Callaghan and Wilson who perversely insisted that what happened in the Six Counties was an internal United Kingdom matter.  It is not, they were wrong and I think they should have been told so.  It is their responsibility, theirs is the blame but it is our legitimate concern.  It is not part of the United Kingdom, it may be physically absorbed into the United Kingdom but it is part of our country.  This year the culprits are Messrs.  Health and Maudling.</P>
    <P>The trouble in our country is the inevitable outcome of the action of the British Parliament in partitioning our country.  In my opinion it is wrong to blame the orange Order, the protestant ascendancy, the Unionist Party or any of these things for this trouble because these are all essential to the success of the British plan, to the continuation of the Six County state which was created by the British Parliament. Equally essential is the massive subsidisation and the military maintenance of this unjustifiable state at the expense of the British taxpayer.  The British are continuing, active aggressors in our country and the British troops who are holding Belfast in a grip of steel are occupation forces and they are unacceptable invaders in our country.  I say this without, in my opinion, being in any way inconsistent when I also say that this military operation was essential to avert a massive attack on the local minority and that it was the minimum duty of the British Government to take this action. The point is that the need for the action arises directly from continuing British imperialism and aggression in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is wrong to deny that this is so.  The first essential, the <i>sine qua non</i> for a solution of this problem, is a British decision to embark <Col N="2681" /> on what must be, I agree, a gradual and extended operation of withdrawing from our country.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach accepts, as he appears to, that there is a right for a minority, which happens to be a local majority in a certain area, to secede from the Irish nation or to be abstracted from it by the British Parliament, this is clearly a reneging of what has hitherto been the national stand-point. One can then understand the reference to past gods, although I can recall an occasion just six months ago when the audience was physically present, not sitting at home in front of television sets, shortly after I had quoted a past god on this question of the inviolability of the Irish nation when the Taoiseach hastily amended his script to insert into it a whole litany of past gods who had enunciated a policy as far back as 1926 to which the gathering was assured we still subscribe.  The past gods who are to be renounced were not specified but since Partition was not really envisaged before the Home Rule Bill and the Second Covenant, presumably these past gods are of quite recent vintage. Tone, it is assumed, is not to be renounced, although when one recalls the circumstances of his return to this country shortly before his death and associates it with current events it seems that he may be partly renounced also and that his doctrine is only selectively retained.</P>
      <P>It is time to state definitely if there is as the newspapers say, a new policy in regard to Partition.  Has the position changed since last January when the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis was assured that the policy remained as enunciated by the past gods in 1926?  Is it now accepted that a minority, which happens to be a local majority, has the right to opt out of the Irish nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it accepted that this right can be legitimately exercised so as to extend to the maximum area that it is feasible to keep out, and if so what of the smaller minorities comprising local majorities in smaller areas?  Or is it that once this position of an artificial unit has been created, illegally and unjustly, that it is accepted that the injustice may not now be undone unless <Col N="2682" /> the minority constituting a local majority, which was utilised by British imperialists for the purpose, changes step and in spite of subsidisation by the British asks to return to the nation out of which the British Parliament legislated it?  If that is the position then there certainly is a new policy and it is indeed necessary to adjure past gods and discard the former national faith before really giving allegiance to the current deities or accepting the new doctrine that it is legitimate to divide an old nation, and asking the people to return to the pre-1937 position in regard to the Border by deleting Article 3 from the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this report of the committee has been in print for over 2½ years and in view of the Taoiseach's Tralee speech and his Eve of the Twelfth television statement, it is high time we were told the Government's intentions in regard to this recommendation.  It is the first recommendation in the report.  Article 3 of the Constitution reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory, and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by the Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, the laws enacted by the Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstát Éirean and the like extra-territorial effect.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the introduction to this report states that recommendations are not necessarily the views of the political parties involved.  Paragraph two of the introduction states that:</P>
    <P>It is agreed between the political parties that participation in this committee would involve no obligations to support any recommendation which might be made, even if made unanimously.  It is also agreed that members of the committee either as individuals or party representatives would not be regarded as committed in any way to support such recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Taoiseach has also said this but the Taoiseach has <Col N="2683" /> not, as some people think, said that the recommendation has been rejected.  It has not been rejected.  It has not been pronounced on at all.  I am wondering if this is a case where silence will be held to indicate consent and will we wake up some morning to find it has become Fianna Fáil policy to put this recommendation to the people, to recommend to the people that they should undo what was done in this regard in 1937 and should in fact adopt the only Cumann na Gaedheal policy in regard to the Border.</P>
    <P>This Article was surely inserted in the Constitution for a very definite purpose.  The enactment of this Article in the Constitution was an important change in the position.  Prior to 1937 the position was that the people had through the agency of their delegates in the Dáil ratified the boundary agreement and registered it as an international agreement at The Hague.  In enacting Article 3 in 1937 the people by their own direct vote reversed the decision made here by their delegates and substituted the solemn assertion of the right of the Parliament elected under the Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of the national territory.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this report has been published for 2½ years it is time for the Taoiseach to tell us unequivocally whether this recommendation is accepted or rejected.  In other words, whether it is proposed to ask the people to reverse their own decision and re-establish the position of a ratified boundary agreement which existed prior to 1937 and which was established by the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  We have been told that constitutional amendments will be required if we are to join the EEC but we have not yet been told what exactly these amendments will be and therefore it would be premature to comment on them.  However it has been intimated in the last week or so that these will be all presented for decision together.  I would like to know if it is intended to insert in this package this proposal, to ask the people to withdraw their own assertion of the right of the people to exercise through <Col N="2684" /> their elected Parliament jurisdiction over the whole of their territory, in the hope that it will slip through as part of the EEC proposition.</P>
    <P>While I am seeking some clarification on some of the points made by the Taoiseach perhaps I could also ask for something more specific in regard to the visit of the Minister for External Affairs to Belfast.  I may say, of course, that I consider the visit was justifiable and that it should not be questioned; certainly there should be no question of the right of the Minister to go to any part of this country he wishes. Although first-hand accounts were already available, I feel that it probably was a good idea for the Minister to go and see with his own eyes some of the depredations of the British Forces in that particular part of Belfast.</P>
    <P>The point that needs some clarification is that the Minister is reported to have said that the visit was intended to &ldquo;show solidarity&rdquo; with the minority.  I do not know if I am using the exact words, but the phrase &ldquo;to show solidarity&rdquo; was used and was, I think, given as the main purpose of the visit.  I should like to know what the phrase &ldquo;to show solidarity&rdquo; means, because I do not know.  To show solidarity?  To simulate solidarity or to establish actual solidarity?  Does it mean that if the minority with whom we were to show solidarity were attacked, arising out of this solidarity we would consider ourselves attacked also?  Does it mean that if they tried to defend themselves when attacked, we would help?  Or does it mean what it has meant in the past and what the phrase &ldquo;We will not stand idly by&rdquo; has been proved to mean&mdash;that, if they try to put themselves in a position to defend themselves until the arrival of the British Army, we will use the full resources to hand to prevent them doing so and compel them to take the more Christian attitude of lying down to die as good little Croppies should?</P>
    <P>I find it hard to avoid being cynical when, on his return, the Minister deplored the fact that the incursion of the British Army into the Falls left the minority defenceless to their well-armed enemies in view of the fact that he is a member of the Government <Col N="2685" /> which, without evidence, took from them a key figure in their inadequate defence arrangements and which have declared their duty to be to endeavour to ensure that they will remain defenceless. It just does not seem to me to be consistent to complain if the British Army helps in the achievement of that objective to ensure that the minority in Belfast, or elsewhere, will be left defenceless to their well-armed enemies.</P>
    <P>While, as I have said, most of the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach would be endorsed by all true Irishmen, the omissions from and, indeed, some of the content of his statement make it, as I said, appear to me to be an abject statement.  This is emphasised by the quite unjustified apology to Her Britannic Majesty's 1970 soldiery because the inconsiderate Irish people, by their mere existence and their perversity in insisting on trying to live in their own area, forced them to act in Belfast with the same brutality and licentiousness as did her illustrious grandfather's Black-and-Tans 50 years ago, forced them to act in a manner which, as the native peoples from every corner of the one-time Empire on which the sun never sets know, is completely out of character with the noble traditions established by their predecessors in their altruistic task of bringing the benefits of British rule and British justice and paternalism to those areas.  I do not think that any apology was due for the fact that they had been forced, apparently by the existence of this particular section of the community in Belfast, to act in the brutal way in which they acted during their incursion into the Falls area.</P>
    <P>I said I hoped that Deputy O'Leary and others would not be confused by my attitude to Government policy in regard to Partition.  I have, I think, said with the utmost clarity, not just now but on many other occasions as well, that I and every one of my acquaintances and friends, be they ex-Ministers or otherwise, fully subscribe to the policy of a peaceful approach to the solution of this problem, that I recognise the inappropriateness of force and that I can see no gain in an Irish Government having to contain a dissident minority in the same way as the <Col N="2686" /> isolated section of the national majority is contained in the Six Counties.  The last time I heard Government policy expounded on this matter was with a formal and almost ritualistic rededication to past gods before a live audience in the Mansion House.  This was the policy of Fianna Fáil since 1926, to which I have subscribed all my life and to which I still subscribe, and it was restated on that occasion in a way that completely satisfied me.  I have, I think, made no secret of my dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the actual implementation of the policy that has been announced. We have had hints of a new policy, but nothing definite.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has claimed that Government policy has now, in fact, come round to Fine Gael policy in this matter, but this has not been admitted. Overall, there is the very vital question of the proposal to ask the people to delete Article 3 of the Constitution which, if it is accepted, will amount to a proposal that Fianna Fáil should adopt not merely Fine Gael policy but Cumann na nGaedheal policy.  As far as I know, this policy has not actually been decided.  Until such time as the proposed refutation of past gods is spelt out in detail, it must be assumed that the official formal rededication to the past gods and their policy and to the Fianna Fáil policy of 1926, which was made at the last Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis last January, still stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to be able to give way to the Independent sitting in the Fianna Fáil benches, and I must admit his speech was worth listening to.  His contribution on the economic situation was more effective than were his contributions when he was Minister and his approach to the subject would be acceptable on the Opposition benches.  While making a reasoned speech on this aspect of the economy he criticised the lack of Government leadership at this crucial time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before commenting briefly on some of the statements made by Deputy Boland, I should like to mention that yesterday we had an assurance from the Tánaiste that never before were the Fianna Fáil Party as united as they are <Col N="2687" /> at the moment.  It was worthwhile allowing Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland to make their speeches because they help us to understand what that type of unity really means.  I realise it is not fair to include Deputy Boland among the membership of the Fianna Fáil Party.  A certain well known politician used to tell the people of this country that we were in the Common-wealth but not of it; Deputy Boland is in the Fianna Fáil benches but he is not of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>One of the points mentioned by him was that there has been a court case and at least one of the dismissed Ministers had been proved innocent.  It would be more correct to say that there was insufficient evidence in his case and it is no harm to put that fact on the records of the House.  He then proceeded to deal with the Taoiseach's opening speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This country is suffering from many ills but I think the gravest ailment is a surfeit of Fianna Fáil.  We have reached the point where Fianna Fáil are afraid to stretch out a hand in case they hit one of their own. They have been in power for 32 years and during that time they have lavishly dispensed political favours all over the place and have been guilty of jobbery on a grand scale.  It is no wonder we have reached a point where the ordinary people regard with contempt the people who are entrusted with administration of the nation's affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in expecting people to be concerned about Ireland if <Col N="2688" /> Ministers are not concerned; and we have evidence that quite a number of Ministers were more concerned about their personal interests and the interests of their party than they were about Ireland.  If we want co-operation from the people there must be example from the top and we must face the fact that there has been a considerable amount of bad example from the top. That is one of the reasons why in almost every sector of the economy there is unrest and dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to the fact that we did not have good example and I agree with him.  We have no indication that the people responsible for the well being of the State were prepared to make sacrifices and to give the lead in what they considered was necessary if Ireland was to be saved. There is no doubt that our country is in danger and the sooner people realise this the better.</P>
    <P>Any sensible people will not leave a Government in power for more than ten or 12 years because if a Government remain in office for longer than this outside pressures build up and outside influences are brought to bear on the activities and decisions of the Government. The result is that you have government outside Parliament.  That is what has happened with Fianna Fáil.  All these pressures have built up and we know the result.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech Deputy Blaney referred to the presence in this House of the Special Branch.  The presence of the Special Branch is more acceptable to me than the presence of Tacateers and you could trip over them in every part of this House, particularly when the Government were in some danger.  However, I make that remark merely in passing.</P>
    <P>This country is going through difficulties and leadership and good example are missing.  The people are not prepared to co-operate and both the Government and people should look for the reason.  Why is it so difficult and are we trying hard enough to tackle the problems in the right way? Ireland is in danger and we should realise that the people who will kill it are the Irish people themselves, not outside forces.  Everybody is grasping; <Col N="2689" /> everybody is greedy for more; there is avarice in every section of the community. The motto seems to be &ldquo;Get more no matter whom you have to hit.&rdquo; There is no great regard for the 70,000 unemployed in this country; nobody seems to be over-concerned about them.  All sections have a responsibility in this and there is no point in Deputy O'Leary exonerating the people whom he says he represents&mdash; the trade unions and so on.  Trade unions have responsibility but the Government must come in and say to them and to the employers that they must come together and work out a formula to correct the situation whereby we are pricing ourselves out of the export market.  We must remedy this situation if we are to save our economy and provide the employment opportunities that are so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not too late but I think we have gone fairly far.  The bank strike has gone on for far too long. The Taoiseach says he will not intervene. The Minister for Labour says he will not intervene.  This strike continues. The bank staffs should decide to ballot.  It has gone past the time when we should be arguing over the niceties of this settlement.  These are responsible people who have a serious responsibility to give a lead in present circumstances.  These people should decide to ballot if we are to have democracy at all.  I could go farther than that but I shall not.  Certainly it is time the bank strike was settled.  If it is not settled soon and if no move is made in this direction then the Minister for Labour has a responsibility to intervene.  The Taoiseach cannot ignore this responsibility.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Blaney's speech here last night, quite frankly I am amazed at the amount of publicity it received in today's papers.  What was new in Deputy Blaney's speech? He talked for a very considerable length of time about the situation in the North of Ireland, about the Border and about re-unification.  While giving him all this publicity, the newspapers today say that the only new thing that emerged from that speech was his suggestion about the making of a serious approach to the British Government to <Col N="2690" /> name a date for starting to phase themselves out of the North of Ireland and for starting to withdraw their subsidies from the North of Ireland. This is exactly what I propounded in this House in September, 1969.  I pointed out that I had discussed the matter with quite a large number of the British delegates to the Council of Europe and that I had suggested to them that it might be a great help if they decided now to name a number of years during which they would phase themselves out of the North of Ireland and a number of years during which they would withdraw their subsidies.  It would help to solve a situation for which Britain was directly responsible.  Nobody denies it.</P>
    <P>In everything Deputy Boland and Deputy Blaney say about this, we cannot say they are wrong.  They are perfectly right in a whole lot of things which they say.  The attitude and the reaction I got from them&mdash;both from the Labour side and the Conservative side&mdash;was that they are sick and tired of the situation in the North of Ireland and would be glad to be rid of it.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty in getting this suggestion accepted if serious approaches were made.  I am quite sure the Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery, is not idle in this matter.  I accept that he cannot tell the House every move he has made towards re-unification.  I would not think it is quite right to say, as was alleged, that certain things were not being done.  I am quite sure the Minister for External Affairs is moving in this direction.  If he were not, he would not be worth his salt.</P>
    <P>In what way was Deputy Blaney helping to solve the northern situation? He went through the tragedies one by one.  He spoke with feeling, as we all would speak, about the shooting of a nine year old child in bed.  Will his recalling of these tragic incidents help? I believe it will only regenerate bitterness and hatred instead of helping to reconcile the Irish people.  I cannot see that Deputy Blaney is contributing in any positive way towards the solution of this difficult problem.  He feels, nevertheless, he is the only person who has a solution for this difficult problem. <Col N="2691" /> That is nothing new: it has always been Deputy Blaney's attitude and approach.  When he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries he was a dictator.  He was not a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as I would see the role of such a Minister, creating conditions within which farmers would do their own job.  He wanted, from the top, to dictate every move. There is no change in that man's attitude today.  His approach to Partition and to the Northern Ireland problem is the same as it would have been 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is all right for Deputy Boland to talk about Article 3 and the dangers of removing it from the Constitution. Nobody would agree that a small corner of the country should have the right to isolate itself and say that only a majority opinion there should alter the situation.  We have to face facts. We have had this cod from Fianna Fáil that we have jurisdiction over the 32 counties of Ireland when in fact we know we have not such jurisdiction in six of our north-eastern counties.  It is all right to say that these people have no right to constitute a local majority and to make this decision for us but we must recognise that 900,000 or 1,000,000 people decide they do not want to join the Republic.  Are we recommending force of arms if they say &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  This is what we are up against.</P>
    <P>It is the declared policy on all sides of this House that the only worthwhile solution is a peaceful solution and a peaceful approach.  I was born quite close to the Border.  I was brought up to hate the British people because of our history.  I found it very difficult to swallow a whole lot of things but I am now an adult and, I hope, a fairly seasoned politician. Politics is the art of the possible.  When I was younger and much more emotional, I would have been on the train to the north if there was trouble.  I saw the two days.  I see the stupidity of this now.  I see the bloodshed that would arise out of such a foolish decision. We must secure the re-unification of our country by persuading the majority of the people in the north that it is in their better interests to come in with us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2692" /> The Government are getting the fullest measure of co-operation from the Opposition parties in this House in this regard and they should admit it. The blank refusal of the Government to set up an all-party committee to study this problem continuously and to see how we can achieve the objective of harmony and peace between all the people of this island indicates a certain degree of insincerity on the part of the Government in their protestations of their desire to banish the fears and suspicions of all the people concerned. If we can hold the line until both sides are in the EEC&mdash;I think that will not be very long delayed&mdash;it will represent an immense step forward on the road to re-unification of our country.  It will make the Border look the farce it is and we shall all be part of the same community and get to know each other and work together in the common interest.  We will be defending the same territory.  It is beyond my comprehension that the Border could remain in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have suffered this situation for 50 years.  Surely we can suffer it for some years further?  I do not think it will be necessary to use any force. Force will achieve nothing but bitterness and new hatreds that will never be forgotten.  I am glad that Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland came into the House and spoke.  This is the place to tell the House what they have in mind.  I find it very difficult to understand and reconcile one thing.  We have this new and fantastic enthusiasm on the part of Deputy Blaney about the North of Ireland.  He has been in Government for some years, and Fianna Fáil have been in Government for 32 years, and we have not seen this concern; we have not seen this display; and we have not seen any achievement. This must be admitted.</P>
    <P>It was not until the civil rights people started on a new and more effective role in the North of Ireland that this concern became obvious. They are quite right in their priorities. The important thing is to try to secure justice in many areas in the North of Ireland where justice has been denied in the past.  That is the first step.  If they got equality of treatment this, in <Col N="2693" /> itself, would lead to better understanding. The people in the North of Ireland, Catholic, or Protestant, or whatever their religion may be, must get closer together and understand each other better.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility here and it should be the responsibility of an all-party committee.  We have a responsibility to look at the Constitution and see what are the Articles in it to which these people can object and see how far we can go to meet their objections without in any way scrapping our Constitution.  Deputy Blaney spoke about Article 3 being brought in in 1937.  There is another Article in the Constitution which deals with the special position of the Catholic Church.  That was brought in in 1937 also.  Now we have Fianna Fáil Ministers saying it should be out, so everything that was put into it in 1937 cannot be regarded as something that should be retained for all time.</P>
    <P>Earlier on I referred to the unrest and to the unfortunate state of the economy generally.  There are many things I should like to refer to.  We had the cement strike for a long time, for far too long, before the Minister intervened to settle it.  We had the settlement of the cement strike and then we had a price increase of 16s 8d per ton. When I questioned this price increase and stated emphatically at Question Time that no more than 6s of it was attributable to wages, I was told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the increase covered only 63 per cent in Drogheda and 80 per cent in Limerick.  He did not say where he got those figures.  I know he is getting them from Cement Limited and, quite frankly, I do not believe them.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the point where we have by far the dearest cement in Europe, including England. The Minister seems to be unconcerned about it.  He seems determined not to bring in legislation to bring cement within the ordinary price controls. That is a fantastic situation, because housing is so important and there is such a backlog of housing needs.  This will go down on the record as one of the worst years for the provision of <Col N="2694" /> houses.  Of course, the excuse that will be offered by the Government at the end of the year is the cement strike. In the local authority of which I am a member, the cement strike is now given as the excuse for everything.</P>
    <P>We had the cement strike and and have the bank strike, but the Government have no responsibility.  Of course, this will mean an immense saving to the Government in many ways. I was reading through the Newsletter of the Confederation of Irish Industry and the first paragraph is worth quoting and putting on the record of the House because it deals with this inflationary situation.  It says:</P>
    <P>A series of industrial relations disputes have temporarily curbed what, earlier in the year, appeared to be a serious inflationary trend.  Following a year of rapid inflation, the 1970 Budget under ordinary circumstances, could only be described as adding fuel to the fire.  However, the cement strike, the bank dispute, the general fall in share prices and most recently, the British dock strike, seem to have damped down the fire.</P>
    <P>Mind you, the fire is there.  I think the Minister for External Affairs will speak soon and he can talk about the fire.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>A serious inflationary situation has been corrected, albeit temporarily, not by the control of the economy through the monetary and fiscal tools available to Government but through industrial disputes and the hardship, disruption and distortion which accompany them.</P>
    <P>While these strikes appear to have temporarily eased the situation, the settlements may be inflationary.  It is important at this stage to attempt to assess the underlying economic position and to identify trends which may develop later in the year.</P>
    <P>When inflation occurs the Government are accused of contributing very largely to it, through their own spending and through increases given to civil servants and people in semi-State bodies. Of course this is so.  If prices are allowed to soar, and if the cost of living is allowed to soar, people cannot <Col N="2695" /> be blamed for looking for what they can get to try to meet these increased costs.</P>
    <P>Leadership is needed.  The Government should get all the people concerned in all these difficulties to come together to see exactly how serious this is, to see what restraints can be accepted by the workers in every sphere from the top to the bottom, and to see what restraints in profits can be accepted by the people who are responsible for providing employment opportunities for the people.  As Deputy Boland said, you cannot eliminate the profit element.  There must be a profit element because it is a stimulus to industry. The problem is how to reach a point where these two interests can be reconciled.  I would be amazed if sensible people cannot sit down together and see when the danger point has been reached, when it must be accepted in the various spheres that this is as far as we can go in increasing incomes and increasing wages and profits, and that there is a serious situation beyond which we cannot go because otherwise we will price ourselves out of the export market and the economy will collapse.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by a number of people to the EEC and to our interest in the EEC.  I think it is generally accepted, even by the Labour Party, that the wise thing for this country to do is to plug ahead and get into the EEC, and get into it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I have some general observations to make.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, certain disabilities imposed by law on persons who practise medicine without being registered as medical practitioners. Subject to those disabilities it is not illegal to practise faith healing.  Neither is it illegal for a person to attend a faith healer.</P>
      <P>Persons who attend faith healers, however, do so at their own risk.  My strong advice to anyone who is ill is to look to his family doctor, or the specialist or hospital to which he is referred, for care and treatment.  In this way he can be sure of obtaining all the advantages which accrue from modern medicine.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will arrange for the provision of suitably trained ambulance personnel throughout the country who could give attention to patients which is at present given by nurses who have to be called from duty for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of accident calls made on ambulance centres in the rural areas and where specifically requested by the referring doctor in other cases, it has been the practice to arrange for a nurse to accompany the ambulance driver when answering the call.  This ensures that skilled nursing attention is available to the victim at the scene of the accident and during the journey to hospital.  Ambulance drivers are given practical training in essential first-aid and resuscitation procedures but it is not proposed at the moment that the attendance of a nurse on accident calls should be discontinued. I might add, however, that all aspects of the ambulance services, including that mentioned by the Deputy, are at present being actively examined by the consultative council on the ambulance services which will be submitting recommendations to me from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons on the waiting list for dentures in County Carlow is about 230. Due to the shortage of dental staff the local health authority finds it necessary to restrict the supply of dentures to priority groups.  Steps taken to fill the vacancy for a whole-time dental officer have not, so far, been successful but efforts to fill the vacancy will continue to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister undertake to do something urgently about this matter?  It is a very long time outstanding and the waiting list is growing.  Twelve months ago there were over 200 on it and there are now 230.  Some of these people have been a number of years on the waiting list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position.  The position for a second dental officer has been approved and no one has been found.  We also approved private dentists doing sessional business through the local authority and no one has been found. I am sending a dental officer of my <Col N="2704" /> Department to see whether we can secure a temporary appointment of a dental officer or obtain the services of private dentists on a part-time basis either from inside or outside the county.

We just have not been able to fill the post.</P>

      <P>I understand from Aer Lingus-Irish that, in the first quarter of the current financial year, they had a shortfall of £160,000 in operating profit by comparison with their target.  This shortfall is serious in itself but not critical when looked at against a target of over £2 million operating profit for the year.  The airline expect that, for the year as a whole, they will come close to their budgeted traffic.</P>
      <P>The troubles in the north are likely to have an effect comparable to last year i.e. a reduction in the airline's targeted operating profit of as much as £400,000.</P>
      <P>The airline are constantly adjusting their level of operations to meet changes in the volume of traffic and are endeavouring to keep a tight control on expenditure.  However, the situation does not call for any major change in plan.</P>

      <P>Aircraft may not be flown over Dublin except in accordance with the terms of the Air Navigation (Rules of the Air) Order, 1963 which vests adequate authority in the air traffic control service to control flight having regard to noise and safety. I am satisfied that these rules are observed by all responsible persons concerned.  Investigation and appropriate action is taken in any case of a suspected breach.  Airports are an essential feature of large and important conurbations and some degree of annoyance is inescapable.  The air traffic control service, however, exercises unceasing vigilance to ensure that aircraft noise is kept to the minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have time and again drawn attention to the inflationary pressures referred to in the Central Bank annual report and to the fact that as a result of these pressures the competitiveness of our goods and services in external markets is being undermined.  The Taoiseach in his speech opening the debate on the motion for the Adjournment for the Summer Recess dealt with the situation in detail.  He called for restraint by all sectors to avoid pricing ourselves out of both home and export markets and thus threatening jobs and living standards.  Inflation is, admittedly, a world-wide phenomenon but it is imperative, given our dependence on increased exports for greater growth and more employment opportunities, that our prices and costs should not be running ahead of those of our competitors.</P>
      <P>As indicated by the Taoiseach, if moderation in seeking income increases is not exercised and there are signs of an unsustainable increase in the balance of payments deficit the Government will have no hesitation in introducing further restrictive measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance how it is that the gold reserve of £28,236,000 in the Central Bank at 31st March, 1969, has been so reduced that it amounted to only £303,000 at 31st March, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The gold holding of £28,236,000 to which the Deputy refers was included in the balance sheet of the Central Bank's general fund on 31st March, 1969.  Of this sum, an amount of £11.5 million was transferred to the Bank's Legal Tender Note Fund in which it is still held.  A further amount, namely £16.4 million, was sold for reinvestment of the proceeds in foreing currencies and foreign securities as part of the bank's continuous task of structuring the external reserves to the best national advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that this resembles the time in 1916 when the gold reserve in this country in the Bank of Ireland was sent across to the Bank of England? Does he not realise that gold in the hand is worth four pieces of paper in the bush?  Does the Minister not realise that gold is a reality and that paper assets are not the same thing at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of our application to join the EEC and assuming that we enter the EEC it is quite probable that that bloc's currency will be based on a gold or quasi-gold standard and in view of that would the Minister not consider that the selling of all our gold reserves is a very short-sighted policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2713" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the indications in regard to likely developments in the EEC&mdash;and they are by no means certain yet&mdash;are that the most likely development is that there would be fixed parity between the currencies of all of the member States.  A less likely alternative is that there would be a common currency but, in effect, they would be the same thing.  The question of the unit being based on gold is quite a different matter altogether.  I have indicated that there was £11½ million worth of gold transferred.  This was really a technical transfer arising out of the transfer from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank of the reserve position of the International Monetary Fund under the Bretton Woods Agreement (Amendment) Act, 1969.  As regards the other sales, it is the responsibility of the Central Bank to use these to the best national advantage and I am satisfied that that is what the Central Bank are doing.</P>

If it did not do so, it would not be possible for it to stay in business in view of the heavy competition from other insurance companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The method of determining teacher requirements by reference to a pupil/teacher ratio is an internationally recognised one.  The fact that it has been introduced in respect of vocational schools for the first time this year has given rise to a good deal of misunderstanding and, I regret to say, some misrepresentation.  I should like, first of all therefore, to make it clear that the pupil/teacher ratio has been applied to all vocational education committees and not just to some of them.  Secondly, I should like to point out that the actual ratio adopted is a generous one.</P>
      <P>The examination of the position in vocational schools shows that in fact there are very wide disparities between schools and between schemes which are not easily explainable.  The allocation of teachers made recently to each vocational education committee was composed of the sum of the following three elements:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the committee's projected enrolment of whole-time day continuation pupils in September, 1970, divided by 17.5;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the committee's projected teaching hours for apprenticeship <Col N="2718" /> and adult education work divided by 800 to give the required number of full-time equivalent teachers for these classes;</P>
    <P>(c)  the number of headmasters in the committee's scheme.</P>
    <P>Allowance was also made by the Department for any teaching services provided by a committee to secondary schools under co-operation arrangements or for any non-school services provided by a committee.</P>
    <P>The position is that some committees have been operating by reference to class sizes which are far too low and consequently feel that the Department's allocation is inadequate. There is no reason why any committee should in any way curtail or restrict their projected apprenticeship or adult education programmes.  As I have indicated, full allowance was given in respect of each committee's projection of its needs in this matter.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I feel that the teacher allocation sanctioned by my Department is adequate to meet each committee's needs provided they operate on the basis of reasonable class sizes.  It has also been made clear to committees that the Department will be prepared to reconsider the matter on the basis of an examination in depth of the position in each of their schools where there are any circumstances of a special nature.  Such an examination is in fact proceeding in a number of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Clare Vocational Education Committee and the parents and pupils are alarmed at this method of curtailment?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says.  I have already pointed out that the staff allocation proposed by us is generous.  In fact, we are proposing a pupil/teacher ratio which they do not hope to reach in Scotland until 1975-1976 and everybody accepts that Scotland is very far advanced educationally.  As I mentioned in my reply, our allocation takes into account not only the whole-time day classes but the part-time and evening classes, including the adult education courses.  We are prepared, as I also said in my reply, to examine in depth cases of schools where there are any circumstances of a special nature.</P>

      <P>No circular on the lines mentioned in the Deputy's question issued from my Department.  What the Deputy probably has in mind is the circular which issued in March, 1969, arising out of the agreement made between representatives of the joint managerial body, the ASTI and the <Col N="2723" /> Department whereby the amount to be paid by way of school salary should be a uniform sum of £400.  In announcing this the circular at the same time notified that the rates of capitation grant were being increased by £5 to cover the additional cost to the schools.  No question of modifying these arrangements arises from my recent proposals in regard to teachers' salaries.</P>

      <P>The assessment made by Cashel Urban District Council in March, 1968, was an estimate of the number of private and local authority houses that might fall to be required to meet accumulated and prospective needs in the period ending 31st March, 1971.  I am not in a position to say how many private houses have so far been provided in the urban administrative area as statistics of private housing completions are not compiled in a form which would enable me to give this information. With regard to the provision of local authority houses, the formulation of scheme proposals to meet needs is a matter for the local housing authority. Their latest progress report indicates that they have plans for a scheme of 15 houses in hands and their proposals for the provision of 27 developed building sites for private houses were approved on the 20th February last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the anticipated increased contract price for the 140 tenant-purchase houses of Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation at Ballybrack, County Dublin, and the limitations of State grants available, he will sanction a tenant-purchase loan (repayment basis) in excess of £3,000 to mitigate the hardship which will be suffered otherwise by those obliged to place very substantially higher deposits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory limit applicable to house purchase loans made by local authorities in the Dublin area is £3,000.  In view of the fact that the prices of the houses referred to by the Deputy are lower than the general average prevailing for comparable houses in the Dublin area and of the special facilities which Dún Laoghaire Corporation provided free for the purchasers of these houses in placing and supervising contracts and in the general administration of the project, I am not satisfied that the making to these purchasers of loans higher than those available to persons purchasing houses in the open market would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it seems likely, on the basis of information available within the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation, that these houses will now cost another £400 per house over the period of the contract under the prices variation clause.  On that basis, surely he appreciates that these tenant purchase houses are being purchased by persons with very limited incomes and savings and that it will be quite beyond their capacity to pay £600 or £700 as a deposit?  The matter is quite serious because some of these houses are now due for occupancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has facilities open to him to give sanction as this is a tenant purchase house scheme on a notional repayment basis.  If he were to sanction a price in excess of £3,000 he would get rid of a very alarming situation in which people might be obliged to opt out of tenant purchase and would have to be rehoused by Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation in the near future at a higher cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1948-49 the subsidisable limit for a serviced house has been increased as follows:&mdash; From 31st October, 1950, £950; from 1st May, 1953, £1,500; from 1st April 1961, £1,650; from 31st December, 1968, £1,850.</P>
      <P>The limits for unserviced houses and for flats were also increased from the same dates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of obvious public concern, including <Col N="2756" /> that of his predecessor, he will review plans for Dublin Bay and ensure that natural amenities are preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for the planning of the physical future of Dublin, including the preservation of the amenities of Dublin Bay, is vested by law in Dublin Corporation.  The corporation's policies and development objectives are set out in the Dublin Draft Development Plan, 1968, which was on public display for almost four months last year.  Before the plan is finally adopted, the corporation are obliged to consider all objections and representations received regarding it.  I understand that over 1,400 objections or representations regarding the Dublin Bay area were received by the corporation and that these are at present being considered.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the corporation to decide whether any changes or modifications to the draft plan are required as a result of consideration of these objections and representations.  Once the development plan is made, I would have power to require that it should be varied in respect of matters and in a manner specified by me, but at this stage it would obviously be premature for me to suggest that such action might be called for.</P>
      <P>I understand that the bulk of the objections and representations received by Dublin Corporation in relation to Dublin Bay are concerned with the long-term proposals for reclamation and development in the port area which were published by the Dublin Port and Docks Board some years ago.  I think I should make clear that these proposals were in outline form and were not intended to represent a definitive plan for the port area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft development plan prepared by the corporation does not involve acceptance of these proposals.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the Port and Docks Board have not yet completed the preparation of their definitive long-term plans.  When these are available, they will of course have to be very carefully considered by the Departments concerned and by the planning authority.  For my part, the <Col N="2757" /> Deputy can rest assured that, as Minister with overall responsibility for physical planning, I will be concerned to ensure that any development that is undertaken in the port area will take full account of the extremely important amenity values of Dublin Bay as well as the other important planning considerations involved.</P>

      <P>I cannot remember where I left off in this debate but I know I was making a passing reference to the attractions which I personally felt membership of the EEC had for this country.  I heard a couple of remarks from the Labour benches at that time.  I think it was Deputy Dr. O'Donovan who said: &ldquo;Yes, head as fast as possible right into disaster.&rdquo; Previous to that I heard Deputy O'Leary saying that the one party in this House which already had international connections was the Labour Party.  I heard Deputy Keating speak on the subject a few days ago somewhere else.  All the time I find it hard to understand the attitude of the Labour Party to the EEC and to the alternatives we have to follow if we decide not to pursue our application for membership of the EEC.  I heard somebody pointing out to Deputy Keating on that occasion that the Irish Labour Party was unique in Europe, that every other socialist party in Europe is quite enthusiastic about membership of the EEC.</P>

      <P>As far as I know their attitude has not changed except that when the balance of payments was corrected in Britain it then of course started to harden purely for the sake of making the best possible bargain.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that we have in my view absolutely no alternative in this country if Britain goes into the Common Market except to follow, I see considerable attractions for this country in membership of the EEC.  I do not intend to go into these in detail. There have been long debates on this and it can be gone into in considerable detail when we resume after the recess. If this Government do not resume another one will.  I do not know what answer members of the Labour Party have to our over-dependence on a single market&mdash;the British market&mdash; where do we go from there if we do not go in.</P>
      <P>It is all right to cry about the position of the 20-acre or the 30-acre farmer in the West of Ireland, that he will disappear.  What farmer of 30 years of age or under today will accept the conditions endured by his forefathers? I agree with Deputy Keating that people should be told the truth. They should be told they will not continue to exist as 20-or 30-acre farmers. They could not possibly.  They will not accept these standards.  Either they will continue as part-time farmers, as the Minister for Lands has suggested, with a job in industry or the size of the farms must be increased and the number of farmers reduced.  This is inevitable if the standard of living acceptable in the future is to be arrived at.  Undoubtedly, these small farmers were wonderful people but the main wonder about them is that they endured for so long the hardships that are inevitably associated with farms of this size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and many people at the present time are concerned about the position whereby according to the law of the land people are compelled to insure their motor cars.  At present there are <Col N="2770" /> thousands of people driving around this country with no insurance.  The sooner the Taoiseach and the responsible Minister appreciate this the better.  This is no fault of the car owners concerned and I say that they should not be summoned because they have failed absolutely to get cover.  The Minister does not seem to be overconcerned about this and the Taoiseach does not seem to be overconcerned about it.</P>
    <P>There should have been an inquiry into the problem long ago.  Nobody knows what people are going through. As far as I can see, there is no solution except to keep your head in the sand.  I have great sympathy for people involved in this and for the people from whom the insurance companies are demanding enormous sums before they will insure them.  The insurance companies and the insurance brokers are not satisfied with the situation either and they would welcome an inquiry.  The whole thing has come to the point where it requires close investigation.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of telephone tapping which was referred to by a number of speakers particularly, Deputy Blaney, I do not give a damn who taps my telephone. Deputy Blaney said that he believed his telephone was still being tapped and that the telephones of other <Col N="2771" /> Deputies were being tapped.  He did not accept the assurance already given. He did not say he disbelieved the Taoiseach.  He said a warrant was necessary and the Taoiseach had assured the House no warrants were given.  He asked if this telephone tapping was taking place regardless of the fact that there was no warrant.  I should like the Taoiseach to tell us if there is any machinery to determine whether or not this type of telephone tapping is going on without a warrant. Some people regard this as a serious thing but, as I say, I do not give a curse who listens to my telephone conversations because I am not afraid of anything that will arise out of them. However, if anybody is trying to undermine the security of this State I say his telephone should be tapped. Even if he is suspected of undermining the security of the State, I say his telephone should be tapped.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could elaborate on this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with everything which the two Deputies who are in bad odour with Fianna Fáil said.  There is a good deal with which we can agree, and of course there is a great deal with which we would disagree.  I agree with Deputy Boland when he says that there is not an awful lot of meaning to be attached to the word &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;. The Minister for External Affairs should explain what he means by &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; with the people in the North.  I presume he means that he would exert whatever pressure is available to him on the British to do everything possible to ease the situation there.  Neither should the Taoiseach make statements like &ldquo;we will not stand idly by&rdquo; without clarifying them. Words are very important and statements are very important and they should be self-explanatory.  I have tried to deal with the statement of the Taoiseach that we were on the brink of a great achievement and I hope Deputy Boland will agree with my version of what the Taoiseach really meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I referred to the fact that what this country was suffering from more than anything else was a surfeit of Fianna Fáil.  I meant that <Col N="2772" /> and I say it is time they gave up. During the past year the whole political scene has been dominated by the difficulties within the Fianna Fáil Party and the real business of the State and its future development have been ignored while the party's internal difficulties were being patched up in such a way that the Taoiseach could cling to power.  The decent thing would be for him to go to the country.  I believe the people would decide on a change of Government and in the years ahead the Fianna Fáil Party could sit in Opposition and settle their difficulties where they should be settling them. The Government, which is supposed to be doing the business of the State, could get down to doing that and would not be preoccupying themselves with their own difficulties and their own party's problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Clinton for being brief and I, too, will try to be concise as other Deputies wish to speak.  I want to deal with some of the many exciting topics that came up during the year.  Two things which can be linked are the question of inflation and the wage freeze.  I want to link the question of the North with our application to join the EEC, because this involves fundamental attitudes on the part of the different parties, and then I want to say something about the position that has been evolving in Fianna Fáil.  We had the extraordinary circumstance here that the Budget was not fully debated in the sense there were so many extraordinary events pending that it was swept out of everyone's mind.  At the time of the Budget there was some similarity between the position taken by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. For a Labour Party to stress the dangers of inflation and to urge regulation of the economy, admittedly in a way which was different from what the Government were trying to do, was to an extent a departure from our traditional position.  I think it was a measure of our responsibility and seriousness. We were mocked from the Government benches for taking that view and we had what was to me a magnificently egregious statement from a Deputy who was subsequently to become Minister <Col N="2773" /> for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, who on the 29th April said:</P>
      <P>Neither the Opposition nor anybody else in the country can justly criticise the Budget.  It is one of the finest pieces of thinking, financial legislation that has ever been introduced.</P>
      <P>Nice unmeasured words&mdash;&ldquo;ever introduced&rdquo;. Three months later we find the Taoiseach indicating, when the Dáil is conveniently going into recess for three months, that all that was said from the Opposition benches about the economy is true; it will be necessary to take steps to solve the crisis.  A Budget does not grow out of thin air in the fortnight before Budget Day.  No doubt there are people working on next year's Budget now.  The Minister for Finance's servants have the country's economy continuously under review and are involved in the lengthy and detailed process of producing a Budget.</P>
      <P>If the criticism of the situation which the Government have been permitting to evolve were obvious to the Opposition three months ago then it should have been evident to the Minister. The turnover tax which was introduced is inflationary, directly in regard to prices and also because the money is raised in that way and in that it leaves money in the hands of industries and in the hands of the richest people.</P>
      <P>Now we have this statement of the Taoiseach that the greatest immediate problem facing the nation is inflation. We agree now and we agreed three months ago when, for reasons that are not evident, the sort of ridiculous Budget that we had was introduced. It may have been introduced in the knowledge that, if it was necessary to get though, it would be better to do it in easy stages.  That is one possible explanation.  It was a definite dereliction; the situation was ignored for three months.  What is now emerging is the other side of this inflation and the way in which the Government propose to solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he introduced the Budget the Taoiseach used the phrase &ldquo;brutal exercise of their bargaining power&rdquo; in relation to the trade union movement. He talked briefly about the activities <Col N="2774" /> of strong, organised groups and the need for an incomes policy.  In his opening speech on this Adjournment debate the theme becomes a little clearer.  He says the Government has this obligation, rather vaguely expressed, &ldquo;to express a statutory limit to the increase any employer can give&rdquo;. To express a statutory limit!  It would have been clearer had the Taoiseach said &ldquo;to impose&rdquo;.  That would have indicated a clear intention.  There is no use in the Government &ldquo;expressing&rdquo; a statutory limit.  &ldquo;Strong and firm action must and will be taken by the Government.  There is not much time left.&rdquo;  There is not enough time left to wait until the Dáil reassembles in October.  &ldquo;The Government recognise workers cannot be expected to show restraint in wage demands unless other groups do the same.&rdquo;  We are faced with a classical pattern repeated in many countries at many times.  When one gets an inflationary situation such as this it is the workers and the poorest sections of the community who are expected to pay.</P>
    <P>There has been some considerable research in many countries from the point of view of government and other policies in regard to prices, in regard to wages, in regard to incomes and in regard to profits and all the evidence is that no mechanism anywhere has ever been devised which has successfully restrained profits, restrained the incomes of those sections of the community who sell their labour at the highest price, the professional classes. We have the classic example of the man who has five times what he needs to live on who is not asked to exercise any restraint whereas the man who has just barely what he needs in order to live is asked to cut into his fundamental and irreducible standard of living. This is the social justice, the corrollary to the refusal to act in the Budget, this magnificent piece of financial thinking, the most magnificent ever introduced, and all the rest of the clap-trap that was served up with it.</P>
    <P>Wage freezes&mdash;there is evidence of this all over the world&mdash;are not things that work satisfactorily for any practical length of time.  They are things which disrupt the organised trade <Col N="2775" /> union movement.  They are a device which tries to solve immediate crisis problems at the expense of those who produce the wealth, at the expense of the working-classes.  If we want to solve the crisis we will have to do so by the methods and the kind of taxation advocated from these benches in place of the turnover tax in the debate on the Budget.  If we want to solve the crisis we will have to introduce a whole series of measures which will bear right across the board, on profits and on higher incomes, and then the trade union movement will be willing to play a correspondingly responsible part in that exercise.  To the extent that we have influence with the organised working-classes here we will see that this crisis is not solved at the expense of the working people.  We will have no part in any policy which says to the poorest sections of the community : &ldquo;Don't ask for any more.  Don't ask even to keep up with the inflation&rdquo;. We will have no part in such a policy which leaves those on the higher levels completely untouched.  Any such policy will be rejected and, if the Taoiseach and his Government think they will solve the crisis in that way, then they are on a collision course and they might as well be clear about that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I wish to say about inflation and wage freezes. I want to turn now to the north and to the EEC negotiations.  These seem to me to indicate linked attitudes.  I listened with some interest and, indeed, some emotion to Deputy Boland this morning, not because I agree with him very often but because I found the turmoil he and many sections of the Fianna Fáil Party are in in trying to decide what is the correct thing to do not at all funny.  It is no source of mockery from our point of view.  I do not have any particular respect for the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party but <Col N="2776" /> I have a great deal of respect for many of their followers throughout the country.  This is a very real turmoil because the policies they so honourably espoused 30 years ago are being cast aside wholesale with quite extraordinary rapidity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland in describing the Taoiseach's speech on the eve of the 12th used the word &ldquo;object&rdquo;.  I used the word to describe the Government's application to join the EEC; it was abject.  Both are abject.  In his speech on 11th July&mdash;Deputy Boland referred to this&mdash;the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;This whole unhappy situation is an Irish quarrel.  I admit that others come into it either because they misunderstand it or because they misuse it, but they are not an essential part of it.  We must settle this quarrel among us.&rdquo;&ldquo;They&rdquo; are the Irish of all strands.  I welcome the Taoiseach's putting out a hand to all strands in the nation, but the suggestion that it is an Irish quarrel and that all the other strands in it are not an essential part of it is surely a total rejection of the whole Irish republican tradition.  I value that tradition only because I think that what is enshrined in it is right.  I have analysed this.  We happen to live beside the country which first evolved capitalism. Perhaps the Dutch were the real first, but Britain came next.  We became one of the first classical modern capitalist colonies and this was our great misfortune.  It was not an Irishman who said: &ldquo;The Orange card is the card to play.&rdquo;  It was an Englishman.</P>
      <P>The determination to divide the Irish people goes back far beyond the institution of Partition.  The division of the people on religious grounds and to some extent on limited ethnic grounds &mdash;in that the people who came from Scotland and England were of slightly different ethnic stock&mdash;goes back to the fright Britain got at the time of the United Irishmen.  At that time under Tone's leadership, Dissenters in Northern Ireland made common cause with Catholics.  The enemy has always been British imperialism and when Deputy Boland used that word today I said: &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that his second <Col N="2777" /> commitment is to Anglo-Irish friendship but I must differentiate when speaking about friendship with England.  For the ordinary people of England I have nothing but friendship but for the ruling classes who have partitioned Ireland, who have brought &ldquo;hangers-on&rdquo; in both parts of Ireland, I have nothing but implacable animosity.  They have spread an empire throughout the world which may not exist as the colour red on the map anymore but it still exists in economic and social terms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland quite correctly referred to the buying-off of Northern Ireland with huge subsidies, making the possibility of re-unification more difficult. These subsidies are available to the British imperialists because they are exploiting others.  The subsidies are paid out of the pockets of the British taxpayers, whereas the profits from the ownership of industries in the North of Ireland go into the pockets of the British ruling classes.  The existence of the North of Ireland is a source of increased wealth for the ruling classes.</P>
    <P>The key to the situation in Ireland is British imperialism and the domination of the economies of both parts of this country by British imperialists.  The key to ending this is to struggle against imperialism, not against Protestants and not against England.  Hate is a sterile emotion and we do not hate the people of any country, of England or of the North of Ireland.  However, we can hate an institution that has brought so much degradation in its wake.</P>
    <P>If we say it is not the majority group in the north that has affected superiority towards the rest of the community, do we end up by saying that there is no institution against which we ought to struggle, which is responsible for this degradation and inequality? The whole kernel of Irish republicanism is its anti-imperialist posture.  If the term &ldquo;imperialist&rdquo; is disliked, one can substitute &ldquo;neo-colonialist&rdquo; or any other word, but the reality is that the strong capitalism of Britain has dominated and divided us in order to perpetuate its rule over us.  This is the source of the hatred between different groupings in the north and this is why the road forward is by unity of the <Col N="2778" /> working classes in the north and south, gathering other elements in a struggle against imperialism.  For this reason the unity displayed in the shipyards this year, in the centre of a holocaust of hatred, was a wonderful and hopeful sign.  When the Taoiseach says this is an Irish quarrel, I must disagree totally with him.  This analysis that it is an Irish quarrel is the basis of the whole sell-out which Deputy Boland so rightly deplored.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of the European Economic Community.  It is fine to talk about Article 3 of the Constitution, as Deputy Boland did at some length.  I have quoted already the remark of Sir Boyle Roche that it is worth sacrificing part or even the whole of the Constitution that the rest may be preserved.  Article 5 will have to go and in my view Article 1 will have to go and many other Articles. Why get excited about the possible re-unification of national territory when accession to the EEC will mean that the Irish nation will cease to exist?  If we are willing to give away sovereignty over this part of the country, why the academic excitement about our sovereignty in the other part of the country? I find it illogical that people who profess to be republicans can find no fault with the Taoiseach's policy on the EEC because these matters are absolutely incompatible.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken about various objections to the EEC and I do not wish to repeat them but the thought that by abolishing ourselves as a nation we can solve Partition is ridiculous.  It is analogous to saying that if you have a cold you jump off the tallest building and that will stop the cold.  It will also stop the traffic and it will solve the problem at the cost of personal extinction. We can solve the problem of the re-unification of Ireland by abolishing Ireland but it is a totally different solution from anything the Fianna Fáil Party have ever believed.  I must admit I am in agreement with much of what Fianna Fáil says, as distinct from what they do.  My great critcism of them is that they have betrayed much of their beliefs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland went back to 1926, but I demonstrated in the debate on the <Col N="2779" /> EEC that every piece of policy adopted at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in 1953 has been abandoned.  Therefore, the excitement of the &ldquo;republicans&rdquo; seems to me to be irrelevant.  I can only ask myself how serious are they and if they can find no crumb of criticism of the EEC that they can offer to join totally without reservations?</P>
    <P>This brings me to the point I have always held and which has emerged with extraordinary clarity in this House and throughout the country since 6th May last.  I believe that in this century it is only possible for a small weak economy to survive as a socialist economy, not as an open capitalist economy.  In other words, if you are a republican in this century you have no option but to be a socialist.  This point was clear to James Connolly more than half a century ago and it is just as true today.  Therefore, throughout the history of Fianna Fáil there has been this dilemma &ldquo;We are republicans and the inheritors of the Irish republican tradition but, on the other hand, we are economically dependent on Britain: we negotiated a free trade agreement with them, we have never had a separate currency.&rdquo;  This is the impossible dilemma.  On the one hand, we support the small farmers; on the other hand, we accept Mansholt.</P>
    <P>I have asked myself over and over again, but never more than in the past few months, how can people who are not obviously dishonest have such a vast divergence between what they profess to believe and what they actually believe.  I do not have this criticism of Fine Gael.  Fine Gael have been consistent. I have been in disagreement with Fine Gael but they have been consistent during their whole life.  If you go back to the old Cumann na nGaedheal times, to which Deputy Boland referred, they were consistent then, too.  However, the evolution of the Fianna Fáil Party, as revealed by the EEC debate and on many other matters, clearly indicates no difference in policy between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There is a difference of personality and there are the hatreds of the Civil War, but there is no difference in policy <Col N="2780" /> between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. That is not because of a change of policy on the part of Fine Gael; it is because of a change of policy on the part of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Boland is beginning to see now an abandonment of everything Fianna Fáil thought possible in the 1930s, the 1940s and up to the mid-1960s: he is beginning to see that under the impact of terrible events. There has been a total shift of policy on the part of Fianna Fáil.  This is what makes for this awful dilemma for the people on whom I look as very fine and very serious and loyal and vital Fianna Fáil supporters throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Was Fine Gael right all along?  Was the whole evolution of Fianna Fáil policy since 1926 totally mistaken and impossible of realisation or, in some way, is it possible to salvage the sort of ideology that has been expressed by Fianna Fáil spokesmen down the years and indeed is still expressed at election times&mdash;this enormous gap between the &ldquo;reality&rdquo; and the pharseology of the hustings?  How can this enormous gap exist in the minds of people most of whom are sincere?  They are not all sincere.  I used to think they were all hypocrites when I came here, that they knew about the gap, that they were aware of the difference, that it did not worry them because the important thing was to stay in power.  Hypocrisy is one explanation, and certainly it applies to a proportion of Fianna Fáil but, on the basis of actual contacts during my time here in the past 12 months I consider that hypocrisy is the explanation only in relation to a minority in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>When a great gap exists between words and deeds and you do not notice it, there is the explanation of simple stupidity.  Hypocrisy and stupidity are not mutally exclusive: it is possible to be both at the same time.  I think of a number of people in Fianna Fáil to whom both these epithets would apply and, in some, it is simply a matter of stupidity because they do not notice the divergence.  A third group is becoming more and more evident in the turmoil of soul which is now taking place: I do not mock them.  They are now facing a dilemma inherent in their <Col N="2781" /> party through the whole of their lives and they have not had to face that before.  People who are not stupid and who are not hypocrites end up by becoming mentally disturbed in the sort of way in which, in the more acute form, is seen in our asylums where people have totally lost contact with the real world.  The tremendous emotional drive they feel causes them to rebuild their picture of the world, in a fantastic way not corresponding to reality.</P>
    <P>What has emerged in this session is that it is no longer possible to face in a whole lot of ways at the same time. It is no longer possible to utter words about policies of the 1930s and, in fact, carry out the realistic policies which recognise the position of British imperialism, which recognises&mdash;they say there is no alternative to go into the EEC; I am not giving my belief but their belief as expressed in their actions &mdash;that the Irish nation as a nation is no longer valid or viable and that the whole culmination of the evolution of a republican tradition of 200 years was all barking up the wrong tree and that the old gods must now be abandoned and forgotten.</P>
    <P>It is sad, not for practising politicians who choose this life and accept the psychological crunch when it comes, but for people to be put into this terrible situation which sections of the Irish people are in at the moment. Many of our institutions are in danger because, in their casting about and in the fury one sees this extraordinary phenomenon of sharp anger, hostility and aggression towards fellow countrymen. You may disagree with people but when you want to hit them in the face&mdash;which we do to quite a remarkable extent in our politics at present&mdash; then you have to find a motivation other than the obvious one.</P>
    <P>Some of the statements made in this House recently are particularly sinister.  I did not hear Deputy Blaney yesterday but in a previous debate he seemed to be evolving in just this violent way which I think is very dangerous.  It is just because the impossibility of sustaining the illusion is now becoming so clear, and has become so clear in the past three or four <Col N="2782" /> months, that we now have a great need to argue not in terms of political advantage but simply in terms of telling the truth to the populace.  The fundamental assumptions of our traditions are brought into question. They bring into question the validity of the old gods, to use a somewhat paraphrased form of what the Taoiseach said.  Therefore, it is a dangerous time.  It is a time, it seems to me, when, if major political parties are really changing their mind in a fundamental way, they have a duty to themselves and to the populace as a whole to say they are doing it, and to say why they are doing it.  Otherwise, we are faced with a danger of solutions&mdash; solutions which are authoritarian, wicked and which will set back the development of the country.  We are far from a resolution but, in this session, it seems to me that the whole ice of Irish political life has started to crack.  It is around the twin issues of the north and the EEC that it is happening.</P>
    <P>If I were to bring it down to a single sentence&mdash;and here very oddly I find myself in agreement with Deputy Boland, rather to my surprise, and no doubt to his&mdash;I would say that the central issue is this: do you or do you not believe that imperialism exists?  Do you or do you not believe that the Irish people, under the leadership of their political parties, ought to struggle against this imperialism?  That seems to me to be the central question that we cannot escape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention at this stage will be very brief because I know there are others who wish to speak and that the time available is limited.  I am mainly concerned with the Taoiseach's opening statement on the general state of the economy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the industrial relations situation.  I should like to take this opportunity to put something on the record in relation to that.  I do not wish to reiterate the many statements which were made in support of maintaining the present system of free collective bargaining which has characterised our system of industrial relations down through the years and is <Col N="2783" /> held, indeed strangely, by everybody in this House to be the ideal system, if it could be found to work.</P>
      <P>This free collective bargaining sysstem which is so vital to the future of the economy has been undergoing a very severe test for some time.  Many people are becoming impatient.  I am not sure that Deputies in this House, and particularly members of the public outside, and other agencies, are always aware when they press on the Minister to intervene in an industrial dispute, that what is really at fault here is simply, as I pointed out so often, that it is encouraging a changeover from the present system to something which would be very much a new system or, worse still, no system at all. It would be left to anyone to come along at some stage and try to do better than he was doing with whatever group was dealing with the situation before.</P>
      <P>When I went to the Department of Labour I set out to try to establish confidence in the institutions which existed and mutual trust so far as management/labour situation people were concerned, that is to say, between the ICTU and the FUE.  Along these lines, and only along these lines, I think, can success be achieved eventually, if we are to have the voluntary restraint which is desired by so many people. It is quite easy to point out the different factors involved, and quite easy to point out the dangers that are inherent where you have a spiralling inflation, but it is not always easy to get the message home to individual groups who are directly concerned who feel that they are only a part of the many and that they might as well have their full share of the cake when it is going, which seems to suggest a type of smash-and-grab system so far as the economy is concerned.  They will express their feelings that it is dangerous to the economy but they will say the other person is doing it and why should not they.  To arrest this situation and to get a measure of individual responsibility brought into what might be regarded as the collective situation is not so easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked at the history of the Labour <Col N="2784" /> Court and the industrial relations section of the court, better known as the conciliation section, the support it got in this House and the views which were expressed when it was set up.  If any Deputy goes back over the record he will come to the conclusion that very high hopes were expressed and that everybody agreed that this institution, given the necessary acceptances and the proper approach from all concerned. It is for this reason that I would fight strongly against the substitution of any new system.  I know there is always a feeling that something new is better.  The impression is created that it will have a different approach. After a time, it becomes the same outworn vehicle, or is looked on in that way by some people and is passed up. People seem to grapple at every straw in the wind for some other approach, the purpose being, fundamentally, to see whether they could do better in the demands they are making, and others seeing if they could do better by holding back from giving what is being demanded.  Therefore, I should like to get the full co-operation, not merely of this House, but of the public, in bringing a sense of responsibility into demands in every direction.</P>
    <P>When strikes or industrial disputes take place, when demands are made, some people seem to think there are only two sides: the management and the workers, but the community, a very important section, are also involved and somebody has got to speak for them.  If I intervene at any stage to ensure that the institutions available to these people are used, it is on behalf of the community and the economy in general.  After all, the community are the most important part of this triangle in the whole question of industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>This year I was reluctant to intervene in some of the major disputes which were either pending or had taken place.  Many people accused me of being too smug or of being complacent about these matters.  It had nothing whatever to do with my feelings. If I did not appear to be jumping in at the deep end, at the wrong time, it was because I thought it was the wrong thing to do, and the Government <Col N="2785" /> felt it was the wrong thing to do.  I pointed out time and time again in the House that parties to any dispute will always be slow to settle at any level, using the existing institutions, if they feel there is still something left at the other end, a Minister or a Taoiseach who is likely to do better.  People who find themselves in a position, due to their own strong negotiating position, due to their position of strength in so far as they can inconvenience a very big section of the public, will make it very difficult for anybody to settle a dispute unless they get the demand they are making.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas this year the ESB were involved in a dispute.  On that occasion we sought to get them to use every agency available to them to settle it.  We found that we had reached complete stalemate.  On that occasion I was compelled to invoke my powers under section 24 of the 1946 Act to have the Labour Court make a thorough examination of the whole situation and, if they saw fit, to make a recommendation as well.  Those are the powers which are vested in me under that section.  They made a thorough examination and a recommendation, which I am very happy to say was accepted at the time by the good sense and wisdom of both sides. Indeed, like many other settlements it went, perhaps, much further than I might have anticipated.  It certainly went further than one side to the dispute would have anticipated at the time, but it worked out satisfactorily. It was satisfactory to me in so far as I knew that the proper channels were being used to settle the dispute.</P>
    <P>We then had the major upheaval of the cement strike.  I was pressed to intervene in it at different stages.  I will say this for the two sides in that dispute.  Although it went on for a long time, they used all the machinery available to them and eventually they put the final recommendation of the Labour Court to a secret ballot.  Some people may argue that it was not all that secret.  I do not intend to comment on that.  Eventually stalemate was reached, the recommendation was not accepted, and there was nothing left other than for me to bring in both sides and discuss with them the recommendations <Col N="2786" /> that were made.  We succeeded in getting some modification of the recommendations submitted as a result of our discussions.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the people who finally negotiated with me representing both sides.  They went back prepared to recommend it.  In fact, it was the last word anyhow.  Where we would have got from there I am not now in a position to say.  Some action would have had to be taken.  These things have to be settled some time. but how, it was not for me to even say, because it was a one-shot effort so far as I was concerned.  Those who were negotiating and who met me at the time knew it was, and I was happy that it was reasonable and that it was accepted.</P>
    <P>We come now to the bank strike which is the main purpose of my getting up to intervene in this debate in which I did not intend speaking because, in an Adjournment debate, one likes to cover the whole gamut of the economy at least in so far as it affects one's Department or Departments.  I do not intend to do that.  I have given much serious thought to this dispute since it began.  I have been kept informed daily of the happenings or lack of happenings and of the efforts being made by different people and I am more than a little perturbed over the whole progress or evolution of the dispute since it began.  At times one would be inclined to weary and despair if one had not infinite patience to persevere and keep on trying, hoping that commonsense and goodwill would prevail and that people would do what would be in the interests of everybody, rather than what would be in the absolute interest of themselves.</P>
    <P>That did not happen in this case. If I say things that may seem harsh in regard to the workers' side it is not that I have any brief for the banks. My background does not make for that.  I am interested in the workers of the country, not merely in the rates they get, but also in the conditions in which they work, their safety, their environment, their health and particularly the security of their jobs. These are fundamental things in which we must take a deep interest.  I am <Col N="2787" /> sure that every Member of the House is also interested in these things.  There are various grades and sections and there is much to be done in regard to providing the conditions under which we would like them to work.  Most important considerations are the security of their jobs, how their redundancy is treated if they become unemployed and their entitlement to it, how we can re-train them and replace them.  These are the fundamental things in which the Department of Labour is interested.</P>
    <P>On one occasion at Question Time a Deputy on the Fine Gael benches asked: &ldquo;What is the Minister's Department for if not for settling strikes?&rdquo; That is not its purpose.  We look upon ourselves rather as having the purpose of preventing strikes, but we are more concerned with training personnel for employment which suits their talents and with finding opportunities for placing them in employment, for re-training people who have been displaced, dealing with redundancy and providing the necessary environment so that we shall have a contented work force applying their talents in the direction in which they are best suited.  This is a very big undertaking.  We have only got round to laying the foundations for it.  It is work of very great importance.  We must determine the lines on which we shall expand and develop rapidly as time goes on.  The foundations have been well and truly laid and we are moving as rapidly as our resources permit.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that one finds the intransigent attitude of some people in strikes that last over a prolonged period difficult to understand and it would sometimes make one despair as to the future.  There are people who say drastic action should be taken, that it is an emergency, a serious situation.  They never come up with any real solution or suggestion regarding what might be done.  In the present bank strike we have such a situation.  It is really a source of great worry to those of us who had high hopes of possible successful development along the right lines of free, collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2788" /> I intervened in this strike only when I found that they were refusing to use the machinery available.  They had not exhausted all the resources available to them but &ldquo;if the mountain does not come to Mahomet&rdquo; somebody must move.  Here, I found people who were claiming to be in some way entitled to some special treatment.  To me, they are just workers and management and must be treated as such like any other parties in a dispute.  As far as I am concerned they are not entitled to special privileges or treatment any more than any other workers who are on strike.  When I say on strike, I mean on strike because I do not accept that, when the clever device of taking out a portion of workers in order to force management to a closure is used, that situation should then be regarded as a lock out.</P>
    <P>This is a device about which I and the Government would really worry, because it is far too clever.  A percentage of workers are withdrawn and this makes the normal carrying on of work impossible and eventually closure must take place.  Then to say: &ldquo;This is not a strike; it is a lock-out&rdquo; is not accepted.  The Labour Court examined that position very thoroughly and impartially. They very definitely came to the decision that the banks could not have continued with the restricted working that was taking place and they had no option but to close.  I do not agree in those circumstances that there is a lock-out.  We must fight hard against acceptance of this idea.  We have had enough trouble in this field without having new devices and gimmicks introduced.  This is one that must be discouraged, and not allowed to be seen to succeed.</P>
    <P>The other proposition involved here is one that cannot be accepted under any conditions: payment for time on strike.  Seeking compensation for time on strike is not &ldquo;on&rdquo; and must be seen to be not &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  The Labour Court made a thorough examination of this dispute and came up with what I thought was a very fair set of proposals which I considered for a day-and-a-half.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is. It is narrowed down to that.  I was coming to that and I want to develop it.  The Labour Court made a very exhaustive, impartial, dispassionate examination of the whole dispute from beginning to end.  They came up with what I consider to be a very fine set of proposals which I might or might not have submitted.  I did submit them for acceptance to these people.  Before the ink was dry, so to speak, before they were submitted to the workers, they were rejected out of hand by one person or a small committee.  Immediately I was asked to intervene: &ldquo;Right.  So far as it goes it is good. We have everything now except compensation for being on strike.  You must intervene now,&rdquo; the clear implications being: &ldquo;You intervene and then we will go back.&rdquo;  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not intervening. Negotiations were started at conciliation level with the Joint Industrial <Col N="2790" /> Council, which was agreed by the management and the workers within the banking system.  When the various processes of negotiation failed I finally got the Labour Court to report on the situation.  They made what I thought was an equitable assessment and very fair recommendations.  Immediately this is submitted for acceptance, before anyone has time to read it, they say: &ldquo;If the Minister intervenes we might be able to settle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is something new and unprecedented. It is unique in the history of disputes in this country.  I thought we had seen everything.  I do not think anyone in this House could condone that type of action.  I believe the people who are in dispute are entitled to have this at least submitted to them for their consideration without any pressurising, without any comment.  We are at a very serious point in the dispute where people look on all the processes of negotiation as being for the purpose of getting a little each time, an accumulator, what the racing people call a roll-up, getting a little more each time. They say: &ldquo;The Minister will now give us another bit and we shall have got virtually all we have been looking for.&rdquo; I am not sure if I intervened and added something more they would not say: &ldquo;Now the Taoiseach will come in and give us something extra&rdquo;.

I <Col N="2792" /> do not believe in making innuendoes and half saying something for the sake of creating an impression.  I want to say exactly what I feel about this and I have been doing that.

      <P>Indeed, I think the Labour Court in recommending the restoration of the 25 per cent cut in respect of restricted hours went a long way.  I noticed, reading the report of the dispute, that it was claimed they worked less than 32½ hours a week. While I would like to see the lower grade workers in any dispute coming out of it well I think this was a particularly fair offer by any comparision. I do not think it is fair either that I have been accused here of saying things that I should not say.  I deliberately say them because I do not believe in thinking them and not saying them. It was also said that the concessions made in the offer were being used as an indication that so-and-so was right and so-and-so was wrong, and that is not fair game either.  That I do not agree with.  If anything is suggested now as a means towards a settlement it should be accepted or rejected.  Let it not be said that it is a vindication of what we did and justifies our looking for more.  There are elements in this strike that have not crept into any other.  So far as I am concerned it is not a strike that requires any VIP treatment.  To me it is just a strike between workers and management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be <Col N="2793" /> treated in the same way as other people and I think they have already got a very fair assessment of the whole dispute and a remarkable fair offer.  I only advise them strongly to go back to work and accept the offer that is made.  The offer leaves it open for a lot of loose ends to be cleared up afterwards but I think the important thing is that they should get back to work and play their part in trying to help the economy of this small country which needs the assistance of everybody so much.  If we are all to seek to get out of the national cake more than the other fellow has been getting I do not know where we will eventually arrive.  As the Taoiseach pointed out in his statement, voluntary restraint is what we would prefer to see.  Nobody wants to see any desperate action taken.  Sometimes that is suggested to me.  What that might be is anybody's guess.  I hope that enough good sense is left to ensure that those who are involved, so far as this dispute is concerned, will now decide that the public has had enough of this, the economy has had more than it can take of it and the people who are out on strike are certainly suffering.  The sooner they get back the better.  I think there is a fair offer available.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say anything further. My intervention was mainly to say that.  Some people may say that it would be better if I never said it but I want to say without any equivocation these are my feelings with regard to this dispute.  I studied the Labour Court recommendations for a day and a half.  I was perfectly satisfied that here was something that was as fair as could possibly be submitted to any set of workers.  I am most disappointed that it was not accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer, before going on to the wider issues, to the interesting remarks made by the Minister for Labour regarding the bank strike.  One thought which immediately comes to mind is that the Minister appears, though he has read this for a day and a half, to have overlooked the Labour Court's recommendation of increased pay retrospective to last December and that this was what the officials of the banks were arguing about.  The Labour Court has apparently justified the officials' claims but because the officials were seeking justification of these claims they suffered a lock-out, according to them. Objectively or subjectively they were without pay for some time &mdash; whether this was a day, a week or a number of months is, to my mind, immaterial. The fact is that what they were negotiating for, with all the negotiating power at their disposal, was upheld by the Labour Court's decision that they be awarded an increase in pay back to last December.  The Minister has not referred to this and I would like him to give his views on this because having listened to the Minister's speech it would appear now that, though the officials have asked the Minister to intervene, the Minister is not now in any position to intervene.  It would appear as if he has outruled himself as an unbiassed, independent intermediary.  This is a very serious situation into which this dispute has now gone.  I do not want to add fuel to the fire.  Perhaps the Minister did not wish to give this impression but it would be unfortunate if this impression went out of this House today.  The people of Ireland would like to see the Minister still available to intervene in this most serious dispute, which has caused great hardship to businessmen and to people <Col N="2795" /> all over the country.  It is seriously affecting our economy.  It appears to me that the Minister could possibly have been better advised if he had kept his options open in the House today and had not come down heavily on the side of management as would appear from his speech.</P>
      <P>All these officials&mdash;I am not carrying a torch for anybody&mdash;are apparently looking for financial compensation for a time when they were either on strike or locked out.  The Labour Court have upheld their claim back to last December.  As they would have claimed, because of unusual circumstances which arose in the economy of the country they were faced with having to break whatever agreement they had originally made.  I feel it is unfair for the Minister to say that the decision of the Labour Court was rejected out of hand immediately.  I do not accept this.  I feel that a skilled negotiator on either side would be in a position or should be in a position to weigh up as each offer comes along how this will affect the final result.  I feel personally that were the negotiators on each side properly briefed and skilled, as it was discussed&mdash;and it was discussed over a fairly long time &mdash; they would be in a position to weigh up the pros and cons of any offer which was being made.</P>
      <P>It appears to me the Minister should intervene because, following the decision in which the Labour Court intimated that the bank officials' claim was just and that, because of the unusually rapid decrease in the purchasing power of the £ they were entitled to break the previous arrangement before it expired, the Labour Court agreed to the backdated increases As a result of bringing their pay claims to the Labour Court the bank officials were locked out and have suffered financial loss.  The financial loss was suffered as a result of claiming a just claim which has since been supported by the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should ask the Labour Court to clarify this.  This has certainly left a big gap.  I do not think, as the Minister said, that it is necessary.  I also think it is contradictory for the Minister to state it, being a Minister in a <Col N="2796" /> Cabinet which so far has rejected all calls to go to the country.  He said this was rejected out of hand by one or two people, by a very small committee, on the official side and they did not put it to a vote, implying that if it had been put to a vote there might have been acceptance.  It is not so long ago since the Minister's party rejected all the calls to go to the country so that the people could decide who was to govern the country.  The democratic procedure was stifled.  Now the Minister is alleging that the bank officials who are adopting a course which could be similar to that which the Government adopted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if I clarified my point rather than that the Minister should pick me up on an isolated sentence.  If the Minister wishes to allege that I am trying to draw an unfair comparison, I am not. The Minister did infer that it was rejected out of hand by one or two people within hours of the court's decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to bring home here is that, apart altogether from the fact that it was not put to the people concerned, there is no analogy at all in what the Deputy is trying to say in regard to the Fianna Fáil Party.  They got a decision from the people a year before.  What I want to emphasise is that, when proposals are made to settle a dispute, they contain certain elements which are calculated to appease the people concerned. To use those proposals as a justification for getting more is never done.  That is what was happening in this case.  My proposals were taken as a justification for saying: &ldquo;Now, we were right all along.  That proves we were right and now we must get more&rdquo;. That is what I object to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying that point.  I should like to refer again to the Labour Court's decision in which they backdated the increase to December, 1969.  The bank officials suffered a lock-out and a loss of pay.  Many of them are young married men with children and all the <Col N="2797" /> other commitments which are associated with the white collar worker today.  The court backdated the pay to December, 1969, which was what they went for in the first place.  The same thing could happen in two years' time. It will not happen under a Fine Gael Government in two years' time, there is no doubt about that.  We would not allow it to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could happen every year if people are going to be paid twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If each time a group of people feel their agreement with the management has been broken, that their claim for just arbitration is ignored and they are locked out, although it is proved by the Labour Court that their claim was justified, is it right that they should have to suffer financial hardship because of this?  I do not accept that.</P>
      <P>This is not the only unusual case we have had.  We have had parades up and down the country, for the first time in the history of the country, by the vocational professions.  Nurses were parading in an effort to get a living wage.  The cost of bedsitters in Dublin and in other towns has gone far beyond the means of nurses.  Is it unjust that they should have to go out with banners, the members of this great profession of which we are so proud? Surely there has been a lessening of the appreciation we had of this wonderful nursing profession.  Not so long ago, and also for the first time in our history, the arbitration for dispensary doctors was thrown out by other Ministers and they carried out a work-to-rule. More recently we had the tragic affair of young men who had spent six or seven years in the university handing in their resignations all over the country because they were not getting sufficient money, not to live in luxury but sufficient money whereby they could live and buy the ordinary necessaries of life.  They were not looking for anything fantastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But for their great vocation we would have had a strike among nurses. We had a partial strike among dispensary doctors and we had mass resignations from junior hospital <Col N="2798" /> doctors.  Then we had the lock-out of the bank officials.  It is not so long ago since the great professions were nursing, medicine and a good job in the bank.  What has happened?  Bank officials are emigrating, leaving their wives and families at home so that they can work in England.  Some of them are working in pea factories. Their claim has been upheld by the Labour Court, yet they have had to lose money in order to get the court to uphold their claim.  But the Minister thinks they were hasty in rejecting the recommendation.  The Minister should intervene.  I am not carrying a torch for these people but I do not like to see people out of pocket after they have had their case proven by the Labour Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am merely saying that the Minister should have kept his options open and not come down heavily on the management side because it is alienating the bank officials. I think the Minister might not now be accepted as an impartial mediator, which is unfortunate.  I do not know if the Minister has ever had to work in pea factories in England but there are many here in this House who had to serve tough apprenticeships.  I do not like to see married men having to emigrate and to return to a type of work which might have been acceptable to them as students.  We all did not have protected lives.  Some of us have had to work in factories abroad in order to subsidise education for certain degrees.  It is not so long ago since the Taoiseach said to a Member of the Labour Party that he would not know what poverty was.  At one stage the Taoiseach may have experienced poverty but he has long since forgotten what it is like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No effort is made by this Fianna Fáil Government to alleviate the sufferings of the lower income groups, that section of our community which is increasing all the time.  We have here the highest percentage of aged as compared with the rest of Europe.  We have <Col N="2799" /> the highest percentage of mentally handicapped and psychiatric patients in Europe, if not in the world.  Our mentally handicapped will increase in numbers because we have the largest number of children per family unit in Europe and, as the number of children increases, so does the number of mentally handicapped.  This great socialist republican Fianna Fáil Party have long since forgotten what it is to be poor and, worse still, have long since forgotten what republican means.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech said there was no invader and he apologised to the members of the British Army for the inconvenience caused to them by their being away from their own homes during this month.  Where now, is the socialism and the republicanism? Look at the state of this capital city of ours, particularly since 1965 when Dublin started to expand very rapidly.  Both the air and the waters are polluted.  Life in many parts of Dublin is quite difficult.  Look at &ldquo;Blaney Heights&rdquo;&mdash;the seven-tower wonder of the world.  We know how unbearable life can be in the conditions there, conditions created by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Recently a special edition of a magazine carried on its cover the word &ldquo;Pollution&rdquo; and, when on turned the page, one was faced with a most attractive advertisement for some brand of cigarettes.  Have we got our priorities right?  I do not think we have.  We advertise alcohol and cigarettes on all our mass media of communication.  We have 70,000 alcoholics, 10 per cent of whom are in need of institutional care at some stage.</P>
    <P>The old advertisement &ldquo;Guinness is good for you&rdquo; was all right.  It is the modern advertising that is so objectionable. We see the young tycoon with the large brandy in one hand and the cigar in the other giving the impression that material success goes hand in hand with these two great hazards to health. It is time the lackeys on the other side of the House tried to get their ministers, who have apparently gone into hibernation, to make some move to curb these evils.  Alcoholism is on the increase.  It is alleged that the lives of on average 16 people are affected by <Col N="2800" /> just one alcoholic.  This is a parlous situation.  Yet the Minister responsible does nothing about it.  In the USA an alcoholic is advised to have medical treatment.  Here he is treated as an outcast. These people can be rehabilitated. It is known that these people are generally highly intelligent.  I have had experience of one particular case, a member of the first Judo club in the Garda Síochána, the winner of a black belt, who was wonderful at his job.  He had a wife and children and a very good home.  He fell foul of his employers because of drink and he was dismissed.  He was diagnosed as suffering from chronic alcoholism.  Is it right that he and thousands like him should be treated as rejects of society? People who contract tuberculosis and are treated for that disease are not rejected.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism is one of the greatest afflictions in our society but it is not accepted by State bodies and industry as a disease; it is regarded as something akin to the plague.  I would appeal to the Taoiseach to take steps to ensure that there is greater understanding of this problem.  It is receiving attention in the medical departments in every country.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the vast increase in the number of elderly people in this country.  In many cases they just go staggering from feeding place to resting place, waiting to die. We have seen the slovenly conditions in which they live, the county homes and the psychiatric homes that are overflowing with these people.</P>
    <P>The greatest evil besetting this country is the problem of drug addiction. This is the most ominous threat which our community has had to face in the past 30 years.  Unfortunately, we have the most lethargic of groups in Fianna Fáil attempting to come to grips with this problem.  The drug squad of four policemen has now been increased to seven but, because they work shorter hours, the effective working force of the squad is still four members.  What can four specially-trained men do to combat this problem? It is a problem not only in Dublin but in Cork, Waterford, <Col N="2801" /> Limerick and other areas.  People tell urban Deputies that drugs come in crates through the port of Dublin but no real effort is made to stop this traffic.</P>
    <P>We have seen recently the sacrilegious abuses that have occurred in some of our finest churches.  The church of Our Lady of Victories at Ballymun&mdash;one of the finest churches in the country&mdash;was ransacked, the safe was broken open and money was stolen.  We know that in the Pro-Cathedral people played cards on the altar after breaking open the collection boxes.  This is what drugs are doing to our youth.  It is a big step away from vandalism.  I draw a line between drugs and drink because, while a drunkard or an alcoholic will rob in order to obtain money for drink, the drug addict will kill.  The crimes I have just described were committed by people who were crazed with drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and myself and others who visit the working class areas have met constituents who tell us how easy it is to get a wide variety of drugs.  The Government must take special action to deal with this problem. While this problem is in its infancy in this country it would not be unwise for us to consider imposing severe penalties on people who are found to be drug pushers.  Those drug pushers, very often not addicts themselves, are fully aware of the consequences of their actions.  They know the hardship that is caused and the rapid death that is suffered by addicts. If those pushers are apprehended by the law they should be punished as severely as the State can punish them.</P>
    <P>Up to a few weeks ago a drug pusher could sell LSD in the public houses and cafes of Dublin and could not be arrested for having this drug in his possession or for selling it.  We must adopt an extreme approach in this matter and set an example for the world.  I feel very strongly about this matter because I have witnessed teenagers near death as a result of drug addiction.  I should like to see the Government giving consideration to the introduction of the death penalty for drug pushers who are not themselves drug addicts.  A pusher, who is also an <Col N="2802" /> addict, needs rehabilitation and can be treated as a psychiatric patient but the pusher, who is not an addict, is a murderer.  He does not murder just one person or half a dozen people but is the potential murderer of thousands of youths in our country.  In this House it is our job to make this country a decent place in which to live and it is time the Government got their priorities in order and attacked the problems that exist. They should learn from the experience of other countries and see how their societies have become undermined by drugs, general permissiveness, literature and lack of censorship.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Government adopt a policy and not merely close the door after the horse has bolted.  Unless the problems are tackled firmly and strenuously the result will be chaos. The drug addict who dies is, in some ways, fortunate.  What happens to those who are diseased for the rest of their lives?  What about the increase in the diseases associated with drug taking; the illegitimate births, the disease of tuberculosis and the psychiatric diseases? In spite of all this the Government have only got four men on duty to combat the problem of drug addiction.</P>
    <P>It is well that people who come from the more protected rural areas can be unaware of this problem but this problem exists in the cities and in other urban areas.  It is not confined to Dublin city, as is the drug squad.  The problem is widespread throughout the urban areas and it will spread throughout the rural areas.  The Government should attack this problem.  They have proved that they can act in other things which benefit themselves but apparently they are unaware of what is necessary for the people.  A man or a young boy in the city can go along with mock psychiatric complaints to about 12 hospitals&mdash;there are 75 hospitals in the whole city and county administrative area&mdash;and get a repeat and a repeat of the prescription if he is well briefed on how to do it, as many people are.  The problem is now ready to explode.  Fianna Fáil know what explosions are like, particularly explosions in their faces.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there are not sufficient <Col N="2803" /> facilities for people to burn up their energy.  About 50 or 100 years ago people worked 70 hours a week and their average life span was 40 years. Now, their average life span is 70 years and they are working an average of 40 hours a week.  How are they spending their leisure time?  If the middle-aged are spending their leisure time in pubs, how are the teenagers spending their leisure time?  Over the past ten years there has been no organised recreational planning by the Government. The pathetic £100,000 which is given to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education is more in the line of an insult than an indication of a sincere desire to try to combat this situation.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Fianna Fáil Party's thinking they can hoodwink the public into believing they are magnificent republicans.  The flash visit by the Minister for External Affairs to Belfast when he stuck out his chest for a couple of hours and walked around a few streets there bears no comparison to what Labour Party Deputies and Fine Gael Deputies were doing when times were rough and when the bullets were flying.  The Minister for External Affairs came back here and reported that he had spoken with a number of people who were of the opinion that things were not going too well up there.  This type of con man effort is no longer going down with the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I want to see social welfare benefits increased for the needy sections of the population but neither this Government nor any Government should try to buy patriotism purely by coaxing people in this manner.  The sooner that party over there cease to believe they have the monopoly of patriots in this country, the better it will be because this party here and the Labour Party over there have their share of patriots.</P>
    <P>I wish to voice a protest on behalf of the Garda and the Army against the unfortunate way in which their increases have been introduced; the unfortunate way in which overtime was denied to the detectives; the unfortunate way in which gardaí were apparently discouraged from overtime when off duty.  We are heading for economic <Col N="2804" /> disaster.  The 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax in the last Budget has put the kybosh on everything.  We are really there.  We are on the slippery slope of inflation.  Our last hope possibly is a prolongation of the bank strike.  This could have some effect. The British dock strike is now ending and we shall see the margin expanding between our exports and imports from Britain.  We are now in dire trouble and we are not taking the proper steps to get out of it.  Certainly the purely political Budget introduced some time ago was no help in this regard.  Whatever steps are necessary and have been advised to the Government should be taken without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The past year will go down in history as one of the most turbulent, if not the most turbulent, in the political life of this country.  It is not easy to assess the various causes for it.  The inflationary trends were brought about by the fact that much too much money is in the hands of certain sections of our people and that has created purchasing power and the expenditure of money on goods, which are not always produced in this country. I have repeatedly said that the Labour Party, with its great trade union backing, could help considerably here.  Deputy Keating implied that Fianna Fáil is dishonest.  He spoke of the inaction of Fianna Fáil.  How blind can a person be when he does not want to see?  This is particularly the case of Deputy Keating in his utterances here today.  All too often I have found throughout the country but particularly in Dublin that when one asks in shops for Irish manufactured goods the shops have not got them in stock.  We have Irish labour, trade union labour, stating across the counter, that those materials are not stocked.  This is a disgraceful situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a disastrous state of affairs when people, who are highly paid in their own right, can ignore the rights of other people, even of members of their own trade unions working in other parts of the country.  Members of their trade unions here in Dublin could help them by putting their goods on the counter.  One of the first duties of the Labour Party here is to develop <Col N="2805" /> that spirit.  We have heard all too often that £1 more spent by each housewife on Irish goods would reduce our commitments abroad and give work to so many more thousands of Irish workers. Still, this is continually ignored for one reason or another.  The shameful part trade unionism is playing in the development of our own resources will go down in history.  The poorer section of the community and the people on the west coast need all the help that can be given to them in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton remarked that the country was without leadership and that that was the cause of our troubles. I would go along with him to a certain extent but not to the point he is aiming at.  Every effort has been made from the Fianna Fáil side and, indeed, by the Taoiseach to try to lead the country on the proper track, towards the development of all our resources and towards the provision of jobs for our people here.  All too often the people on the far side of the House spend their time decrying every effort made. This is where leadership should spring from.  It should spring from within the body of this Chamber.  This leadership should be backed by all sections of the House.  This is the only way we can have real leadership where the nation is concerned.  This does not happen.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the people on the far side of the House decrying the Government and the Ministers concerned for not bringing the cement strike to an end.  The only way it could be brought to an end would be by giving in to the demands.  If that policy were followed, if the Government intervened in every strike&mdash;and this is what the people across the floor of the House evidently want&mdash;we would reach a stage where we would bring to a stop the momentum we have achieved in the development of our economy. The only straight course to be adopted would be authority backed up by all parties to deal with strikes and the strike trouble that is enveloping the nation.  We seem to be continuously in and out of strikes, with increasing costs making it impossible for our products to be sold on foreign markets. This is a very serious position, indeed, <Col N="2806" /> and it must be corrected.  It cannot be corrected at the moment.  The strike must be left to wear itself out.  The people opposite are not prepared to face up to the responsibility of trying to help to guide the nation's efforts along a really productive path and to help all sections of our people.</P>
    <P>References were made from the Labour benches to the difficulties our farmers will have to face up to when we enter the Common Market.  This has been referred to time and time again in this House.  I have stated previously that I spent two years in Europe.  I believe that the greatest opportunities will be available to us in this European market.  It has been said that only the very big farmers, the farmers with large tracts of land, can survive in Europe.  This is a point of view with which I have never agreed.  By and large I failed to find that there are large numbers of big farmers in Europe.  The Belgians and the Dutch are very small farmers.  The German farmers are small farmers with the exception of some very big estates which are owned by the overlords there.  Usually they are not fertile estates.  They grow trees on the more barren soil.  The small farmers in Germany are not any bigger than most of our farmers.</P>
    <P>I believe our farmers will be able to hold their own against any competition that may arise in Europe.  I have said here before that we have assets no European country has.  We have an abundance of grassland which can be developed to help to produce beef on the hoof.  This is the cheapest method of producing it.  The European farmers have to house their animals all the time because of the severe winter frost and snow and the great heat in the summer.  Therefore everything has to be grown and they have to be hand fed.</P>
    <P>I have used every means in my power to nail this idea that is put around our country that our farmers have no chance of competing with the people who make up the Common Market.  The Danes are not afraid of it, nor are the Belgians and the Dutch. Their farms are no larger than our <Col N="2807" /> own, and in many cases they are smaller.  Our people have the energy and the ability to compete with the best.  I should like to see every party in this House backing that idea.  This is the way I think things will shape. Our smaller farmers with their tidy farms and their method of farmyard production will be in a position to stand up to any competition they will have to face in Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne commented that no effort was being made by Fianna Fáil to help the rural section of our people. The next moment he said that the great social Fianna Fáil Party do not know what socialism means.  He said we were not helping the people in the rural areas and the next moment he referred to the great social Fianna Fáil Party. It is quite true that Fianna Fáil have always been the social party in this country and the votes of the people up and down the country have consistently upheld that point of view.</P>
    <P>We have heard members of the Opposition say that the Government should get out; that they have not the confidence of the people.  All too often we have heard that said but when we have been out we have been put in again.  No doubt if we go out tomorrow morning or in two years time or at the end of the term we shall be put back again as we always have been.</P>

      <P>I am very much in touch with the people and I know that this is the position and, for the benefit of the Opposition, let me say that we as a party shall run the length of the term.  That is how we see it and how it will be and that can be accepted by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The northern problem is the most difficult one we face.  There are many lines of thought about it and about the action that should be taken.  One thing is definite; it is not the intention of anybody in the country or in this House to bring about a position where we would have to attack the people in the north.  There is no reason why we should do that.  They are our own <Col N="2808" /> people irrespective of their religion or frame of mind.  This does not mean that we should abandon any type of pressure we can use on the British Government and the British forces to get out of our country.  I think this is where the views emanating from this House have gone astray.  We have stated consistently that we are not to attack the north and this is a quite acceptable view&mdash;but, having clarified this, it behoves each one of us to use every means we possibly can to impress on Britain and the world that Britain must hand over the position which she is trying to control here and of which she is making such a mess.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the views held by Deputy Clinton that the British Conservative and Labour Parties are sick of the north and what is going on there and are very anxious to hand it over, this is not the impression I got in my two years there.  I am convinced that the British, with their imperialistic outlook and ideas of empire, will hold on to the last breath to this part of the north because the people who carried on the fight in 1916 put the first crack in their great empire.  The men who died for what we have today showed the way to the other countries.  I think she also has the view that, while she holds the north she holds what in her insular way she still regards as an empire of a kind.  If, at any stage, she agreed to relinquish the north she would be in trouble with Wales and Scotland.  She is well aware of this and it is one of the reasons why she will never relinquish control until we can exert sufficient pressure.  I think we should be trying to do this every day in every forum in the world from this House and from every crossroads where possible. We must maintain the type of pressure that will make it not worth while for Britain to continue subsidising the position in the north and causing trouble underneath.  This is something we must recognise in this House because it is what many people in the country think.  Many of them feel that not enough pressure is being exerted on Britain in regard to the north.</P>
    <P>The recent efforts by this infamous Scots regiment that had been pushed out of Germany because of two or <Col N="2809" /> three incidents there and put into Belfast should make clear to our people what we are faced with in the north.  Yesterday or the day before a colonel with a Saracen armoured car and a large number of troops surrounded a priest's house&mdash;another indication of the British attitude.  Surely the idea of sending armour and troops of that kind to the house of a clergyman was unnecessary and it bespeaks the thinking of the various British governments.  Their efforts last year in sending gunboats up the Caribbean to attack a defenceless people, not even a nation, is a further indication of their thinking which survives from 50 or 100 years ago and which is being applied to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The entire efforts of the House should be directed towards organising a trend of thought in this country that all sections and types of people must adopt the aim of impressing on the world and on Britain that we can no longer tolerate this position in Northern Ireland.  We cannot tolerate attacks on our unarmed and helpless people whether in the Bogside, Belfast, Newry or Armagh.  I was, I think, the first Deputy of this House to get into the north when the civil rights marches were on and I saw the intense feeling that prevailed there.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear again that in anything I say I am not suggesting the use of force.  This would get us nowhere. We do not want it, but we want to see everything the British Empire stands for removed from every inch of our soil because when one reads the Proclamation of 1916 in the hall here and studies it one realises what was in the souls of the men whose busts surround us in this Chamber pointing out the course we should take and the aims we should project from here.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think we are not putting across the ideals of those men to our own people and if we continue as we are, trying to placate the British by our expressions here, we are letting down the ideals for which those men died and we might as well turn their faces to the wall.  This is not, I think, what the Irish people want us to do but they need the lead that should be given by all sections of the <Col N="2810" /> House towards the solution of this problem which has created so much strife and so much confused thinking among our own people.  I hope when this time next year comes around and we are again facing the long recess this problem will be seen in a clearer light and that we shall be well on the road towards having this problem solved and better times for our people. Inflation has been enveloping us and if it is allowed to go on it could cripple the nation.  We have a vast programme of development.  Our exports have increased reasonably and will increase much more in the coming year if we can keep prices down.</P>
    <P>Our tourist trade has suffered not, as so many seem to think, as a result of the troubles that have arisen recently, but because of prices.  I have met many British people and they have complained of the charges made here, particularly for drinks.  Most Britishers book their three weeks' holiday as a package deal: they have paid for it before they come and they are satisfied at that stage.  It is the £30 or the £50 spent over and above that which, they complain they do not get value. One Englishman told me he paid 3s 4d for a Guinness in different places in my county and that he could get the same pint in Mooney's of the Strand in London for 2s 9d.  I think it requires our united efforts, including an effort by the Government, to reduce drink prices and to get the different bars and lounges to co-operate in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are, however, places in Kerry, such as Knocknagoshel and Castleisland where drinks are more reasonable. I have heard some of our members who attended a football match in Askeaton saying they could get a pint there for 2s 8d.  If a pint can be had for 2s 8d in these places there is something wrong if 3s or 3s 2d is charged in other areas.  This is what is murdering our tourist trade.  The men who frequent the public houses here are the same men who go to public houses in Britain and they can spread this disastrous news&mdash;if I may use the term in this context &mdash; far and wide to the detriment of our economy and our tourist trade.  Something should be done to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ask particularly <Col N="2811" /> the Labour Party to use every effort to ensure that the trade unionists they represent would encourage the sale of Irish goods.  This should not be a difficult job but here in Dublin there are some shops where Irish goods cannot be bought.  Seven or eight years ago there was great publicity about this and many shops in Grafton street had a notice to the effect that the most discerning Deputies in Dáil Éireann could get Irish goods in their shops.  It was one shop which was responsible for this, but then some shops&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To answer the comment made by Deputy O'Connor about the necessity to impress on trade unionists that they should sell only Irish goods, might I remind him that the trade unionists working in the shops have no choice in the type of goods they sell.  He and his friends in the Fianna Fáil Party should speak to the capitalist-owners of these shops and ask them not to take advantage of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which his party signed a few years ago and which is operating so well that it is now almost impossible to buy Irish goods, particularly articles of clothing and footwear, in this city or in many other parts of the country.  The reason is that, as the tariffs dropped and British goods became cheaper, the owners of the shops took advantage of the extra profit they could reap, and there is nothing trade unionists can do about it.  I quite agree with Deputy O'Connor it is a shameful thing that people in this country, in order to save a few shillings, are buying non-Irish goods in preference to better-class Irish goods.  It is not the trade unionists' fault, it is the fault of those who stock the shops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been put off what I intended to say but I am sure I shall catch up on it.  The Taoiseach, when he opened this debate on Tuesday evening, said he intended to deal with three major points which he felt were of interest to the country and should be dealt with.  He dealt with them, as he said, not in any particular order but just as they came to his mind: inflation, industrial relations and the Six Counties, which I think he called Northern Ireland.  I do not have to remind him that the most northern part of Northern Ireland is in the Republic and if he wants to refer to the Six Counties as Northern Ireland he might refer to that as the Six North Eastern Counties: they are certainly not Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as inflation is concerned, he seemed to forget that inflation has been in the main caused by the action of the Fianna Fáil Government, or has he forgotten the Budget of a short time ago which induced rapid inflation here because of the way in which prices rocketed, and therefore wages had to go up after prices?  I was amused to <Col N="2813" /> hear the Minister for Finance talking about inflation and the way it should be dealt with, he having just recently vacated the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce on whose shoulders rested the obligation to keep down prices but who made no effort to do so.  Then he came along into Finance and he now wants the assistance of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Joe Brennan, and one or two other Ministers to lecture the workers of this country on the necessity to refrain from looking for higher wages because it will affect the economy of the country. Surely the first thing that must be done is that somebody must make an effort to keep prices at a reasonable level. If this Government will not do it, somebody else will.  It is obvious from what has been said here that a build-up has occurred now to try to give the impression that the inflation which we all know is rampant in the country has been caused by trade unionists looking for more wages than they were entitled to.  Surely it is obvious that the reason why they looked for higher wages was that they could not live on the wages they were getting.  The standard of wages in this country has been too low.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Haughey, then Minister for Finance, attempted to do something which was subsequently destroyed by others.  He attempted to bring in an increase in wages for lower paid workers.  People who could by no means be called lower paid workers, and, indeed, they might not be called workers if we were very strict about it, insisted on getting the same amount of interim increase which was used to bring the lower paid workers up so that they would have more in their pockets.  Instead of the gap narrowing last year it, in fact, widened because while the lower paid workers got an increase of £1 5s from June and £1 from October, a 4 per cent increase was given to a large number of very well paid people with the result that they got £3, £4 and £5 a week.  This is the nonsense that is going on and, of course, the ordinary workers are blamed for what happens and everybody, at least everybody who is a <Col N="2814" /> Fianna Fáil supporter, says that the workers are destroying the economy and pricing us out of the market by looking for too much money.</P>
    <P>An example of this was the strike which occurred in Cement Ltd.  This strike, whether we agree with it or not, contained one important factor.  These people felt they were being badly paid, they were working for a firm that was making a hefty profit.  After a very lengthy dispute an increase was granted. Cement Ltd., despite the Taoiseach's earlier statement that he would limit increases in prices to 7 per cent, succeeded in tricking the Government in such a way that they agreed to a higher rate and the result was that Cement Ltd., having got an increase of 15s per ton earlier in the year, got a further 16/- after the strike.  If anybody wants to know who got most out of the cement strike, the answer is Cement Ltd.  They got more out of it than the people who were on strike for weeks.</P>
    <P>Now we have the bank strike and the Minister for Labour here this evening spoke about the ridiculous situation of these fellows and girls who are working in the banks not accepting a recommendation from the Labour Court; it should be accepted; it was a good offer and he most certainly would not come in to try to settle it. Let me say to the House that the Minister for Labour will swallow those words before the bank strike is settled because eventually I believe he must come in one it and if he insists that the strike which, in effect, was a lock-out is going to be settled, there must be compensation for those who were locked out and if there is not going to be compensation for the workers it is surely reasonable to ask that no interest will be charged by the banks for the services which they did not give.  They cannot have it both ways. They did the last time charge interest on overdrafts, on cheques which were cashed during the period, just the same as if the banks had been opened and they got away with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And they got interest on investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They had invested money <Col N="2815" /> that could not be drawn from the banks and made sure they had invested it well and now they think they will do the same again.  If they say the workers are not entitled to be paid for the period that they, the employers, locked them out, then they should not charge interest on the money which is locked up.</P>
      <P>We have heard much about an incomes policy.  When members of Fianna Fáil talk about an incomes policy they talk about it as if it was a wage standstill.  They say that if we are to tie prices we must tie wages. What about profits and dividends? Surely they must understand that the cost of putting up articles contains, as well as an element for wages, an element for profits.  It does not matter whether people use the trick of doubling the share capital, whether they pay it out of the dividend or any other way, the Government must understand that they cannot allow wealthy people who are investing in firms to continue to draw high rates while the workers have their wages tied at a relatively low scale.  One hears people saying that extra money given in wages causes a lot of trouble in many ways including an increase in the external adverse trade balance as if every worker who got £2 10s a week increase went out and bought a Mercedes or some foreign piece of machinery. They must know that the people who are doing that are not the workers. The increase they have got has in many cases been spent.  Their wives and their children need the money in order to live as well as they did last year.  It is ridiculous to suggest that we can have an incomes policy simply by tying wages and nothing else.  If there is to be an incomes policy we want to know whether professional fees, profits and so on, are going to be tied as well as wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the troubles with this Government is that they have no policy whatever on inflation, on incomes, on finance of any kind.  They are trundling along from day to day.  If they have no policy, how do they expect the country to follow the lead which they are not giving?  It was interesting <Col N="2816" /> to read the report of the Central Bank. Some of it seems to be pretty accurate; some of it is just wishful thinking.  They admit that the drop in the adverse trade balance is due to a certain extent to the cement strike, that the money was not there, the workers had not got it. They also grudgingly admit that there is slight inflation caused by the bank strike.  Do we not know that because of the cement strike not only the cement workers but many of the building workers of this country had not enough money to buy what they needed to feed their families for a period?  Is it not true that people who have no money are now living in the lap of luxury because of the bank strike?</P>
    <P>Is it not true that money is being spent right, left and centre, not by the people affected by the cement strike but by a different type who are, in fact, causing the inflation?  A different type of people are living high and the reckoning will be a pretty grim one when the bank strike is over.  If the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance want to do something about this crisis, they should not wait until the 28th October when we can discuss this matter again.  They should try to bring it to an end now.  It must be ended some time and, if they cannot do it, I do not know how it is going to finish up.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the trouble caused by strikes over the past few years and particularly in the past 12 months.  The theme now seems to be that the trade unions had better do something &ldquo;or else.&rdquo;  I do not know how far the Government want to go with this but when they talk about the number of man days lost as a result of strikes let them pause and look at the number of man days lost by people who could not get jobs. They will find that the strikes, whether they are official or unofficial, are not the biggest curse of the country but the Government who have failed in their responsibility to provide employment for those who need it.</P>
    <P>I was appalled a few weeks ago to hear the Minister for Labour talking about the necessity to bring back from Britain people who would be required here for industry.  When I asked him <Col N="2817" /> why he could not try to put some of the 60,000 people who are unemployed into these jobs, his reply was that they would not be suitable for the jobs, that they would not be suitable for training for them.  In other words, he was saying that we have 60,000 unemployables. We have 60,000 people who have not got jobs because they are not fit for jobs.  Yet we hear this talk about &ldquo;come back to Erin&rdquo;, bring back people from Britain to jobs that are supposed to be here.  The Government should wake up to reality.  The position is that they just do not know what is going on and, perhaps, I cannot blame them because they have been interested in other things and they have not got the time to look at mundane matters such as some 60,000 people out of jobs.</P>
    <P>The question of prices has been raised here and whether they had gone up as much here as they had elsewhere. I have a small table here from which I will quote and leave it at that. Between 1963 and 1969 consumer prices have gone up in this country by 35 per cent; in Belgium by 26 per cent; in France by 26 per cent; Germany by 16 per cent; Norway by 28 per cent and in the United Kingdom by 30 per cent.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might like to explain why this has happened.</P>
    <P>We heard rumours about remedial measures that are to be taken to prevent inflation from getting worse.  In his opening address the Taoiseach devoted quite some time to this matter. When the Finance Bill was being discussed I asked the Minister for Finance if he proposed to change the system of taxation and, if he did, in what way he proposed to do it.  Did he propose to impose the added value tax and if he did was it going to be in substitution for the taxes we have already, the turnover tax and the wholesale tax, or was there some other suggestion? He said that they were just thinking about it.  It had been mentioned in the Budget and it would probably be introduced some time next year if they could work it out, but they were very vague about it and he could not tell me very much.  Eventually, he told me that he thought it would be in substitution for the two taxes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2818" /> I was rather surprised to find, a couple of days later, that he could go into great detail in the other House about how the added value tax would operate, the fact that it was going to operate, the date on which it was going to operate, and all the trimmings. Was it because the Minister felt that the ladies and gentlemen in the other House would treat him more gently than the people here, or what was the reason that we did not get the details here?  I suggest it was a gross discourtesy on his part to allow the Finance Bill to pass through the House without giving us the details which he had and which he denied he had.  This, of course, is the sort of thing to which we have become accustomed.  At least it was mentioned in the Seanad. Usually, as a previous Member used say, such things would be announced at some dog fight or dinner.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may also be able to answer another question.  On today's Order Paper Deputy Dr. O'Donovan was told that our gold reserves were transferred.  They had been £28,236,000 12 months ago and are now £303,000. There was some suggestion that £11 million was still available in some way or other, but it does now appear as if, as somebody said recently, gold is no longer of any use and we must get rid of it before it goes out of date.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were asked here and a number of statements made by Ministers and others about the Six Counties.  This is such an important matter that I must comment on it.  The reason I want to comment is that I heard two former Ministers making statements here and I should be glad to hear the Taoiseach answering some of the very pertinent questions they put. I do not want to transgress the Chair's rulings and I know that the Chair will call me to order if I start talking about court cases or of High Court judges so I will have to skate around the edges.  It is true that we did have what we call a crisis and what the Fianna Fáil Party call a slight dispute in the Government party some months ago. As a result, one Minister resigned, one Parliamentary Secretary resigned and two Ministers were removed from office in, as one of the ex-Ministers <Col N="2819" /> said, the small hours of the morning, in a hurried rush to the Park.</P>
    <P>Subsequently the court decided that the reason the Taoiseach gave for having one of the Ministers dismissed was incorrect and the Deputy is a free man and came in here yesterday and spoke, as he had a right to do.  One of the other Ministers also addressed the House this morning.  They appear to be in this position that Fianna Fáil, who down through the years have claimed that there was no danger at any time of a split in the party, have now reached the stage where the party seems to be split from stem to stern.</P>
    <P>If anybody wants to know whether or not the party is split, all he has to do is sit in this House and count those who speak in the House and those who do not.  We hope that it is not the House for which they have the contempt but they do have the contempt for somebody because 11 or 12, or, perhaps, 13 would be a better figure, of those people who have refrained from taking part in the deliberations of the Dáil for quite some time.  Some country Deputies will probably know that in the spring of the year when the cuckoo arrives he usually flies around with a small bird in tow, just a few yards away from him.  That bird is always with him for some extraordinary reason.  In this House we have had the phenomenon since this dispute started, of having one, two or three ex-Ministers floating around the House, as they are entitled to do, with a number of rather large birds fairly close beside them.  I do not know whether they keep their hands in their pockets because bodyguards do, whether they are determined to ensure that nobody attacks their favourite sons while they are around, but the situation has become so laughable now that one never finds one of these but the other is sure to be there.  In fact, if one is going through a narrow doorway, one must wait until the procession passes through, right round and round the House and out on the lawn where, someone said today, the Letterkenny Parliament meets regularly unless the aeroplanes make too much noise.  Apparently aircraft disturb the proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2820" /> How, in the name of all that is good and holy, can the Tánaiste insist that this is a united party?  On television, here and elsewhere the Tánaiste keeps on insisting on the unity of the party. How we can have unity in a party. when these people will not even sit in the same benches with front bench members of the Government is something that puzzles me.  The situation has, in fact, now reached the stage at which two of them came in here last night and today and attacked the Government and Government policy roundly.  One of them today&mdash;I suppose because of the fact that he is not in the habit of using bad language&mdash; did not use bad language; but for that, he would have called the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste some very rude names indeed, particularly the Tánaiste whose television appearance he described in such lurid terms, tearing to rags, to very tatters, what he is supposed to have said or not said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>How can we have a Government in whom, according to themselves, the people can repose confidence when, at the same time, we have almost half those elected at daggers drawn, to say nothing of the architect-in-chief of the Party's victory; I refer to Deputy Kevin Boland who so gerrymandered constituencies, with the connivance of the Taoiseach and other Ministers, that they achieved the impossible and had a Fianna Fáil Government returned here again.  These people are now condemning the Government openly in this House.  God knows what they say about them outside it.  This is the ludicrous situation we have, with people standing up in the Fianna Fáil benches saying Fianna Fáil is a united party, and never more united than they are now.  If that is the case then there must have been some really terrible rows in Fianna Fáil in the past.</P>
    <P>You have the Taoiseach making statements about the north.  He made one on television just before 12th July.  I have no objection at all to listening to someone making a statement provided I consider the statement will do some good, but when I sat down before the television set and heard the Taoiseach sanely and soberly addressing the British Government through a <Col N="2821" /> television station that does not reach much further than Drogheda, and certainly does not go across the Irish Sea, I thought it was just too silly for words. Might I suggest to the Taoiseach that, if he is really serious about getting across to the people in the Six Counties what we think about them and how we operate, a few extra kilowatts of power in the station, which would beam up a little further to the north, might do a very good job?  Maybe then he could talk to our separated brethren.</P>
    <P>As things stand it is all a little foolish unless he knew, as he did, that the morning newspapers and the radio would carry a report of everything he said.  That is the process now: get it on television and, no matter how stupid it is, it will get the headlines the next day.  We had the Taoiseach for the sixth time&mdash;I kept the count&mdash; coming along and saying what his idea was as to how we should settle the problem of the Six Counties, this north/south problem.  The only thing wrong was that, with the exception of a few similarities, all the statements were different.  All had new ideas.  The really extraordinary thing is that the Taoiseach apparently feels that, if he makes a statement, all he need do then is sit back; he does not have to follow it up or suggest how things should operate.  Make a statement, have it widely publicised, sit back and everybody should be happy. If he waits to solve the problem of the Border in that way he will wait a very long time.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor talked about being the first man into the north after the row.  I come much closer to the Border than Deputy O'Connor does. I have been backwards and forwards through the north as often, or oftener, than a great many people here, with the exception of one or two from Donegal.  If we want to solve the problem of the Border the first thing we must realise is that the Six Counties of north eastern Ireland are at present an embarrassment to the British Government.</P>

      <P>They are held only because successive British Governments have got the idea that they just cannot <Col N="2822" /> let down these people who have shown their love for Britain over the years. But the people there do not love Britain.  The Orangemen in the north no more want Britain than we do. They only want here money and they know darn well that we in the south have never put forward any kind of policy which would allow us to replace the British money going in there; and they know darn well that if, tomorrow morning, the Republic took over the Six Counties automatically the standard of living would drop, mass unemployment would be rife, health services would become much dearer and they would have to pay for things for which they do not have to pay now.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose anyone thinks we could make this change overnight, but we are making no plans which would suggest that we have even the remotest idea of ever dealing with the problem.  We make statements and get publicity for them and expect the people to swallow them, hook, line and sinker.  The Taoiseach says&mdash;I agree with him&mdash;that the Border can only be removed by peaceful means and any head case in this House, or outside it, who believes we can attack the people in the north, attack our enemies who are, in fact, our brothers and sisters, in an effort to free Ireland just does not know what he is talking about.</P>

      <P>I was amazed listening to two gentlemen who are in the party but not of it, or something like that, saying that they believed with us and with the Taoiseach that there should be a peaceful solution to the Border but certain people should be allowed to carry arms for defence.  Logically then the police and everybody else should carry arms.  If we have no arms we cannot cause trouble.  If we say we have arms we will have a right good row on our hands.  I presume that what they meant was &ldquo;Walk softly, but carry a big stick&rdquo;.  This kind of attitude towards the people of the Six Counties is the one thing likely to drive them mad, this idea that we are just waiting,  Big Brother across the Border: so long as you behave, all <Col N="2823" /> right, but, if you do not behave, we will do something about it.  They know darn well, just as well as we know, and as the Taoiseach knew when he made his statements, that there is nothing we can do.  We could possibly take and hold Derry against very strong odds. What about Belfast?  What would happen in Belfast if an effort were made at any time to cross the Border? Let us be reasonable about this and not make fools of ourselves.  We have to negotiate a settlement and we have to draw up terms under which we can negotiate before we can expect these people to talk to us.</P>
      <P>I agree with statements made by people on both sides that the Taoiseach apparently believes this is an Irish question.  It is not an Irish question. This problem was introduced by the British Government and we cannot remove it without the British Government changing their attitude.  I believe that the Six Counties are an embarrassment to Britain and that she would love to get rid of this problem.  It has been said that it would give the people of Wales and Scotland an opportunity to kick up a row but it should be understood that our country is an island and as far as we are concerned we owe no allegiance and have nothing in common with the people in the neighbouring island.  If they want freedom let them have it but they are part of the same land mass.  We have a different right to freedom and we should ensure that we use that right in our own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about this question of British occupation of the six north-eastern counties is that we are trying to do several things together. On the one hand we say that we hate Britain because she is occupying the Six Counties.  I was amazed and surprised to hear Deputy Boland say in effect that we do not want the British soldiers in Northern Ireland but if they were not there there would have been much bloodshed a few weeks ago.  We are in the awkward position that we want them and we do not want them. While we hate the British because of the north, we love them because of trade.  We hate the British because we feel they are not treating us fairly in <Col N="2824" /> regard to the north but we love them for giving employment to many thousands of Irish people.</P>
    <P>We have reached an absurd point in regard to the EEC.  The Minister for External Affairs made a comment in Luxembourg to the effect that our special trading arrangements with Britain would have to be taken into consideration.  I imagine that statement was made for home consumption because the Minister is aware that, so far as trade relations are concerned, regulations are laid down by the Treaties of Rome and Paris and we cannot evade the regulations.  The issuing of nice statements such as that made by the Minister for the purpose of having them published in Ireland is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the Taoiseach when he is speaking here seems to think the country is doing very well.  I have already tried to point out how badly I think it is doing.  Unless the Government pull up their socks we shall be in serious trouble.  The statement made by the Taoiseach on 11th July in a television interview that the country was on the brink of a great achievement has caused much confusion in the minds of many people.  We have been searching for evidence of this great achievement but to no avail.  If the Taoiseach said that the country was on the brink of a disaster he would be much closer to the truth.</P>
    <P>We have been making arrangements to negotiate for entry into the EEC and as we have already had a long debate on this matter I do not propose to discuss it again.  On the 21st September we will be negotiating with the EEC representatives.  The Taoiseach has announced that he proposes to adjourn the Dáil until the 28th October, so the position will obtain that whether our negotiators succeed or fail, whether the discussions require consideration, the negotiators will not be able to consult the Dáil.  The Taoiseach will probably say that they will consult the Government but who are the Government?  I should like to know who is in control of Fianna Fáil.  I have been counting heads and, quite frankly, were I in the Taoiseach's position I should be unhappy.  We will <Col N="2825" /> know tonight who controls Fianna Fáil for this period at any rate.</P>
    <P>In my opinion Deputy Haughey was a good Minister for Finance; he might be anything else after that but he was an efficient Minister.  Deputy Blaney was a hard-working Minister; I disagreed with him perhaps more than anybody else in this House but he did his homework. Deputy Boland could talk for hours and hours and must be a hard-working man to have collected all the information he repeated in this House. These were men the Taoiseach and his predecessor had selected &mdash; the men who were described as &ldquo;dynamic,&rdquo; These men have now been replaced by others who appear to be rather thirdrate&mdash;I would not even say second-rate&mdash;and they are the people who are supposed to be running this country. However, if one listens to whispers in the corridors it would appear that they may not be getting all their own way. I do not like to make personal attacks but I must point out that we have as Minister for Justice a man whose love for the gardaí was well known before he became Minister.  We know of his relations with the gardaí particularly in his own area, and he is now in control of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I would assume that the Minister for Local Government is in charge of everything dealing with local government, including the settlement of itinerants. Yet, he disliked them so much that he was responsible for a new word in the English language, Rahoonism. We have the Minister for Agriculture; his fellow-Ministers seem to think he was responsible for informing on them to the Taoiseach when the big dispute occurred.</P>
    <P>We have those people whom the Taoiseach has said are loyal to the Fianna Fáil Party and, in fact, he objected very strongly when Deputy Corish said they were a junta.  I interrupted to say that they were not a junta but were two juntas.  There are two distinct parties now: the people who think they are the republicans, whose wounds bleed when anyone speaks about the Six Counties and there are the people of Fianna Fáil with the words Republican Party in brackets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2826" /> We have had enough of this outfit and the Taoiseach must realise that his position has become impossible.  He must realise that while this evening and on other evenings these people may troop through the lobby and vote on his side they are not voting for him or for Fianna Fáil but are merely voting for self-preservation.  As Deputy Lenihan, the Minister for Transport and Power, said some time ago. &ldquo;The name of the game is survival.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While the Dáil is in recess the Taoiseach will be left to the tender mercies of the people I have just described.  He will be expected to look after the affairs of the country and ensure that we do not meet such an economic storm in the meantime that the ship will have floundered before 28th October.  This is not just political claptrap.  The fact that today in this House we reintroduced a Bill for the purpose of ensuring that squatters would not be thrown out if they are relatives of the person who owned the house indicates just how bad is the housing position.  No matter in which direction the Taoiseach looks he sees no friends but political enemies because of the fact that the Government he is supposed to be leading have made a mess of everything.</P>

      <P>In his opening statement on this immensely important debate, the Taoiseach indicated to this House and to the nation that the ship of State was certainly on a crash course. Having indicated the rocks upon which the ship of State was about to perish&mdash; the rocks of inflation, of industrial relations chaos and of national disunity&mdash;the captain of the national ship says to the crew of the ship &mdash; the members of Dáil Éireann&mdash;&ldquo;Abandon ship.  Jump overboard.  Forget all about it for the next three months.&rdquo;  Was there ever, in the history of democratic government in any State, such gross irresponsibility as to wait until the day on which the head of the Government is asking Parliament to go away for three months to issue warnings of inevitable national ruination from matters <Col N="2827" /> such as inflation and industrial relations which are directly within Government control or directly within the control of Parliament so long as it is given the necessary leadership? Was it responsible to say, at the most sensitive time in our national life concerning national unity, that we should go away without any right in the elected representatives of the Irish people to meet if the situation should warrant it?  Not only has the captain told the crew to jump overboard but he is now faced with the great difficulty that some of the people whom he would like to see sink refuse to sink and keep bobbing up, causing him continual and perpetual embarrassment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that situation, what have we from the sinking ship?  We have from the Taoiseach himself, on this beleagured bridge, a sermon on brotherly love with which nobody can disagree.  We have from him a lecture on the economic theory of inflation. We have from him threats to the wage-earners and the income-earners in the community.  We have all this at the conclusion of a time during which this sovereign Parliament of the Irish nation has been unable to discuss what most of the Members wanted to discuss because the Taoiseach was afraid of what might be said by the former members of his own Cabinet whom he had commended to us last year as Ministers and whom he has now dismissed or caused to resign either willingly or unwillingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is not a man given to irritation or passionate or angry out burst.  In recent weeks we heard him <Col N="2828" /> assert with fierce denial that it was not because he was afraid of what his erstwhile Ministers would say that he would not have a debate on Northern Ireland.  We see now that his denials were empty&mdash;I do not want to say they were dishonest.  He knew, as he uttered them, that that was the real reason why he would not have a debate in this House on that subject.  Nothing was said from the Fine Gael or Labour benches to cause the unity of the Irish people to suffer in any way.  However, a great deal was said by former Ministers, whom the Taoiseach had recommended to this House a year ago, to postpone the date of the eventual unity of this nation.</P>
    <P>It is not without some great significance that, amongst the 16 motions on the Order Paper of this Dáil&mdash; Private Members' motions which have not been discussed because the Taoiseach and the Government refused to allow time to discuss them&mdash;stands a motion which calls upon Dáil Éireann formally to reject the use of force as an instrument to secure the unity of Ireland.  When the Fine Gael Party tabled that resolution, they desired that it should be taken in conjunction with the debate we had last October dealing with the difficulties which had arisen in the North of Ireland.  The Taoiseach took umbrage that the Fine Gael Party should interfere with what he hoped would be a convenient debate by tabling such a resolution. We tabled it so that all people resident on this island might know that this Parliament, representing the people of Ireland, did not wish to use force as an instrument to secure the unity of Ireland.  The present Taoiseach, and he alone, is responsible for preventing this Dáil from putting on record its rejection of the use of force.  We want to see that resolution put before the Dáil and voted upon by every Member of the Dáil so that our people&mdash;all our people &mdash; will know, when we stand up and are counted in the lobbies, who is for and who is against the use of force.</P>
    <P>Just as he did not wish to have a debate on the matter lest the people on whom he is depending for support should be identified for what they are, so the Taoiseach does not wish to <Col N="2829" /> have that resolution discussed or voted upon in this House.  Then he goes on radio and television to deliver pious remarks about brotherly love.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here today by one of the Taoiseach's former Ministers to the Committee on the Constitution which discussed and then made its recommendations on the Constitution in December, 1967.  I wish to refer to that report which has now, unfortunately, been forgotten and upon which the Government have taken no action whatsoever.  The first and most important recommendation of that commission was that we would amend the Constitution by removing from it any presumptuous claim to exercise, from this Parliament, rights over a part of Ireland not at present within our jurisdiction and to replace it with a resolution&mdash;which the Opposition in this Dáil are able, unanimously, to subscribe to &mdash; namely, that the Irish nation hereby proclaims its firm will that its territory be reunited in harmony and brotherly affection between all Irishmen.</P>
    <P>It was from Deputy Boland, speaking here today on behalf of the 12 members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; one-sixth of the total membership of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party&mdash; that we heard his opposition to the insertion into our Constitution of a declaration of a desire to reunite Ireland in harmony and brotherly affection.  It is upon these 12 people&mdash; who are not prepared to subscribe to doctrines of harmony and brotherly affection&mdash;that the Taoiseach and the present Government rely for their continuation in office.  Were ever a Government so unworthily in office?</P>
    <P>In 1967, the Committee on the Constitution also recommended that a specified number of Members of the Oireachtas would have the right to require the President to convene meetings of the Dáil or Seanad.  The Government have had three years in which to bring forward that reasonable amendment to our Constitution. They have refused that amendment. They have refused to give that right which is in existence in most democratic Constitutions.  They were unwilling to allow the Opposition to convene <Col N="2830" /> a meeting of the Dáil or to order its business.</P>
    <P>When people complain, as they have every right to complain, and when the mass media complain, as they are quite justified in complaining, that Dáil Éireann is becoming irrelevant, let it be understood that it is only because the business of this House is ordered by the Taoiseach and the Government of the day and not because, we representing the people, do not want to have debated here the very issues which are exercising the minds of the people and causing them to take to the streets.</P>
    <P>The 1967 Committee on the Constitution also recommended that, when constituencies were being drawn up, the boundaries should be determined by an independent commission.  That was offered in a gross and unworthy package deal two years ago, together with a proposal to abolish proportional representation, the very thing which because we have it here, gives us some degree of justice, and because it is absent in the North of Ireland has a régime of tyranny and failure in existence there.  That was refused.</P>
    <P>Who criticised today the offering of package deals in referenda?  Deputy Kevin Boland.  When he was Minister for Local Government he spent hours and days insisting upon having package deals to combine an unanimously agreed recommendation with a proposal which had not the support of even one member of the Committee on the Constitution.  He opposed an amendment by Deputy Fitzpatrick on behalf of Fine Gael to make them separate issues.</P>
    <P>The 1967 Committee on the Constitution also urged that there should be an amendment to the Constitution which would do away with the hypocritical position we have here at present under which this State continues to operate under an assumed state of emergency, under which many of the fundamental rights of people may be suspended, and under which many Articles of the Constitution may be declared by Government order not to apply.</P>
    <P>When we are now about to go into <Col N="2831" /> recess, forced upon us by the Government, we have the Taoiseach issuing threats to every wage earner in the community, to everybody who earns an income in the community, to everybody involved in industrial relations in the community, to every shopkeeper in the community.  People may be inclined to feel that they can wait until October or November before those threats can have any meaningful application to their affairs, but the reality is that, because we are still living under an assumed emergency, by a vote of the Dáil and the Seanad in 1941, all the Government require is for the Dáil and Seanad to go into recess and then to make multitudinous emergency powers orders restricting incomes, interfering in commerce, and generally doing what they have not got the courage to propose here in the national Parliament. This arises out of their neglect to amend the Constitution which 2½ years ago all parties agreed to be amended.</P>
    <P>The 1967 Committee on the Constitution also recommended that we should repeal that section of the Constitution which causes so much unnecessary offence, Article 41.3º which provides that no law shall be passed providing for the dissolution of a marriage.  I said in Galway some months ago, and I say again, that the provisions in our Constitution against the dissolution of marriage go far beyond what is required by the tenets of the religion held by the majority of our people.  Not only do they offend against Catholic principles but they are also entirely in conflict with the fundamental rights of all our citizens.  Again it is well to remember that the members of the 1967 Committee on the Constitution were unanimous in thinking that that objectionable section should be repealed.  Nothing has since been done about it.</P>
    <P>The 1967 Committee on the Constitution unanimously called for the removal of the constitutional recognition of the special position of the Catholic Church and also for the removal of recognition in relation to other religions confined only to denominations which were in existence in 1937.  These are matters on which <Col N="2832" /> it would be proper to consult an adult people in a properly drawn up referendum. The Government did nothing about these things either, until there was bloodshed, a resurrection of ancient hatreds and a stimulation of present hatred in the streets of our villages and towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Was there ever a more unfit Government to rule than the Government which introduced these obnoxious provisions into our Constitution in 1937, and which have not got the moral courage to repeal them?  They introduced them of their own volition, without any suggestion from anybody.  At that time, apparently, they were adoring the gods which Deputy Boland says we should still be kneeling before. In 1967 they had not got the courage to right what they accepted through their own emissaries on that committee to be wrong.  Now the Taoiseach's only suggestion is that some group should consider it in depth.  There was a time when, if you did not want to do anything about something, you set up a committee.  Now you ask somebody to study it in depth and, the deeper you go, the more likely it is to be buried.  It is also fair to remark that what the Taoiseach had in mind was that the discussions would be in secret and that the democratic process would not be brought to bear on them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go too deeply into the 1967 report but it has become a terribly important document because every paragraph of it indicts the Government for 2½ years for gross, irresponsible and unpatriotic inactivity.  It also recommended the addition of a new principle to our social policy, the principle of equal pay for men and women for work of equal value.  Apparently that was also causing difficulty to the Fianna Fáil Government. We know also that, notwithstanding years of pressure from Fine Fáil were the Labour Parties, Fianna Fáil were reluctant to give votes at 18 years of age until they were teased and taunted on that matter by Mr. Faulkner and other members of the Northern Government. This is a document which indicts the Taoiseach and every member of his Government in every possible way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2833" /> We had a lecture from the Taoiseach about industrial relations and the need to improve them.  He chastised all concerned, all the employers and all the employees concerned, for the chaos which existed.  For 32 of the past 38 years, Fianna Fáil have been in power. If government means anything, it means responsibility for the state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Surely the lion's share of responsibility for the social, moral and patriotic difficulties and attitudes in our midst must lie with the Government which has had 32 years of government in the last 38?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, says the Government cannot abdicate responsibility. It is a bit late in the day to make a declaration of that kind.  As I said earlier, there is something ominous in a Government which accept responsibility only on the eve of a threemonths holiday for both Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>In the last two years we have had four major strikes and a multitude of smaller ones.  We had the maintenance strike, the cement strike, the ESB strike and the present bank strike which has gone on for three or four months or more.  The Taoiseach's view and the view of other members of the Government is that those involved in those strikes should use existing machinery. Has it ever occurred to him to examine why they are not using existing machinery?  Why has the Taoiseach or members of his Government not stepped in at an early stage in these disputes to ensure the machinery would be used?  Why has it required over a quarter of a year with these major strikes, with the immense harm they have done to the economy, for the Taoiseach and other members of the Government to feel that they have some responsibility for the state of chaos existing in industrial relations?</P>
    <P>If the machinery which the Taoiseach suggests should be used, because Dáil and Seanad Éireann in their wisdom suggested it, is not being used, surely it was clear for years past that it has not been used?  Why have the Government which have had such immense power in the past 38 years and in the last 13 years in particular, <Col N="2834" /> not moved to amend that legislation? What are they afraid of?  Why are they not prepared to discuss the matter? Why have they not proposals to put before the House?  Why have they not the guts to let the democratic process work and make their proposals?  Because they abdicated responsibility and now, in an ominous fashion, we are threatened with acceptance of that responsibility when we are all being forced by the Government to go on holidays.</P>
    <P>In these days we think only of the dismissed Ministers, Deputies Haughey and Blaney, and the resigned Ministers, Deputies Boland and Brennan, but let us cast our minds back to the resignation of another Member of this House from the Fianna Fáil Cabinet upon whose support the Taoiseach relies and whose support has been given to the Taoiseach during the last five or six years of industrial relations chaos, the resignation on 3rd November, 1964, of Deputy Paddy Smith of Cavan, who resigned from the Cabinet in which Deputy Jack Lynch, now Taoiseach, had responsibility for industrial relations. He resigned because he said he could not live with the Government's handling of industrial relations.  There is the pretty picture.  Twelve Members of the Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Party, one-sixth of the party, have declared that Deputy Boland was not wrong to accuse the Taoiseach of unparalleled treachery.  We do not know if Deputy Smith was among that 12.  We do know that nearly six years ago he accused the present Government of mishandling industrial relations.</P>
    <P>What have we got from the Government since then or from Deputy Lynch, who moved from his responsibility for industrial relations into the Taoiseach's chair?  Nothing, but an ominous threat on the day the Dáil is being forced by him to go into recess, so that over the next three months we shall be unable to criticise his actions or activities.</P>
    <P>We also received a lecture from the Taoiseach about the cost of living. The Government have boasted for some years past of their effective control of prices.  They have maintained that they were doing as much as could <Col N="2835" /> be done in a free economy about prices.  Our economy is no more rigid than that of any other European country, but at no time, with the exception of the last six months, has any European country experienced an increase in the annual cost of living of more than 2½ per cent.  The OECD has recommended that this is the maximum increase that should be permitted. But we have had a 4 per cent and a 5 per cent and a 6 per cent and a 5 per cent and a 7 per cent and, this year, a 10 per cent increase.  The Government say they are not to blame: it is everyone else in the community. But this year, when all the danger signals were flashing red about inflation, we had the deliberate injection of inflation through the imposition of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Whatever theory one may have about the turnover tax spreading the burden, our experience with the turnover tax of 1962 proved without doubt that in Irish conditions an increase in turnover tax would increase prices by not less than 4 per cent and more likely by 7 per cent.  In that full knowledge the Government chose that particular form of taxation almost exclusively to give them the additional revenue required and, in so doing, they deliberately or, if not deliberately, recklessly, carelessly, increased the cost of living and ensured inflation to a degree of 5 per cent or 7 per cent which could otherwise have been avoided.</P>
    <P>What other tremendously important increase in inflation have we had which has been just as significant as if not more significant than the wage increases which people have sought so that they could make ends meet?  In the past four years we have placed&mdash; for the first time to such a degree in our economic and financial independence&mdash;our reliance upon foreign loans to an extent where we injected substantial inflationary pressures into our economy.  We have borrowed from abroad £59 million in the past four years, including £20 million in sterling-Deutsche mark bonds.  It now appears that the Government are surviving on Bonn bonds.  This is the kind of utterly <Col N="2836" /> reckless Government we have had, grasping at the nearest straw for survival and using any possible method to grab money and appear to be generous without regard to the inevitable consequences of relying on outside money, highly priced, or a tax like the turnover tax and the inevitable damage which such reliance involves.</P>
    <P>This has been done at a time when the Government know that not only are we going to have these pressures which they already created but that they are occurring in a year in which there will also be an increase in the cost of living.  Perhaps it is artificial, only passing and not to be repeated but yet it is an increase which will be caused by decimalisation next February.  No matter what care is applied by the Government or other agencies of the State to limit the increase in the cost of living which will come about through decimalisation, there will be an increase because that has been the experience in any country that has gone over to decimalisation from more ancient systems.</P>
    <P>We also have the knowledge now that the value added tax which is in operation in Europe is to be applied in this country on next Budget day.  That could well be, for all we know, in October or early November.  This will also inject a new substantial increase in the cost of living and in the knowledge of all that, with their own hands filthy with inflationary lucre the Government, through their Taoiseach, the day the Dáil goes into recess, says: &ldquo;You are all out of step bar us.  You must all tighten your belts.  You must keep down your wages&rdquo; when they have injected some of the most significant factors into the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the northern situation has improved in the past few weeks in so far as there have not been deaths or that there has not been substantial violence.  We share his view that matters have improved, but let us understand why that situation has come about.  What kept the peace in Belfast and Derry and throughout the north over that critical week-end of 11th to 13th July?  It was the massive military presence, the intimidating military <Col N="2837" /> might of the British Army.  It was not pious words of any pious people, no matter how well intended, which kept the peace.  Anybody who was in the north, as I was, must have been overwhelmed with the intimidating presence of the military.  Thank God they were there.  Without them there might well have been a holocaust.  But let us not fool ourselves as to the price which had to be paid in order to maintain a passing peace.  Now we have ahead of us as we are asked to go into recess without any hope of recall the proposed Apprentice Boys parades on 12th August.  We think it is very sad to see the police and security forces in the north apparently unwilling or, perhaps, unable to stop parades which they have banned.  It does regrettably appear to query the fitness to govern of those who are in control in the North at the present time.</P>
    <P>The moment of truth has come not alone for the Stormont Government but also for the British Government. If a parade which last year set alight ancient bitterness is to be allowed to go ahead because of the weakness or unwillingness of the Government to stop it, if the proposed provocative parade is not stopped the confidence of the minority in the North of Ireland will be shattered and, goodness knows, that confidence has already suffered enough by what happened in the Lower Falls in July, where the British Army invaded, looted and outrageously damaged the homes of many innocent people and, since then, there has been a completely unsatisfactory handling of the complaints of the injured people by the military authorities.  I would hope to get from the Taoiseach in his reply an assurance that the Government have protested in the most vehement way about what happened and also urging proper handling of the complaints and adequate compensation.</P>
    <P>As I say these things, I of course, have full need to consider carefully the possible consequences of any comment or action.  Indeed, I think it is regrettable that that care has not been displayed by all Members of this House in the course of this debate here today or since it began this week or over recent months.  In the light of this terrible situation we must deplore Deputy <Col N="2838" /> Blaney coming into this House and speaking as he did, he who led others into the paths of error, who played it more cleverly than they, but who, when the people he misled were caught, left them to carry the can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney has presumed to question the integrity of Deputy Cosgrave and of his informant and to taunt him and others with the validity of the information which Deputy Cosgrave received and which he passed on, as he had every duty to do, to the Taoiseach.  It seems to me that a number of questions are still to be answered by Deputy Blaney.  He must answer why it was that it was he who arranged the first meeting between Captain John Kelly and Mr. Albert Luykx.  Deputy Blaney must also explain why it is that he asked the Minister for Defence would he in any circumstances sign a document to facilitate the illegal importation of arms to shoot Protestants. When Deputy Blaney has given satisfactory answers to this and many other questions which need to be answered, it will be time for him to speak.  Deputy Blaney demanded the drumming out of the Garda Síochána of the man responsible for revealing a plot.  Deputy Blaney has a wrong understanding of his obligations if he seeks to blame or accuse or chastise somebody who insists that nobody should be above the law but that all Irish men and women should be equal before the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney mentioned that to him peaceful means is the ideal solution for Partition.  He mentioned it as the ideal solution which, to my mind, suggests he believes there are other solutions which are less ideal but which may be possible.  Does he or any Irishman who loves his country and his fellow countrymen believe that if force is ruled out there is any other alternative but that of conviction?  Does he believe that if he fails to co-operate with the present leaders of the Unionist majority in the north that the only alternative to co-operating with and speaking with them is to deal with Dr. Ian Paisley and his like?  That is the reality of the situation and I think that one must accept what was said by Major Chichester Clark, the Northern Prime Minister, earlier this week, that <Col N="2839" /> there is no realistic policy which ignores the existence, the strength and the democratic validity of Unionist sentiment.  One can disagree with it just as we violently disagree with Fianna Fáil gods past and present, but we must respect the consequences of democratic activity and of democratic life and that is what we insist should be respected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland was, of course, mainly concerned with the internal difficulties of his own party&mdash;I am not sure whether he is still within the party, but the party to which he gave service over many years.  He wanted to know whether the Taoiseach was adjuring past gods and adopting new ones.  We are not terribly interested in manmade gods.  We do not believe the poor and the sick, the ordinary people of this country who wish to live in peace and harmony, are interested in politically-made gods.  No man or manmade god, past or present, has the right to stop co-operation between fellow Irishmen or to postpone unity by reliance upon the theoretical rights which have no relationship to the possibility of providing a solution for the difficulties of all the Irish people living on this island.</P>
    <P>We do not think that any man or man-made god, past or present, has any right to rake up past hatreds or to inflame present fears.  The Taoiseach, if he wishes to be fair to the Irish nation must reject tonight the support of those who believe that they or their gods, past or present, have a right to delay the unity of the Irish nation.  These people are giving or have until now given support to the Taoiseach.  If the Taoiseach has principles, if his Government have principle, or if the men in question have any principles and if they want people to believe they have principles, they must separate.  They must indicate that, as they are poles apart and cannot agree on this fundamental matter, they are no longer prepared to work together.  It is very easy to be a verbal martyr, a verbal patriot, but when the crunch comes, when a matter of principle arises, such as has arisen in a very clear way in this year in this island, then men of principle have a clear duty even if it means that <Col N="2840" /> they lose office and all the perquisites of it.</P>
    <P>Sir, we have difficulties ahead&mdash; economic, financial, in industrial relations and in matters pertaining to the unity of our people.  I can understand and we can all understand the reluctance of any Government to have any discussion which could be avoided, but I would ask the Taoiseach in the name of Irish democracy, in the name of the fundamental right of our people to express their views, and having regard to that right and the importance of it in any just society, in any free society, to give an undertaking tonight to Dáil Éireann to re-assemble the Dáil if any political or economic crisis should arise before the end of October. We would ask him not to take any drastic action affecting industrial relations or affecting the incomes of our people without first having a meeting of Dáil Éireann to justify it and, above all, not to use what he still has available to him&mdash;because he has not yet washed his hands of it&mdash;the emergency powers which were conferred on our Government in 1941 because of the then existing state of international crisis.</P>
    <P>The truth is, whether the Taoiseach likes to remember it or not&mdash;and I am sure he wishes to get away from it&mdash; that one in every six of the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party in Dáil Éireann believes that Deputy Boland was justified in accusing him of unparalleled treachery, that one in every six believes that Deputy Boland was justified in accusing him of being a felon setter and that the whole Fianna Fáil Party have remained silent in the face of a published statement that one of the members of his Government, Deputy Gibbons, was an unmitigated scoundrel.</P>
    <P>This does not appear to me to be a united Government.  This does not appear to be a Government to which it is safe to entrust the destinies of our people for any length of time.  This is particularly so during a period of three months when our Parliament and the people's voice cannot operate because the Government say: &ldquo;You must go on holidays and we will not let you back.&rdquo;  We are paying the price of protracted <Col N="2841" /> weakness.  What is that price? The price is the mess in which the country is.  The Taoiseach opened this debate by saying that the country is in a mess.  He should not dissolve the Dáil when the country is in a mess.  He should carry on either with free discussion in Parliament or else resign from office.  It seems to me that it is only honest for himself and his colleagues to resign because he knows he has not got a majority, an honest and true majority, behind him.</P>

      <P>It is not a blatant falsehood.  Then they come along complaining about the length of the Adjournment.  The Adjournment this year is no longer than the average Adjournment over the last ten years and in fact is less than the average over a number of years.  As well as that the number of hours this Dáil sat in the current session is away above the average for the period ending in the Summer Recess.  Then Deputies claim they have not had sufficient time to debate the people's affairs in true democratic fashion.  However, I have enough to deal with in the short time at my disposal without chasing Deputy Ryan's hares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the speeches of the Opposition representatives they chose to dwell on different themes.  Deputy Cosgrave underlined what he considered to be the absence of any consistency in the policies of the present Government.  Deputy Corish lamented the apparent diminution in the importance attached to this House and the reluctance of the Government to avail of the responsible <Col N="2842" /> and constructive advice and views which Opposition parties could provide. Unfortunately for their leaders, but not surprisingly to us, the speeches which we have heard from the Opposition Deputies over the past three days give no indication that either Fine Gael or the Labour Party are capable of speaking with a consistent voice on any topic.  Nor could I find much in the way of constructive advice.  We were treated to the by now familiar differences of views as the Opposition Parties proceeded to support all possible shades of opinion on different kinds of topics.  So much for consistency.  In addition, diverse and often conflicting opinions were delivered with the expected blend of exaggeration, misrepresentation and occasional sheer disregard for fact.  So much for responsible and constructive advice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave started the theme within a few minutes of his opening statement speaking on the subject of inflation where he was purporting to endorse the need to curb the present inflationary process.  He proceeded to conjure up a picture of prices rising by almost 10 per cent this year and used this to say that people would be justified in seeking a 15 per cent pay rise to cover the period up to the end of 1971. Coming from a person in his position such a statement can only be regarded as the height of irresponsibility.  I emphasised in my remarks that one of the dangers in an inflationary situation is that people may talk and think themselves into a frame of mind where they expect larger and larger price rises in the future and I said it was essential that any such inflationary expectations should be dispelled as a matter of urgency.  Yet we find the leader of the Opposition indulging in this dangerous activity of adding fuel to the inflationary fire.</P>
    <P>When it came to the subject of how to deal with inflation we were treated by other Fine Gael speakers to a variety of views delivered in confident, ringing tones.  Their views might have carried conviction were it not for the fact that one speaker was contradicting the other.  Deputy FitzGerald told us how the Opposition always find it easy to criticise the Government, sometimes unfairly, he admitted, to his credit.  He <Col N="2843" /> assured us that they could stand on their record for criticising the Government's failure in relation to a prices and incomes policy.</P>
    <P>We were given a confident statement as to how such a policy could be operated and it was one which one assumed would be operated by the Fine Gael Party.  Unfortunately, one of their new acquisitions to the party, Deputy Cooney, who spoke earlier, assured the House that he had no faith in any incomes policy because of the shortcomings of human nature.  However, it is a comfort for me to know that whichever course I take I will have some support from the Fine Gael benches.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney went on to suggest some of the fiscal changes that might help to curb inflation.  He called for restrictions on imports as the first and most important step which might be taken.  There is only one thing wrong with this advice and that is that import restrictions do not help to curb inflation.  On the contrary, they aggravate it.</P>
    <P>No doubt determined to emulate the performance of the Fine Gael speakers the Labour Party members managed to provide a similar pattern of contradictory statements.  Deputy Desmond like Deputy FitzGerald was anxious that the Government should press ahead with an incomes policy and saw this as a necessary measure to safeguard the jobs and living standards of workers.  On the other hand, his colleague Deputy O'Donovan considered an incomes policy, and I think I am quoting him correctly, to be nonsense and nothing more than a wages policy designed to prevent workers from getting adequate pay increases.  Deputy O'Donovan also presented us with another blatant example of irresponsible talk about price increases.  The official figure for price increases in 1968 of 4.7 per cent was to be placed in a category, according to Deputy O'Donovan, of &ldquo;lies, and damned lies,&rdquo; because he considered that prices had risen by at least 10 per cent.  Of course Deputy O'Donovan is a statistics office in his own right.</P>

      <P>The basis for this extraordinary statement was a survey, if we can call it that, of one shop, relating to some unspecified but presumably restricted range of goods and for an unspecified and apparently short period of time.  Perhaps intoxicated by these performances Deputy O'Leary felt compelled to add his mixture of misplaced exaggeration and ignorance of facts when he spoke this morning. He dragged out yet again the old bogey that there could be a devaluation of the Irish £ in the near future.  This is hardly the sort of comment which could be regarded as responsible since it can do nothing but stir up unwarranted speculation both here and abroad which could, if allowed to develop, lessen the confidence of foreign investors in this country.  It is worth nothing, of course, that this remark was part of a commentary in which the Deputy revealed his lack of both knowledge and understanding of economic affairs.  Where else, he asked us, was there a country which had inflation, rising unemployment and a growing balance of payments deficit. He need look no further than to the recent experiences of the United States and the United Kingdom and I invite the Deputy to have a look at them.</P>

      <P>That is the cause of it.

I have chosen to illustrate the confusion amongst Opposition Deputies with this example of their economic comments but the same inglorious pattern was followed in their treatment of other topics.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish spent part of his speech dwelling on the need for us to break away from the parliamentary pattern which he said had been modelled on that of Westminster 50 years ago.  I was consequently waiting with some interest for the contributions of other Labour Deputies on this theme but far from any constructive contributions as to how we might alter our practice what do I get?  A lecture from Deputy O'Brien who wants to reprimand me for not apparently subscribing to the doctrine of collective Cabinet responsibility which I understand derives from Westminster.</P>

      <P>It is also rather unfortunate that Deputy O'Brien should choose to raise the topic of sectarian bias and activities and accuse me and this party of it, especially since the most widely publicised case of this nature in recent times has been one with which a prominent member of his party was identified.  Deputy O'Brien made many points in the course of his speech and I have time only to deal with some of them.  He analysed and parsed speeches made by me, put them into juxtaposition with themselves and with speeches from other people, for whom I have no responsibility, such as the Nationalist leader in the North of Ireland, and tried to read between the lines and made some completely unsustainable assumptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was more like a political microbiologist, if there is such an animal, than a political realist.  Perhaps one might not blame the Deputy for that because with a little more experience I am sure he will come to the reality <Col N="2846" /> of politics which, as he probably knows better than I do, is described as &ldquo;the art of the possible.&rdquo;  He challenged the sincerity of my public statements when I urged peace, tolerance and brotherhood between all Irishmen.  To sustain this challenge he took a very poor example. He implied, and I was here at the time, that I promoted sectarianism during my election tour in June, 12 months ago.  He said, as reported in today's papers &ldquo;What the Taoiseach was putting out then had not a great deal to do with tolerance, forbearance and neighbourly love.  It was a campaign of calumny.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Since the incidents of last May I have had special security placed on me and, more recently, the Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery.  This was done without our consent, I need hardly say, and obviously as a result of some threat.  I do not know where the threat came from.</P>

      <P>On one occasion quite recently they came to the House as I had an engagement outside. Unfortunately, I was not able to get away and I instructed my private secretary to get these men into the restaurant and have them served tea.  I do not know if that is the occasion when they were seen there.  So much for that.</P>
      <P>I want to come now to a comment made by Deputy Cosgrave in reference to the arrangement by the Government last May of the interdepartmental unit established to examine all matters affecting north/south relations and study in depth short-term programmes as well as long-term difficulties.  Deputy Cosgrave said that, as far back as February, 1957, the Government decided, with a view to the preparation of specific detailed proposals for the reintegration of the national territory, that each Department should undertake in respect of the matters with which it was concerned an intensive study of all the practical problems that might be expected to arise in that connection. That was the inter-Party Government. According to Deputy Cosgrave that decision was taken in February, 1957. Deputy Cosgrave said that prior to that decision there had been a good deal of consideration on many matters and &ldquo;eventually the study undertaken and the discussion between the different Departments culminated in the Government decision to which I have referred.&rdquo; He added that it would be interesting to know what happened. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that the terms of this decision were given in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 19th July under the heading &ldquo;The inter-Party all-Ireland Plan&rdquo; from a Special Correspondent. I suggest it was a very special correspondent.  It attributed the initiative in the matter to the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Liam Cosgrave. The article stated that the decision was taken on the initiative of Deputy Liam Cosgrave and, in Deputy Cosgrave's words again, it would be interesting to know what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2849" /> I was a Member of the Dáil at that time.  I remember the events of January/ February, 1957, and, for the benefit of younger Members in the House, I can tell them something about it.  The Coalition Government had the aid of 70 Deputies, Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan.  They were also enjoying the support of the Clann na Poblachta Party of three members.  On 28th January, 1957, the three Clann na Poblachta Deputies tabled a motion of &ldquo;No Confidence&rdquo; in the Government. The terms of the motion, <i>inter alia,</i> regretted the failure of the Government to formulate and pursue any policy designed to bring about the unity of Ireland.  Now, the then Deputy McBride was close to that Government and he was able to charge them on 28th January with not having even formulated a policy.  In a statement published on 29th January Clann na Poblachta said they could no longer support the Government for that reason as well as for the Government's failure to deal with the economic crisis at that time.  This was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 29th January.  There was on Tuesday, I presume, the day it was published, the ordinary Government meeting and you can imagine the dilemma in which the members of that Government found themselves having, in the words of Deputy Dr. Noel Browne, had the rug pulled from under them, sitting on their chairs, almost transfixed at their panic stations.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;For heaven's sake, go back to your Departments and think up some kind of a policy on Partition&rdquo;.  The next public event of significance was the announcement of the dissolution of the Dáil, as reported in the daily papers of 5th February&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a couple of days later.  A meeting of the Government had taken place after 29th January at which the decision to dissolve the Dáil was taken and the decision <Col N="2850" /> to produce a Partition policy.  Might I say a cynical decision and one designed to delude the Irish electorate?  Deputy Cosgrave told us last Tuesday that that decision was taken in February.  It was obviously taken some time between 1st and 5th February.  It enabled the then Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, who had been in the Park on the previous Monday, the 4th, to advise the President to dissolve the Dáil, to provide an answer to the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis on 6th February to the Clann na Poblachta charge the previous week that there was no policy on Partition.  This was done between a decision taken to dissolve the Dáil and produce a policy on Partition and I think it was one of the most notable and, if I might add, cynical examples of a long line of Fine Gael instant policies.</P>

I am glad to say that in this respect many Deputies have expressed themselves well.  Some particular themes have recurred and I should like to make a few remarks about these first.  Deputies have asked what I mean by the expression in my speech on 11th July: &ldquo;We stand on the brink of a great achievement&rdquo;.</P>

I regard my speech as one designed to promote in a realistic way the unity of our people and country in full accord with true republican principles. Let people describe what I say and do in any way they like, but I want to assure the House that I am not going to hang my head before anybody in presenting and pursuing this policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew when I spoke on the 11th July that all the influences which could be exerted to maintain peace in the north two days later were being exercised by my Government as well as by the Governments in London and Belfast, by the leaders of the minority in the north and, let us be fair about it, by leaders of the majority.  At that time Deputies will remember the high state of tension and anxiety that prevailed in the country.  This determination among the three Governments, combined with the efforts of responsible community leaders, to avert a political disaster was already an achievement in the light of past experience.</P>
      <P>However, I meant more than this.  I also meant to indicate that if peace was preserved we would have begun to break the cycle of provocation, followed by violence, followed by more provocation and more violence.  I think I can say tonight that developments since 13th July continue to move in a favourable direction.  Many of the Deputies who have spoken in this debate will willingly agree that breaking this cycle is a necessary preliminary to the beginning of progress towards a peaceful solution of the Irish quarrel.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland commented on my use of the phrase &ldquo;Irish quarrel&rdquo;, in my speech of 11th July.  Obviously, the Deputy has read that speech carefully and I presume he will have seen that I specifically referred to and fixed the British Government with responsibility in the matter.  I want to assure him that the Fianna Fáil policy, as I interpret it and as stated at the last Ard-Fheis, still stands.  In this connection, I would say that a political party is a moribund and static one if in pursuing a policy it does not take account of changing circumstances and take advantage of new opportunities that passing decades will present while, at the same time, remaining true to the fundamental principles that inform that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2852" /> It has also been suggested that in my remarks about reforms in the northern society I was both patronising and speaking with tongue in cheek.  I do not accept these assertions.  Surely as Taoiseach I am expected to express the opinion of the Government on the status of reform in the north.  And, if in doing so my remarks appear to suggest a way of dealing with these matters, I do not see this as patronising. If some people in the north are offended by being told that they run their society badly, and in some important respects, have done little as yet to change their system, it is for them to cure the condition rather than resent fair criticism.</P>
    <P>On the question whether it was right for me to complain about others while we still have matters to correct, I would point out that our imperfections do not arise from deliberate discrimination and are not subject to the kind of criticism which not only I but Cameron, Hunt, the British Government and half of the world directed at the Stormont régime.</P>
    <P>I would add that in my statement to the Dáil two days ago there were several references to the need to examine our own society and to supply solutions to difficulties, of which we are all well aware.  I have said that society is constantly in a state of perfecting itself and that its instruments were Parliament and Government. Those Deputies who have pointed to particular matters in our internal situation and those who have pointed to difficulties in north-south relations will, I am sure, be glad to assist in correcting them.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have suggested that I am less concerned about violence done to Protestants in the north than to Catholics.  This is utterly untrue. The House will remember when Protestants were killed in Belfast last June I expressed on behalf of the Government deep sympathy with their relatives. I deplore all violence in the north and death or injury to anyone.</P>
    <P>At this stage I will refer to the visit the Minister for External Affairs made to the Falls Road&mdash;a visit that was intended to reassure the minority who <Col N="2853" /> had come under curfew and suffered casualties in the previous weekend.  Let us not pretend that the majority in the north need the same kind of reassurance from us.  If this is sectarianism, let people make the most out of it.  Incidentally, the Minister for External Affairs in his London interview was asked whether he intended to show solidarity with the people in the north by his visit.  Solidarity yes, but let us remember the leadership will still come from here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Outside this House there are others whose remarks also deserve attention.  There is much that Major Chichester-Clark says which I find reasonable and acceptable.  For example, last September he referred to himself as one of the elected representatives of a &ldquo;closely-knit historic community&rdquo;.  I recognise the general truth of Major Chichester-Clark's self-description.</P>
      <P>In his capacity as a leader of a certain community, I am more than willing to recognise his sincerity and his particular place.  His Government are entitled to the same kind of recognition in representing that community. I am willing to agree that he and his colleagues are facing the immensely difficult task of teaching some of the community they represent the need to come out of their isolation and to give up their domination of people who do not form any part of that closely-knit historic community.  Any encouragement and help that I can give in this respect I shall give willingly and unconditionally. Major Chichester-Clark can rest assured that any influence I have on events in the north will continue to be deployed on the side of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as constitutional responsibility is concerned, I am sure Major Chichester-Clark realises that the fact that unionism may claim to be the expression of the will of 900,000 people does not mean that a Unionist Government is the sole voice of all the <Col N="2854" /> people in the north.  Not alone were 500,000 people in the Six Counties, who formed the majority in more than half the area of the Six Counties, not consulted fifty years ago about what their option would be; and not alone was it clear then but it is clear now that their option would not be for a Stormont Government, totally controlled by one part only of the population of the Six Counties; the behaviour of Unionist Governments towards them in the past fifty years has conferred no moral right on unionism to speak for them.  I do not think it is sectarianism to say this.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should in some manner give some recognition to the Stormont Government, although I am not quite sure what was meant by that suggestion.  From what I have said I think that Deputies should begin to realise that what we are prepared to recognise is the existence and strength of unionist sentiment among the northern majority.  In doing so, we recognise the real situation of the Irish community as a whole.  To add to this some kind of recognition of territorial legitimacy offends against nonunionist sentiment in the north as well as here and does nothing to solve the problem.  Again, I repeat it is not sectarian to say this.</P>
    <P>Such an attitude does not imply physical reconquest by us of the Six Counties nor disrespect for the closely-knit historic community of the area. Surely I have said enough already&mdash; most recently in my speech of 11th July&mdash;to show that neither my predecessors nor I have or had any wish to confront or destroy that community.</P>
    <P>I often ask myself what the northern majority really want.  No doubt some proportion of extremists want to continue in the old ways of intolerance and contempt for the rights of their neighbours.  I do not believe this is true of Major Chichester-Clark's Government nor of the great majority of the people they represent.  What then is their difficulty about joining with us in creating the kind of Irish society they and we could both be proud of?  Surely it is obvious that this is the right thing to do, and the best thing to do, and the only way out of the errors of the past?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2855" /> Above all, they need have no fear in a country whose sovereignty they would share, and in whose councils they would have a strong voice, of any interference with their religious and civil liberties.  In this regard, the national majority should be very careful to listen to them and lean over backwards to give them reassurances. We are prepared to do this and to go a very long way in providing the kind of guarantees that reasonable men ought to accept.  If they fear for their economic wellbeing, surely it is now clear that this is already in jeopardy? Surely it is also clear that a united Ireland would wish to safeguard the vitality of an area of immense importance to the economic health of the whole country?</P>
    <P>Here again I would be prepared to go a very long way in negotiating the kind of agreement which would leave the northern economy at no risk. Britain has a role to play in such a negotiation and I am sure that North and South between them could find with Britain a useful solution.  There is little point in Britain continuing to finance what many people would call social bankruptcy.  Would it not be better for all of us to co-operate in a different endeavour?  When we have solved our political problem, Ireland should quickly enjoy the economic standards common to Western Europe.</P>
    <P>We have already shown in the 26 counties what can be done even from a very weak base.  The EEC considers us capable of assuming the obligations of full membership of the Community. Do they fear, the northern majority&mdash; is it even conceivable&mdash;that some people have a spirit of revenge for the past?  On this I have no doubt at all that I speak for all Irishmen in saying that an Irish Government would not, under any circumstances, countenance any such further crime against our nation.</P>
    <P>Finally, is it not better that Belfast should partake in the sovereignty we enjoy here and the distinction which we have already secured for our nation in world affairs and to which our whole country could accede, than that Belfast should continue to be just a capital <Col N="2856" /> city in a troubled part of a province? In saying this, I do not for one moment disparage Britain or the British people with whom all Ireland will have no quarrel.  I realise also the value of the cultural connection between the northern majority and Britain, and see no reason why this, too, could not be accommodated in a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>I agree that realistic policy on our part cannot ignore the existence and strength of Unionist sentiment, nor do we wish to ignore these things.  An Irish nation which takes the best from all our traditions, is a better thing than a divided country whose division is unnecessary and can bring out the worst in our traditions.</P>
    <P>An Ireland united by peaceful means, by agreement, has a greater democratic validity than an imperfect solution found 50 years ago for the wrong Irish question.  Everyone in this House agrees with an Ireland united by peaceful means.  Those who do not want to come along this road have their choice, but there should be no prevarication about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Byrne gave notice he proposed to raise on the Adjournment the following matter: arrangements in relation to the control of drug abuse in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of the abuse of drug-taking and the freedom with which drugs of different types are available in Dublin and other urban areas.  It is to our horror that recently we had in Dublin two sacrilegious offences in two of our finest churches.  It is because of this that I have asked with your permission, Sir, to discuss this at this unusual time, following the Taoiseach's Adjournment Debate.  I feel the urgency of this matter warrants that it be discussed here because we are going into recess for three months and already we have signs appearing on the horizon that drug abuse is on the increase in Dublin.</P>
      <P>As I said, in the past few days we have witnessed two sacrilegious offences and these could only have been committed under the influence of drugs. I am not talking here about ethynol or alcohol; I am talking about drugs which can change a person's personality. A person can have a personality which during the day, while free of drug intoxication, will render him amenable to participation in normal life in society, but following the abuse of his system by drugs, following drugs being made freely available to him, we see the drastic effects and the stage to which such a person can be driven. We see in this evening's <i>Evening Press</i> that in the Pro-Cathedral in Dublin there was a card-playing school at the foot of the altar of the Virgin Mary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How is this connected with drug taking in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim that no person in his proper senses but only somebody under the influence of drugs, who has obtained drugs freely in this city&mdash; because drugs are readily and freely available in Dublin&mdash;would commit such an offence as occurred in the Pro-Cathedral and which also occurred a few days ago 50 yards from my own house in Our Lady of Victories Church <Col N="2863" /> in Ballymun.  I want to say that the drugs, the sale of which the Minister prohibited by a recent Act, are available in this city.  I know they are available because constituents of mine have reported to me that they are available but unfortunately they will not tell me the exact source from which they get them.  I also know from my contacts in the docklands that drugs are coming in through Dublin port and indeed through other ports.  I am also aware that the constituent necessary for the production of marijuana is being harvested in this country.  The drugs which are available and which are being abused to a great extent, and the Minister for Health will agree with me, are the tranquillising drugs, the drug called valium, the drug called, in drug circles, &ldquo;the blue&rdquo;, and another drug, a sleeping tablet, called mandrax which is taken to put people into a very severe, dazed condition.  It is these and the free availability of these drugs that has brought me here at this unusual time to raise this issue.</P>
      <P>I want to tell the Minister for Health that it is possible for a person, malingering, feigning psychiatric conditions, to obtain a prescription from a doctor in the suburbs and by going from one doctor to another, by being well versed in symptoms and mimicking signs, he can obtain freely at 12 hospitals in the Dublin area during one week prescriptions which he can have filled at relatively little cost.  The last time I raised this matter here was approximately nine months ago. Nothing has been done since to stem this abuse.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that drug abuse and the availability of drugs on prescription, forged prescriptions and otherwise, has got out of control.  It is at a crisis point. I want to say that drug pushers, as we know them, are not drugs to the com-people who bring drugs to the community are not people who use the drugs because they know the danger and the addictive qualities of them and they know the financial rewards that can be gained from the peddling of these drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that, if a person should be apprehended for peddling drugs or pushing drugs, the severest penal servitude <Col N="2864" /> available in the State should be imposed on that person.  I want to go further and say that, if there is a known case of somebody who has caused the death of any member of our community, with particular reference to the teenagers, the reintroduction of the death penalty should be considered by the Government.  The death penalty should be imposed in such a case on the drug pusher, who is completely free of addiction or of any psychiatric ailment and who is pushing drugs purely and simply for monetary gain.</P>
    <P>It is a known fact that great hardship is caused in a family when a teenager has become habituated or addicted to drugs.  It is also known that death comes rapidly following addiction to certain kinds of drugs.  We can bear with the benzedrine, dexedrine and the stimulant type of drugs which the Minister has removed from the market.  We can bear with the marijuana and the LSD, and &ldquo;the blues&rdquo; and the mandrax but when it gets to the morphine and the heroin stage, to the hardline, mainline type of drugs, which are being peddled freely in this city and in other cities, and when people die from these drugs, when the pusher is found the severest penalty which can be imposed should be imposed. No longer should the pusher be able to take the easy way out of a couple of months in a psychiatric home and then out again on the street to continue the dreadful work he is doing.</P>
    <P>Recently we had the introduction of a special clinic in the Dublin area for the treatment of drug addicts.  Some of us are aware, to our dismay, that drugs are in fact being brought in to patients while they are undergoing treatment.  I should like the Minister to recommend to the Minister for Justice that the severest penalty be imposed upon pushers here.  They are not necessarily all Irishmen.  Some of them have come from as far away as America and some have come from England.  They are undermining the will of our youth.  It is not only the well-to-do who are affected: working-class children, teenagers, are affected too.  It is widespread and it is associated with the widespread increase in vandalism, and, indeed, tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is again on the increase <Col N="2865" /> in this city.  It is also associated with the vast increase which has occurred in the emotional sector of disease.  It is not sufficient to say that the lucky ones die.  For every one who dies there are hundreds who are maimed mentally, hundreds who will fill the wards of the psychiatric institutions in this country for years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange raised this here in 1966, four years ago, and he was told there was no problem.  Deputy M. O'Leary brought it up in 1961 and he was told there was no problem.  The Minister for Justice introduced a drug squad composed of four people to deal with the small crime of drug peddling in the city of Dublin.  Recently he almost doubled it to seven.  Due to the shorter working hours of the gardaí it is still an inadequate force and it gives recognition to the fact that this State only recognises a drug problem in Dublin city and ignores the problem elsewhere.  It is not sufficient for us to pass over the hardline drug takers, the people who will drop out.  The tragedy of our administration is that we are attempting to close the door after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>In the lower income groups, the largest section of our population, we have widespread drug abuse.  Alcoholism is a form of addiction to a drug called ethynol.  The Minister discussed this problem very fully last week, unfortunately outside this House.  He pointed out that one out of every 12 people will require institutional care&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that one out of every 11 going into a psychiatric home for institutional treatment was an alcoholic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>One out of every 11 going into psychiatric homes is going in for treatment for ethynol.  This shows our population has a predisposition to taking drugs whether in the form of alcohol, methylated spirits, poteen, dexadrine, tranquillisers, or any other drug which will give them a feeling of euphoria.  What will the situation be like if this trend continues unchecked?  What will it be like unless the Minister for Health issues strong directives to every dispensary doctor in <Col N="2866" /> the city of Dublin and to every psychiatrist to cut down the tranquillisers they prescribe?  He should investigate the possibility of introducing legislation to ensure that no patient will possess four, five, or six separate prescriptions from different general practitioners. He should take steps to prevent the forging of prescriptions.  There should be a regional registration of general practitioners and of all doctors who are in practice.  There is nothing to stop a person going into a printers and having prescriptions printed in the name of Dr. Higginbotham, or Dr. anything else, and presenting those to any chemist anywhere in Dublin.  It is as easy as that to obtain some of the drugs I have mentioned, the tranquillisers, not the more dangerous ones. We have done nothing to stop this.  It has been brought to the attention of DMOs and others, but no really practical steps have been taken to prevent abuse.  I say this as someone who has practical experience in this sphere.  This country, a young nation, a nation with many problems at the moment economic and political, should attempt to set some example to the diseased world around us by wiping out drug abuse in this country before it gets completely out of hand, before we reach the pathetic stage that has been reached in Britain and where they have a register of drug addicts, before we decline to the level of the USA where the difference between the drug addict and the alcoholic is that the drug addict will kill to obtain drugs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne has been doing a beautiful piece of self-advertising by exaggerating wildly the state of drug-taking in this country. I hope he is pleased with himself for this beautiful piece of self-advertisement. Associating very much to be regretted vandalism in two churches with the apparent possibility that the people concerned are taking drugs is very good publicity for the newspapers, but it will not help us to end drug abuse.  This is sheer self-advertisement on the part of Deputy Byrne.  Would he please give me or the gardaí the evidence?  He talks about an enormous increase.  Let him give the evidence to the gardaí.  Unless the evidence is given <Col N="2867" /> to the gardaí the gardaí can do nothing. The Deputy knows perfectly well that I and the health authorities have taken every possible step to deal with drug addiction here.  I have also made it absolutely clear to everybody that I cannot stop drug addiction.  No Minister for Health in any country in the world can stop it.  Let us get rid then of this nonsense of pretending that by making a wordy speech Deputy Byrne can suddenly find a Minister for Health who overnight will eliminate drug abuse.  All we can do is control it as far as lies within our power.</P>
      <P>In the last two weeks I have given a complete description of what we have done in this matter.  I have taken all advice given to me by the working party on drug abuse.  The Garda drug squad has been increased; we have been in touch with the customs officers about the smuggling of drugs; we have been dealing with the possibility of forged prescriptions; we have banned the sale of most types of amphetamines from the shelves of chemists' stores&mdash;in company with only two other countries; we have ensured that drugs cannot be pilfered from hospitals, dispensaries and chemists' shops and I have a satisfactory report on this; we have established, or are establishing, three separate institutions for drug addicts. The matter is constantly subject to the attention of the Garda Síochána.  We are also going to register the small number of persons dependent on drugs who are attending general practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell the country that I know the consumption of drugs is increasing but mercifully for us at the present time it is at a low level compared with most of the affluent countries.  I know from the Garda Síochána that a large number of addicts in this country are <Col N="2868" /> not permanently hooked on drugs but take them from time to time.  I also know that a considerable number of drug addicts are delinquents in other ways and are not normal members of society.  They are just as likely to be picked up by the gardaí for one form or another of delinquency as they are to be picked up for drug addiction.</P>
    <P>I shall do my best in this matter but there is no crisis situation in regard to drug addiction in this country and I hope there will not be a crisis.  It is no use for a Deputy to get up in this House and make these statements without providing the evidence.  I would ask not only Deputy Byrne but all the public to provide evidence to the Garda Síochána of suspected drug smuggling.  They should provide any information of wrong action by medical practitioners which, of course, would be immediately dealt with by the Medical Association Ethical Committee. They should provide any information of any wrong action by pharmacists which would be dealt with immediately by the Pharmaceutical Association. One of the ways to prevent the spread of drugs is by people having the moral courage and decency to give to the authorities any information or even suspicion they may have in regard to the peddling of drugs.</P>
    <P>This is a very paltry method of ending a long session of the Dáil and the most gloriously hypocritical aspect was the statement of Deputy Byrne that inevitably sacrilege was connected with drugs.  Would the Deputy kindly give any evidence he has to the Garda Síochána that these two appalling outrages took place as a result of drug-taking?</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 28th October, 1970.</P>
