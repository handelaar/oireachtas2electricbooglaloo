      <P>The percentage unemployed is obtained by relating the number of insured persons on the live register to the estimated currently insured population.  In calculating the percentages, agriculture, fishing and private domestic service are excluded. The data required for the calculation of the percentages are available only in respect of the areas covered by each local employment office and these areas do not correspond with county boundaries. For the calculation of the percentages the offices are grouped into eight regions.  With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the percentages unemployed at mid-March, 1970, in each of the eight regions.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>PERCENTAGE of currently insured persons unemployed at mid-March, 1970 (excluding agriculture, fishing and private domestic service).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had urgent discussions on this matter with Dublin Health Authority.  They are being most co-operative.  There is a possibility of restricted quarters in the wing at St. Brendan's.  There is the possibility that another wing there will be vacated as it is no longer required for other cases. This could be used for drug addicts who require to be detained and treated. I am anxious to make the necessary arrangements with the Dublin Health Authority as soon as possible.  We now know that drug addicts who are also delinquents cannot suitably be placed in an open system along with drug addicts who are well-intentioned and who wish to be cured as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>At present there are 15 permanent posts vacant in district mental hospitals but, as I indicated in a reply to Deputy Dr. Browne on 4th December, a number of posts are not filled in a permanent capacity.  I also indicated in that reply the steps which had already been taken to improve recruitment to permanent posts.  In addition, I am having discussions at present with managers and the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union on further steps necessary to improve recruitment.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are numerous reasons for the shortage of medical staff&mdash;a shortage that is not confined to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there are 15 vacant posts.  What percentage is that of the total number of posts available in mental hospitals? How many non-specialist practitioners are in charge of mental hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the reply to everything the Deputy has asked. There are 163 permanent posts.  There are 15 vacant posts and there are some temporaries.  As the Deputy may know from my previous observations on this matter, we are having all the necessary discussions on this question.  The committee have met to examine the whole staffing structure, method of employment and undergraduate and postgraduate training of people in the psychiatric field.  I cannot promise a great improvement in the very near future.  If we examine all these recommendations and get agreement with the health authorities and the managers concerned, we ought to be able to <Col N="477" /> make progress towards having a greater number of appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Minister be in a position to have this matter sorted out so as to have these mental hospitals properly staffed?  Can he give some indication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the report of this committee.  It has to be examined by the medical associations concerned.  Then it has to be put to the health authorities.  It may involve increases in remuneration and changes in conditions which, in turn, may affect other staffing structures.  This is a matter of priority as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister emphasise the number of permanent posts?  Are we not all well aware that the great bulk of the hospital posts are staffed on a non-permanent basis?  How many non-permanent posts are vacant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the figures prepared in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question did not mention anything about permanent posts but was in relation to the number of posts vacant.  The majority of hospital posts in this country are nonpermanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a great number of non-permanent posts and that is why we are having the whole matter examined.  There is a shortage of staff in other countries as well as in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of public concern <Col N="478" /> over the recent disclosure of primitive conditions in some mental hospitals, he will consider having a public inquiry into conditions in all mental hospitals in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of our mental hospital buildings were erected in the last century when the circumstances then prevailing led to the development of large structures with facilities which fall far short of modern standards. This is a legacy of the past of which I am only too well aware and which I am doing everything possible to remedy. In recent years considerable efforts have been made to improve standards.  There are, however, still sections of hospitals which leave much to be desired.</P>
      <P>Improvement works costing nearly £4 million are at present under construction, or at an advanced stage of planning for mental hospitals and considerable further improvement schemes are under consideration.  My Department are pressing ahead with all possible speed to bring about the necessary improvements.  In these circumstances I do not feel that any useful purpose would be served by having a public inquiry into conditions in all our mental hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider requesting an up-to-date report from every mental hospital without necessarily having a public inquiry? Further, will the Minister admit that the conditions exposed in two mental hospitals were more relevant to the Victorian era than to the present time?  These are not isolated incidents and therefore the Minister should have an inquiry carried out or else have a report made on conditions in our mental hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy I have no intention of having an inquiry carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not wish to hear about the conditions in these hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy might listen to me.  The position is that I have on my desk a complete <Col N="479" /> report on the conditions in our mental hospitals and I know exactly what is the position.  I need no commission of inquiry whatever.  I also have available to me the report of the Commission on Mental Illness and reports are made every year.  At the moment there are improvements actually in progress or down for planning in respect of 14 of the mental hospitals and every effort is being made to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the conditions in St. Ita's and in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister's statement is correct because I am aware that reports on all mental hospitals have been sent to the Department by the health boards but will the Minister not agree that the matter is one of money?  It is very costly to provide for new buildings and necessary improvements.  Perhaps the Minister will endeavour to persuade the Government to view this matter in a more favourable light so that the conditions about which Deputy Dr. O'Connell speaks might be improved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is more than a matter of money; it is a matter of planning.  It is also a matter of separating the mentally handicapped from the mentally ill and finding places for them.  A total of 1,500 places is being prepared for the mentally handicapped, both severely and moderately handicapped. There is also the problem of planning in so far as there is a reduction in the number of permanently institutionalised medical patients because of more modern treatment and domiciliary treatment of psychiatric patients.  All these matters must be examined very carefully.  Modern techniques are made use of but the solution cannot be found in a period of one or two years.  It is a question of a steady programme of improvement over a period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that in a number <Col N="480" /> of hospitals, including institutions catering for many elderly bed-ridden patients, no fire drill whatsoever is held; if he will have a full investigation made as a matter of urgency of arrangements in all hospitals for fire fighting, evacuation of patients in the event of emergencies and the frequency of fire drills; if he will issue directives to all hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A circular was issued by my Department in December 1969 to all mental hospital authorities which emphasised the need to establish administrative responsibility for fire arrangements, to ensure that fire precaution measures were given a very high priority and that all staff should have training in fire and evacuation drills.  Health authorities were asked to ensure that these hospital buildings are examined regularly by the local fire officer; that fire fighting equipment is inspected and tested regularly; that regular fire drills take place; that all parts of the hospitals are adequately patrolled at night and that all matters relating to fire precautions are fully logged.  It had been ascertained earlier that, in so far as it is possible to do so, ward accommodation for elderly patients is provided on the ground floor of the mental hospitals.  The fire protection standards as prepared by the Department of Local Government were brought to the notice of the health authorities and of the authorities responsible for institutions catering for the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>Further circulars on the lines of that issued to mental hospital authorities are being prepared for issue to all health authorities in respect of acute hospitals and county homes and to the authorities of voluntary institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question dealt with all hospitals and not merely mental hospitals or hospitals concerned with the treatment of mental patients. Would the Minister consider it appropriate that a ward accommodating more than 30 elderly patients should have the one door to a fire escape blocked on the inside by a bed occupied by a bed-ridden patient and built <Col N="481" /> up on the outside with wallboard in order to prevent draughts?  Will the Minister ensure that fire drill takes place in all hospitals without further delay, particularly in those hospitals which cater for elderly people or those who are otherwise immobile?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will draw the attention of the fire service in the area to these matters.  It is not my direct responsibility but I must take account of the operations of the fire authorities.  If the Deputy has any specific instances in mind perhaps he will communicate with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider it proper that a hospital accommodating more than 1,000 patients has not had any fire drill within living memory, particularly as the hospital is very old?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>I am aware that nurse staffing difficulties have arisen in the Dublin Health Authority's institutions and I gave some particulars of the numbers of beds affected in reply to a question by Deputy Desmond on 29th April.  The problem arises also in the psycho-geriatric service of Cork Health Authority but otherwise no serious difficulties have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed the Deputy on 7th May, <Col N="482" /> 1969, in reply to a question on the possibility of setting up a register for a grade of nurse equivalent to the state enrolled nurse that An Bord Altranais do not favour such a course in the present circumstances.  They are, however, keeping the position under constant review.</P>
    <P>In an effort to help recruitment of general trained nurses to geriatric hospitals I approved in May, 1969, of the payment of a special allowance of £40 per annum to such nurses and ward sisters.  In the case of the Dublin geriatric nurse staffing problem which presents most difficulty the proposed changes in the function and management of two major health authority hospitals should have helpful consequences in this area.  These are at St. Kevin's and James Connolly Memorial Hospitals.  I am hopeful that decisions about these changes will be arrived at in the course of the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have regard to the fact that staffing difficulties become acute during the summer period when regular staff are taking their summer holidays?  Having regard to the fact that it is now generally recognised that State enrolled nurses can perform 25 per cent of the services rendered by general nurses, would the Minister not urge An Bord Altranais to make this necessary move?  It will certainly have to be taken within a few years and it is better to take it now rather than when it is too late.</P>

      <P>We are certainly discussing this matter with An Bord Altranais.  They are undertaking a statistical inquiry into the whole position of the nursing profession in all the hospitals of the State.  I hope their inquiry will be expedited.  As the Deputy said, there are two points of view about the idea of State enrolled nurses.  An Bord Altranais seem to be very much against it and this idea is not looked at with pleasure by the Irish Nurses Organisation.  We are examining the whole position as quickly as we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of staffing difficulties which exist in one fever hospital, namely, Cherry Orchard Hospital, Ballyfermot.  This hospital, due to a variety of reasons, has been experiencing difficulties in recruiting trained nursing staff for a number of years and these difficulties have been increased in recent times as a result of the decision of An Bord Altranais to discontinue the special fever nursing qualification as from 1972.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Health Authority have the position under constant review and certain concessions have been introduced to stimulate recruitment including the grant of credit, up to a maximum of five increments, for previous post-graduate experience in a recognised hospital both to single nurses who accept permanent appointments and to married nurses employed in a temporary capacity.  A special allowance is also payable to nurses engaged in the nursing care of children.</P>
      <P>On the question of the replacement of students in the training school for fever nursing at Cherry Orchard, the Dublin Health Authority have applied to An Bord Altranais for approval to the establishment of a group training scheme for general nursing based at St. Kevin's Hospital and other health authority institutions including Cherry Orchard Hospital.  This application is at present under consideration by An Bord Altranais who hope to give a decision on the matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Dublin Health Authority are doing everything in their power to attract suitably qualified nursing staff to Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>

Surely these increases should be deferred at least until the question of salary adjustments is finalised?

      <P>My Department has 47 stallions on lease to breeders throughout the country.  The need for the movement of these stallions from one area to another because of excessive inbreeding arises on very few occasions largely because the owners normally sell off the female progeny and replace the mares with unrelated stock.

The owners of the mares in the area will not cause undue inbreeding to take place.  It is not something which results merely because there has not been a change of sire in the area.  However, I <Col N="489" /> can see the Deputy's point that more frequent changes might perhaps make for greater convenience for mare owners with just one mare.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 25th March last I notified Dublin County Council of an allocation of £2.7 million for the payment of house purchase loans and supplementary grants in the current financial year.  This compares with a capital allocation of £1.1 million for these services in 1969-70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A provisional allocation to cover local authority housing commitments only is made at the beginning of each financial year and further allocations <Col N="494" /> are made from time to time during the year as new work matures for commencement.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Fund grants for 1970-71 have been allocated to the various road authorities on the basis of most pressing needs, and include very substantial allocations to Dublin County Council.  While, for reasons I have indicated in reply to previous questions by the Deputy, these do not include a specific allocation for county road improvement, it is open to the council to proceed with such work out of moneys which they provide from their own funds for road work, including the substantial sum made available to them for general road purposes by the increase in the grant for the maintenance of national primary routes from 50 per cent to 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister justify Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin Corporation being entitled to an urban road improvement grant while County Dublin, which carries the same traffic, if not more, is not entitled to such a grant?  There are roads in County Dublin which are turning into laneways because they are not able to carry the volume of traffic.  It will require a considerable sum to bring them up to the standard they should be at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>County Dublin gets a very substantial grant from the Road Fund but because improvement work to the county roads is practically completed it does not get a specific allocation for this purpose.  I am well aware that some of the county roads are deteriorating because the county council has allowed development to take place on these roads which has meant that these roads have been subjected to traffic which they were not designed to bear.  If the county council insists on allowing this to happen it is the county council's responsibility to bring the roads up to the required standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether there is any provision, pending court proceedings, to prevent further driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle by a person who has failed to produce a current certificate of insurance on request by a member of the Garda Síochána; and, if not, whether in view of the fact that other persons are put at risk by a driver who is not insured, he will consider taking action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no specific provision such as that referred to by the Deputy.  However, as the law stands at present, if a person persists in <Col N="501" /> driving a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place without insurance he can be charged with an offence in respect of each separate such occasion. Furthermore where a garda has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is persisting in driving without insurance there are facilities for getting an abridged summons so that the person can be brought to court very quickly.  A provision along the lines the Deputy suggests could be regarded as empowering the gardaí to impose sanctions on the acts of a person before such person had been convicted of an offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a person who is not insured, who has produced an out-of-date certificate at the Garda station and is, therefore, not insured, can afterwards drive away? Is the Minister aware that if that person is involved in an accident with a pedestrian, the pedestrian has no recourse to compensation?  Does the Minister think this state of affairs should continue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The person can drive away but he cannot legally do so. There is the possibility that the Motor Insurers' Bureau would deal with such a case.  The position is as I have outlined, that each time a person drives a vehicle without insurance an offence is committed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the plight of former agents of his Department who on retirement after more than 30 years service receive no pension and are consequently suffering serious hardship; and if steps will be taken to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Local agents were transferred from the former National Health Insurance Society to my Department on the 1st August, 1950. Under the terms of their employment with the society they were temporary part-time officials who were not entitled to pension or gratuity on retirement, and, in fact, their remuneration had an element in it by way of compensation for their non-pensionability. Since coming into the Civil Service they <Col N="503" /> have continued to be employed on a part-time, temporary basis and, as in the case of other groups in this category, are not entitled to pensions.  Some years ago, however, my Department succeeded in having agents made eligible for gratuities and those agents who have retired since the 1st April, 1967, have been paid such gratuities. I might mention that local agents are insurable under the Social Welfare Acts and should, therefore, be eligible for contributory old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 13th November last on this subject.</P>
      <P>As regards the other parts, the position is that each applicant must publish notice of intention to apply for a certificate of personal fitness in a daily newspaper published and circulating in the city of Dublin and is also required to furnish the names of three persons resident in the State who are willing to vouch for him.  In practice, the bookmakers from the north who are granted licences here are also licensed in the north and for that purpose have to obtain, annually, a certificate of character from the courts there.  This covers matters such as financial stability as well as character in the ordinary sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to operate on authorised tracks here, a bookmaker must have not only a bookmaker's licence but also a permit from the Racing Board or Bord na gCon, as the case may be, and these boards require certain financial guarantees before issuing permits.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that owing to the failure of over half the lifts in the Ballymun high rise dwellings great hardship is being caused to residents, in particular to pregnant women whose health is endangered by having to climb many flights of stairs, and to many young children who have had to be confined to their homes since the failure, and that many residents, particularly the elderly, are in effect isolated; and if he will take immediate steps to have the lifts restored to use.</P>

      <P>I understand that, arising from an industrial dispute between the maintenance contractor and his electricians, a number of lifts in Ballymun are out of commission.  Talks between the parties failed to resolve the dispute. It is open to one or both of the parties to seek the intervention of the Labour Court.  It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the dispute until the normal procedures for settlement have been used.  However, I am informed by Dublin Corporation that they have had talks with both sides and have got agreement to temporary arrangements pending the resolution of the dispute for the servicing of the lifts that are out of commission.  Repair work is being resumed today.</P>

I do not see that anything more could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on Thursday I had already spoken at considerable length on the Budget.  It is not my intention to monopolise the time of the House but there are a few aspects of the Budget on which I should like to comment and which I had not reached on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>The worst feature of this Budget is the severe impact of the additional taxation on the poor and underprivileged sections of the community. As I said when the turnover tax was introduced in 1963, I believe that as a system of taxation it is most unjust and inequitable for the reason that its impact is felt most severely by those least able to bear it.  Indeed, the impact of the increase in turnover tax announced in this Budget has already begun to make itself felt.  Prices have begun to spiral upwards.  Necessaries and luxuries are equally affected.</P>
      <P>Any fairminded person will be concerned about the additional impost of the increased turnover tax on the pensioner, the unemployed and other social welfare recipients and on persons on fixed incomes.  The Budget has been described as a social welfare Budget.  That is not a proper description of this Budget because it is impossible to reconcile so inequitable a system as turnover taxation with any principle of social justice.  The cost of necessaries, for instance bread and other foodstuffs, has already been increased by the further 2½ per cent turnover tax imposed by this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the Budget which causes concern is the impact it will <Col N="522" /> have on our tourist industry.  I feel obliged to warn the Minister and the Government that if prices are allowed to spiral there is grave danger of the tourist industry being placed in a hazardous position.  Our competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other tourist countries could be destroyed.  At the three-day conference on tourism held in London on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday last&mdash;a conference known as the tourist workshop&mdash;there was evidence of the fact that British travel agents and tour operators are beginning to strike a much harder bargain than was the case heretofore.  The £50 limit imposed by the British Government on British holidaymakers in recent years benefited our tourist industry to a considerable extent.  This restriction has been removed, so that we will have to compete with Spain and other tourist countries for British tourists.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the Budget's impact on industry by increasing costs.  There is a possibility that this Budget could have disastrous consequences for the tourist industry. A rise in prices in the tourist industry at this stage would have really serious results because we have recently adopted as national policy the promotion of year-round tourism.  One way in which we can compete for off-season tourists is by keeping prices at the lowest possible level and by keeping tourist marketing in a competitive position.</P>
    <P>I referred at length on the last occasion to the effects this Budget will have on agriculture and industry.  So much has been said and written in the past couple of weeks about this Budget that to keep on referring to various aspects would involve repetition but I do want to say by way of general comment that the debate on the Budget has been remarkable for two things: first of all for what I would describe as the rather sickening hypocrisy of the Taoiseach and certain Government Ministers and, secondly, for the arrogant and scurrilous performance of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>In this Budget we have evidence of a Government who are either unable <Col N="523" /> or unwilling to face up to their responsibilities and to take the necessary corrective action to put the economy on a sound basis.  The Budget is indicative of a Government who are motivated purely by political expediency and who are now so power-drunk as not to be able even to contemplate taking any action which might in any way damage the party.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his Ministers should have provided the leadership and the programme now so necessary in tackling the serious economic problem with which we are confronted. However, the Taoiseach, reading the Financial Statement for the Minister for Finance, appealed to the patriotic sentiments of the people and, in particular, asked for restraint, asked the people to tighten their belts and, as it was put, to refrain from plucking the fruit before it was ripe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley, adopted the same line of argument and was particularly serious in his appeal to the people.  He appealed to Deputies on all sides of the House to co-operate with the Government in advising the people to be careful, to have patience, to tighten their belts.  This appeal by the Taoiseach and his Ministers to the patriotic sentiments of the people sounds very hollow, coming as it does from a Government who, on numerous occasions over the past decade, have not hestitated to sacrifice the national interest for the sake of temporary, political, party advantage.  As I said earlier, this appeal by Government speakers is nothing less than arrant hypocrisy.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach and his Ministers how can they expect the people to listen to and to respond to such exhortations while, at the same time, we have a Government who are synonymous with high spending, high living, and land and property dealing.  It is difficult for the people to take seriously a Government who have both encouraged and condoned the existence of a diabolical system of political patronage.  This diabolical system of political patronage has come to be known as &ldquo;Taca&rdquo;.  In my opinion <Col N="524" /> Taca has done more to damage national morale and has done more to create unrest and dissatisfaction than any other single political act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have said what I wanted to say.  The Budget is a bad Budget and I fear it will have disastrous repercussions on industry, agriculture and tourism.  It is an unjust and an unfair Budget because the increase in the turnover tax will hit the underprivileged sections of our community hardest of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to congratulate the Minister on the increases he has given to the recipients of social welfare benefits.  No one would deny these increases to the weaker sections among us.  I should like to advert to the tax imposed for the purpose of giving these increases, some of which I shall deal with in greater detail later.  There have been a number of complaints that there are unscrupulous shopkeepers charging tax in excess of what would appear to be just.  There are others who are charging tax which is quite fair and just.  It was brought to my notice recently that one penny turnover tax is being charged by some shopkeepers on chocolate bars labelled eight pence. I was informed by a member of the wholesale trade that the manufacturers issued a circular recently indicating there was to be no price increase in the lower priced chocolate bars and that turnover tax would be included in the purchase price.  Many retailers displayed notices in their windows indicating a price in which the turnover tax was included.  Now, with this notice still in the window, they are charging the five per cent tax.  A very strict watch will have to be kept initially on these people who are trying to make a quick &ldquo;buck&rdquo;.  There are too many of them.  There have been many complaints <Col N="525" /> and I would ask the Minister to ensure that this practice is checked at the earliest possible moment and that an example is made of profiteers and racketeers who try to extract the last penny from the housewife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be talking about the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation is developing and may develop still further.  Steps must be taken now to ensure that the price charged is just and proper.  No one objects to paying tax to help the weaker sections of our community.  The Labour Party, and of course the Fine Gael Party, voted against the necessary increases and thereby voted against increasing social welfare benefits.  While people are prepared to pay tax so that the weaker sections will get necessary and desirable increases they are also anxious that the housewife should get ample protection.</P>
      <P>There is evidence of an unrealistic price structure backed up by all sorts of gimmicks in order to attract custom. These caravans, woolly dogs and so forth, have to be paid for by the community at large and some sections are, therefore, paying more than is necessary. The elimination of gimmicks would ensure a more realistic price structure and better value for the housewife.  This price structure system is objectionable and undesirable.  It puts an undue burden on some sections. It has been suggested that these gimmicks are channelled into certain counties and towns in an attempt to attract custom.  There is some justification for that suggestion and the net result is that those living in the areas in which the gimmicks are operated are paying more so that the producers who are endeavouring to boost sales will reap the benefit.  This system is just as inequitable as is the system under which turnover tax is imposed on commodities already carrying the tax.  I would ask the Minister to take a very realistic look at this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in relation to the tax paid various other gimmicks are being introduced by manufacturers to ensure that the taxation system does <Col N="526" /> not catch up with some of the retailers. This is done in a variety of ways such as by supplying people to dress the shops and by supplying assistants to carry out work in those shops.  They are unable to reduce the prices of commodities which they supply to the shops any further but they provide assistants or people to dress the windows and shelves and ensure that there is a higher turnover and that these shopkeepers get a greater concession than others in the same trade.  Therefore, there is unfair competition in this respect.</P>
    <P>I understand that many shopkeepers buy for cash and these transactions do not go through the books and are not, therefore, liable for taxation.  Such people are taking from the citizens money to which they are not entitled and for which they are not accounting. All these matters should be examined in detail to ensure justice for the people who are willing to pay the tax to provide the benefits that are being given.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal in detail with the various reductions in income tax.  In the main, these make due allowance in the case of the lower income group for the increases in the price of foodstuffs and other commodities affected. Almost every section of the lower income group is covered by tax reductions which will more than offset the extra amount they will pay in the year if they are paying a just amount of 2½ per cent more.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have other increases for the weaker sections of the community. It is regrettable that Fine Gael and Labour see fit on this occasion to come together and vote against the financial resolution necessary to give these increases to the farmers, the unemployed, the widows and orphans, deserted wives and other people mentioned in the benefits.  In the past the Labour Party voted for taxes where these were diverted to social welfare benefits.  On this occasion they are taking instructions from their new masters, Fine Gael, and they disregarded their speeches in the past and voted in the same lobby with Fine Gael who over the years have a record of voting against increases for this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> I can well understand the motives of some of the parties who voted against the financial resolution.  Taking the Fine Gael Party, if we go back a short while and examine their interest in the social welfare code, we find that, as reported in volume 242 of the Official Report for 19th November, 1969, there was a Private Members' motion by Fine Gael which said:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann favours the establishment of a comprehensive national pensions scheme, based upon insurance contributions by all persons with income, to create an adequate system of social security to provide for people in old age, sickness and disability, unemployment and for dependants on death.</P>
    <P>This was moved by Deputy Belton and Fine Gael's interest is clearly shown by the fact that he could not get a seconder from his own party and the motion had to go by the board.  The tears shed by Deputy Belton were in vain when he could not get a seconder among the members of Fine Gael. This indicates the Fine Gael outlook on social services.  This is not new.  It is important that this should be noted by anybody interested in the social outlook of Fine Gael in regard to the needy sections of the community.</P>
    <P>If this is not enough to convince people that Fine Gael have no interest in the needy sections&mdash;probably this was the reason prompting them to vote against the financial resolution&mdash; let me recall that on Wednesday, 3rd December, 1969, the following motion was put down:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is concerned about the plight of old age pensioners, particularly those living on their own, and calls for substantial improvements in their pensions and the provision for them of a comprehensive home-help and meals service.</P>
    <P>The amazing thing about this motion was that, having been moved, proposed and seconded, the motion again went by the board because not a single member of Fine Gael was present to support it when it was put by the Chair.  This gives one an idea of the type and outlook of individuals forming <Col N="528" /> the Fine Gael Party.  In one instance they could not get a seconder for the motion and in the other they got a seconder but when the motion was put, there was no Fine Gael member in the House to support it any more than there was any member of the Labour Party present to support it.  This gives one a better idea of the tie-up that has been becoming apparent for some time between Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Black Panther section.  The statement of the Minister for Finance outlined many concessions. For example, the basic rate for contributory old age pensions will be increased by 17s 6d to £5 per week and the non-contributory old age pensions by 10s to £4 5s per week.  Fine Gael <Col N="529" /> and Labour were against these increases because they voted against the financial resolution.</P>
      <P>Personal disability, unemployment and sickness benefits will be increased by 15s a week to £4 10s a week and the personal rate of unemployment assistance by 10s to £3 12s and £3 6s in urban and rural areas respectively. Again Fine Gael were not concerned about the disabled, the unemployed or the person on unemployment assistance. I can understand Fine Gael not being concerned about those on unemployment assistance because there was no unemployment assistance when they were in power in the not-too-distant past but the fact that the Labour Party decided to adopt the same principle and policy as Fine Gael shows clearly that there is a change in the political arena.</P>
      <P>The coming together of these two parties and the fact that the instructions are coming from the Fine Gael benches as to how they should vote are borne out in their action in the Dáil quite recently.  The widows' contributory pension will be increased by 15s and 12s 6d a week, as appropriate, to £4 10s, and the widows' non-contributory pension will be increased by 11s 6d to £4 5s.  They were not considering the widows' pensions.</P>

      <P>That is only the start of it.  A scheme for deserted wives was brought into operation on 1st October and, under this scheme, they will qualify for a weekly allowance equivalent to the non-contributory widows' pension.  Again, they have no time for the deserted wives.  I can understand their mentality in voting against the financial resolution.  Of course, this is an unforgivable sin as far as the Labour Party are concerned, although on previous occasions they voted against the necessary money resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this occasion when the increases were so substantial, the highest increases in the history of the State across the board, it is easy to understand the mentality of the Labour Party in voting <Col N="530" /> against the financial resolution in the hope that the weaker section of the community would not get an increase and they could say that, in the past, they gave some of these people 10d a week.  When the Labour and Fine Gael Coalition were in office there were no increases of 10s, or 15s, or 12s, or 17s 6d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back to the two periods of Coalition Government between the Labour and Fine Gael Parties, they gave a miserable increase of 10d a week.  They stabbed some of our mothers and fathers in the back, just as the Fine Gael Party in the past stabbed our grandfathers and grandmothers with the contribution they gave.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the 10d a week in the first and second period of Coalition Government, this would seem to be a set policy and a set amount.  To give this 17s 6d increase to the old age pensioner, at the rate of 10d a week, the rate at which Fine Gael gave an increase, it would have taken 21 years. To give the non-contributory increase it would have taken 12 years.  Old age pensioners cannot wait for 21 or ten years.  They want the increase now, and they got it from us.  This is the pattern we see in the Coalition contribution. They were in power on two occasions and the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, was Minister for Social Welfare on the last occasion and he dished out a miserable 10d a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> The increase of 10s 6d which was given in relation to unemployment assistance would have taken 12.6 years at the Coalition rate.  The unemployed would have had to wait for 12.6 years to get the increase they got on Budget day this year.  There is no reason to believe that they would have got it at the same rate because, what they wanted to do by voting against the financial resolution, was to give them nothing.  It would have taken the Labour and Fine Gael Parties 235 years to give out at 10d a week what we gave in one day.  This is an indication of the mentality of the people who voted against it.  In other cases it would have taken 356 years.  The people cannot wait that long.  They are looking for immediate benefit.</P>
    <P>We see that in the period when the Labour and Fine Gael Parties came together they gave this miserable increase of 10d a week.  On the old age pension book at the moment there is an overstamp of £1 for the husband and wife in the case of contributory old age pensioners.  Very shortly there will be another overstamp for 17s 6d.  These overstamps are very important.  At another time, this is the type of overstamp that was on the old age pension book.  It was to do with the Old Age Pensions Act of 1924: &ldquo;This old age pension order is to be taken as representing a sum of 1s less than the sum mentioned on the face of the order.&rdquo; This is an historical document and, for the benefit of the younger Members of the Dáil, I should like to place it before the House so that they can have a look at this important overstamp which was placed on the order by the Fine Gael Party, which again shows their complete disregard for this section of the community.</P>
    <P>I am very happy that the Minister has brought in this new scheme for deserted wives.  It is long overdue.  It would have taken the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, at their rate of contribution to the social welfare classes, 102 years to provide this assistance.  A deserted wife cannot wait that long.</P>

      <P>These things do not worry the Fine Gael and Labour Parties because for too long they have been pushing these sections of the community.  This is a very important scheme and it is not before its time.  As time goes on I am quite sure that, since the amount which old age pensioners and others are receiving is still not adequate, when the necessary finances are available, there will be further increases to ensure that the weaker sections of the community are no longer trampled upon even if the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party continue to oppose increases.  They did this in no uncertain terms the other day.</P>
      <P>I feel sorry for some members of the Labour Party who may have wanted to vote for the resolution but the instructions came from &ldquo;Lady FitzGarret&rdquo; or Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish had to fall into line. There was a complete sellout of the Labour Party.  They were crowing about the victories they had, but I should like to congratulate Fine Gael on winning 19 seats in two by-elections. There was a complete take over of the Labour Party.  They sold themselves out lock, stock and barrel. As Deputy O'Leary said last Sunday, they prefer to wait until after the election before talking about coalition.</P>

      <P>The contributory old age pension is now £5 a week.  When the Deputy's party were on this side in 1957 it was 24s.  That is a very substantial increase.  The non-contributory pension has been increased from 24s to £4 5s.  That, again, shows the outlook of this Government.  They have ensured each year since 1957 that everybody in the social welfare classes was covered by increases.  Disability allowances were increased from 30s to £4 10s.  Widows' contributory pensions were increased from 30s to £4 10s and their non-contributory pensions have gone up from 30s to £4 5s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> There is no need for me to labour further the point about increases throughout the whole range of social welfare benefits.  They are to be found in the summary of the social services. In case there are people who are not aware of them, I should like just to mention the substantial number of benefits that are available and the increases which have been given in existing benefits.  Unemployment and occupational injury benefits have been increased, contributory and non-contributory old age pensions, infectious diseases benefits, treatment benefits, widows' non-contributory pensions, widows' contributory pensions, unemployment assistance in all forms have all been increased.  As well, as a result of Fianna Fáil's social conscience, there is now free travel for pensioners, free electricity, free radio and television licences, free fuel.  They are only some of the benefits.</P>
    <P>They are only some of the reasons why the money is required.  They are an indication of where the money goes. I am sure that if there is any social conscience left in the two parties across the House they will examine the position in detail and change their minds when next they are asked to meet the bill.</P>
    <P>We need not look back to 1957 to realise the value of the increases that have been granted in social welfare benefits.  In 1967 there were social welfare increases of 5s a week for contributory and non-contributory pensioners.  There was the introduction of the free electricity scheme. Public service pensions were increased by 12 per cent.  In 1968 non-contributory pensions were increased by 7s 6d a week; there were increases in the infectious diseases maintenance allowances and there was an increase of 2s 6d in the children's allowances. Again, there were free television and radio licences.  Old IRA pensioners were given free electricity, television and radio licences.  Schedule A income tax was abolished and a special personal allowance was given for married men in the first year of marriage.  In 1969, there was an increase of 15s a month for the second child and the allowance for the third child was increased to 40s.  There were other social <Col N="535" /> welfare increases of 10s a week.  When Labour and Fine Gael were in power one class of social welfare recipients got tenpence a week and no one else got anything.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are several other improvements in the social welfare benefits which indicate the social conscience of this party and the people who support us.  There have been a variety of tax reliefs but the list is so long that I do not propose to bore the House with it, merely to recommend that Fine Gael and Labour have a look at them so that they might be converted from their policy of crushing them when they were in power.  Their actions in the past indicated that they had no desire to help these classes, the weaker sections in the community.</P>
    <P>There was much reference during the debate by Fine Gael and Labour to what they termed the destruction of the Dublin City Council.  I was a member of the city council at the time when the council divided on the health estimates. We in Fianna Fáil wanted to provide the financial wherewithal for widows and orphans, for the weaker sections of our community, and Labour and Fine Gael members decided to vote against the allocation of the necessary money for this purpose.  That is why the council divided on that occasion. The Fianna Fáil group were the only people who supported the provision of the necessary money to maintain the health services.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have no interest whatsoever in the problems which affect certain sections of our community; that much has been made very evident by their contributions to this debate.  Just consider the claim by Deputy O'Donovan that he was the person who conceived the idea of reducing the size of the loaf while maintaining the price rather than increasing the price of the then standard loaf. Deputy O'Donovan and others on the Opposition benches who have no sympathy for the plight of our aged, our widows, our orphans, our disabled, our dependent children, our deserted wives, and so on, resent the increase in the turnover tax which is designed to provide <Col N="536" /> revenue to give increased assistance under this Budget to the needy. Furthermore, there is now something for an only child and for the first child of a family.  Deputy O'Donovan said he would not give any allowance for the first child.  Many a parent with only one child is in need of that allowance. There is no reason why the unfortunate woman with only one child should be robbed of that allowance by Deputy O'Donovan and the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Many families in the Deputy's constituency would be very glad of Deputy O'Donovan's suggestion which did not consist solely of what the Deputy has said.  Why not give his suggestion in full?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given substantial increases to the large families in my constituency and in every constituency. The day is not far distant when the children's allowances will be increased still further.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan also considered that unemployment is a cure for inflation. Fianna Fáil want to maintain the present level of employment and to increase it to the greatest possible degree.  Deputy O'Donovan's theories were very prevalent in 1957 when we had 100,000 unemployed and when 60,000 a year were taking the emigrant ship.  Fianna Fáil do not wish to witness such a situation again.  At that time by virtue of the ineptitude of the second Coalition Government, our building industry was at a standstill and those who had worked in it had emigrated.  In the capable hands of Fianna Fáil, the present inflationary trend can be curbed by our Minister for Finance without resorting to the brutal tactics suggested by Deputy O'Donovan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had quite a variety of speakers from the Labour Party and from Fine Gael in this debate&mdash;the capitalist socialists and the socialist capitalists and the progressive reactionaries.  They have one basic understanding about our social welfare classes: by resisting the turnover tax they are resisting increased benefits for them.  Having heard so much about this, that and the other type of socialism, one would <Col N="537" /> like each member of the Labour Party to explain to which particular section of it he belongs and which particular type of socialist policy he favours&mdash; ranging from all black to deep pink and some of them verging a little towards the shade of red.  Certainly, they do not all stand for the one policy. The only thing they have in common is their opposition to the turnover tax which, in turn, means opposition to increased social welfare benefits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I support any type of taxation that will ensure that the weaker section of the community is adequately catered for and that will be for the benefit of the nation.  The turnover tax was introduced to benefit the categories I have already mentioned. In politics, the people are more apt to support the honest man than the fake.</P>
      <P>Care of the aged is a pressing problem but it does not seem important to Fine Gael or to Labour.  The care of the aged is important to Fianna Fáil and whatever taxation is necessary to assist this section of our community&mdash;as, indeed, other worthy sections, too&mdash; will be imposed.  Fianna Fáil are not fakes.  Fianna Fáil produce the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such services as meals-on-wheels and home nursing have been in operation in many places for a considerable <Col N="538" /> number of years and the Minister referred to them in much detail in his Budget statement.  He has promised to encourage greater development in the part being played by the various voluntary organisations by making more money available for these services. When Fine Gael put down a Private Members' motion relating to these matters they were aware that the matter had already been outlined by the Minister for Health.  I participate personally in the distribution of meals-on-wheels so that I am fully aware of the problems involved, as I am aware also of the improvements that can be made in the system.  In reference to the work being done by these voluntary organisations the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Health Estimate already includes £100,000 for grants by health authorities to these voluntary organisations. I am adding an extra £150,000 this year to this sum making a total provision of £250,000 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The need for voluntary organisations to help in the provision of these services cannot be over-stressed.  We must thank those people for the wonderful work they are doing in providing these services.  The Minister has promised to provide practical assistance for these organisations to help them intensify and extend their work.  I hope that in time to come the other parties will take an interest in these problems just as we are doing.</P>
    <P>In Crumlin, Drimnagh and other areas, there are excellent social workers concerned with the problems of the aged.  I would say that the Crumlin social welfare service is probably one of the best in the country. It is a service which is expanding all the time.  We would hope that when such organisations are being set up and extended in other areas, they will seek the advice of those who have been engaged in this type of work for so long.</P>
    <P>I note that there is an increase of 14 per cent for public service pensioners, including retired civil servants, gardaí, teachers, members of the Defence Forces and local authority pensioners and their widows where service <Col N="539" /> terminated before the 11th round. This is a matter with which I am much concerned.  These people who have given such loyal service up to the time of their retirement are entitled to this increase and I hope that in time we will be able to afford them even a greater increase so that justice will be done to them in full.  Up to now they may have been lagging a little behind other categories but the Minister has made a substantial effort to right that situation.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy's party were in power the workers were in Birmingham, London and elsewhere. The Minister has offered a new retirement scheme to temporary full-time State employees who have not hitherto been pensionable.  This scheme, according to the Minister's statement, will affect more than 10,000 unestablished State employees.  It is good that this particular section of the community are being helped in this way but why do the trade unionists in the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald spoke about the turnover tax.  He told us it would be disastrous.  He is not in favour of the turnover tax because he voted against it.  I have a book here called &ldquo;Administration&rdquo;.  It is the journal of the Institute of Public Administration of Ireland, Volume 15, No. 3, and it makes very interesting reading.  I quote from page 286 :</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald's main point of attack is the committee's failure to recommend the abolition of rating in favour of some other form of taxation...  According to Senator FitzGerald, turnover tax at an average of 5½ per cent over the whole country would have brought in a sum equivalent to the entire rates burden in 1960-61.  Thus rates are done away with easily and simply and everyone is happy, except presumably the members of the InterDepartmental Committee.</P>

      <P>It says further on :</P>
      <P>But who could prove that turnover tax is more equitable or more politically acceptable than rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on to state the effect it would have and gives the comments of the person who prepared the article.  It is very interesting indeed that Deputy FitzGerald suggested an average of 5½ per cent turnover tax in 1968 and now he is not in favour of 5 per cent, not <Col N="541" /> even to assist the widow, the orphan, the unemployed, the old aged, the deserted wife, the unestablished State employee, the meals-on-wheels service. He is not in favour now.  I wonder why.</P>
    <P>I want to express my deepest sorrow to the Leader of the Labour Party that this year he had to do what Deputy Cosgrave told him to do and voted against these things.  In the past he always stated he was in favour of supporting taxes the benefits of which were to be passed on to social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>In the capital budget under the heading &ldquo;Housing&rdquo; we can see the increases given in this field this year to ensure that housing is maintained at the high rate that has been going on for some time.  We heard much criticism about the production of local authority houses.  Indeed, I too would like to see more houses built.  I know there is full employment in the building trade.  I know it would be impossible to double the output because we would not have the building workers.  I am aware also of the demands on the local authority in this city and also the reason for the demands. We are told 10,000 people are in need of housing accommodation while the records of the housing authority show that there are somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000.  At page 32 of &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;<Col N="542" /> under the heading &ldquo;Housing Costs&rdquo; we see the percentage increases in population in Dublin city and county. From 1951 to 1956 it was 1.84; from 1956 to 1961 it was 1.89 and from 1961 to 1966 it was 10.68.  This gives some indication of the increase in population which, of course, brings an increased demand.  This is one of the factors but still there are not 10,000 people in need of housing accommodation as has been stated by some speakers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made provision for additional moneys to be paid to local authorities this year.  On page 19 of the <i>Capital Budget 1970</i>, it says that capital expenditure on grants for the erection and reconstruction of houses and on loans for local authority houses will amount to £16.7 million in 1970-71 representing an increase of £3.5 million on the outturn for 1969-70. It goes on:</P>
      <P>This increased level of capital expenditure reflects the rising demand for private houses from persons in the lower and middle-income groups.</P>
      <P>One can see, therefore, that the economy is buoyant, that there is this demand by people to purchase their own homes and the Minister recognises this and makes more money available.</P>
      <P>The next paragraph relates to the National Building Agency:</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure by the National Building Agency Limited in 1969-70 totalled £0.5 million.  The allocation for 1970-71 is £0.85 million.</P>
      <P>I feel the National Building Agency could be used to a greater degree by industrial concerns whose workers need housing accommodation.  They could assist themselves by having houses for their workers erected adjacent to their industrial set-up.  When they take in workers from outside the city they are responsible to some degree for the increase in population and therefore they have a responsibility to ensure that the workers they bring in are adequately housed.  Greater attention should be paid to the National Building Agency for this purpose.  It says here that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firm orders have been placed by <Col N="543" /> the Industrial Development Authority or by various firms which will give rise to the completion by the Agency of about 350 houses to serve industrial development in 1970-71 as against a programme of 132 completions in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>This is still not enough.  Much more use could be made of the NBA.  They have got additional moneys this year to ensure that they will be geared for greater development and expansion as the situation demands.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Sanitary and Miscellaneous Services&rdquo; it says :</P>
    <P>Water supply and sewerage schemes now being carried out by local authorities represent a pool of work exceeding £10 million in value. Major works are in progress or pending in the Dublin area which will provide sewerage services for approximately 23,000 acres and will improve the water supply to the city and serve a major part of the north county area.</P>
    <P>It is very important that these schemes should go ahead.  They have been responsible, to some degree, for the holdup in the development of the area.  The obstacles that have been put in the way of the corporation in the past in relation to the south city sewerage must be overcome at an early stage in order to ensure that industries with a higher labour content can be established in the south-west area.  At the moment the type of industry that can be established in the south-west area of this city is the type that does not make a great contribution by way of labour because of restricted sewerage facilities.  We may be in a position shortly with those schemes proceeding to open up not only the south county area but also the north county area as indicated here.</P>
    <P>Expenditure under vocational schools is being increased from £1.51 million in 1969-70 to £1.75 million in 1970-71. The major proportion of this expenditure is for new vocational schools, extension to existing schools throughout the country and the provision of prefabricated classrooms.  This is very desirable in order to meet the population <Col N="544" /> expansion in Dublin city.  I am glad to see that this aspect has received this increased amount of money.  If further money is required it should be readily available under this heading. Expenditure on comprehensive schools for 1969-70 was £150,000 and in 1970-71 this will be increased to £450,000.  That is a substantial increase also.  Expenditure on secondary schools in 1969-70 was £2,464,000 and in 1970-71 it will be £2.75 million.</P>
    <P>Our hospital services have been criticised.  In 1969-70 the expenditure on hospital services was £2.93 million and in 1970-71 it will be £3.6 million. Those increases indicate a viable economy and we hope that as time goes on this will be progressively increased. The building programme for 1969-70 will cover urgent and essential work.  Special emphasis was laid on the provision of improved or new accommodation and facilities for the mentally handicapped and for the aged.  At the same time essential improvements in the general hospital and mental hospital fields were provided for us as far as possible.  Elm Park Hospital will be completed during the coming year.  Some of it is already in use at the moment.</P>
    <P>The mentally handicapped have been overlooked for too long.  Much needs to be done in this area of the health services.  A new unit at Beaumont for severely disturbed children was completed in 1969, also a new 40-bed patient unit at Lisnagree, County Limerick.  Adaptation works were carried out at St. Patrick's Hospital, Kilkenny and we have first stage developments of a major scheme to provide a modern new centre at Tracton Park, Cork.  Major new centres are planned at Galway and Limerick and a number of new units for adult mentally handicapped at various centres are at present at the initial planning stage.  One can see that no section is overlooked in the Minister's Budget.</P>
    <P>There is particular emphasis on the provision of active treatment psychiatric units at some general hospitals. Work is in progress on a unit at St. Kevin's hospital, Dublin and other units are being planned for the regional hospitals at Galway and Limerick.  I <Col N="545" /> was at a function in St. Kevin's recently and I saw the work in progress. It is heartening to see that this need is being met to some degree at the moment.  Taking the hospital situation all in all, quite a substantial amount of work has been done although we know quite an amount of work needs to be done and can only be done by greater effort on the part of everyone.  We all desire that much should be done in this regard and it is up to us to ensure that the work will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The development of Dublin Airport is another very important factor in our future development.  Many Members of this House recently availed of the opportunity to visit the airport.  We had a trip on an Aer Lingus plane. We saw the hangars and the loading bays.  We inspected the computer section and had discussions with Mr. Dargan.  He dealt with the development of the company in great detail. It is good to see that money is being made available for the future development of Dublin Airport.  Quite a number of Deputies do not appear to be interested in the airport.  I can well understand that because it is probably a hangover from previous days when they got rid of the aircraft.  Those Deputies still have an opportunity of visiting the airport and discussing matters with Mr. Dargan.  If they want to ask any questions and be brought up to date Mr. Dargan will be glad to help them.</P>

      <P>Not alone did you sell the aircraft but you sold the torpedo boats as well.  Bord na Móna are getting an increased allocation.  Their capital expenditure in 1969-70 was £0.10 million and in 1970-71 this is being increased to £0.18 million.  This is a further indication of the Government's confidence in Bord na Móna and in the personnel employed there. The capital expenditure of CIE in 1969-70 was £3.79 million and in 1970-71 it will be £4.25 million.  A very good job has been done by the company in the replacement of their old <Col N="546" /> vehicles.  The service provided by CIE is very inadequate particularly in Tallaght and other Dublin areas.  There is a long time lag between buses and there is great irregularity due to a variety of factors such as traffic congestion. The workers who live in those areas are very often late for work. Many workers have complained bitterly to me about this.  Something must be done by CIE to ensure that the buses keep to the timetable.  Alternatively, extra buses should be provided to eliminate the time lag.  CIE have very strict rules in relation to workers who arrive late.  If a man is late on a number of occasions he suffers to some degree.  As a result of bad services on some routes CIE are responsible for a substantial number of workers constantly being late for work.  I hope this matter will be rectified in the near future.  I repeat that the replacement of road and rail stock ensures greater comfort for travellers and CIE must be commended for this.</P>
      <P>The technical workers in CIE deserve great credit for their high efficiency. Following the general changes that have occurred in CIE as a result of the changeover from steam to diesel the workers are to be congratulated on their efforts to develop their technical capacity to meet all the requirements of the modern day.  It is a desirable feature that provision is now made for improvement of staff amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 30 of <i>Capital Budget, 1970</i> mention is made of industrial grants. The IDA is again being serviced; provision is made for the sum of £18.5 million in respect of new projects, for payment of grants approved under the re-equipment grants scheme and payment of the increasing number of grants approved under the small industries scheme.  One cannot be too loud in praise of the development of small industries.  The method by which this sector has been developed was outlined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently.  He pointed out the value to the State and the employment that existed in this field.  The re-equipment scheme cannot be left in abeyance by industrialists and every effort should be made by them to reequip <Col N="547" /> themselves and thereby ensure greater efficiency in the future.  Many industrialists have applied for re-equipment grants but some work remains to be done.  We still have time and I hope that the Minister's comments will be heeded by this section.</P>
    <P>Reference is also made to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  This is an important development and shows the confidence Fianna Fáil have in this project, in the industries that were set up there and in the ability of our technicians&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there has been a change lately.  I see &ldquo;Stevie&rdquo; here today.  It is heartening to note that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company now employs 4,399 persons as compared with 4,266 last year. If the Opposition were in power there would be no Shannon Free Airport Development Company and no jobs. At the moment there are 28 manufacturing firms employing a large number of people; 684 houses have been built in addition to 137 flats, and a further 56 houses are under construction. This shows what can be done in an area where we were told rabbits would be running around and that we would have to make needles out of the transmitters.  We have overcome these difficulties and the men who made these statements are now gone.  This indicates clearly the confidence of successive Fianna Fáil Governments in the Irish worker and in his capacity to do a job and to compete with the best.</P>
      <P>I heard some objectionable references here today to corporation workers.  Our workers in industry or in the corporation are as competent and as efficient as workers in any other country.  A reference was made here today regarding defective workmanship in the servicing of the lifts at Ballymun.  This was made by Deputy O'Leary and I regard it as an insult to the workers of Dublin Corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have given a clear indication of the irresponsibility of Fine Gael and Labour in relation to their decision to oppose the social welfare increases, to oppose the increases to widows, the disabled and the unemployed and to oppose large increases to the various other sections.  I pointed out that if the increases were given at the same rate as those given by the Coalition Government it would have taken 356 years at 10d a week to bring them up to the current level.  Old age pensioners could certainly not afford to wait for the considerable length of time that would be necessary under the Coalition Government to bring them up to their present rate.</P>
      <P>It is notable that in previous years the Labour Party declared that they would support taxes imposed for the purpose of social welfare.  On this occasion they took their orders from Fine Gael and decided not to support those taxes.  This is a rather sad state of affairs and it shows clearly the social thinking behind the Labour Party in relation to increases to the widows, orphans and the unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important to note that in 1968 Deputy FitzGerald <Col N="549" /> indicated that the turnover tax could be increased to 5½ per cent.  He thought that in 1968 the people could pay this increase.  This revenue mainly goes to assist those who need it most.  I shall support any additional taxation that is required in order to ensure that the weaker sections of the community will be catered for adequately.  Each year these people will get the same treatment from Fianna Fáil and they will not be stabbed in the back as they were in relation to the 10d a week. Many people, including Labour Party supporters, are now aware that all the talk about social welfare was useless and I am quite sure it will have the same response the next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Little now remains to be said on this Budget.  Most of the faults of this Budget have been adequately covered earlier in the debate.  However, there is a tradition of the House that one picks out certain relevant features on which to comment and I do not propose to be very long in my comments on the Budget this afternoon but merely to pick out some of its major faults which have been previously referred to and to elaborate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have searched for a phrase or a word to describe the weakness of this Budget.  It has been called an unimaginative Budget and so on.  It certainly cannot be described as a courageous Budget.  It marks a retreat from the reality of the Irish economic position and, for &ldquo;the party of reality&rdquo;, which boasts a more intimate contact with reality than any other political party, this Budget marks a shameful retreat from some of the major problems confronting the economy.  As the commentators have remarked nothing has been done in this Budget to combat inflation. Another remarkable thing is that the most influential critics of its provisions have come not from political parties but from neutral groups outside this Parliament.  From bankers, trade unionists, economists, there has been a tirade of criticism.  People have recognised that the provisions of this Budget show no awareness on the part of the Minister for Finance of the dangers facing this economy.  Little has <Col N="550" /> been done to stem the rising flood of inflation, or to turn back pressures that are building up in both wage and price increases.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate we have concentrated on the criminal folly of the increase of 2½ per cent in the turnover tax.  The statisticians may say that in the general price index there will be an increase of merely 3½ per cent as a result of this 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax, but in practical terms for the majority of the working population, the people who are forced to buy several small items each week, who must spend a greater proportion of their income on foodstuffs and other necessities, this increase will be much more.</P>
    <P>The halfpenny has been abolished, and therefore a 1½d increase in 5s will, in effect, be 2d or 3d.  The moment of recognition for the women of this country of the effect of this Budget came last Friday when they went to shop.  There they saw the reality of the Budget which was so pleasingly represented as an attempt to redistribute income.  They saw some of the first effects of this inflationary and criminally irresponsible Budget. Throughout the rest of this year they will see more price consequences of this inflationary Budget.  They will see further price increases and their husbands will find themselves with only one reaction to these price increases, to look for further wage and salary adjustments.</P>
    <P>Therefore we come to one of the major criticisms of this Budget, that what it suggests it does it does not do. It is suggested of this Budget that it indicates a social conscience, that it is one that passes cash from those who have to those who have not.  In this connection there was a most interesting article by Professor P. R. Kaim-Caudle which was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> of Thursday last, 30th April, and I wish to quote its conclusion:</P>
    <P>However, large sections of the population who certainly are far from well off will actually be worse off as a result of the Budget.</P>
    <P>That is not the conclusion of any <Col N="551" /> man with an ideological axe to grind but of an impartial sociologist examining the effects of this Budget.  One may question whether or not it was necessary to give income tax relief to those on unearned income over £7,000 or £5,000 a year, who are certainly not as pressed as those under £20 a week.  If the Minister for Finance were anxious to help those really feeling the effect of price increases he would have released totally from income tax obligations those under a certain weekly income. We find in fact that global relief is given to those on unearned income from investments of £5,000 a year. They are treated with the same compassion as those in the poverty belt.</P>
    <P>This is all of a piece with the Government's approach to taxation.  It will be recalled that two years ago they showed their concern for those paying surtax.  Of course our ears have been deafened by the complaints about how hard our hearts are in the Labour Party, that we have voted against social welfare benefits.  In this Budget we have voted against the overwhelming increase in the cost of living which will arise from this Budget.  Last year there was an increase of 1s 8d in the social welfare contribution so we can conclude that the increase will be about 2s on this occasion.  This again means an increase in the burden of taxation for the majority of the population.</P>
    <P>One might say this is a Government with a large and secure majority, a Government in a position to take unpopular measures were these measures necessary, a Government in the strongest political position to take decisive corrective measures where the jobs of our people are at stake.  Instead, we see the Government taking a gamble, taking a risk.</P>
    <P>That may, of course, be the essential character of the attitude of the Government towards economic decision, as it has been the attitude of the Government in more trying times.  It was the attitude of this Government to take a risk, to take a chance, to tell lies, last year.  You recall the Minister for Finance, for political reasons, was <Col N="552" /> forced into that uncomfortable position last year, that at first there was a crisis and then there was not a crisis and the understandable reason for this deceit was, of course, the pending election.  We can understand the Minister's dilemma.  Why, though, must we have a repetition of this deceit this year when, with a safe electorate majority, the Government do nothing about the inflation which every economist sees gripping the economy?</P>

      <P>The deceit was in a pre-election announcement in March last year that we had a very sharp crisis and then before the election it turned out that there was no crisis. As I say, there was an understandable reason for that change of mind.  We understand the expediency that dictated that change of heart.  Most people comment quite sensibly that it seems impossible that the Government will not be forced to some further measures in the autumn.  Predicted by economists this year is a balance of trade deficit in the region of £90 million.  It seems that some measures may be necessary by the autumn of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must see the 100 per cent jump in turnover tax as the first instalment of the admission price of our entry into the Common Market because&mdash; and this is the significance of this&mdash; already the Commission has laid down, with the value added tax regulation, that by the mid-seventies there should be a taxation rate of 15 per cent in most of the Common Market countries. There has been an extension for both Belgium and Italy so far but they must harmonise taxation rates.  Ours at the moment at a figure of 5 per cent must reach by the middle seventies something like 15 per cent.  So, despite the difference between a turnover tax and a value added tax, we can see that the Minister for Finance must continue in the general direction of a higher taxation figure.  I think it is correct to see this increase in taxation as the first instalment on the entry price of this country into the Common Market and housewives and ordinary people all over the country are at present <Col N="553" /> paying the first instalment of that entry price.</P>
    <P>So, we can predict with absolute certainty a dizzy increase in taxation by the Government over the next two or three years and we must also bear in mind that from January of next year with decimalisation, there will be a further administratively easy method to increase taxation levels.  The primrose path to economic perdition on the part of this Government will be that much easier after January of next year when a 1 per cent increase will give the Minister for Finance an extra £9 million.  There would be temptation to go to 2 per cent which would produce £18 million.  It would be a simple matter, with the decimalisation system, to administer such increases in taxation.</P>
    <P>Of course, the real risk being taken as a result of the flight of this cowardly Government from reality, this cowardly Administration, with its electoral majority, is being taken at the expense of young people searching for employment, those young in employment and those looking for employment, the young people in western counties. They are the people who are taking the risk for the Government's failure to take decisions at this time to safeguard the economy.</P>
    <P>Kaim-Caudle wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>The general lack of severity of the Budget may be reflected in a slowing down of industrial expansion. This will affect not those already working in industry not the middle-aged in agricultural and service industries, but young boys in Mayo, Sligo and Donegal who will have to move to London, Birmingham or Coventry, rather than Dublin, Cork or Shannon.</P>

      <P>Kaim-Caudle, in the <i>Irish Times</i> of last Thursday.  This is not, therefore, a Budget which represents any attempt to redistribute income to those really in need.  Those in a good position financially at present are given concessions equally with those who are not and overall the increase in the turnover tax means that <Col N="554" /> the proportion of income spent by working people on living, on foodstuffs and so on, is larger than the proportion of their income spent by those earning larger amounts.  This means that the Government are gaining far more from the less well-off sections as a result of this Budget; they are taking far more back and giving, with great publicity, a very small amount in compensation.</P>
      <P>It is forecast by that august body, the National Industrial and Economic Council, that our balance of payments deficit will go up to £90 million in the current year and they also see prices increasing by another 7 per cent.  It is not quite honest, in a political sense, for the Taoiseach to berate the population for their cupidity in producing this situation because, of the 7.4 per cent price increase that we have had thus far, the Government are responsible for at least 3 per cent, especially in the budgetary policy of the last one and a half years, the November, 1968, Budget, after the referendum.  With no real price control over the same period, we have now reached a point where wages and prices are following one another in a dizzy progression that, seemingly, it is impossible to stop.  Our balance of payments deficit in 1968 was £22 million.  In 1969 there was a deficit of £60 million and it is predicted, for this year, that the deficit will be £90 million.</P>
      <P>With the Government responsible for a great proportion of the price increases, with a worsening balance of payments position, with a higher import imbalance, we cannot in this situation suggest that the fault lies elsewhere. Imports for 1969 amounted to £589 million; imports in 1968 were £496 million&mdash;an increase of 18.7 per cent or £93 million, while exports increased by 11.6 per cent or £38.5 million&mdash;a trade gap there of £218 million.  Over the past year, therefore, there has been an increase of £54 million in our trade gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note, as has already been remarked, that a great proportion of this trade gap occurs in our trade with Britain&mdash;£47 million, in fact&mdash;and, of course, this arises from and is another bitter fruit of, the <Col N="555" /> Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, an agreement which the British have broken consistently since we signed it and one which is now worsening to our detriment by increasing the trade imbalance we have with Britain. Most predictions are that this trade imbalance will get worse as the agreement runs its course.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment the general strategy of this Government. We are not solving our inflationary problem.  We are sailing blissfully on a blue sea of optimism towards Brussels and the Common Market.  Our trading situation with Britain is steadily worsening, our job possibilities are contracting and we are doing nothing to safeguard the jobs we have.  This is tied in apparently with an acceptance that our taxation structure must continue on the lines of more indirect taxation.  This all adds up to an immense gamble with the futures of the people we are elected to represent. The Budget does nothing to meet a situation which farsighted people view with alarm.  It is suggested that the Government are depending on fortuitous circumstances, on chance, to help them solve the present problem.  There must be a sigh of relief in official quarters at the protracted cement strike because that helps, in the jargon of the economist, to damp down demand and act as a brake on the economy generally.  But there are no sighs of relief on the part of those involved directly and indirectly in this dispute in an industry with which the Government are closely associated.</P>
    <P>Over the past month we have had weekend speeches preaching restraint. Recently the Taoiseach asked wage earners to restrict their demands to a 7 per cent increase and that at a time when the cost of living has soared.  I am puzzled as to whether this Government have any policy to deal with this situation.  We have a Budget which does not fairly redistribute wealth. The Government say that the basic prerequisite of any incomes policy must be actually seen in productivity and the redistribution of wealth to help the weaker sections of the community. Here is a Budget which does the <Col N="556" /> opposite.  Those who are worst off will pay most and those who are best off come off most lightly.  This is the Government which asks to be taken seriously when suggesting to wage earners that they should moderate their demands.  It may be argued that the relief given to those with over £5,000 or £7,000 a year will not amount to very much but, when you show by your actions that you are not, in fact, serious about helping those below a certain income while ensuring that those higher up on the scale come better out of the Budget, surely that betrays the social character of the Government?  This Budget is one which could never come from a Government legitimately asking for moderation on the part of those who work for their living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Global relief in taxation is given to those who do not need such relief.  That is the point.  At the other end of the scale the turnover tax will bear most heavily on those with smaller incomes.  More of their earnings will be eroded as a result of the policy of this Budget which will tax them on every purchase.  This Budget will penalise the less well off while helping those who need no help. That is the analysis of those who have examined, as it were, the small print.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous for members of the Fianna Fáil Party to suggest that we are against increases in social welfare benefits.  No one would be elected to this House if he were against increases in social welfare allowances.  I suppose the kind of childish argument to which we have had to listen is best forgotten.  The heart and soul of the Fianna Fáil Party is with the stronger sections in our economy.  They are least concerned with those less well-off. So long as they can get away with the hypocrisy of pretending they are increasing benefits while, in reality, attacking the living standards of working people, they are content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social policy of this Government can be described as a public relations exercise.  It is cynically believed <Col N="557" /> that the people can be codded and, so long as they can, the game goes on. This is not good enough in our perilous economic situation.  The reaction of the trade unions must be a contemptuous rejection of any calls for moderation by this Government.  This Budget contributes to whirlwind inflation. We have had inflation for two years now and the Government continue their folly in the current financial year.  There is no excuse for this.  We would support any taxation measure aimed at a real redistribution of income. That is not done in this Budget. Those under £20 a week will be worse off as a result of this Budget.  It is not in accordance with the facts to suggest that cost-of-living demands can be kept down to 3½ per cent.  Let us consider what the cost of living is likely to be by the autumn of this year.  Our prediction is that there will be a sharp increase.  This will erode wages still further and bring more pressure on trade unions to look for increases.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the Minister for Finance is gambling on having an equal rate of inflation with that in Britain or, perhaps, an increased rate of inflation in Britain.  The hope&mdash;it is only a hope&mdash;is that inflation in Britain will keep a little bit ahead of ours so that we can still export to that country.</P>
    <P>All these hopes on which the Budget is based are totally outside our control; in the areas within our control we have not taken action.  The most severe criticism that can be made of this Budget is that neither the Government, the Taoiseach nor any Minister is morally justified for the remainder of the year in asking any section to &ldquo;lay off&rdquo;.  They have lost any right to suggest that they may counsel sections of the community to moderate their demands.  The green light of this Budget is: If you are strong, become stronger; if you are greedy gobble; continue your attack on prices; let them go upwards.  Sliding on a bubble of expansion we hope things will be all right.  Do not panic.  The balance of payments deficit as forecast by NIEC may be £90 million but when the autumn comes the inflation in Britain may have kept pace with ours or something else may have happened.</P>
    <P>Looking into this Budget I would <Col N="558" /> see a continued increase in inflation with decimalisation next January.  I would also see that obviously the Government are satisfied to continue on their path of more indirect taxation. Most people agree that indirect taxation on purchase goods is finally far more costly and damaging to those who must spend the larger part of their income on living.  In fact, those who are able to put away portion of their income as savings benefit by Government policy, but working families with incomes of from £20 to £30 a week, spending a large proportion of their income on merely living, are penalised in this Budget.</P>
    <P>If we are forced to put up the turnover tax why did we not select the areas which would be effective? Why did we not exclude foodstuffs? The old age pensioner, about whom Deputy Dowling was weeping this afternoon, as a result of this Budget and before getting any increase in the autumn&mdash;an increase for which every member of the population will be paying an extra 2/- a week; we all agree with paying extra in order to give better social welfare contributions &mdash;will be paying more each week on his bread, butter and meat whenever he can get it.  This Budget increases the prices of these goods by 3 per cent or 4 per cent.  How can this Government go out and ask the relations of such people to moderate their demands because the economy is in peril?  This Government cannot do it.</P>
    <P>We have approached the Budget not on any propaganda basis but on the assessments of sociologists and economists who have examined it and seen the inbalance in it, its essentially unfair and punitive nature against those least able to look after themselves and we have condemned the Budget unreservedly and we shall continue to tell the people the actual social nature of the Government, the character of their social legislation.  We shall expose the mean public relations exercise the Budget is and we shall expose the attempt to prove that it is something which it is not, that it provides something for the less well off, underprivileged sections of the community, by giving more in social welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> The most tragic part of the Budget, leaving aside all political differences, is that we are in trouble in this economy and that the Government with their large, safe majority, have neglected to do their duty.  That is the greatest condemnation of this Budget, of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening for the past two hours to other speakers I was tempted to follow Deputy Dowling into avenues of invective and misrepresentation and historical misquotation. To do so would, however, serve very little purpose and would not add much credit to my standing in this House.  I did not think it did much for Deputy Dowling either.  Neither Deputy Dowling nor I are middle-aged or old men and it is not appropriate for us to go back into history and to pick the bones of Budget debates of 30 or 40 years ago for political ammunition.  It may be amusing and may give the Deputy some satisfaction. Perhaps I should not blame Deputy Dowling alone because this happens, on occasion, on all sides of the House but it can scarcely raise the level of the House nor contribute to such a serious debate as this or improve the image of the politician outside the House when people read the kind of mud-slinging, as they call it, that goes on here and which has certainly no relevance to the debate.  For that reason I shall resist the temptation to make that kind of speech.</P>
      <P>The introductory speech on the Budget was punctuated by references to inflation and the danger of inflation. At column 1721 of Vol. 245 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach says:</P>
      <P>Prices here are now moving upwards faster than in most other countries in the OECD and the dangers for the future wellbeing of the country if the trend continues are obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to say that we have dangerous inflationary pressures that are threatening our prospects of future development and causing serious social injustice.  There are other references to <Col N="560" /> inflation and its effects on the economy and, after that, the speech comes to the stage of give and take.  I am no financial wizard or economist and can only judge the merits of what was said from an ordinary man's point of view but the Minister for Finance then appears deliberately to add to the inflationary tendency by increasing prices.  One section of RGDATA is quoted in the morning papers as having been told by the Department of Finance that it would not be sufficient to increase prices by 5 per cent, that the increase would have to be 5¾ per cent if the traders concerned were to recover the tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be deliberately driving up prices as if saying to the people : if you do not come to heel and stop your excessive wage demands this is what will happen.  I will give you increased prices before the wage demands. It seems as if this is to frighten the people and show them what inflation really means.  If the Minister was thinking on these lines when he framed the Budget it was a most irresponsible action to bring in a Budget of this nature.</P>
    <P>I think everybody realises it was inevitable that at some stage the turnover tax would be increased.  I believe it was said during the original debate on the turnover tax that it would never be increased but we are all sufficiently realistic to realise that some Minister for Finance would increase this tax.  I certainly thought this would happen and that next year or some year after decimalisation would be the time when it could be done least painfully by putting on, say, five new pence in the £ which could be increased to six or seven new pence and so on.  Now we have had a 100 per cent jump nine months before decimalisation.</P>
    <P>The increase in turnover tax comes into effect much sooner this time than it did in 1963.  This gave traders and others less chance to prepare for it.  By observation last Friday I believe that prices went up very much more than 2½ per cent.  If one were to judge by the comments of various publicans interviewed over the weekend in the newspapers, public house prices jumped <Col N="561" /> in some cases by as much as 12 per cent.  People can do without drink but the increase in drink prices over last weekend was double what is considered now as the normal budgetary increase, 2d on the pint and 2d on the glass of whiskey.  Again, I am judging by observation and newspaper comment over the weekend and I do not know if this is true, but the point I want to make is that these prices went up now. Speakers from the Government party told us the reason the turnover tax was doubled was to provide social welfare benefits to old age pensioners, widows and others.  Yet, nobody in that category will get any increase until 1st October.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that in the current financial year the cost of the increases for the social welfare recipients will be £5.4 million.  Before the social welfare recipients get one penny of an increase the Government will have collected that £5.4 million from the community at large from the increased turnover tax, whereas the people who will get the increase will pay for it before they get it.  The contributory old age pensioner will have to wait for a further three months.  He will get this much vaunted 17s 6d for only six months of the current financial year.  That means that, instead of 17s 6d, he will get 8s 9d per week for the full year.  He will be paying increased prices for 12 months and he will be given the increase of 17s 6d for only six months of the 12.</P>

      <P>Eleven months, so.  He will not pay it for the month of April of this year.  He will pay it for 11 months and he will be paid for six months.  On the Taoiseach's reckoning the 17s 6d becomes 8s 9d or perhaps 10s.  The dependent relative who was given an increase last year does not get one this year.  The married old age <Col N="562" /> pensioner who has been told he is getting 17s 6d for 12 months will, in fact, be getting 5s a week for the 12 months of this financial year.</P>
      <P>One point I was tempted to throw back at Deputy Dowling was that in 1948&mdash;he was fond of going back to what he called the Coalition days&mdash; the first act of the Coalition Government was to increase the old age pension by 5s a week, which was an increase of 50 per cent on the 10s. pension which had stood for 16 years without being budged.  Now, 22 years later, we discover that when we take away the trappings the increase the old age pensioner and his wife will be getting in the current financial year is 5s. I do not think this will compensate him for the increase in prices.</P>
      <P>I do not know what prompts some traders to seek to increase their prices whenever there is a change in the price structure.  This happened in 1963. Prices went up much more than 2½ per cent and I am afraid that will happen this time.  I am also afraid it will happen again on 15th February of next year on decimal day.  I hope it will not. I hope the traders will behave more responsibly.  We all have a duty to pay our taxes.  We all owe the country something.  I hope the Minister will be very careful to see that the traders who collected what I consider to be much more than the 2½ per cent, and now more than the 5 per cent, in turnover tax pay it back to the Exchequer. They may grouse about being tax collectors but, if the law of the land says they must collect this tax, I hope the Minister has sufficient inspectors around the country to see that they pay the tax and do not put it into their own back pockets as rumour has it is happening in many cases.  This money belongs to the people of this country. It is being paid, reluctantly perhaps, by shoppers in trust to the storekeepers, for the Government, for the people.  Traders who put that money into their own pockets deserve very severe punishment.  They are misusing public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with the inflationary point about which Deputy O'Leary was talking, that is, the dangerous gamble involved in this <Col N="563" /> Budget.  It seems that the Minister is gambling on the British general election at the end of this year and the freeing of the restraint on wages in England.  There have been comments by economists who are better qualified than I am which suggest that wages in England will go up this year by 11 or 13 per cent.  Those figures are tossed around.  The Minister has not even taken the more conservative figure.  He has taken the figure of 13 per cent.  He hopes that this increase in wages, because of the British general election, will allow our goods to remain competitive. I hope that a more studied approach has been given to this Budget but, to an outsider like me, it seems that it is the icing on the cake and not the cake itself.  It appears to give in six or nine months's time but takes immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by quoting from the quarterly handbook of the Department of Labour, <i>Saothair</i>, and particularly the summary which a study group made on their trip to Sweden with regard to industrial relations and the manner in which they have harmonised their industrial relations over there.  The summary states that the re-organisation of industrial relations in Sweden entailed the adoption of voluntary disciplines and involved giving up a certain amount of sovereignty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that anything in the nature of adopting voluntary disciplines or giving up sovereignty, a certain amount or any amount, is unfortunately a little out of fashion in this country at present.  People talk at all times of their rights and not at all often enough of their responsibilities. <Col N="564" /> That quotation might well have been made&mdash;and indeed in many ways it is a paraphrase&mdash;in a Budget speech of a Minister for Finance.  It might equally have been made by a Minister for Justice introducing a Criminal Justice Bill and endeavouring to explain to the people that the rights of one group must in some way be subject to the responsibility and the good of the community.</P>
    <P>It could be said, too, and can be said particularly to the Labour Party, with regard to our potential entry into the EEC, that this will involve voluntary disciplines and to a certain extent giving up a certain amount of sovereignty. If anything is to be achieved in any of these spheres, in the sphere of finance or any other sphere, unless man wants to live to himself alone on his own island he will always have to give up a certain amount of sovereignty to achieve the desired results in the end. I would hope that we will wake up in this country to the fact that the fundamental rights that people talk about so often are not rights when they are demanded to the exclusion of the community interest.</P>
    <P>It might be worth while, although I do not intend to undertake a detailed study particularly at this early stage, to see the effects of this re-organisation in Sweden.  In the years under review in that survey, from 1963 to 1967-68, Sweden lost 26 work days per thousand of the working population.  In the same year Ireland lost 1,210 per thousand. The United States, which is composed of different ethnic groups, different racial tensions and different societies and different views, lost 934.  The United Kingdom also, which all of us will agree is composed of different groups, different interests, as distinct from Ireland, lost only 184 days per 1,000.  I do not have the figures for last year but I understand we have maintained our place in the world league table&mdash;indeed the only world league table we have headed in recent years.</P>
    <P>The one theme which ran through most of the speeches during this debate, and through the Minister's statement as read by the Taoiseach, was <Col N="565" /> the theme of inflation.  That is why I open on this line, on the line of this self-imposed inflation we have been bringing on for a number of reasons. The Taoiseach warned about it before the Budget was introduced when he requested the laying down of guidelines to organised labour and suggested that demands for increases in wages and salaries should be limited to 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputies like Deputy FitzGerald one would think that not only is inflation here but that it is here to such an extent that there is no way to recover from it.  To quote any of the Deputy's statements in the press, to which he is a regular contributor, on radio or in this House, it would seem we are in a state of extreme doom and that only an economic genius can get us out of it.  That is not so and no number of statements like those of Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Ryan will stand up in any appraisal we make of our situation or that outsiders, who perhaps know it better, make.  Indeed outsiders, who are better equipped to be objective, look at us and say: &ldquo;There is a country that has its fair share of prophets of doom, but there is a country that knows what it is about and that will achieve it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the need, however, to restrict demands on the public pocket. As late as this afternoon I was a member of a deputation on drainage and, although I did not expect the people there to accept that their case should be taken in conjunction with those of others, I realised that in pressing their claims exclusively of all others they were being typical.</P>
    <P>The one demand which has been apparent particularly in this country, and which must be satisfied, is the strongest demand on the social conscience of our nation.  That demand has been met.  It has been met in this Budget in a very significant way and it is not enough for us to say that we have overlooked the whole matter of whether our people are worse off or better off.  The Government have met that demand.</P>
    <P>The meeting of that demand has meant that the recurring theme in this <Col N="566" /> and in other Budgets has been an annual round of social welfare increases. The Minister made it clear in his speech that what he was endeavouring to do was to cushion these classes against the fact that they are not organised to the extent that they can insist on demands being met.  The Minister wanted to ensure that this cushioning is done.  It has been done so consistently that I have, without the slightest reluctance, informed people that their pensions will go on increasing. We can say that with confidence unless the boom that is forecast for us really collapses, and I cannot see any sign of that happening.</P>
    <P>The statement is very clear throughout the Budget speech that in many ways we are ensuring we will protect those people against the effects of increased demands by organised groups.  What then, of the voluntary restraint which the country needs primarily?  We need it, whether organised or unorganised, to ensure that the productivity of the country, the development of the country, will not be subjected to the dire hazards associated with such demands.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer for a moment to the history of trade union legislation, to the magnificent fight for rights in this respect.  We need to consider whether in the interests of the trade unions and of all of us we have gone a little too far.  In 1871, the first Trade Union Act was introduced in England.  At that time it was utterly illegal to have a trade union in the sense that it was taken as being a restraint on trade. There was the doctrine that anything which put a restraint on free trade was illegal and therefore that trade unions were illegal.  Rightly so, the trade unions fought to rid themselves of this strong brand of unreasonable illegality and the first breakthrough came in the Act to which I have referred when the notion of illegality which was operated in respect of restraint of trade was lifted.  It was followed by what was termed the Combination Act of 1875 which had provisions in respect of collective bargaining which up to then had been regarded as criminal conspiracy&mdash;nobody was entitled to get in touch with <Col N="567" /> one or two others for the purpose of collective bargaining.  Thereafter, collective bargaining was not regarded as criminal conspiracy and thenceforth it was not a criminal offence to withdraw labour and the sanction of legality was given to strikes.</P>
    <P>Of course any of us would say that it was unjust that the previous situation should have existed.  The unions have long since got over that stage of repression.  The fight for rights started at that time.  It is still continuing and that is why I say that the fight of trade unions should be a fight for responsibility nowadays and not a fight for rights.  The Swedes and the Germans can certainly teach us a little lesson on the question of national responsibility.</P>
    <P>Later still, picketing was legalised with the reservation that picketing was then and is now legalised for the purpose of communicating information to the people concerned who might be doing business with the firm concerned. The one thing that was still illegal then, and still is, was watching or besetting and in any way intimidating or interfering.</P>
    <P>We must admit honestly that we have gone a long way in this country. Incitement, remember, is still a criminal offence.  One sometimes wonders whether or not some small pockets&mdash; who can do all the damage&mdash;have fully realised this.  It is probably just as well that I should speak along those lines on a Budget debate rather than when trade union legislation or criminal justice legislation is being discussed. My desire is to speak fairly and objectively. I do not intend my remarks to be in any way a condemnation of the trade unions&mdash;what they stand for and what they endeavour to do.  There must, however, be a condemnation of some things allegedly done in the name of trade unions although I believe not with the authority of trade unions.</P>
    <P>Under the 1906 legislation the trade unions achieved the last great right. For obvious reasons, they were granted immunity at that time against any actions for tort.  If a union, in its corporate capacity, does any harm to any other section or person, it has an immunity <Col N="568" /> which no other person or section has.  Under that legislation, they cannot be sued for tort.  This was a major breakthrough.  It has placed the trade unions in a very special and privileged position in law.</P>
    <P>Peaceful picketing was finally and fully legalised on the one condition that there must be a trade dispute between employer and employees as to conditions of service.  We have seen picketing here not only in relation to trade unions but even to the extent of pickets on a Minister's house.  We have developed the notion that picketing is not now limited in law; that it can be imposed by any group without official sanction; that it will necessarily have the desired results of frightening, intimidating or pressurising&mdash;something which the law never intended the picket to have.</P>
    <P>The history of our trade unions has been one of extension of rights from a very deprived beginning to a point where I feel it may be extended beyond anything that is right in any sense : I speak not of organised labour in its proper sense but of small splinter groups pretending to act under the umbrella of organised labour.  In view of ever-increasing demands, this marvellous organisation is in danger of losing sight of the aims it set out to achieve.  If this particular tradition of trade unionism is not channelled in the directions its founder members desired then, in many cases, those who may suffer most will be the members of trade unions.  It is the responsibility of the parties immediately concerned to ensure that their work does not go for nothing.  The Swedes have realised this and have therefore enjoyed a magnificent record of industrial relations which has ensured that, if there is inflation periodically in the Swedish community, it is not caused, by any manner or means, by industrial relations there.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said it is useless for the Taoiseach or for anyone else to say that workers should not look for a wage increase beyond a certain percentage because they will not listen.  To a certain extent, I am inclined to agree.  However, Deputy O'Leary went farther : he asked why workers should <Col N="569" /> restrict themselves to a certain percentage in view of the fact that the Government have introduced what he described as this inflationary Budget. So long as immediate responsibility for industrial relations appears to rest on the Government rather than on the parties concerned, the Government are a convenient whipping-boy.  It can be argued, if members of the Oireachtas received increases in their allowances of up to, say, 25 per cent, it is unreasonable to expect workers to restrict themselves to seven per cent.  I strongly suggest that responsibility should rest where it belongs.  We inherited a lot of good things from Britain as well as a hell of a lot of bad things : one of these is trade union development in recent years.  For instance, we have about 140 trade unions here.  Maybe there are more.  Just take CIE as an example.  The executives or stewards of the various unions will have to justify themselves before their members and improve on what the others can get for their members.  How long can we accept and tolerate a situation of leap-frogging and status-seeking, even between unions, which is inherent in a large number of small unions?  I trust that legislation will cope firmly with that problem.</P>
    <P>Let us cast our minds back to the problem facing the Chairman of Congress, as he then was, Senator Dunne and the Marine, Port and General Workers' Union.  The basic trouble was too many small unions, one leap-frogging over the other.  Someone suggested to me that one of the best things the Minister for Finance might have done under this Budget would be to pension off the executives of many of these unions not with a view to infringing on the rights of the workers but with a view to ensuring that their jobs will no longer be in jeopardy.  We cannot hope for this in any legislation; all we can hope for is voluntary restraint.</P>
    <P>Many references have been made to NIEC reports and the views of experts.  If the Government create the machinery for the submission of such reports then the least that can be done is to consider them carefully.  Report No. 27, on Prices and Incomes, will <Col N="570" /> not arouse any reaction amongst those mostly concerned.  It gives a very informed lecture on inflation and its causes which would be suitable for students of economics or students doing a commerce degree.  There are many theories on inflation.  This document recommends something which I feel may be the beginning of a breakthrough, namely, the desirability of establishing a new employer-employee joint body which will act in unison&mdash; that body alone, not the Government&mdash; and regulate wage cycles and price increases generally, though some must always be the responsibility of the Government, and establish the limits within which extra wages can be met and extra prices can be imposed.  Such a body will, of course, use the advice of the Government.</P>
    <P>This is, as I say, very much in line with what has happened in Sweden as in other European countries. Do we in this country know, for instance, that in 1936 Sweden had a record of industrial disputes that would leave our present situation in the shade?  Do we accept that what they have done can also be done by us?  They realised that the situation which they then had could not be tolerated just as we must realise that our present situation of leap-frogging cannot be tolerated any longer.  As Minister for Labour have said so often, and rightly so, it is not for the Government to impose bargains because the people who make the bargains are those who will have to keep them.  In any event, those directly concerned at that time in Sweden, the employers' organisations or, as they are now known, the SAF, and the main workers' organisation which, I suppose, would correspond here to the ITGWU or the ICTU, reached basic agreement on how they would regulate price increases, wage increases and so on.  That happened in Sweden where there is a much greater population than here and where there are 39 affiliated unions to the workers' organisation and 43 affiliated employer associations.</P>
    <P>Their agreement which, with amendments, has lasted up to now was, first of all, based on what were regarded as central wage agreements.  Those concerned <Col N="571" /> operated such agreements at intervals of about two years and any negotiations that took place were at local level.  Such negotiations were conducted within the guidelines and the fixed permanent limits of the figures agreed at central negotiations between the workers' and the employers' main organisations.  This suggestion seems so simple that I am wondering why it has not yet been thought of here but I suppose the main reason is because we have inherited a different system from our historical associates in Great Britain from whom, as I said earlier, we have inherited many great things. However, it seems to me that the sooner we adopt the European system, the better.  When that system was first adopted in Sweden there was a strong rejection of it by the workers.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals was that there could not be a strike in an industry in which less than 4 per cent of the workers involved were affected.  If we had had something on those lines the country would have been saved a very expensive strike.  It is significant that the joint group who went to Sweden and from whose summary I have taken a lot of this information, say now that the very people who will ensure that these binding, major basic agreements are maintained are, above all, the workers and that it is they who will ensure that what they have earned will not be frittered away by inflationary wage demands or, as they are called here, leap-frog increases.</P>
    <P>It has become very clear that the system which has worked in Sweden would also work here.  One of the inherent factors was that the agreement was binding so that failure to keep the agreement was subject to penalty.  I do not wish to dwell at length on this point but I often think of that system when I hear so much talk here about inflation.  One of our problems is that so many groups in the same industry are affiliated to different trade unions. We have, therefore, a situation in which a fitter is looking after a floor sweeper who is looking after somebody else, so that they are all looking after each other.  Other European countries more than 50 years ago saw how ridiculous <Col N="572" /> such a set-up was.  There must be about 50 unions involved in CIE, for example.</P>
    <P>In Sweden, the organisations have judicial court status.  They have the powers of a court and not just powers of recommendation and not just hopeful suggestions.  I am not commenting in any way on the magnificent work that has been done here by the Labour Court.  In fact, in view of the power which our Labour Court have, I am amazed that they have been able to do so much.  Therefore, the Swedes, and the Germans, too, have realised that responsibility for wage negotiations and, may I say, for resulting price inflation, must rest where it belongs and that is on the shoulders of those concerned.  The Government play a supervisory role.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the interests of all we will be able to check inflationary tendencies and, as the Minister said in his speech, we will at least succeed in creating a climate in which this responsibility will rest fairly and squarely where it belongs so that we may have the normal and natural industrial relations which we have not hitherto enjoyed.</P>
    <P>This country is a developing one with rich resources.  It is not, as we were told at school, a country of limited resources.  Any other country can readily realise this.  Coupled with these resources we have great natural manpower so that there is great scope for development unless we, ourselves, stifle that development.  In a troubled world such as this, in which investment is no longer as attractive as it might otherwise be, Ireland is still a haven for attractive investment.  However, that is not the impression one would get from listening to Deputy Donegan who, because somebody he met at a social function told him he had gone to South Africa to set up a factory rather than come here, went on to generalise and inferred that South Africa was more attractive for industrial investment than Ireland. Members of this House should make every effort to encourage people to come here and invest in industry instead of pretending that South Africa, of all places, is the place to go.  We have a <Col N="573" /> lot to offer from the point of view of investment and of productive resources. Perhaps we do not fully appreciate the status of a parliamentary representative as he is appreciated in other countries.  We make statements for the purpose of scoring political points, and a fair few points have been picked up by both sides during this debate.  That may be quoted extensively elsewhere. Whatever political satisfaction there may be in the plug: &ldquo;We are all white; you are all black&rdquo; or <i>vice versa</i>, the long term effect of that will certainly not achieve what we are supposed to be here to achieve.  In any event, we have a quality of life which is the envy of many countries; we have many natural assets and in such a small country we should have a community responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is much to welcome in the Budget.  I do not intend to make political capital of it; I do not think it is appropriate that I should.  However, I should like to welcome, as a gesture, the special responsibility given to the Minister for Lands in regard to Conservation Year.  Whatever about having balance of payments problems or inflationary problems, the worst problem one can have in any country is that of pollution.  All the money in the world is worth little if one cannot live in one's environment.  This is happening on the Rhine in Germany; it is happening in America and it has happened for years in Britain.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for Lands, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government or perhaps with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will ensure that we have conservation legislation to combat pollution.  But for the fact that there are so few of us in such a broad area we would have poisoned ourselves years ago.  We are not by any means, I would say, the most hygiene conscious people, nor have all of us the habit of tidiness.  If we want to preserve Ireland as the kind of country we should all like it to be&mdash;a clean, happy environment&mdash; we will have to introduce effective legislation to control pollution.</P>
    <P>When one hears President Nixon making control of the environment the central theme of his &ldquo;State of the <Col N="574" /> Nations&rdquo; speech one begins to realise how important it is to plan, while there is yet time, for the kind of environment we should like to have here. What we want, then, is to maintain and promote normal and secure living, to develop community concern, to have it realised that there cannot be rights without responsibilities and that we all share community responsibility. These are the things people look for when they are investing in a country.</P>
    <P>Despite all that, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien goes on an apparently casual week-end trip to the North of Ireland and&mdash;if he is quoted correctly in the newspapers&mdash;rather than give a reasonably objective impression of what life is like here, tells them up there that we have greater or at least as much social injustice here as they have.  Is anyone in this House honestly prepared to stand up and say that, or will Deputy Cruise-O'Brien come back into this House and say it now or any other time?  This is the impression given by one of our representatives.  No doubt it has been taken up by the world press, because some people have a habit of saying the kind of thing that gets into the world press&mdash;not that they are always heeded, but nonetheless they are heard.  He went on further to say that we have our &ldquo;Paisleys&rdquo; here.  Deputy O'Brien has had ample opportunity in this House of naming the &ldquo;Paisleys&rdquo; here.  A characteristic of that type of gentleman is to take authority from Parliament, where it belongs, and transfer it to the street.  If there is any man in this country who has a record of marching which in some way may correspond to that of Mr. Paisley, it is the same Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien.  For instance, he has spoken on the &ldquo;principles&rdquo; of civil disobedience.  Here is the kind of thing that is giving us the sort of name we do not want to have.  Principles of civil disobedience hallowed, I ask, by what tradition, developed from what source?  The principle that allows one apparently, when a guard asks you to move on, to sit down or to lie down.</P>
    <P>Talk is easy, but all of us here have a responsibility to ensure that this country is regarded as a secure place <Col N="575" /> in which people can live and invest. It is shameful to create in the north the impression about this country that there is a crowd here as bad as and worse than anything they have up there.  One must judge the long-term effect of this.</P>
    <P>One could not attempt to cover the whole range of the Budget.  The social welfare provisions are very enlightened and much needed.  As I said last year, I like particularly the extension of services. Money alone will not buy the needs of the social welfare recipients. The Minister for Finance has been consistent in this&mdash;and consistency in a man, as in a Government, is a great quality.  He has extended these services for the old through voluntary organisations. Great credit is due to these voluntary organisations.  All we can do here is to create the environment in which they can work effectively.  I am especially glad that the Minister has made special provision for the employment of social workers throughout the county council areas.  We all know now, and it is particularly true of the North Tipperary constituency, that that is what is needed.  We have down there a very enlightened public.  We have itinerant welfare societies, old folks' committees and many others, all of them working extremely well.  What all of them, even Alcoholics Anonymous, need most are trained social workers to co-ordinate their work and make it more effective.  I will not continue to go through the Budget but I hope the Minister will continue to make it the occasion for his annual round of social welfare increases and improvements.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said on the turnover tax&mdash;and who in this country is going to believe this&mdash;that those who are worse off pay more under this Budget and those who are well off pay least.  Can anyone possibly take that connotation from the Budget?  Of course, it is the business of the Opposition not to promote the Government interest; but it is the business of the Opposition, too, when they criticise to do so on a reasonably rational basis, to apply the same standards as they would in business.  These sweeping statements <Col N="576" /> just do not hold water at all and are a sheer waste of time.  Deputy O'Leary was concerned about the turnover tax. No tax will ever be acceptable, no tax will ever be welcome.  This is unfortunately the lot of us humans.</P>
    <P>I agree with a lot of what Deputy O'Leary said.  I found much of what he said less objectionable&mdash;I do not mean this in the shocking sense&mdash;than what some others said.  He said that we should face our responsibility and tighten our belts.  The responsibility is always ours.  He also said that what the Minister should have done&mdash;and what he should be ashamed of for not having done when it was needed &mdash;was to introduce new taxation.  I have no doubt if he had done that we would have heard many &ldquo;ohs&rdquo; and &ldquo;ahs&rdquo;, as we heard here once before in regard to new direct taxation. We would all have been shocked and we would have been told we were imposing taxation on people who could not afford it.  How can you be right?</P>
    <P>One way turnover tax or indirect taxation has of being right is to provide lower paid and lower salaried groups with protection against an increase. It is a built-in curb on inflation. If we are going to spend money on a large car when a smaller one would do we know we are going to pay more in tax, just as we know that if we buy a large fridge when a smaller one would do, we are also going to pay more in tax.  The funny thing about the Irish people is that while sometimes they do not mind imposing indirect taxation on themselves they certainly resent direct taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last year&mdash;and both in the Seanad and in this House I have always pleaded for this&mdash;that an extension of indirect taxation, provided the lower income groups are cushioned against it so that it will be fairly spread, is a fairer system of taxation.  Many people escape through the tax net under direct taxation&mdash; I am not going to name the classes as I have named them often before&mdash;but the salary or wage earner does not escape.  It is a more effective system from the point of view of curbing inflation.</P>
    <P>If we are to become members of <Col N="577" /> EEC&mdash;and this is not just a pious platitude&mdash;we will, apart from having to change some provisions in our Constitution, have to harmonise many things, particularly our taxation legislation. Should we wait until the year we are to enter?  Should we wait until we are ready to say: &ldquo;Right, everything else is all right now&rdquo; and then start this major change in our taxation system?  Happily we have a Minister and a Government who are enlightened and are keeping ahead on this and who will not, for the sake of some short-term advantage, leave it until it is too late to introduce this necessary taxation. As long as we can cushion the lower income groups against its effect then an extension of the indirect taxation system, with a diminution of direct taxation, as we saw in this Budget, is, must be and will be the order of sound taxation.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this as a prophet. The signs are there for those who want to see them.  I say good riddance and goodbye to the 50,000 people who are escaping the net of taxation this time. They deserve to have escaped it a long time ago.  They are escaping it this time and some others will escape it the next time.  Next year, please God, we will be able to help many more of the lower paid workers and various others to escape the net of direct taxation; we will have an extension of the indirect taxation system and go on to the TVS system.  If we have not introduced this system we have introduced something which is a parallel to what they have in Europe.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say we can talk at length about what is being done on this side and what is not being done on the other side, and all of that kind of thing but can we not all as elected representatives, rational, reasonable people, representing rational, reasonable people, once and for all stop crying, stop talking about gloom, stop talking about the things which are going to happen to us?  I know the Opposition have to make a case for opposing something and I do not blame them for that, but do not let some of them go around saying that things are bad around here.  The one thing we can do is to give the opportunity to work to those many people <Col N="578" /> who want to work, so that those people who cannot work will be cushioned out of the earnings and out of the efforts of those who have the energy and the ability to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in presenting the Budget on behalf of the Minister for Finance, asked all sections of the community to give the nation and its economy the respite it urgently needed.  Does the Taoiseach honestly think in 1970 a request for restraint will be taken seriously when over 14 months ago a similar request was made and brushed aside by the Government within weeks?  An election was in the offing and so all good economic rules for the preservation of a buoyant economy were pushed aside in favour of a soft Budget which was geared for electioneering.</P>
      <P>During this debate much use has been made of the word &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;.  So much so is this that it is now a dirty word and Fianna Fáil are to brush it under the mat and hope the natural flow of events will heal the illnesses of our economy.  From a credit balance of payments of £22 million in 1967 we have reached a deficit of £60 million and there are no prospects of improvement in 1970.  All the danger signals were ignored and no remedial action was taken despite the warnings of the experts, the NIEC, the Central Bank, our Economic and Social Research Institute.  Fine Gael for years have been expounding that a prices and incomes policy was essential to the ordinary development of the economy. The NIEC have just published another document on prices and incomes which, while it has been welcomed by the Government, has little prospect of success without Government participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen, since the last Budget, the capital which was attracted from abroad by the colossal rates of interest paid by the Government.  Why is it that such small rates of interest are paid to the ordinary speculative investors in Ireland?  The pounds, shillings and pence saved by ordinary men and women have been the backbone of capital development in Ireland.  Why can more attractive rates not be paid <Col N="579" /> to encourage the average person to save more and thereby help this country in a very practical manner?</P>
    <P>The increase in turnover tax hits hardest at the very people the Government claim they must help.  We all know since the 1st of May prices have increased&mdash;in many cases that would require investigation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;at a rate far in excess of 2½ per cent.  The poor unfortunate old age pensioner, the widow, or any recipient of social welfare must wait until the 1st August for the benefit of the Budget increases. The impact of the cost of living increases over the past 12 months has been cruelly felt by this section of our community and they must now suffer for another three months.  Great show has been made by the Government about the great announcement in the Budget that the income tax rate in the £ has been unaltered for years, but with an increase in wages and salaries over the years and the efficiency of the PAYE system the net of taxpayers has been broadened.  The workers who are now negotiating wage claims for the 12th round, and who have their claims settled by the Government, will find that the Government will be standing on one side with open palms to collect the income on tax on such awards.</P>
    <P>The proposals to help local authorities to provide sites for itinerants are welcome.  There should be no excuses or delays by local authorities in the provision of properly designed and serviced sites for this section of our community.  I hope there will not be any delaying tactics employed by the Department of Local Government when proposals are submitted to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to those other members of my own party who welcomed this Budget. It continues the tradition Deputy Haughey has set for our Budgets since he became Minister for Finance, namely, improving the lot of the lowest paid section of our community.  As a member of the Government party, I certainly do not resent the increase in turnover tax.  I always thought that indirect taxation is the fairest system <Col N="580" /> of taxation in that it affects primarily those people who have most money to spend, whereas it affects to a lesser degree the people who spend less.</P>
      <P>With the new increase in the old age pension given in this Budget, the old age pensioner will not be affected by the increased turnover tax.  In fact, the extra few shillings a week it may cost him for items he will purchase will be more than offset by the increase in pension.  The increase in the turnover tax by another 2½ per cent means an extra expenditure of 2s 6d for every £ he spends.  I do not understand the mathematics of people who say that the 17s 6d per week granted to old age pensioners will be eaten up by this extra 2s 6d.</P>
      <P>One of the interesting facts that emerge from turnover tax is that 2½ per cent realised approximately £18 million&mdash;or, perhaps, £20 million in the coming year.  Therefore, 5 per cent can be reckoned to realise £40 million.  This means that there will be a total expenditure of £800 million in the coming year by the Irish public. The fact that there is so much money available for spending on consumer items spells out clearly the vast improvement there has been in the lives of our people.</P>
      <P>During the year I and other members of my party have been impressing on the Minister for Finance the need to give pensions to widows of IRA veterans.  Possibly the Minister went as far as he could in granting free transport to Old IRA veterans but I must confess that I was extremely disappointed that this was not extended to widows of IRA veterans.  I hope that this was an oversight and that the Minister will re-examine the matter and see whether it is possible to include the widows of IRA veterans. When an IRA veteran, who is granted free transport, dies is his widow entitled to free transport any longer, or <i>vice versa</i> where it was the woman who was active in IRA activities in Cumann na mBan?  I would urge the Minister to try to see whether he can fit in the widows or widowers of IRA veterans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about rising taxes and every time taxes increase there is the usual <Col N="581" /> cry of &ldquo;whipping the poor public&rdquo;. The fact is that taxes will continue to increase as long as our standard of living rises and as our prosperity increases the gap will widen between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;.  This is a natural occurrence that comes from prosperity and this Government recognise this fact.  In each Budget they protect the lowest paid sections, the old age pensioners and the social welfare classes by giving them extra allowances over and above any new increases in taxation.  Members of the Opposition can argue as much as they like but this is the fact of the matter. Every year under Fianna Fáil Governments the lot of the old age pensioners and the social welfare classes has improved and this will continue. It is often said that the increase comes too late in the year but in January this year the old age pensioners got an extra 10s and every year they can expect an increase in their incomes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give consideration to the setting up of a special committee to examine special hardship cases.  Sometimes it is difficult for legislation to embrace every single hardship case; when draftsmen are drafting legislation it is difficult to allow for everything.  I have in mind the case of a woman who is aged, confined to bed and is totally disabled. One of her daughters has given up her employment to stay home to care for her.  I endeavoured to get an extra pension of 55s a week for this old lady but the Department of Social Welfare had to turn this request down because the law, as it stands, states if there are any other people in the house who are working the disabled person cannot get an increase in pension.  Had the daughter remained at work she could have got a nurse to look after her mother.  This would have cost from £10 to £15 a week which the local health authority would subsidise; in other words, it would cost the taxpayer more money if that family called in help from outside.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of special case that crops up frequently and I am sure all of us here have experience of this.  If a special committee was set up by the Minister for Finance to take representations <Col N="582" /> from a Department where they could say &ldquo;Here is a genuine case of hardship,&rdquo; they could authorise a special pension in a case like this.  It would not cost very much but there would be quite a few cases where it would be well used.  I have no hesitation in putting forward a suggestion like this, because I know the Minister has a wonderful social conscience and he is only too anxious to receive such suggestions.  They may or may not be possible but we know that at least they will all be considered.  It is very heartening for a backbencher like myself or for any other Deputy to make suggestions here which he knows will be seriously considered and not brushed aside.</P>
    <P>I want to close with the request I made at the beginning.  One cannot ask for too many things at once; that is why I would rather confine myself to this suggestion that the widows of Old IRA veterans would also be granted the free transport.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Briscoe in regard to granting free transport to the widows of Old IRA veterans.  Before he sat down I intended making the suggestion myself, and I hope the Minister will look into it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said he was delighted that 50,000 people would escape from the tax net.  For how long, for a week or a month?  This is only publicity, because we know that when they get an increase in wages, especially now that the turnover tax has been increased and the cost of living goes up, they will be back in the tax net again.  The Minister has also given greater interest on savings.  This, again, will not be of much use to the worker because he will not have money to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The turnover tax increase of 2½ per cent is, on my reckoning, 1/40th, but in actual fact the trader has to pay 1/39th.  If he is running a van or a lorry he has to pay turnover tax on the purchase of petrol.  He is collecting a huge sum of money on which there is a great risk, particularly if it is a cash business.  He may have a dishonest assistant and even if he loses money he still has to pay turnover tax on it. <Col N="583" /> Therefore, if he charged only 2½ per cent in a business based on a small profit, as are some of the supermarkets, he would be out of business in the morning.  The people collecting turnover tax should send out leaflets to every trader explaining the exact amount of turnover tax, which is nearer to 3 per cent than it is to 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>There are two methods of charging turnover tax in the retail business.  One is to charge a price which includes the tax.  Another is to charge a price and add the turnover tax.  The trader should only pay £4 14s 6d tax on £100 turnover, but 60 or 70 per cent of the traders in Dublin are paying £5 on every £100, which is nearly three per cent.  A grocer's shop is, therefore, being done out of 5s 6d on every £100. The supermarket which adds the turnover tax to the price of the goods is not being done.  There is a tremendous amount of trust given to traders to pay the turnover tax and it should be paid since it has been collected.</P>
    <P>Is it right that the Revenue Commissioners should charge tax on losses? During the last strike a certain publican cashed cheques which were returned without payment.  The Revenue Commissioners were looking for income tax on that £4,000 although he was at the loss of £4,000 and was also paying turnover tax on that amount.  It may be legally right but it is morally wrong.  If the Revenue Commissioners do that they deserve to be done by the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley, was shouting about a maximum wage increase of 7 per cent at the time of the maintenance strike.  He did not say it beforehand; he waited until something happened. Going on the history of 1963 turnover tax is bound to have an effect on wage increases of 7 or 8 per cent.  Even Mr. Lemass, when he was Taoiseach, added 5 per cent to the 7 per cent increase that was practically agreed between employers and the unions.  That five per cent was either to buy the two by-elections in Cork and Kildare or to compensate for the turnover tax.  You can make up your mind which it was. I would say both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> Previous speakers from the Government side say this is a small tax, that everybody pays a little and the weaker sections are compensated.  We know how well they have been compensated. We saw what happened in 1963 when I got into the Dáil on this issue in an area where Fianna Fáil had three seats, Fine Gael two and Labour none. The result was that Fianna Fáil were annihilated.  I am not boasting about it but merely pointing out the effect of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, came into the Dáil he went back in history and attacked everyone in the Fine Gael Party.  He misquoted Fine Gael by saying that Fine Gael said that the 2½ would rise to 15.  What was said was that the 2½ would rise to 5 and more and that over a number of years the increase in prices would rise to 15 per cent of the present value.  He said the lesser people had been provided with money to make up for the turnover tax.  The lesser people are being paid 17s 6d, and that is the maximum.  That is a great deal less than the rate by which wages are going up at the moment.  It is about 25 per cent of the rate.  Workers are getting increases of £3, £4, and up to £6 in certain cases over a period of two years.  The 17s 6d is not 25 per cent of that.  In other words, the proportion to the average wage is going down.</P>
    <P>Then we had the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, saying that the social insurance contribution in Ireland is only 28s 3d, whereas in Britain it is £4 3s and he asked how could we expect to get the same benefits.  Every worker in this country is paying in respect of health in a separate charge; he is paying it in rates; he is paying it to his employer in respect of sickness benefit; he is paying it to his union and he is also paying his social insurance contribution. When all these contributions are assessed one finds that he is paying every bit as much if not more than his counterpart in Britain.</P>
    <P>Then we had the old Fianna Fáil piece of propaganda trotted out that we have heard over the years in order to brainwash the people&mdash;the reference <Col N="585" /> to the reduction in the old age pension from 10s to 9s.  They are taking that out of context.  In the twenties it was normal practice that if the cost of living went up wages went up and if the cost of living went down, wages went down.  In 1923-24 the old age pension was reduced from 10s to 9s. It went up to 10s in 1927 and it was 10s in 1932; it was 10s in 1947.  After 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government it was 10s&mdash;not increased at all.  The first Government to increase the old age pension was the inter-Party Government when they gave 5s I think.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that at that time 9s or 10s was practically one-half of the average wage.  The present old age pension is not half the average wage or even one-third of the average wage.  So, proportionally, the old age pensioners were being paid more at that time.  The Government was handed over to Fianna Fáil in 1932.  The exports of 1932, prior to the economic war, were never reached, money-wise, until 1948, when the inter-Party Government were again in power.  These things were not explained.</P>
    <P>I may not be an expert on agriculture&mdash;I am a Dublin Deputy&mdash;but I have farmed a great deal more than many a countryman and for a big part of my life.  I do not say that I know a great deal about agriculture, particularly modern agriculture.  Every time the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries spoke about agriculture he spoke about the amount of money spent; he gave no details of individual income.  I was in France in 1947.  At that time the rate of exchange was 980 francs to the £.  You could prove you were a millionaire on that basis.  The rate at present is a little less than 14 francs to the £.  There is a big difference.  The Minister mentioned that in 1960 farm income was £111.8 million and that it is £173 million now &mdash;an increase of 55 per cent.  In 1960, what was the income of a worker, what was the income of any business, and what is that income now?  Has it not doubled or trebled while the farm income has gone up by 55 per cent?  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries set out to look for £14 million and then tried to make the case that <Col N="586" /> £4 million was doing a tremendous amount for the farmer.  He said they were going to get 8 per cent.  He worked it all out, taking buoyancy into account and suggested that the farmers would get an 8 per cent increase.  That is 1 per cent less than Deputy Colley promised.  So, he is going to keep the farmers to 8 per cent when everybody else is getting from 17 to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>I was in Longford during the by-election campaign.  There is a big turf scheme in Lanesboro, the village my father came from.  A Minister stood up there and pointed out that Fianna Fáil had done this and that Fianna Fáil had done that.  One would think that the Minister had gone out with a shovel and pick and had done it himself.  The workers did it.  Various Ministers in Fianna Fáil started it in a small way and Mr. William Norton made a huge job of it.  During the by-election campaign Fianna Fáil were claiming credit for everything that had been done.  How often in by-election campaigns have we seen them taking films for television of the various co-operatives started by the farmers and trying to get credit for them?  This is the way in which they are trying to get over the question of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The reason for the increases in social welfare benefits is to keep people up with inflation and the cost of living.  It has been in the last number of years that inflation set in in this country since 1961-62.  They inflated everything so that when they were paying back money on loans to the people they were paying back money that had lost value.</P>
    <P>Two years ago a proper system of children's allowances should have been introduced.  That would have avoided the huge wage increases that came afterwards.  As I have said many times, if you take three men working in the same job and earning the same salary, a man with eight children who is paying £6 a week for his house is in poverty; a second man with two children may be paying £2 10s a week for his house and the third man, with one child, may be paying nothing for his house.  That may be an exaggeration <Col N="587" /> but it does illustrate the point that if the money is given by way of children's allowance the first and second man will get the increase, whereas the third man will not and that, therefore, with a proper system of children's allowances there would not be the same demand made to unions to seek greater wages.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the family allowances payable in various countries in 1966 for the first child: Ireland, 10s; United Kingdom, nil; Netherlands, 59s 6d; Luxembourg, 77s. 9d; Italy, 65s 4d; France, 99s 8d; Belgium, 80s. In many of these countries the cost of living is a great deal higher than ours and wages are lower than they are here because the workers are getting these family allowances.  Now let us take the figure for the second child: Belgium and France, nil; Germany, 44s 8d; Italy, 65s. 4d; Luxembourg and the Netherlands, nil; United Kingdom, 34s 8d; Ireland, 15s 6d.  For the third child the figures are: Belgium, 167s 6d; France, 170s 8d; Italy, 65s 4d; United Kingdom, 43s 4d; Ireland, 26s 6d.  I presume that the rate in these countries has gone up also, with ours, in the last period.  With a proper system of children's allowances spending power can be more evenly spread.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, took part in this debate.  The Minister for Health is consistent.  Over the years he has said that we should not look for something out of a country unless we earn it, that wages should not increase unless the country has produced the wealth with which to pay them.  It is a pity that he does not make all the members of the Government think in that way.  They all say it but they do not believe it and they do not practise it.  Deputy Childers also spoke in money terms and did not refer to items.  He mentioned the amount of money spent on housing in 1957&mdash;£10 million&mdash;I may be wrong &mdash;that could be 1960 but I think it is 1957&mdash;as against £35 million in 1969, but he did not tell us the number of houses built for that £10 million and the number of houses built for the £35 million in 1969.  I will guarantee there <Col N="588" /> were more houses built for the £10 million than there were for the £35 million.  I will also guarantee that they were bigger and better houses.  Practically all of the £10 million was supplied by the Government.  I will guarantee that the £35 million was provided by the banks, some by the Government, some by the building societies and some by the insurance companies, though they are pulling out of this kind of exercise now because there is not enough money in it for them.</P>
    <P>Again, the people who have saved for a deposit on a house&mdash;be it £1,000 or £1,200&mdash;will not find there is 5 per cent added to the cost of the house.  The only exclusion is cement and cement products.  The Minister for Health mentioned social welfare and he said it had gone up from £15 million in 1958 to £25 million in 1969. That sounds marvellous.  By how much has taxation increased in the meantime? By how much have wages increased? There was a sum of £20 million from the turnover tax.  I do not know what is collected in wholesale tax.  There is revenue from PAYE. Revenue from spirits, excluding wines and mineral waters, has increased.  In 1964 the revenue was £21.6 million.  In 1965 it was £24,743,000.  In 1966 it was £27,330,000.  In 1967 it was £32 million.  In 1968 it was £34,899,000 and in 1969 it was £41,508,000.  In 1970 an extra £12 million or £13 million was collected.  All this revenue has been dissipated. I do not know where it has gone.  The increase of 17s 6d sounds lovely and it will be lovely for the old age pensioner to handle it, but that is all the old age pensioner will do with it; it will disappear twice as quickly as would 5s in the forties had Fianna Fáil seen fit to give an increase of 5s at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health also talked about a prices and incomes policy.  He said that Fine Gael only give lip service to such a policy.  He knew quite well that what he was saying was not true.  When the turnover tax was introduced in 1963 the economy was in a bad way and in his speech on the Budget in that year the late Deputy Sweetman had this to say, and I am quoting from volume 202 of the Official Report, column 133:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> Where is this Budget going to help the development of an incomes policy?  We said last year and the previous year that the development of an incomes policy was vitally necessary to the country.  We cannot afford to have the continued effect of play and counterplay between opposing interests in our economic life.  This Budget is not going to do much to help the situation and neither did the hamhanded White Paper issued by the Government three months ago.  All that this Budget and that White Paper have shown is that this Government do not understand what an incomes policy really is.  Their policy has been concerned solely with restricting earnings but by an incomes policy we would have expansion in salaries and wages, expansion in profits, in agricultural earnings and in social service benefits.  Of course, that has never been Fianna Fáil understanding of these matters.  Instead they have always preferred to rely on incomes.</P>
    <P>That was in 1963.  In 1962 he also referred to an incomes policy.  I was instrumental in drawing up the Fine Gael policy document on incomes other than wages and salaries.  Let me quote the policy enshrined in that document:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael now reiterates its commitment to the introduction of a genuine incomes policy in this country, and in government it will seek the co-operation of both sides of industry in pursuing this policy. We join with the National Industrial Economic Council in its view&mdash; endorsed by trade unions and employers alike&mdash;that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;any incomes policy which does not embrace all categories of money income (is) inadequate and inequitable....  The measures relating to other incomes should be set out in advance and applied to them contemporaneously with the application of an incomes policy to wages and salaries...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the Council went on to point out the undesirability of control of profits:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not the purpose of an <Col N="590" /> incomes policy to prevent profits from growing ... nor is it envisaged that the profits of each individual firm should grow at no more than a certain rate....  Even if control of profits were desirable &mdash;and this is not the case where they are earned competitively, for example, from exporting&mdash;such control could not be operated in advance, but only in arrears, after the profits have been earned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is Fine Gael's view also that in a mixed economy like ours a competitive environment provides the best mechanism to prevent excessive profits.  Fine Gael will strengthen and extend to areas not now covered, the existing legislation against cartels, monopolies and restrictive practices, so as to ensure the maintenance of competition.</P>
    <P>The Council's view on prices policy as expressed in this Report were also in harmony with Fine Gael's Just Society policy of price surveillance; the Council offered no support for the discredited policy of <i>rigid</i> price control pursued by the present Government.  Except where it proves impossible to create or maintain conditions of competition between private firms, or where a temporary or artificial shortage of goods exists, Fine Gael does not favour price control; but where for one reason or another competition does not operate, it recognises and accepts the duty of the public authorities to protect the consumer against exploitation by private monopolists or cartels.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael joins with the NIEC in seeing the role of incomes policy as concerned not with the profit earned by companies most of which is and should be ploughed back for future investment and productivity but with the residue of profits accruing to individuals.  Fine Gael recognises the undesirability of dividend control, as well as of profits control, and it is for this reason that it has proposed measures designed to ensure (in the words of the NIEC which in 1965 adopted the Fine Gael proposal) &ldquo;that the rate of increase in aggregate post-tax purchasing <Col N="591" /> power derived from investment is no higher than the rate of increase in aggregate post-tax wages, salaries and other incomes.&rdquo;  Because these measures would be based on the trend of total dividend income, related to that of wage and salary income, they would not have the adverse economic effects of dividend control, which hits the successful firm which has nothing extra to pay out of dividends.</P>
    <P>In supporting these policies, which have been endorsed by both management and trade union representatives, Fine Gael rejects the negative attitude of the present government which in the three years since these NIEC proposals were put forward has done nothing whatever to implement them.</P>
    <P>The Government have moved in regard to health and education on lines first mooted by Fine Gael.  If they had done so three years earlier they could have done it gradually instead of jumping into it and making a mess of it. The health scheme was thrown around between three or four Ministers. One promised everything; another did nothing; the third man is working hard on it and we do not know whether he will succeed or not.  If this had been done at the right time and not kept three or four years in abeyance it could have been done better.  The Government jumped into improving the educational system, not knowing what they were doing with the result that it is costing four times what they reckoned.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that in West Germany between 1963 and 1969 wages went up by 50 per cent and the cost of living by 24 per cent.  I agree that in most of what he said he was down to earth and thinking of the country rather than individuals but he should complete his statements.  He said that in Ireland wages went up by 71 per cent and the cost of living by 34 per cent but he forgot to mention the social benefits they have in Germany which are far greater than what we have here.  There are free holidays, swimming pools and various other things provided for the workers.  On top of <Col N="592" /> this in Germany there was 44s 8d for the second child against our 15s 6d in 1966.  Their maximum is 125s as against our 26s 6d.  Wages went up by a good percentage and they also have better benefits than we have.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are quick to tax a man on money of which he did not have the use.  Would they spend the same time getting at foreign combines that overcharged for their research done in other countries, in America, or Germany, or elsewhere? These firms send out their research teams, getting new products and then when they make their profits here they put a huge proportion of that cost against the firm here.  Quite a few firms do this.  The bulk of their research and sales costs is borne by the Irish company where they are getting away with it.  Probably they also get away with it in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is seldom that the Minister speaks without referring to productivity in the free trade area.  We went into this free trade area thinking we would join the EEC in 1971.  I think we should now look at it again since we are not in the EEC, and get better terms from England, if we did it only for training in meeting competition. In regard to training for the EEC it is strange to think that we have the Government putting a surtax of 5 per cent on Irish workers over what English workers have to pay.  The Irish worker must now spend 5 per cent more on buying goods than the English worker spends and the Irish worker must already pay more for these goods because we are a small country and cannot mass-produce.  Then we are asking the Irish workers to be competitive with England.  First, food is slightly dearer here and then the Government put on 5 per cent on food, clothing, drink and all the things the worker must buy, or things that he can enjoy. Yet, the fur coats and items that only the wealthy can afford are taxed at only 5 per cent also.  In England you have no tax on food but you have tax on luxury articles.</P>
    <P>English workers also have better children's allowances, better health services and better social benefits. Then we have Ministers saying: &ldquo;We <Col N="593" /> want more productivity.&rdquo;  How can we get more productivity when they are paid more in England while we are charging them more.  We are killing the initiative of the workers by this 5 per cent surcharge.  Even in the case of the two commodities which were cheaper here than in England, semi-luxuries or semi-necessaries such as cigarettes and drink, the position has changed.  Our prices were below the English prices for many years.  Now, our tax on drink is greater than in England and in the case of cigarettes it is very close to the British figure.</P>
    <P>Government speakers have said that people must be taxed in order to provide for the weaker sections.  Nobody denies this, but how much of the taxation goes to the weaker sections? How much of it is wasted by Government inefficiency?  I have heard the Minister for Local Government saying that he was down to earth and that he had no imagination and did not believe in it.  One of the greatest assets anybody can have is imagination.  I would put it before brains or money or anything else.</P>
    <P>In 1959 a house of about 1,250 square feet cost about £1,800 gross. Today that house or probably one a little smaller costs £5,400.  Houses have nearly trebled in value despite the fact that many materials have been replaced by cheaper materials, by new inventions such as PVC piping instead of copper piping.  We also have higher interest rates which is probably the case all over the world.  Also, because of the attitude of the present Minister for Finance to banking the banks are no longer willing to give a loan as they used do some years ago to families over a period of five or six years.  Today you can only get a very short-term loan from these banks and if you want money for any length of time you go to merchant banks and they are very short-term also or to an insurance company.  You pay dearer rates of interest which puts up costs.  The whole banking system has completely changed over a number of years past.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies that should be putting up money for housebuilding are putting it into property companies. They can make more money in this <Col N="594" /> way because they can take a share in a block of flats and after seven years they can increase the rent and get a higher return on their money.  When one went to a bank four or five years ago looking for money any bank manager would tell you that there were more people looking for money than could be accommodated.  They rationed it out and you got a percentage.  If you were the best businessman in the world you did not get all the money. You got a percentage of what they had to give out.  They gave it to the small and the big people.</P>
    <P>What is happening today?  The insurance companies will give money to the big operator, the huge operator, the big builder, the big businessman, the man who can give them a return of 20 per cent on their money.  They will not give money to the house purchaser who can give them a return of only 8 or 9 per cent.  People are buying up land all over the city and they are given money by these Irish insurance companies.  The money belongs to the Irish people, the ordinary savers, but the insurance companies are giving it to the big operators.  They become cartels and buy up the limited amount of serviced land in this city.  I am speaking about Dublin because I know it in detail. I do not know the other cities.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are looking for 30 per cent interest from the big operators, the people who are building these flats and offices.  The money is given to them by Irish insurance companies instead of being used to provide houses and to cut down the cost of housing.  If they were like the banks they would give so much to each person.  There would be competition and the land would not go at a big price.  At present the big operator can say: &ldquo;I can buy the land and hold on to it.  It must go up in value if nobody else has land.  I have the only land and I can get my price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1961, a site with a 35 to 40 foot frontage cost between £275, £300 or £400.  It costs £2,250 now.  That is five times the price it was.  The reason is that we had two Ministers for Local Government who sat down and asked <Col N="595" /> the corporation questions so that they could answer questions in here.  Neither was a businessman.  At the moment in the Department of Local Government there are civil servants who spend their time checking on whether a person is entitled to a grant of £275. There are inspectors going out and making inspections.  There are people in the office making checks.  I do not know how many are involved altogether but there are quite a number.  I know the grant is up to £300 now.  There is another section checking on the turnover tax so there is one set of civil servants checking on the money being sent out and another checking on it coming back in again.</P>
    <P>We know the amount of money which was spent on the flats in Ballymun. One Irish person was involved in that consortium.  The rest were English people.  Those flats could have been built by 50 Irish builders in a conventional way and much more cheaply, thereby injecting money into this country and not letting the profits go out of it.  We have in those flats doors imported on licence by a person from England.  I do not have to say what party he was a member of and how well up in it he is.</P>
    <P>We have seen today that out of 73 lifts in the Ballymun scheme, 53 are not working.  I asked the Minister today are they good lifts or are they bad lifts, were they bought in a job lot or did some pal get the licence to bring them in.  He said Fine Gael were jealous of those flats.  He should go up and ask the tenants what they think of the flats.  Some of them are living 14 storeys up and the lifts are out of order.  I guarantee that at least two lifts in every block are out of order every second or third week.</P>
    <P>An extra 2½ per cent has now gone on to about 30 or 40 per cent of the builders' costs, including labour and land.  The repayments on these houses are £6 to £8 a week.  Take a man who after the next wage increase has £20 a week and is paying £8 a week in outgoings.  He is worried about the five per cent turnover tax.  He is in real trouble.  That man, particularly if he has a few children, must demand more wages.  If he had proper children's <Col N="596" /> allowances he could wait for another year or so.  We used to laugh at the stop-go economy&mdash;although I did not because it was not good for the country&mdash;we had here to suit elections. That may be all right for Fianna Fáil when an election is due.  They said: &ldquo;We will put money into the economy and keep it going.  A bit of inflation will do no harm.&rdquo;  After the election there was either a Budget or a clamp down.  That was all right for the Fianna Fáil Party but businessmen have to look ahead.</P>
    <P>When things are going well for a small businessman he can expand but, as soon as they contract, he is stuck for money and he has to sell.  Some big English firm, a supermarket chain or a big furniture shop, buys up that place.  If you walk down any of the main streets in Dublin I guarantee that about 50 per cent of the shops are owned by a combine in England and the profits from those shops go out of the country eventually.</P>
    <P>Usually in a Budget debate it is quite easy to attack an increase on drink, cigarettes and petrol.  Usually there is something for the old age pensioners. This year we heard the Taoiseach standing in for the Minister for Finance saying that the old reliables like drink, cigarettes and petrol could not be hit any more and that they had to get a more broadly based tax.  He still hit the drink, petrol and cigarettes. He hit every single thing that is sold except, I think, medicines for animals.</P>
    <P>I should like to give an example of the money that is collected and the risks involved.  Take a good business and take the round figures.  Take a business with a turnover of £100,000 per annum.  We will say the profit on that is 10 per cent.  That is £10,000. The Government collect £5,000, roughly, on the turnover tax.  The company have £10,000.  Take income tax and corporation profits tax off that. The company have £4,875 and the Government have somewhere in the region of £11,000 odd out of that company. The Government collect that with practically no risk but, if there is one dishonest man on that premises, the company will not get £10,000 profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> I am not saying you would make that profit on that turnover.  You would not.  I am just taking round figures. Dishonest people are in the minority but, if there is a dishonest person on the premises, the Government's take goes down infinitesimally but the owner's goes down completely.  That is the risk involved in this turnover tax. We can bring that down lower to a man who is barely existing.  If the Government have to collect their tax on £15,000 the owner may have nothing.</P>
    <P>I think you could draw up this Budget in your sleep.  I do not know what all the talk was about.  Fianna Fáil said it was a great Budget.  It is practically identical to the 1963 Budget, when Fianna Fáil were in serious financial trouble.  Again, they are in financial difficulties and to solve them they have presented the same style Budget.  Again, it is the people's necessaries that will cost more&mdash;the loaf of bread, shoes, boots, clothing. Again, the increase in the turnover tax will affect the housewife's loaf in the same way and to the same extent as the fur coat of the rich.</P>
    <P>When I was a candidate for Dublin North East some years ago, the election was being fought on the turnover tax issue.  The present Minister for Finance, then Minister for Justice, went on television and told the people the Government were putting on a 2½ per cent turnover tax but that they were giving the old age pensioners an extra 2s 6d a week which, he said, would more than compensate them&mdash;indeed, he said, it would give them a balance of 1s a week.  Of course, this did not happen; of course, the Minister was making a pure mathematical calculation.</P>
    <P>Later, we had Deputy Lemass, as he then was, who could not trust three Independent Deputies and had to hold two by-elections, one in Cork and one in Kildare.  He said in the Dáil that he thought the people should get increases in incomes but he did not approve of the agreement for 7 per cent or 8 per cent between workers and employers. He said the people should be compensated for increases in the cost of living.  People with large families suffer most from a cost of living increase yet to the parents of those large families <Col N="598" /> he gave 1s 1d per week in respect of each child.  How far would 1s 1d go to feed a child?  In England when ice cream was taxed it was said that the Government were taking food out of children's mouths.  Here every item of food has been taxed.  Even rates and deposits now bear this 5 per cent tax.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have done nothing but speak about amalgamation of trade unions.  They have done nothing about discussing better industrial relations. Indeed, Deputy O'Kennedy this afternoon blamed the trade unions.  It is up to the Government to discuss matters with the unions.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald spoke about the Civil Service.  He said that higher civil servants are so overloaded with day-to-day duties that they are unable to devote any time to policy planning. Some years ago when top civil servants were given an increase of £800 per annum I said that if they were worth it they should get it.  The same applies to comparable workers in private enterprise. Top civil servants today cannot do the work they are asked to do and we have the terrible example of Ministers shouting at functions all over the country when they should be sitting in their offices doing the work of their Departments which they now expect their top civil servants to do.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil took off the food subsidies and they are the only party to have put a tax on food.  Not even in Britain did they put a tax on foodstuffs. Our national debt in 1963 was just more than £500 million.  Now it is £1,000 million.  If a private individual did business like that he would be thrown out by the bank manager. Finally, I calculate that what happened in 1963 will happen again as a result of the steep new rise in the cost of living.  This is becoming a progressive increase and every shilling we add, every 2½ per cent we add, will worsen the situation.  It will mean greater inflation. The turnover tax is the worst type of tax that could be imposed, particularly because we are in a free trade agreement with Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to join with other contributors in expressing regret at the unfortunate <Col N="599" /> accident which prevented the Minister for Finance from introducing the Budget. I am glad to learn that he is now at home and I trust he will be able to resume his duties soon.  His absence on Budget day cast a shadow over the entire proceedings.</P>
      <P>I regard this as being an unusual type Budget because in it the Minister for Finance achieved a balance of giving and taking which is unique in budgeting tactics.  Once again we have the strategy of concessions to taxpayers and benefits to social welfare classes. The Opposition felt they were politially committed to opposing the turn-over tax.  Apart from the Opposition and other vested interests, there has not been any screams of protest against the 2½ per cent increase in the turn-over tax for the reason that the general public are intelligent enough to see that this is comparable to other taxes operated in other countries, but on a slightly different level.  It is the sort of tax we must ask our people to be prepared to face in the event of our joining the EEC.  In the Budget there is a cushioning for the weaker sections and for the lower paid against the new impost.  For the middle income earner there is also some relief.  Overall, it is a Budget that spreads the revenue net rather than concentrating on any one particular section.  Those who have listened to some of the fearful forebodings from the opposite side cannot help but notice the usual big omission&mdash;a clear statement of possible alternatives.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has given careful examination to the terms of the Budget will see that it has been framed with the objective of securing another advance on the road to total social justice in our society.  I am not going to say that the end of that road is in sight but at least successive Fianna Fáil Budgets show in a very realistic way that this objective is the denominator of the Budget planning.  If we take the over-all progress of this State since its foundation and match it against the huge assets of wealthier countries it will surely be found that in proportion to our years of existence and to our resources much has been accomplished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> One of the key sentences in the Minister's Budget speech was to the effect that a genuine and widespread feeling of social concern is the hallmark of a humane, civilised society.  The Minister has clearly shown his concern, as one of the leading administrators of our Government, in the concessions he extended to old age pensioners, to deserted wives, to widows, orphans, the disabled, parents of young families, and so on.  In particular, the Minister has shown his concern for and appreciation of the wonderful work by voluntary organisations in helping to care for our old people.  The members of these voluntary organisations are very dedicated people.  The Minister has shown his recognition of their valuable work by providing a substantial sum to enable them to extend their activities.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that this progressive order of things can be maintained. There are many clouds in the economic sky, many uncertainties facing us in this decade but as long as we try to get a reasonable balance each year between economic progress and social development then we are charting a proper course.  It was always recognised that the prerequisite for securing a better deal for all the people and for ensuring that emigration would be cut to a minimum was that first of all a stable economic foundation be laid by Government assistance to farming, industrialisation and exporting.  This massive operation goes on, and on an even greater scale than ever before, and already the fruits of it are being harvested on a great scale.  There is, however, a great need for prudence all round because national wealth does not come from a bottomless pit.  It is especially important today that one section or other does not use the power that it democratically holds to grab more of the wealth than any other section.  Those who are of that state of mind should stop to think of the danger of their actions to the national welfare and especially of the repercussive effects their actions could have on the weaker sections and to the employment tally.  It seems to be agreed all round, more particularly from the NIEC report, that the grand ideal of full employment cannot be <Col N="601" /> accomplished unless a measure of reasonableness is brought into industrial relations.  There is hope and a prospect of success in the field with the latest suggestions on prices and incomes from the same body.  I trust that the Ministers concerned in the establishment of organisations to make this effective will give this report priority consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to join in the plea to extend the privilege of free travel to widows of pensioners: it would not cost the State very much.  I trust the Minister for Finance will have another look at the rates question.  The Government have set up an inter-Departmental committee to examine the problem in depth and during the past year a measure of relief in this respect was afforded to certain sections but my experience is that it is rather restricted in its scope: it relates mainly to rated occupiers in receipt of social welfare benefit.  Clearly it does not take account of the hardships facing the widow and her family or those on small incomes. There are people who have inherited houses which can be a burden to them but who feel it their duty to remain there.  The spectre of ever-rising rates is a matter of serious anxiety to them.  I should like the Minister for Finance and his associates to use their energies and talents to ensure that the scope of this relief be widened so as to ease the burden on the unfortunate people to whom I refer.  I recognise that substantial subventions have been made to local authorities, principally because of the increase in the health estimates throughout the country and the rising costs of our health services.</P>
    <P>I come now to a matter of concern to Irish industrialists and people in small businesses, namely, the rising imports of footwear, clothing and other materials and commodities, which constitute a serious threat to the livelihood of many people here who are engaged in industry.  I urge that a massive effort be made by the Government to induce the Irish people to buy Irish goods.  There is an appreciable import of goods of a kind which are made here of equally good quality.  I make a special plea to the trade union movement to join the Government in trying to curb this undesirable trend <Col N="602" /> of outlets and agencies in this country for the promotion and sale of goods and commodities already manufactured here and which practice is a detriment to the livelihood of so many of our workers in their own country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the Budget &mdash;a Budget that can be regarded as a step towards further progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend, a Cheann Comhairle, to be brief in my contribution and I shall begin by asking a question.  The question must be addressed to the Taoiseach, to the Minister for Finance and to every Fianna Fáil Deputy.  It is a simple question and it is this: do they see anything wrong with the economic position of this country?  Because from the Taoiseach down to the humblest Government Deputy who has spoken it would appear that we are living in the midst of great wealth and prosperity.</P>
      <P>If Fianna Fáil consider this to be the position then I say that they themselves must be living in cuckooland because Deputies representing rural constituencies know very well that this Budget provides no solution for our national and economic ills.</P>
      <P>It is a source of regret to all of us in this House that, because of an unfortunate accident, the Minister for Finance could not have been here either to introduce or defend his Budget. Nevertheless, we are all glad to hear that he has left hospital and we hope that he is now on his way to a speedy recovery to full health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil maintain that this Budget will solve our economic ills and problems but is it not true to say that we still have a lot of unemployment and that we still have emigration? Nothing has been done to provide proper emigrant welfare services for the thousands of Irish boys and girls who emigrate&mdash;not for adventure, as we are told by Fianna Fáil, but because they are denied the right of a decent standard of living at home.  As soon as they cross the Irish Sea they are completely forgotten by the Government, in spite of the demands and requests that these emigrants have made.  They are not <Col N="603" /> seeking mercy from the Irish Government: all they seek is justice and fair play.</P>
    <P>In the field of education during the past year there have been many difficulties in relation to teachers at all levels.  These teachers have not yet got settled conditions.  We find that the Army is ill-equipped and underpaid and that the recruiting drive has been a failure.  During the year, too, the Garda Síochána almost reached a stage of revolt which was avoided by certain helpful recommendations made by the Conroy Commission.  There are now fewer farmers in the country than ever before, just as there are some thousands fewer agricultural workers. In the industrial sphere there are thousands of workers on half time and short time employment, particularly in the textile trade, in the wool industry and in the jute and bag manufacturing industry. I am aware of this because I live in a constituency in which the workers in Goodbody and Co.'s jute mills in Clara have been compelled to go on short time.  Because of the failure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to respond to representations made by the firm of Messrs Salts (Ireland) Ltd. of Tullamore and because of the neglect of his Department some 500 or 600 workers in one provincial town have been put on short time work.  When all these matters are taken into consideration it is obvious that we have many serious problems.</P>
    <P>This Budget sounds the death knell of all our small country shops because of the increase in turnover tax from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent.  It is disastrous that we should have reached the situation in an agricultural country such as this that we have so few agricultural workers, just as it is disastrous that we have had such a record of strikes&mdash;a record that is worse than any in Europe.  Strikes have been the order of the day.</P>
    <P>Our health services are, perhaps, the worst in Europe with the exception of Greece.  Despite all the evidence of these deplorable conditions there are Fianna Fáil speakers who will say that such conditions do not prevail in this country.  Fianna Fáil claim <Col N="604" /> the Budget is improving the lot of the poorer sections of our community, namely, widows, orphans, the sick and the deserted wives and the various types of people that have been referred to as receiving concessions, whether on a contributory or a non-contributory basis, next October.  Is it not true to say that the increases which they are now getting are only sufficient to cope with the rise in the cost of living since the allowances were last increased, with the result that they are getting nothing to meet the serious increase in the cost of living as a result of this savage imposition of turnover tax?  Who do Fianna Fáil think they are fooling?  If there is the great wave of prosperity that we are supposed to be experiencing why did they not have a more satisfactory result than the short victory they had in the Dublin by-election and why did they lose Longford-Westmeath and Kildare?  Is it because the people were so wallowing in prosperity that they would not vote for them?  The position is that the people are beginning to come to grips with facts and every section of our people is finding it extremely difficult to live.  Without this Budget at all, the cost of living was going completely beyond the capacity of our people but the 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax, which increases the price of food and the price of everything one must purchase, has made it even more difficult still for people to exist.</P>
    <P>If the Government gave any serious thought to the conditions under which our people are obliged to live they would have taken the necessary steps to see that food was not the subject of what we can only describe as a savage tax.  Have Fianna Fáil any answer to the fact that medicines and food for animals are free of turnover tax but food for human beings is subject to tax?  The health of the animal is more important and of more concern to Fianna Fáil than the health or the food of the citizens of this country.</P>

      <P>No Deputy on this side of the House voted against social welfare benefits.  We voted against the imposition of the 5 per cent turnover tax and offer no apology for doing so because this tax is increasing the cost of living and closing up all country shops, making it impossible for the country shopkeeper to exist.  The turnover tax will also impose a very substantial increase on the rates.  Every local authority, when striking the rate, must take into consideration the cost of food for institutions, the cost of oil, the cost of plant and machinery, and all this will lead to a very substantial increase in the rates in every county.  I should like to hear from the Taoiseach what he estimates will be the increase in next year's rates as a result of the additional 2½ per cent turnover tax.  It will have a very serious effect on the rates. In addition to the economic and national ills I have referred to the rates and the rating system are so unsatisfactory that local authorities are now finding it impossible to discharge their obligations.  The new rating system which we were promised before general elections has not materialised.  This increase in the turnover tax will be responsible for putting local authorities in an intolerable position when striking the rate for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are discussing a Budget, providing £X-millions for the administration of this country, and yet Parliament has no say as to how many millions of this money will be spent.  I am critical of that state of affairs whereby as a result of a Budget this House imposes certain taxes on our people and when these taxes are extracted from the trouser pockets and <Col N="606" /> the purses of our taxpayers, from housewives and mothers of families, the House is gagged and blindfolded in relation to the spending of this money.  I want to make a special reference to the tens of thousands of pounds which Bord Fáilte can spend, which CIE can spend and which other semi-State organisations can spend and yet when we ask a question about who is getting this money and how it is being spent we are told that Ministers have no responsibility to this House for the day-to-day affairs of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I feel the time has come when Parliament should seriously get its teeth into this.  If we are to impose taxes on our people we should have the right to know how they are spent, on whom they are spent, under what circumstances they are spent and what is the possibility of a good return for the investment of the people's money.  We cannot have that because it does not suit Fianna Fáil to disclose where these tens of thousands of pounds are going.  I have a feeling that the people are waking up and asking themselves who is benefiting by the spending of the Government.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the manner in which public money is spent by very many State bodies.  I want to repeat, if I may, because it has not been repeated often enough in this House and sufficient emphasis has not been put on it, that every penny of the taxpayers' money should be accounted for in this House.  That has not been the case and steps should be taken to ensure that the House will receive a full account as to the manner in which moneys collected from the taxpayers are spent.</P>
      <P>Investment in Irish industry should be greater.  I have seen proposals submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for what were considered in many parts of this country to be very worthy national projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>To the Minister and to the Industrial Development Authority.  The Minister is responsible to this House.  Therefore, when we speak of the Industrial Development Authority we mean the Minister who is answerable to the House, not the Industrial Development Authority who cannot come in here to answer for themselves.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Development Authority have been very <i>flaithiúlach</i> with the Irish taxpayers' money in giving very substantial industrial loans to foreigners.  All they wanted was to have an international name and they got a guaranteed loan. A proposal submitted by an all-Irish concern was immediately viewed with suspicion.  There is need for a complete overhaul of the system by which taxpayers' money is given to industry.</P>
      <P>In the course of speeches by the Minister for Finance time and again reference was made to a credit squeeze. We have had experience of such a credit squeeze for a considerable time past.  At the same time, the Taoiseach and his Ministers have appealed to the trade unions not to seek increases in pay.  What do the Taoiseach and the Ministers expect the trade unions to do?  Do they expect the unions to allow the cost of living to rise recklessly as a result of Government policy and Government action and make no demand on behalf of their members? The sooner it is realised that the trade unions play, have played and always will play, a very important part in the life of the country and that the trade union movement is the medium by which organised workers can seek fair play, justice and their rights the better. If the Government allow the cost of living to rise recklessly, if they allow an economic situation to develop which makes it more difficult for the wage-earners to eke out an existence the trade union movement are certainly obliged to seek fair play and justice for their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union movement adopted a most charitable attitude when the Taoiseach some weeks ago set out for them what percentage increase they should demand for the workers.  The Taoiseach was going to lecture the <Col N="608" /> trade union movement.  He was going to tell them and the workers what they should ask for and he was going to hold a big stick over their heads and say: &ldquo;Only ask what I tell you to ask and that is all you will get.&rdquo;  The time has come when a lecture to the workers by the Taoiseach, and even the threat of the use of the political stick by the Taoiseach, will not cut any ice with the organised section of the workers.</P>
    <P>This Budget has been responsible since 1st May for increasing the price of clothing, heating, light and food and has already substantially increased the living costs of every working-class home.  The trade unions will be failing in their duty to the sections of the community they speak for and represent if they do not seek justice and fair play for their members.  This Budget is a clear invitation to every section of the community and to all employees to seek substantial increases in order to cope with the increased cost of living. The trade union movement would most certainly be failing in their duty if they did not demand justice and fair play for those for whom they speak and those whom they represent.  I was referring to the credit squeeze as it has been described by the Minister for Finance and others.  I submit that from the Taoiseach downwards the Government have lost touch with reality and are living on the moon.  To give a small example I shall quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputies are finished.  I have a right to speak in this House and I am not going to say what Fianna Fáil Deputies would like me to say.  I was referring to the fact that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance made reference to the credit squeeze and, with the approval of the Government and the Minister for Finance, the banks considerably restricted the amount of credit in circulation. The banks refused to give any loans or to extend overdrafts for business, industry and agricultural investment.  For the past ten months there has been a very serious restriction of credit here.  This has been in operation since the week following the general election and it has been operated by the banks because, seemingly, they have the power and authority to do as they desire.  In addition to the restriction of credit there is now a bank strike in which the banks are on record as treating their employees with contempt.  How can we expect the banks to be generous with the State and with the citizens of this country when they cannot be generous with their own employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have in this country a system similar to what is operated in New Zealand whereby the Government do not have to go, hat in hand, to the commercial banks when money is required for national development, whether it be drainage, land reclamation or housing.  There is what is known as the &ldquo;reserve bank&rdquo; in New Zealand and this bank is empowered to undertake any loan proposed to be raised by the New Zealand Government or by the State Advances Corporation of New Zealand who buy and sell securities of the Government under the Reserve Bank (Amendment) <Col N="612" /> Act of 1936 and the Finance (No.2) Act of 1936.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has money available which is handed over to the New Zealand Government according as there is State demand for it, and the State demand for it is based on the national requirements for development, that is, the amount of unemployment existing at any particular time.  In the event of unemployment existing the Government do not make any approach to the commercial banks but go to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.  There was all-round recognition of this at the time the late Sir Walter Nash was Prime Minister of New Zealand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be some reserve financial institution set up here, independent of the commercial banks, which the State could call upon for the purpose of providing money for employment, housing, proper health services, and making a decent standard of living available to the people.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that a Government in a democracy has to go cap in hand to private individuals who have no responsibility to or from the people to seek loans at exorbitant rates of interest, which are a crippling burden on the taxpayer, in order to ensure that our people will be housed, that land will be drained, that our tourist trade will be promoted and that Irish industry will be geared to meet international competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come for some very serious thinking on this matter.  When one considers the rate of interest the banks can get away with charging to borrowers and then sees the rate of interest that can be provided by the banks to those who have their savings there, I respectfully say that an investigation into this by some courageous Government is long overdue, and the sooner it takes place the better.  There is an appalling housing shortage.  There is an appalling situation in which the tenants of urban houses both in city <Col N="613" /> and provincial areas are up in arms because of an unfair differential rent system.  Local authorities are engaging in the building of houses which, if they are to be let at an economic rent, the tenants cannot afford.  Surely housing and the provision of work for our people are of primary importance.</P>
    <P>Neither this Budget nor any previous Budget has tackled these national problems.  We are only operating a system of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Fianna Fáil tell us it is their job to close the gap between rich and poor, but they are making the gap wider.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of prosperity in this country, but there is also ample evidence of a vast amount of poverty It.  is only those, whether they are inside this House of outside it, who are associated with the work of charitable organisations who know the vast amount of poverty in many homes.  It should be the aim of all of us in this House, in so far as it is humanly possible, to eliminate hardship and distress from our society.  Very little has been done by Fianna Fáil to eliminate such distress and hardship which must follow where people are on fixed incomes or very meagre pensions.</P>
    <P>Next October, under the social welfare services of which the Fianna Fáil boast, a contributory pensioner will receive £5 per week and a non-contributory pensioner £4 per week. How do they expect a person to live on that?  In present circumstances the very least one would expect an old person or a sick person to live on would be £1 per day and even with £1 per day they would be put to the pin of their collar to eke out an existence. Why do the Fianna Fáil Party try to hoodwink the people as to the great benefits they are now bestowing upon them?  It is only keeping them from the very threshold of starvation.</P>

      <P>It cannot be said too often that this Budget gives nothing, that the benefits Fianna Fáil speak of for the social welfare recipients are only sufficient to compensate for the increase in the cost of living to date and that from 1st May onwards there will be increases in the cost of living as a result of the additional 2½ per cent turnover tax for which no provision has been made and social welfare recipients and the poorer sections of the community will find themselves worse off.  We find now that this Government have failed miserably in providing the people with the essentials of life and with that decent standard of living to which our people are entitled.</P>

      <P>Our people are not getting the standard of living to which they are entitled.  Fianna Fáil are not providing it for them.  They are not being provided with houses, with jobs, with a proper rate of pay. There is discontent in every branch of our economy.  There is no use painting a picture unless one paints realistically. The people are finding Fianna Fáil out.  It has taken them a long time, but the evidence is there now; that evidence was the &ldquo;snout&rdquo; victory for Fianna Fáil in the Dublin by-election, which should never have been, and their subsequent defeat in Kildare and Westmeath.  The evidence will be there in the by-elections to come.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is relevant.  Fianna Fáil will be removed from office in the next general election because of this Budget.  The people are crying out for an opportunity to put Fianna Fáil out.  We in the Opposition have a duty and an obligation to provide the Irish people with an alternative Government to Fianna Fáil.  I have no doubt but that that will be done.  We have a duty to do it in order to save the people from further ruin and disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increased turnover tax will make it impossible for our people to live.  It will close down every shop in the country and bring ruin and disaster to our country towns.  It will put the rates of local authorities beyond the capacity of the ratepayers to pay because this increased turnover tax will have a very serious effect on rates.  Local authorities will have to pay more for the food supplied in institutions.  There will be demands from the workers for increased wages to meet the increase in the cost of living, an increase recklessly engineered by Fianna Fáil.  I think the time has come when they should be sufficiently courageous to stand up and say that they have now discovered they have failed to provide a remedy for our <Col N="620" /> national and economic ills and that they will get out and permit an alternative government, a government which will provide our people with a decent standard of living and the necessities of life.</P>
    <P>This Budget is a disastrous one.  It sounds the death knell of every small shopkeeper in the country.  It will impose a severe hardship on every man, woman and child who will have to pay for food, fuel, light and clothing. A Budget such as this could not command the support of conscientious people and if there are Fianna Fáil Deputies, like Deputy Moore, Deputy Foley and Deputy Tunney, who are concerned about the price of food, let them stand up and be counted.  Let them oppose this Budget.  This is the place in which to do it, not behind closed doors.  This is what Parliament is for.  Parliament is the voice of the people.  If these Deputies do not approve of dearer food, of shopkeepers closing down, of the creation of bigger combines and more foreign controlled supermarkets, then let them stand up and show their disagreement.  Let them go into the division lobbies and have the courage to fight against this imposition. I challenge them to do it.</P>
    <P>This Budget will confer no benefits on social welfare recipients, on the disabled, on the deserted wives and so on, because every person who benefits will get with one hand what will be taken away with the other hand in dearer food and dearer clothing and higher rates and bigger rents.  This Budget is a colossal fraud.  It is one of the biggest frauds ever perpetrated and we have a duty in Opposition, both Fine Gael and Labour, to expose the fraud at the church gates and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>We warned the people about the turnover tax and, in protest, the people did not support <Col N="621" /> Fianna Fáil.  They gave Fianna Fáil notice to quit, four years advance notice.  Fianna Fáil are beginning to crumble now and, who knows, but that the change may come sooner than four years.  We must be prepared.  Fianna Fáil are withering away.  They are being overtaken by their own dishonesty, corruption and deceit.  It is our duty to expose this dishonest Budget, this piece of political trickery designed to impose additional hardships on all sections of the people, designed to make the gap wider between rich and poor.  Ireland is becoming a very pleasant hunting ground for the few, the few who are associated with Taca; for the hard workers, the farmers, the trade unionists this Budget spells disaster. It may take six months, eight months or 12 months before the position is fully revealed, but there are tens of thousands who will regret the day on which this Budget got the approval of Parliament.  It is certainly a Budget not in the best interests of the country.  It is a dishonest Budget and those who know it is dishonest should be sufficiently courageous to stand up and be counted in their opposition to what can only be described as chicanery.  It is introduced by dishonest men, surrounded by suspicion, men who have failed to provide our people with even a nominal form of the proper standard of living. That is why the Government have lost the confidence of all sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say that I command or wield any influence in the trade union movement but I hope that movement will be sufficiently courageous to ensure their members are given a fair deal and that if Fianna Fáil recklessly put up the cost of living the piper will be paid.  Workers must not be hoodwinked by having their income drastically reduced by dearer food.  If we see the cost of living rising, then in order to cope with the increased cost workers' wives and families must be protected.  The only safeguard and protection they have is their trade union. May the Lord help us on the day we have not a good strong trade union movement.  Thank God we have it and may it long flourish to ensure that the workers will at least have a voice to <Col N="622" /> demand justice and fair play because never before has there been such a need for justice and fair play for the underpaid workers and the poorer sections of the community as we shall have following this disastrous Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take up where Deputy Flanagan left off when he came out loudly and clearly against the increase in the turnover tax announced in the Budget.  The provision was made mainly to provide greater benefits for all sections of the community. The turnover tax issue was discussed in 1963-64 and it was the principal issue in the general election in 1965 when Fianna Fáil were returned to office.  I distinctly remember a few days before that general election standing on my doorstep in Killarney and hearing the former Deputy Dillon, then leader of Fine Gael, stating that if Fine Gael were returned to office they would repeal the turnover tax if possible.  He was well guarded because he said &ldquo;if possible&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We know all the arguments for and against the turnover tax at that time.  I read with interest the Dáil Debates during 1963 and 1964 and I know the arguments that were made.  These arguments were put clearly to the people in March and April, 1965, and the public came out clearly in favour of the turnover tax as a method of providing income to meet necessary expenditure. We should not forget that the turnover tax issue was fought and won in the general election of 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the increase in turn-over tax and the decrease in direct income tax by way of tax-free allowances we know that about 30,000 taxpayers, principally workers in the lower income bracket, will now escape the income tax net.  This is a great achievement of which Fianna Fáil can be quite proud.  I ask the Opposition, Fine Gael and Labour, to say now where they would get the £40 to £43 million necessary to provide increased benefits in social welfare, better educational and agricultural services, more money for industry and increases for pensioners and other sections of the community? It is only fair that the public should <Col N="623" /> know where the Opposition would get this money provided now by the turn-over tax.  This is a question that should be answered at some stage by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Would the Opposition prefer to increase direct taxation and have the workers pay tax at 9s or 10s in the £ instead of the reduced rate of tax which many of them will now enjoy as a result of this Budget?  One must remember how far wrong the Opposition were in their judgments this time last year when the 1969 Budget was introduced.  In the general election campaign they said there would be a supplementary Budget immediately after the general election.  When that did not happen we were told it would be in October or November.  Then we were told it would be in February or March. Then the big bombshell came for the Opposition when the books balanced at the end of March.  It showed remarkable foresight on the part of the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, that they were able to see so far ahead when, out of a total expenditure of £411 million, we were only out by £500,000.  If an ordinary man were to budget for £411 and was only 10s out at the end of the year we would say he did a very good job.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be a member of the Government party who were able to bring in a Budget such as this providing better benefits for all sections of the community.  I very much resent the attack made by Deputy Flanagan on the Minister for Finance.  I consider this a masterly Budget.  In agriculture, for example, it is gratifying to note that sheep farmers will get an extra 30s subsidy on the mountain lamb and the hogget ewe.  It is also noteworthy that the beef subsidy schemes have been increased from £12 to £16 per head and to £21 for the first qualifying animal and £19 for the second.  A few years ago nobody could foresee money being available for such a scheme or such a scheme being so successful.  Our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries deserves great praise for his foresight in introducing this scheme.</P>
    <P>We were glad to be able to give 1d <Col N="624" /> a gallon on the first 7,000 gallons of milk.  Many suppliers cannot supply more than 7,000 gallons because their holdings are too small.  The Government are also assisting these farmers by unemployment assistance under the small farms scheme.  Not alone are we able to give the 1d a gallon increase for milk to them but we are also increasing unemployment assistance by 10s a week and 2s 6d per child.  Apart from the increased price for milk the average small farmer with five or six children will get an extra £1 a week. The increase in the turnover tax is appreciated by all the farmers who will benefit from the increase in the beef subsidy, the increase in the lamb subsidy, the increase in the hog and ewe subsidy, the increase in the price of milk and the increase in unemployment assistance for the small farmer.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for expenditure of more money on farm buildings and water supply grants for farmyards.  We all know that more and more water supply schemes are being put into operation and carried out throughout the country.  It is natural that the farmers should be one of the first sections of the community to benefit from these schemes.  It is only right and fitting that greater provision should be made in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for the payment of these grants.  I can foresee a great increase in the number of grant applications under this heading during the coming year, particularly with the great advances that are being made in group water supply schemes in many counties.</P>
    <P>In the field of social welfare Fianna Fáil have a proud record, a record which we can stand over and face the public with any day.  There was some increase in social welfare benefits in every single year since 1957.  This beings me back to what Deputy Flanagan said a short time ago.  He stated that Deputy Foley did not remember what had happened in 1957.  I well remember Killarney during the reign of the inter-Party Government.  I remember the long queues at the labour exchange.  Today it is difficult to find an unemployed man in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> In every single Budget since 1957, Fianna Fáil were able to provide some increase in social welfare benefits.  The increases granted this year are the biggest ever granted in any single year. We have increases in old age pensions, contributory and non-contributory pensions, widows' pensions, children's allowances.  The public know what Fianna Fáil are doing for them, and they appreciate it.</P>
    <P>In the field of health, it is only fair to say that anyone with any commonsense would expect that the estimate for the health services would be increased. Every Deputy who voted against the turnover tax on the day of the Budget voted against better working conditions and better salaries and wages for the health staffs, for the staffs in hospitals, for the administrative staffs of the health authorities and for those working with the health authorities.  Provision was made in the estimate for an increased contribution to the health authorities for the payment of better salaries and wages and better working conditions for the health staffs, and also better facilities and better hospitalisation for our people.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the improvements that are being carried out every year in our hospitals.  This year expenditure will be much higher than it was last year.  Again, those who voted against the turnover tax, to my mind in any event, voted against the provision of money for better hospitalisation for our people.  Our people are at least entitled to the hospitalisation which is available to them.  They are entitled to better, indeed, and we hope that we will be in office for some years to come to provide better hospital services for our people, and that we will be able to use the extra money coming into the Exchequer, as a result of increasing expenditure and a better standard of living and the greater inflow of money into our economy, to help the health authorities to provide better health services and better hospitalisation for our people.</P>
    <P>We all know that the Minister for Health will shortly be bringing into operation the regulations which will provide more health services for many <Col N="626" /> of our people who are now outside the scope of the Health Act, particularly those in the lower income group.  We know that when certain regulations are brought into operation in accordance with the provisions of the recent Health Act, a person applying for a medical card, for registration in the general medical services register, will be entitled to have his or her application considered on its merits alone.  No longer will family income be taken into consideration.  No longer will the income of each unmarried son or daughter living in the household be taken into account, as is the position now and as has been the position since 1953.</P>
    <P>This will mean that more people will be entitled to free general medical practitioner services, free drugs and medicines.  When these regulations are brought into operation we know that medical card holders will be entitled to go to the doctor of their choice and will be able to get free drugs and medicines from the chemist of their choice.  No longer will it be necessary for these people to line up outside the dispensaries in many areas, as has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>When regulations under another section of the Act are put into operation anyone who applies for a disabled person's maintenance allowance will be entitled to have his or her application considered on its merits alone.  No longer will the income of each unmarried brother and sister residing in the household with the applicant be taken into account.  This means that more people will qualify for a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  It is a hard thing to say, but I think it should be said, that Deputies who voted against the increase in the turnover tax voted against the provision of the money to provide these better health benefits for our people.</P>
    <P>I cannot recall any Opposition speaker mentioning the Gaeltacht.  We have a special regard for the Gaeltacht. Provision has been made this year for increased expenditure on furniture grants for those in the Gaeltacht who are providing holiday accommodation and also for special Gaeltacht housing <Col N="627" /> grants.  Money is also provided for special Gaeltacht grants for the provision of water and sewerage facilities and water and sewerage schemes in the Gaeltacht areas.  The people in the Gaeltacht very much appreciate what Fianna Fáil are doing for them and the special regard which Fianna Fáil have shown for them by providing these special grants for services.</P>
    <P>In the field of industry there is no doubt we are making remarkable progress and the proof of that is that despite the drop in employment in agriculture there has been an increase in the population.  This trend is accepted by all.  It is entirely due to the great industrial expansion throughout the country.  Most counties have benefited from this industrial progress.  In Kerry we have benefited considerably, particularly in the entire central area of the county, from Killarney to Killorglin and from Tralee to Castleisland.  We hope that in a short time the rest of the country will become similarly industrialised.</P>
    <P>There has been an extension in the free travel scheme to include the wives or the husbands of IRA medal holders and old age pensioners under the age of 70 years.  This was a most thoughtful move on the part of the Government and of the Minister for Finance. On numerous occasions recently I made representations to the Minister for Defence and Social Welfare on behalf of the wives or husbands of IRA medal holders and old age pensioners because I thought that in fairness they should qualify for free transport.</P>
    <P>We are proud to have been in a position to increase the pensions of former State and local authority employees by 14 per cent.  Were it not for the turnover tax we would not have been able to do this.  This increase in pensions is a reasonable one.  Many public service pensioners retired at a time when their salaries and allowances were low and therefore their pensionable remunerations were low. They have been granted increases under various Acts during the past ten years but this 14 per cent is substantial. Naturally we should like <Col N="628" /> these pensioners to get more but the Government have done a good job so far in their respect.</P>
    <P>In the field of education, Fianna Fáil have a very proud record.  To provide for improvements in existing schemes and for new schemes, the turnover tax increase was necessary. The scheme of free post-primary education has been an outstanding success and so has the free school transport scheme.  I remember distinctly that when the scheme of free post-primary education was first introduced by the former Minister for Education, the late Deputy O'Malley, many Opposition Deputies said the scheme could not work, that teachers would not be available and that the schools in existence could not cater for the increasing numbers of children who would be available to go to them. The scheme was put into operation swiftly, smoothly, efficiently, and it has worked superbly.  Many thousands of our children now have access to free post-primary education who would not have had it otherwise.</P>
    <P>The scheme of free school transport in respect of post-primary schools was also very successful.  The success can be gauged by a number of children who are being taken to post-primary schools.  We all know that in remote rural areas the free post-primary education scheme would not have meant anything to parents and children were it not for the free transport system.  Otherwise they could not have availed of the free education facilities. Free transport has been bringing in thousands of additional children to post-primary schools, to secondary and vocational schools.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a free transport scheme for primary schools has also been a great success.  This scheme has been operated only in certain circumstances and it is an innovation which has become most popular.  Free transport for children going to primary schools is being extended throughout the country at the rate at which applications are reaching the Department. In Kerry many areas are now well covered and already we have had six new schemes sanctioned in respect <Col N="629" /> of south Kerry.  This is a great advantage to the children, especially those who live long distances from national schools.</P>
    <P>It would not have been possible to maintain all these schemes were it not for the extra revenue from the increased turnover tax.  It would not have been possible to provide the additional remuneration for teachers and it would not have been possible to provide better facilities in our schools and for the improvement and renovation of our schools were it not for the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who voted against the turnover tax voted against the possibility of extending these services. <Col N="630" /> He voted against the extension of free school transport to our national and post-primary schools, against the provision of additional money required for the improvement of our schools and the additional remuneration provided for teachers.</P>

    <P>*Already partly allotted.</P>
    <P>NOTES: 1.  The position regarding lands on hands in the possession of the Land Commission for distribution is subject to constant fluctuation, depending upon progress in intake and allotment.</P>
    <P>2. It is not possible at present to indicate when the individual Estates mentioned will be allotted but there will be no avoidable delay.  The necessary local inquiries preliminary to allotment are being pushed forward as rapidly as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>3. During the last three complete financial years the aggregate area allotted in Co. Meath was approximately 5,500 acres.</P>
