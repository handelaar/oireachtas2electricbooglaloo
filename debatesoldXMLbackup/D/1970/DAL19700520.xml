      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is prepared to amend the qualifications for the office of permanent nurse under county councils and health authorities to provide for the appointment in a permanent capacity of married nurses separated from their husbands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that while the practice of excluding married women from permanent nursing appointments under local authorities continues, it cannot, under existing legislation, be modified in favour of married nurses who are separated from their husbands.  The practice in regard to the employment of married nurses will no doubt come under the scrutiny of the Commission on the Status of Women which has recently been established by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to explain why permanent established appointments are given to male married nurses and denied to female married nurses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained at some considerable length in the House already, and there is no need to repeat what I said, these are matters that must be considered by the commission in regard to the status of women.  It would be quite wrong for me, as Minister for Health, to start making unilateral decisions which would affect other people <Col N="1928" /> in the service.  It is best to wait for the commission to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we need a State commission to decide whether or not male or female married nurses are grossly discriminated against in this setting?  Surely the Minister knows quite well that this is a preposterous situation which he should end by bringing in amending legislation rather than waiting for a commission to report in five or six years time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the ESB in the Cork area are refusing to accept Government paying orders in payment of accounts; and that they are threatening to have supplies disconnected in such cases; and if he will have this matter investigated and take steps to avoid hardship to the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Government payable orders are non-negotiable.  I am informed by the ESB that, nevertheless, they normally accept them in payment of accounts provided the name of the payee corresponds with that on the account being paid.  The board cannot, however, because of the obvious risks involved, undertake to accept such orders from business people who have cashed them for third parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>During the present bank strike would the ESB not consider relaxing this rule in order to facilitate customers?  I know one case in which a man was threatened he would have his supply cut off and the ESB would not accept this order as payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently there is some difficulty about it.  If the order is in the name of the payee it will be accepted.  That is surely a reasonable compromise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say what risk is involved but I suppose the risk is that it might have been cashed already and might not be valid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister for Transport and Power to look at it again but, as far as I know, the ESB will take the same attitude on this occasion as they took on the occasion of the last bank strike.  I replied to a question at that time indicating that the average number of persons disconnected had not increased during the whole period of that bank strike which showed that the ESB took a reasonably helpful attitude and did not disconnect a larger number of persons as a percentage of the total number of payments made and I have no reason to believe that they will take a harsher attitude on the occasion of this bank strike.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Would the Minister not agree that it would be wholly unreasonable for the ESB to disconnect even one person during the bank strike in view of the fact that they were able to operate for six months during their own strike, stand out of payment and not disconnect anybody during that period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the ESB have got back to the normal rhythm of payment and know the people who are bad payers and who have to be disconnected.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question implies that a decision is outstanding in this case and this is not correct.  The applicant did not reply to an inquiry addressed to him on 8th January, 1970, requesting him to furnish a statement which would enable his earnings in the previous year to be established.  His qualification certificate was accordingly revoked with effect from 4th February, 1970, on the ground that he had failed to show that his means do not exceed the statutory limit in his case for entitlement to unemployment assistance.  The application was notified of this decision on 24th February, 1970, and he subsequently appealed but still did not furnish the required information.  The appeals officer confirmed the decision revoking his qualification certificate on 25th March, 1970.  Notification of the appeal decision was issued on 6th April, 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that all the information that the man could produce was handed in?  I even handed in the information available. Every effort was made by him to provide the information.  He could not get the necessary qualification certificate from the society of which he was a member because the rules do not allow them to provide this information. Is the Minister further aware that, because of the harsh treatment this man has received, he, his wife and his family have been on public assistance for the <Col N="1933" /> past five weeks?  I would ask the Minister to have a look at it again.  All the information available is in his office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that the applicant is in receipt of public assistance, which would seem to indicate that his means are not good, but I am aware that he has not supplied the necessary information with regard to his income.  The Deputy states he is precluded from getting this information because of some rule.  That does not necessarily exempt him or make him an exceptional case.  The Department must find out what the income is in order to know whether or not he exceeds the statutory limit.  I suggest he advises his employers to give the information. If he gives his consent I am sure the employers will furnish the information. One cannot make exceptions, as the House is aware.  I am sorry he is in receipt of home assistance but, in the light of existing legislation and under the regulations, the Department must find out what this man's means are.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether detailed work targets are set for officials in the Estate Duty Office; (b) if so, by whom they are set and the sanctions imposed for non-fulfilment; (c) whether estate duty work is appropriate to a scheme of this kind having regard to the varying nature of the work; and (d) whether experience has shown that schemes of this kind result in a shedding of more difficult cases in order to reach targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of the work of the estate duty branch is such that the type of control envisaged by Deputy Fitzpatrick is not appropriate.  Some cases may be disposed of in a matter of hours while others may take days to complete.  Each section in the branch is supervised by a senior examiner whose duties include that of ensuring that a reasonable output is forthcoming from each official in the section.  In addition, each official gives a weekly return showing the number of cases dealt with by him during the week. The weekly return from each section indicates the number of cases on hands and the date of the oldest case.  The flow of work is accordingly subject to weekly review.  The &ldquo;shedding&rdquo; of more difficult cases would immediately be highlighted if such a practice were to develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is it correct to say that, under recent <Col N="1935" /> regulations within the Department, an official is required to deal with a given number of cases each day or each week?  If that is so, does the Minister not agree that such a rule or regulation is inappropriate to the Estate Duty Office because of the vast differences between one case and another?  If the Minister can give me an assurance that no such regulation, setting a numerical target each day or each week, without regard to the type of case involved, is in existence I will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me is that no such rule is in operation and, for the very reasons mentioned by the Deputy and by me in my reply, it would not be appropriate because there are such considerable differences between different kinds of cases.  Therefore, I can give the Deputy the assurance that no such rule is in operation.</P>

      <P>This property was first purchased on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  Subsequently it was decided to have only a one-man station there but there was difficulty in this because the one man posted there found it hard to get meals in the locality.  In the meantime the Department of Justice had been reviewing the organisation of the police force and in 1969 the Department of Justice informed the Office of Public Works that they were going to close this station permanently.  At that stage the Office of Public Works communicated with other Government Departments to see if any of them required this property or any part of it.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs do require part of it and the balance is now out for tender and tenders are due in on 9th June.</P>

In particular, pig producers who are members of co-operative societies operating such units greatly benefit <Col N="1942" /> from their activities.

The units can, of course, be of particular benefit to farmers who sell their pigs at the bonham stage.</P>

The whole purpose of the operation is to increase the incomes of the small producers.  The pig industry is particularly suited to the small farmer.  The size of a farm does not determine the size of the pig enterprise operated on it.  It is fallacious to suggest that because certain enterprising people, including people in west Cork, are expanding their pig operations, they are having a detrimental effect on somebody else.  The case is, as Deputy O'Hara says, that any progressive small farmer who wants to develop his pig enterprise can do so with greatly increased grants.  There is no question at all of the small person being steam-rolled out.  In fact, most of the grants paid to date have been paid to cooperatives which consist of small farmers.</P>

      <P>To use the Minister's own term, surely it is fallacious for him to make the statements he has just made?  Surely he will agree that the market is limited?  Taking into account what his Parliamentary Secretary across the way said, that we were unable <Col N="1944" /> to fulfil our quota, is it not reasonable to assume, particularly coming from me, a Deputy representing an area in which 11 per cent of our pigs are produced, that if these large combines get free rein and grants and help from the Department, the small producers, the farmers and cottiers who have been producing pigs down through the years, will be wiped out eventually?  Does the Minister not appreciate that many small farmers derive a significant percentage of their income from this source?  Surely it is unfair for the Department to sit idly by and allow that to happen?  To conclude let me say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is satisfied that there are sufficient judges to ensure that traditional sessions of the circuit court can be held in Waterford city and county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the business of the circuit court as a whole can be discharged with reasonable expedition with ten judges.</P>
      <P>The president of the circuit court, who is the statutory authority in relation to the prompt dispatch of the business of the circuit court in the several circuits, has been arranging for the temporary transfer to the Dublin circuit of provincial circuit judges, to deal with an arrears position which developed in that circuit last year.</P>
      <P>The recent adjournment of the Waterford sittings arose from the transfer of the judge to Dublin under this arrangement.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, however, that it should be possible to so arrange the provincial sittings of the circuit court that temporary assistance can be provided for the Dublin circuit while maintaining the normal provincial sittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a circuit court sitting in Dungarvan was cancelled last April and that this has disrupted the whole process of law in County Waterford? To say that they have to be transferred to Dublin is a very poor reflection on the whole system.  Apparently there are not enough judges available. This is a very serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already stated in answer to the Deputy's question, I am satisfied that there is an adequate number of circuit court judges to carry out the entire business of the circuit court.  It happened, as I explained, that last year the criminal business of the Dublin Circuit Court fell into arrears.  The president of the circuit court, on the suggestion of my predecessor, assigned, for short temporary periods in turn, each of the provincial circuit judges to the Dublin Circuit Court to try to clear the arrears.  The facts show that all the provincial judges, except one, could be assigned to the Dublin circuit for temporary periods and still have ample time to do their full work in their own circuits.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I take it the Minister concedes that there is an accumulation of arrears in the Dublin Circuit Court and that it is necessary to transfer country judges to the city to clear them up.  Is the Minister aware that, within the past fortnight a judge permanently assigned to Dublin city has been transferred to the country to relieve congestion there?  Would the Minister look into the whole matter, now that he has brought a new mind to bear on it, and check the information given by his Department?  He will find that a circuit court judge from the city has, in the past fortnight, been transferred to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  It may happen that a judge had to be assigned to the provincial circuit, temporarily, because of illness or the unavailability of the judge.  The figures show that, apart from the eastern <Col N="1949" /> circuit where Judge Deale sat for a great number of days, there is ample sitting time in the other circuits which was not used before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big volume of opinion that a great deal of time is wasted in our courts.  This latest innovation of arguments in the absence of juries, sometimes taking up days, is regarded by the general public as a racket.  Those two items account in many instances for additional calls on public funds and account for a waste of time in our courts, which should not be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that the carrying out of legal argument, in the absence of a jury, is not a recent innovation or racket.  It has always been part of our law.  It is there for the protection of the accused person.  There are various matters which counsel might wish to put to the judge on points of law and it might prejudice the accused if the jury were present at that time.  That has been a normal feature of criminal jury trials for many years.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that many of these long legal arguments before the judge, in the absence of the jury, arise from attempts by the prosecution to tender evidence, by way of statements and otherwise, which is not legally admissible and which should never be attempted to be put before the jury?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in the northern circuit, it has been necessary for the president to come up to relieve the circuit judge where there has been congestion?  If the circuit judge from the northern circuit, who also does Cavan and Monaghan, is taken away from that northern circuit, there will again be an accumulation of arrears.  When this House agreed to the up-grading of salaries of district court justices and judges of the High Court, we did so on condition that a Bill would be introduced here extending the jurisdiction of the lower courts.  It was for that reason that the House agreed to the increase in salaries. Furthermore, it was for that reason that we agreed to limit the number of circuit court judges.  We came to the conclusion that circuit court work would diminish if district justices got greater jurisdiction.  Will the Minister try to implement the undertaking of his predecessor in office to this House that the new jurisdiction Bill would be introduced as soon as possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the House that a Bill increasing the jurisdictions, as mentioned, will, I hope, come before the House quite shortly: it is before the Government at present.  With regard to the complaint relative to the northern circuit, I would point out that, on the basis of a normal sitting year of 35 weeks composed of four sitting days each week, a provincial judge can be expected to sit on 140 days.  In the year ended 31st July, 1969, a circuit court judge sat in the northern circuit on 114 days.</P>

On his own statement, would the Minister not accept that the judge referred to works 456 hours a year&mdash; 114 days multiplied by four.  The position may be different from the High Court where judgments are reserved in a number of cases.  We cannot afford to have people earning big salaries and working for only 456 hours per annum. The general public are saying throughout <Col N="1951" /> the country that we are too soft in this island of ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to.  It consisted of pre-Budget speculation which clearly had no foundation in fact.  Figures for the total number of slot machines in use at present are not available.  I am satisfied, however, that the figure given in the newspaper report in question is grossly exaggerated.</P>
      <P>The operation of slot machines is regulated by the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  Section 10 of that Act prohibits the operation of any slot machine that is &ldquo;designed to deliver&rdquo; a money prize when successfully operated.  That section was for many years interpreted by district justices as allowing the use of machines which do not deliver prizes direct to the player, but in December 1968 the Supreme Court held that this interpretation was wrong and that, in effect, the section prohibits the operation of all slot machines that deliver prizes.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Gaming and Lotteries Bill, 1969, which was recently passed by the Dáil and is now awaiting consideration by the Seanad, provides for the removal of this absolute prohibition and will permit of the operation of all types of slot machines, subject, however, to the general restrictions on gaming contained in the 1956 Act.  The effect of those restrictions is that in general gaming may only be carried on in an area where the local authority has formally passed a resolution adopting the relevant provisions of the 1956 Act and then only in amusement halls and fun fairs licensed for the purpose on the authority of the district court.  The maximum stake is 6d and the maximum prize 10s in each game.</P>

        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Justice (a) whether daily work targets are set for Land Registry officials, (b) by whom they are set and the sanctions imposed for non-fulfilment, (c) whether he considers Land Registry work is appropriate to a scheme of this kind because of the varying nature of the work, and (d) whether experience has shown that schemes of this kind result in the shedding of more difficult cases in order to reach targets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Work targets are set at various levels, <Col N="1958" /> though not on a daily basis, and they have produced substantially improved results.  The targets are set by the registrar in consultation with experienced officials including an organisation and methods officer with special training in this type of operation.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the schemes in operation take full account of the question of possible deferment of more difficult cases.  This is guarded against by adequate supervision.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Will the Minister agree with me, as the Minister for Finance did in relation to the Estate Duty Office, that any sort of numerical targets are inappropriate to the Land Registry, where cases can be as different as chalk is to cheese, where one case might be dealt with in three minutes and another case might take three hours or a whole day?

      <P>Could the Minister do anything, by increasing the staff or otherwise, to expedite dealing with applications?  Is the Minister not aware that many people have to wait long periods, more than six months in some cases, and, I understand from recent comments at a county council meeting in Cork, up to 12 months in others?

      <P>I am aware there have been some delays in the past, particularly in the mapping branch.  A very special effort was made to overcome those and they are now beginning to be overcome successfully.  The Deputy will appreciate that many of the complaints which he and other Deputies receive about alleged delays in the Land Registry are not, in fact, the fault of the Land Registry.  Very often it is found on investigation that requisitions were issued three and six months earlier to the parties lodging the dealings and requisitions were not replied to at all or were not adequately replied to.</P>

      <P>In view of the unrest there has been in that office over the targets set, would the Minister agree to look into this question of the appropriateness of targets of this kind to professional work, the incentives they give to skimp work or to postpone it?  As a new Minister, will he agree to look at this again personally with an open mind rather than necessarily adopt a defensive stance on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish now to deal with what I consider the most contradictory and controversial aspect of this year's Budget, that is to say, the complete absence of any measure to deal with the current insidious inflation in our economy or, indeed, the absence of any measure to counter the most serious position of our balance of payments. Because of the recent political crisis I have information that there has been a large-scale cancellation of hotel bookings throughout the country.  This will have severe repercussions on the balance of payments and on our economy as a whole.  In regard to the inflationary position I should like to quote the speech of the former Minister for Finance on the presentation of this year's Budget, at column 1721, volume 245, of the Official Report of Wednesday, 22nd April, 1970:</P>
      <P>Prices here are now going upwards faster than in most other countries in the OECD and the dangers for the future wellbeing of this country if the trend continues are obvious.</P>
      <P>Later on he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot sustain such a rate of price increases and have satisfactory economic growth as well.  If prices continue to rise and our unit wage costs to increase as they have been doing our goods will cease to <Col N="1963" /> be competitive on either the home or the export markets.</P>
    <P>That is a serious position.  That view is backed by a number of publications. I should like to quote briefly from the spring issue of the Central Bank Report:</P>
    <P>It has been evident for some time that Irish prices and costs are rising so fast that competitiveness and the future growth of output and employment are being jeopardised.  Action to restrain the excessive rise in prices and the related increase in the external deficit is an urgent priority.</P>
    <P>Or, again, in Report No. 27 on incomes and prices policy of the National Industrial and Economic Council, at page 9:</P>
    <P>There is now a real danger that many Irish goods will become less competitive both on the home and export markets.  The external deficit could be widened beyond the possibility of recovery and employment and output could suffer.</P>
    <P>Or, even again, the Report of the Industrial and Social Research Institute, page 1; speaking of rising prices:</P>
    <P>The worst part of the damage done by rising prices is the part that is least visible, the damage to the prospect of new jobs and of ending emigration.</P>
    <P>All these pronouncements by experts, which should be taken into account by any Minister for Finance presenting a Budget, have been completely ignored by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>For a number of years reports of the Central Bank have been criticising Government monetary policy and, indeed, Government fiscal policy, all to no avail.  One must come to the opinion that the Fianna Fáil Government do not care about the economy as a whole.  Lust for power, apparently, is the overriding factor and, I venture to say, especially in times of election, proper and sound monetary policy has been thrown to the wind on a number of occasions.  This is a pity because proper monetary policy is very essential to the country's development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> We are, I am sorry to say, reaching a crisis in the matter of inflation.  This crisis could have been avoided if successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance had had the guts to manage the economy properly.  It is evident that they have not done so.  The effects of this rampant and insidious inflation have been felt and indeed will be felt in the coming year perhaps more severely than ever before on a number of fronts.  It is expected that in the coming year investment in the economy will decrease.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote again expert opinion from the Quarterly Economic Commentary, March, 1970, of the Economic and Social Research Institute:</P>
    <P>Other features of the forecast for 1970 which is set out in Table 2.2 include a strong growth in consumption, a reduced expansion in investment and a lower rate of stock building.</P>
    <P>That in any economy, perhaps more especially in a developing economy such as Ireland, is very, very serious. It is fair to say that it can be directly attributable to the inflation which has persisted in our economy for a number of years.  The long term effects of inflation upon our export potential must be obvious to all.</P>
    <P>It is all right for a Minister to come into the House and to say that we can have inflation once we keep it more or less in line with our customer countries. That is not quite so; it is a false statement.  We must keep inflation in line with other countries who are exporting to our customer countries.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Irish Sea is the costliest expanse of water across which to transport goods.  It is probably fair to say that it is as cheap to transport meat from the Argentine to London as it is to transport meat from the west of Ireland to London.  This is a crazy state of affairs.  Nobody seems to comment upon it.  Nevertheless, it is a fact of life which has serious connotations for our export industry.</P>
    <P>All costs, labour costs, taxation costs&mdash;we must remember that taxation bears heavily on business people &mdash;building costs, equipment costs have gone very high in the last few years <Col N="1965" /> and if we are to remain competitive someone, sometime, in Government must take sound action to ensure that we at least will survive.  It is apparent that the Fianna Fáil Party are not capable of such action.</P>
    <P>Inflation has a serious effect in the social field.  There are people living on pensions, people living on incomes from investment, perhaps a bit of old property or land.  The Fianna Fáil Government do not seem to care about these people.  This is very serious.  Our country has a higher proportion of persons living on social services than most other western European countries. It has a higher percentage of older persons.  Inflation hurts these people very much, deep in their pockets.  Again, the Government do not seem to care.</P>
    <P>The real danger of the balance of payments position was referred to by the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement of 22nd April at column 1720 of the Official Report, as follows:</P>
    <P>A surplus of £15 million in 1967 gave way to a deficit of £22 million in 1968: last year, the deficit was about £60 million.  This year, despite a small improvement in the first quarter, the deficit could be substantially higher.  This trend has grave implications for the economy. Unless we abate the excessive increases in domestic consumption and costs, the gains of the past decade and our potential for further progress in the seventies could be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>That is a serious quotation from the Minister's speech which is worth examination and worth bearing in mind.  The fact is that in official reports a figure as high as £90 million has been given as the possible balance of payments deficit in 1970.  Another figure that has been given is £75 million. The country's reserves will not stand up to that kind of continuous buffeting.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister for Finance ignored expert advice.  It is all right coming into this House and giving increases in social welfare allowances but the Budget which he prepared <Col N="1966" /> ignored his responsibility to the economy, a responsibility which is a grave one and which must be faced up to if we are to survive within the EEC or within any free trade area.</P>
    <P>It is a dangerous policy to pursue to say that capital inflows will offset the balance of payments deficit over a period of years.  This money could disappear as quickly as it came in and the recent political crisis will encourage it to disappear.  Perhaps, it has disappeared; we do not know.  Continued inflation has resulted in a large number of serious strikes.  It is all right for people to say that the trade unions have been pressing for higher and higher incomes but the fact is that the Government have been the main cause of that inflation and to a very large extent they must bear the responsibility for the number and extent of the strikes we have had in the last few years.</P>
    <P>The inflationary position is going to hurt the tourist business and if we are to survive in the tourist field, we must contain price rises at all levels.  As I have already said there has been a reduction in hotel bookings throughout the country because of the recent crisis. The position is far more serious than it might first appear.  The present inflationary crisis can, in fairness, be attributed to some small extent to the increase in the cost of imports, imports which may be essential to our economy, imports of capital goods.  It is, perhaps, an aspect of the matter which must be acceptable to the Government and the people; if we are to industrialise we must have these essentials.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, the main cause of inflation has been an excess in domestic expenditure on all fronts.  The greater factor in this expenditure is Government expenditure. No longer is the yearly budget balancing the country's essential services which are run by the Government. In our position we should be budgeting for surplus but the Government have not got the guts to manage the economy properly.</P>
    <P>Under the third heading of excess incomes there have been excess incomes granted and sought in the last few years but it was an excess under <Col N="1967" /> all headings: excess of incomes from house rents and, indeed, there has been extortion in the rent level in the last few years especially in Dublin and in other major cities; there have been excessive profits which should be controlled; there has been an excess of incomes from dividends and in the incomes of members of the trade unions.  We must make a conscious effort to produce an acceptable and voluntary policy of prices and incomes. It is essential for the survival of our economy that the people on all fronts should come together and agree on such a voluntary policy.  The Government have not engendered the proper atmosphere in which this could come about.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a few recent references to a policy on prices and incomes.  The first is a reference by Michael P. Fogarty in a report produced under the auspices of the Economic and Social Research Institute &ldquo;We Can Stop Rising Prices&rdquo;. He suggested that a prices stabilisation level should be imposed on both dividends and pay.  He said that there would be an exemption from the tax for any firm or other organisation which satisfied the appropriate Minister&mdash;Labour in the case of pay, Finance in the case of incomes&mdash;that it intended in the next year to follow a pay and dividends policy in line with national incomes policy.  It is an idea worth discussing.  It has not been discussed and no action has been taken so far.  He was quite unhappy with the present method of negotiating price increases.  In the same report he said:</P>
    <P>If you look at Con Murphy's report on the maintenance dispute last year, or the report of my committee on the ESB&mdash;or for that matter, at the Mulvey report on Bord na Móna&mdash;you will find a common thread.  Both reports stress the sheer, flaming chaos of the process of deciding on, putting forward and handling pay claims, especially, though not only on the union side.</P>
    <P>That is a serious statement by an expert.  Perhaps, a more important report was the NIEC report on incomes and prices policy, No. 37.  This discussed <Col N="1968" /> at some length the inflation in our economy and the practical and institutional necessity for a proper incomes and prices policy.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>In our view an effective incomes and prices policy is urgently needed to help in protecting production and employment from the disruption threatened by the accelerated rise in costs, prices and the external-payments deficit.</P>
    <P>For an appropriate prices and incomes policy there are four essential steps.</P>
    <P>The first requirement is the promotion of a general understanding of the national need for a closer and more orderly relationship between incomes and output.</P>
    <P>That is fair enough.</P>
    <P>The second requirement is an explicit commitment by the Government, the Irish Employers Confederation and the ICTU to exercise their particular responsibilities fully towards creating the general understanding referred to above and the environment in which an incomes and prices policy, based on this understanding, would have reasonable prospects of success.</P>
    <P>The third requirement is that the general trends of productivity, prices and money incomes in the economy should be reviewed periodically and guide-lines enunciated for increases in money incomes for the appropriate period ahead (which need not be as short as a year).</P>
    <P>The fourth requirement, therefore, is to translate the NIEC guide-lines into terms which are operationally useful for those who would be engaged in detailed negotiations on wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>That report looked forward to the development and the establishment of a new employer/employee relationship. It says:</P>
    <P>A comprehensive incomes and prices policy would, however, need more institutional backing than this.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, need for a deeper analysis of the relationship between incomes, prices, productivity <Col N="1969" /> and employment; for the development of a wider public understanding of those relations.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to discuss at some length two ways in which the functions set out could be performed: first, by establishing an independent incomes and prices board and, secondly, by using the existing bodies&mdash;the Labour Court, the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Fair Trade Commission, which are already concerned with some aspects of these functions.</P>
    <P>As an economist, I honestly think the Government should consider seriously implementing the recommendations in that report.  They are vital to the survival of our economy.  In the Budget the Minister for Finance referred to initial discussions he had had with employer and labour interests, but I would like to see the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming together and producing an acceptable prices and incomes policy.  The present system of price control has failed and there must be a fresh approach.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in social welfare allowances but no allowance is given for the dependants of recipients. The subvention to agriculture is not such as favourably to affect that part of our economy.  Because of increased prices more will be taken out of agriculture than will be injected into it.  It is a pity, but it is a fact, that the farmer will pay heavily under this Budget.  The tax adjustments have complicated rather than simplified the situation.  The turnover tax will lead to excessive price rises.  That is already becoming apparent and the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce is not capable of coping with the situation.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Budget to contain inflation or combat the dangerous situation in which our balance of payments is.  I was looking forward to some export incentives, not only for new industries but for old established industries.  The latter have been neglected to a certain extent.  We are facing a very tough year.  Negotiations <Col N="1970" /> are to commence for entry to the EEC.  On the home front we are faced with unprecedented inflation.  There will be a rise of 10 per cent or 12 per cent in the consumer price index.  This will not help us in our negotiations for entry to the EEC.  It will bear heavily on our export industries.  Let no one make any mistake about that. I believe there will be an autumn Budget in an effort to combat inflation and redress our balance of payments situation.  Such a Budget would have been rendered unnecessary had marginal corrections been made over the past few years to combat inflation, to contain imports and to promote exports. Such marginal corrections would have resulted in a complete avoidance of the present serious situation.  The Fianna Fáil Government must bear responsibility for the present economic crisis as it must bear full responsibility for the current political crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour and Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with those portions of the Budget which deal directly with my Departments, the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare.  The previous speaker, as did many of those who preceded him, referred to what he regards as an absence of a prices and incomes policy.  There is a good deal of uninformed thinking on this by people who apparently have not followed the trend of events.  Deputy E. Collins quoted from the NIEC report and accused the Government of doing nothing about it.  He does not seem to be aware of the rapid movement of events since the report was published. The Government have decided to adopt the report and to implement it. Meetings have been held with the FUE and ICTU.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself have decided on the procedure to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A temporary committee has been set up.  That led to the setting up of an employer/worker committee on the lines visualised in the report and that committee is having its first meeting before the end of this week.  No time whatever was lost in implementing this suggested formula of the NIEC Report. <Col N="1971" /> The committee is composed equally of management and worker elements and representation from State bodies.  It is a 42-member committee under the chairmanship of Professor Chubb and we look forward, not to criticism of it, but to support from all sides without which its work cannot be as successful as it should be.</P>
    <P>To those who talk about a prices and incomes policy I say it is very easy to use the old clichés in this sort of criticism but nobody indicates whether he wants a statutory prices and incomes policy, one that has enforceable legislation in which the Government are directly involved, or whether he wants it on a voluntary basis operated by representatives of both sides in industry. The NIEC report to which the Deputy has been referring and which is now being implemented is on a voluntary basis, not supported by any enforceable legislation, and it will depend for its success on the attitudes and acceptances of those who operate it.  It has the elements of success in it and it can work, given a right will and proper disposition on the part of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The NIEC will set the guidelines and the worker-management body will articulate these guidelines and translate them into action.  The Labour Court will act in its capacity of deciding disputes that may arise as a result of the interpretation of guidelines.  It sounds a little complicated but it is quite simple in practice and should tend to bring about a more orderly procedure in future in regard to the relationship between production and wage increases and the growth of the economy.  This is what we aim at.  This is all one can do.  If people who talk about wages and incomes policy mean we should become directly involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices and incomes.  The trouble is most of you talk about wages and incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very seldom.  I mean prices and incomes.  If the Government are to become directly involved in the enforcement of a prices and incomes policy, that is a separate consideration because irrespective of <Col N="1972" /> whatever legislation we may introduce it depends on the attitudes and acceptances of those involved as to whether it is a success or not.  Sometimes people pretend not to realise this.  Many people have been talking and indeed writing about the lack of involvement of the Minister for Labour and the Government in current strikes while they know that the necessary institutions for the settlement of these disputes have been provided and that intervention on the ministerial or Governmental level should only be a last resort.  If ministerial intervention is to be looked on as another stage in the settlement of a dispute then his intervention will be invoked in every dispute.</P>
      <P>We have set up adequate machinery for the processing of negotiation and we must insist that it be used.  Merely setting up some new procedure does not necessarily bring new thinking.  If those concerned would use the institutions available I think they would find them adequate.  Some people think their strikes are in some way superior or different to other strikes and that the Minister, the Government or the Taoiseach should intervene because of their special circumstances.  People say glibly: &ldquo;Why does the Minister not intervene?&rdquo;  The Minister could settle every strike if he wanted to force those concerned to give all demanded.  That is one way of settling strikes but there are always two sides, at least, to strikes. As far as I am concerned there are three, the workers, the management and the general public or the whole economic set-up.  One can only deal with trade disputes in the context of the national economy; and if we suffer seriously as a result of a strike that is prolonged we must also think of what could result from accepting unbridled demands over an extensive period which would ultimately be serious for the economy in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody must deprecate a prolonged strike and while we must endeavour to ensure that the institutions available for settling them are used we must also think, in the context of the whole of the economy, of what can and what would happen if some measure of orderly procedure is not <Col N="1973" /> adopted and these demands permitted to run without restraint.  I am not prepared to accept that any one strike has a special right to ministerial intervention more than another.  There are occasions when, perhaps, one must seek other means but until such occasions arise the people involved have no right to invoke measures not available to others or not used in other instances.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cement strike and the bank strike at present there is ample scope for further negotiation and ample machinery for it.  We can only see that every effort is made to ensure the machinery is used.  It is fully representative of both sides in any dispute.  I think this is quite adequate and it certainly must be seen to be used.  If the Labour Court and the institutions attached to it, the conciliation service and the joint industrial councils, which were set up in a serious effort to place at the disposal of people in dispute the machinery capable of processing any dispute and bringing it to a successful conclusion, are to be by-passed and a dispute treated in some special way by Government procedure we are merely placing ourselves at the disposal of all disputants and leaving the Labour Court and its machinery in a very secondary place.</P>
    <P>Lack of goodwill and, very often, what would appear to be a lack of commonsense lead to a good deal of unnecessary delay in settling a dispute which must eventually end.  Sometimes we are not too happy at people becoming involved who are not directly concerned in the dispute.  This may not be a very significant factor but it is one worth watching.  We have free collective bargaining in this country; it is at present undergoing a very severe test.  It must be tried to the bitter end, so to speak, before we attempt to deal with trade disputes by any crisis or panic methods.  That stage has not been reached.</P>
    <P>In the production of this new formula as outlined in the NIEC report which we have now sought to implement&mdash;and we have set up the first committee which meets this week&mdash; we have made a fresh effort which, given the necessary assistance by all concerned, should result in an institution <Col N="1974" /> that will provide orderly procedures in the future and will bring production into relationship with the national growth and wage increases.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House can visualise perpetual leap-frogging in wages.  It cannot go on for all time.  Some order must be restored at some stage.  If we are called on to take legislative action, this is anathema to any person who has any regard for free collective bargaining and, in any event, coercive measures are never seen to work successfully. No one wants to adopt them while it is possible to use other means. All those concerned, including the Department of Labour, must at every opportunity point out the inevitable consequences of the present system going on unchecked and without restraint.  If both sides concerned with disputes do not take heed of this at some stage, we may reach a crisis in which we will have to adopt measures which certainly would be distasteful to everybody concerned and, indeed, might not be very successful anyhow.</P>
    <P>This is a field in which one has to tread wearily.  One can appear to be very active but, as I said in answer to some supplementary questions here the other day, it is not a field in which I should like to introduce gimmicks and stunts on the pretence of doing something. One must be sincere.  One must make a genuine appraisal of the position, deal with it and eventually create the necessary confidence that will induce acceptance and bring about the necessary change of attitude.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with it at this stage and I would not deal with it in this debate were it not for the fact that so many Deputies referred to what they regarded as the lack of a prices and incomes policy.  The last speaker actually read the NIEC report and accused us of doing nothing, whereas we have moved rapidly towards setting up the institutions recommended in that report.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal in full with the social welfare services as improved in this Budget.  I will not keep the House too long.  Other speakers have to come in at the right time.  Now that the Department of Social Welfare is again my <Col N="1975" /> responsibility I want to repeat what has been said so often.  The Fianna Fáil Party attitude of improving the social welfare code as circumstances permitted and in accordance with the availability of resources, has proved to be a wise policy.  We have always kept trust with it.  We have always honoured it.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare payments as provided for in the Book of Estimates this year are something in the vicinity of £64 million.  That does not take into account the insurance fund side of the scheme.  If we take into account the disbursements from the social insurance fund, the figure is £102½ million, which is a fair amount of money payable under the social welfare code.  This does not take into account anything provided for in the current Budget which is now being discussed.  The Budget makes provision for a further £16 million in a full year. That, together with the increases that have been granted in every one of the past ten years, is a creditable performance by any Government and one of which nobody should be ashamed.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to say it is not enough. I would say it is not enough.  I have always said I hoped each year would see us a step further ahead.  That is exactly what is happening.  We are not just taking a step to meet the rising cost of living: every single increase given in the past ten years was far in excess of what would be demanded by the increase in the cost of living. In other words, the social welfare classes were not the residuary legatees when the Budget was being prepared. They took priority in the allocation of money and the re-distribution of incomes.  We did not hesitate to impose the necessary taxation in order to bring these people up to a higher level, somewhat in keeping with the general improvement in the standard of living which all sections of the community have been enjoying progressively each year over the past decade or more.  This is a duty on any Government with a social conscience.  We have done our duty.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Finance certainly never neglected his duty and <Col N="1976" /> responsibility to these classes.  The rates across the board are increased comparatively generously this year.  We have got away from the 1s and the 2s 6d.  We are now giving increases of a decent amount.  Not merely have these rates been increased, but the scheme has also been extended in recent times.  Legislation which it will be my duty to introduce here shortly will make provision for the payments coming into effect on 1st August and 1st October.  The House will notice that this brings forward the payments this time.  It used to be January.</P>
    <P>It will also include many new features which have already been referred to in the House.  It will include a limited scheme of retirement pensions at 65, invalidity payments at the same age and death grants.  It will provide £4 5s per week for deserted wives.  It will make provision for an extension of the age in the case of dependants payments, and welfare payments from 16 to 18 years.  There are several other provisions which highlight the improvement in the rates and expand the service to take in under the social welfare umbrella many classes who did not have that protection in the past. Many people in the House will say&mdash; and I would say&mdash;it is time these people were brought in.  I would also say there are others yet to come in but we are rapidly moving in that direction. The free travel scheme, the free electricity scheme, the provision in relation to incapacitated old people who are living alone and require some relative to take care of them have all been moves in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister showed his social conscience&mdash;and I was very proud of it in this Budget&mdash;in his endorsement of the work being done by social committees in the various localities.  I have frequently had the pleasure of paying tribute to these social committees, these community associations, who are doing such good work throughout the country.  It is very easy to pay lip service to them.  We all know they do work which nobody else can do.  With their personal contact and intimate knowledge they can get through to the people concerned and they can do work for them which mere monetary benefit cannot equal.  They do much <Col N="1977" /> more than that.  They provide meals on wheels, clothing, entertainment.  As I say, we have paid lip service to them and rightly so.  They were doing a good job.</P>
    <P>This time the Minister has endorsed their work by giving them money. There was £100,000 already provided under the Health Estimate for these committees.  The Minister increased that by another £150,000, bringing it up to £¼ million to be disbursed by these committees, to encourage the formation of new committees and to assist them in the great work they are doing.  This is a very generous innovation in this Budget and one which is welcomed by everybody but highlighted by few.  We all tend to point out what is not in the Budget.  Naturally, this applies to the Opposition.  They seldom refer to what is good.</P>
    <P>There is more good in this Budget than was contained in any Budget hitherto introduced.  It has been achieved simply by the adjustment of one tax which was already in operation and which does not require the setting-up of any new machinery.  The addition of 2½ per cent on the turnover tax, which is an indirect tax, is the fairest way of enabling the Government to give the new benefits to the social welfare classes apart from the many other benefits which are contained in this comprehensive Budget.  A determined effort was made to do something worthwhile for the social welfare classes at a time when the Minister for Finance might be expected to revert to the old 1s to 2s 6d increase of the past.</P>
    <P>During the past year, every income improved and some incomes improved very considerably.  This took up more than the buoyancy of revenue available to the Minister to meet the bill and particularly the bill as regards the public sector.  Many people thought&mdash;incorrectly&mdash;that very little provision might be made to cushion the impact of the rising cost of living on this occasion. Not merely was the increase in the cost of living met but it was far exceeded right across the board to the social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>This is a Budget to be proud of and, <Col N="1978" /> as Minister for Social Welfare, I consider it a step in the right direction.  It is in keeping with Fianna Fáil policy down through the years.  We promised that our social code would be expanded and improved according as there was an expansion and improvement in our resources and we have kept our word and acted most generously.  The taxation that had to be imposed should yield the revenue necessary to enable the Government to meet the cost of the additional benefits which have so thoughtfully and generously been provided under this Budget.  Therefore, the position should be faced fairly and squarely and this Budget should unanimously be accepted by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The Minister should be congratulated on being able to maintain a straight face while making that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare concluded by stating that it was necessary to impose only one tax.  In the situation confronting the Taoiseach and his Government on Budget Day of a shattered Cabinet, they took the lazy way out by asking themselves what was the easiest way of getting £20 million and then resorting to that method without examining the detailed effect it would have on the economy.  Certainly, I do not agree that this is a good Budget.  It is a cruel and a harsh Budget.  Many experts claim it will bring about increased prices ranging from 12 to 15 per cent on an already overtaxed people.  All of this is due to gross neglect and incompetence. It is due to a strong-arm, dictatorial, ruthless and corrupt Government.  A few moments ago, I read the heading in this evening's <i>Evening Press</i>&mdash;Insurance Shock: Motor Rates Soar.  One of the biggest bombshells for years, according to the <i>Evening Press</i>, hit the Irish motorist today when it was confirmed that the Government had given the green light to insurance companies for a 17½ per cent increase on all motor insurances from 1st June next.  That indicates that our cost of living may indeed increase beyond 12 or 15 per cent.  We are reaping the bitter harvest of a divided Government, led by a <Col N="1979" /> Taoiseach who is not in control of his Cabinet and with a Minister for Finance who is not in control of his steed.  It would take much more now than the grasping of a leaden gutter to save the Irish nation from the effects of this Budget.  For years, the nation and its finances have been allowed to drift from bad to worse by a Government and by Ministers who were more interested, it seems, in tearing down the institutions of this State than in building up its financial viability, a Government of incompetent meddlers and muddlers who have deceived the nation on financial affairs.  They have lost the confidence of the world&mdash;a fact which is humiliating not only to them but to each and every one of us.  The recent Government Cabinet crisis will probably have very severe economic repercussions on this country during the coming year. We shall be lucky if irreparable damage has not been done.  Our tourist industry may lose from £20 million to £25 million this year which would be disastrous for many people.  The present Taoiseach is responsible for this unwholesome situation because he was not alert to current events.  The members of the Cabinet and, indeed, the Fianna Fáil Party in general cannot escape blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past four years we have had three experiences of a stop-go policy.  In 1967, when Deputy Haughey became Minister for Finance, we had a balance of payments surplus of £15 million, having emerged from an unfortunate recession lasting four or five years.  In 1968, instead of having a balance, we had a deficit of about £58 million and last year we had a balance of payments deficit of £69 million.  If trends continue, it is reckoned that, in the coming year, we may have an adverse balance of £80 million to £90 million.  This situation must not be allowed to continue.  I do not want to list the organisations, societies, trade unions, and so on, that warned the Government about inflation.  One would have expected at least mild corrective measures but this Government have dithered and hesitated and done nothing.  Lack of resolute leadership is <Col N="1980" /> responsible for many of our ills and particularly for our present very unsatisfactory economic situation.</P>
    <P>In November, 1968, after the Referendum we had a second Budget.  That Budget was definitely a deflationary Budget.  A total of £19 million in new taxation was imposed in that Budget. There was an effort then to tackle the problem of inflation; the Government pursued that policy but they did not seem to be succeeding too well.  On the 19th March, 1969&mdash;we should all remember that date&mdash;the position became so serious that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, with a widening deficit in the balance of payments which was then approaching £50 million, spoke on radio and appeared on television proclaiming a state of national emergency.  He appealed to the workers and to the trade unions to tighten their belts; he said things were bad, that we were faced with an economic crisis.  The situation seemed to be so serious that the Ministers of the Government, in an effort to give a lead to the rest of the country, met and in blaring headlines on the newspapers the next day and on radio and television it was announced that they had imposed on themselves a 14 per cent cut in their salaries.  That was on 19th March, 1969.  The Government, it seems, at that time had their minds made up to go to the country in a general election.</P>
    <P>Then things started to deteriorate in the north and the Government, again putting party before country, realised that if things got worse during the summer it would not be an opportune time for Fianna Fáil to go to the country the following winter.  Therefore, on 7th May, less than seven weeks after, what do we find?  We find a complete somersault.  We have an inflationary Budget introduced in this House.  The Fianna Fáil Party again change horses&mdash;they do not fall off them this time&mdash;and the Fianna Fáil Government and Party again show the people that they are prepared to stoop to anything, just as they have being doing for the last fortnight to cling to power.</P>
    <P>That Budget was an inflationary and an election Budget to try to get back <Col N="1981" /> into power.  Overnight, according to the Taoiseach, according to the Minister for Finance, and indeed according to all the Fianna Fáil Deputies, the recession was over and the country had become more prosperous.  The message was preached at every crossroads, on radio, on television and in the innumerable speeches made throughout the length and breadth of this land by the Taoiseach and by Government Ministers.  Indeed, to the people I suppose the message sounded reasonable enough.  The man in the street, unfortunately, believed Fianna Fáil and they were returned to office. Again they deceived, in that Budget of May, 1969, the Irish people for their own low, petty ends&mdash;to get back into power.</P>
    <P>Now, as the Minister said, we have only one tax here this time.  Certainly it is a lazy man's tax.  It means doubling the turnover tax which was imposed on the people in 1963.  Up to October, 1963, it could be said that we had stability.  Wage demands and strikes were few until the Government introduced this iniquitous turnover tax. This was a new tax imposed for the first time in the history of our country &mdash;a tax on bread, butter, tea, sugar, fuel, meat, medicines, clothes and all the necessities of life.</P>
    <P>The strange thing is if one wants to buy a pill for a greyhound, to make him run more slowly or run more quickly, there is no turnover tax to be paid; but if a working man's child has a pain in his tummy and must go into the chemist for a pill or a powder turnover tax must be paid.  That is certainly a very unfair tax.  That was imposed on the people despite the fact that Mr. Lemass, who was then Taoiseach, had stated at Waterford shortly before that that Coalition Leaders were threatening the country with high food prices and a lot more besides if Fianna Fáil became the Government.  He said that the Fianna Fáil Government did not intend to do any of these things. &ldquo;How definite,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;can we make our denials of those stupid allegations?&rdquo; At that time the loaf was something like sixpence.  I do not know what it is now&mdash;2s 2d or 2s 4d.  The price has been increased so often lately <Col N="1982" /> that I do not think even the housewife knows what it is.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always claimed down through the years that they are concerned with the lower paid people, the poor, the workers.  If they are concerned with those people why did they impose a tax on bread, butter, tea, sugar, meat, fuel, clothes and all the necessities of life?  It might be no harm to quote Mr. de Valera at Belmullet on 28th February, 1957.  He said that they did not want the price of bread, so important an article of diet for the poor, to be increased.  I do not want to repeat how much it has been increased since then.  At the same time, the late Deputy Oscar Traynor, at Doyle's Corner, said that the warning issued that a Fianna Fáil Government would withdraw the food subsidies or increase food prices were blood-curdling stories.  We now know who was telling the truth and who has told the truth to the Irish people down through the years.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and indeed Labour speakers and others in Opposition pointed out at that time the bad effects of these ill conceived policies. We pointed out how a tax on the necessities of life was bound to increase the cost of living, how it would kindle again the flames of inflation, with all its harmful effects on our economy.  Unfortunately, our forecasts have been proved right.  Immediately after that there was a sudden jump in prices, as we are having now, a sudden jump in the cost of living, as we are having now.  At that time too the Government were asking for restraint, as far as the workers were concerned, in wage demands.  How could the workers be expected to have restraint when their living standards were dropping and when the money they were getting was buying less and less, as it is at present?</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have said we voted against the social welfare benefits provided in the Budget.  We did no such thing.  We voted against the increased taxation.  It would be no harm to bring Fianna Fáil's memory back to the past when they were in opposition and when they also voted against increased taxation to give increases to social welfare beneficiaries.  When <Col N="1983" /> Fianna Fáil are in opposition they always want taxation reduced.  Let me quote from column 624, volume 155, of the Official Report of 15th March, 1956, where Mr. Seán Lemass said:</P>
    <P>Surely some explanation is due why the Government not only failed to keep that pledge but why the cost actually has gone up by £10,000,000. Some apology is at least due to those whom they misled by that statement by a responsible representative of the Coalition parties.</P>
    <P>Again let me quote what Mr. Seán Lemass said at column 49, volume 157, of the Official Report of 8th May, 1956:</P>
    <P>We announced that we had made up our minds on that fact and, that so far as we were concerned, there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that, if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burdens on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>When he made that statement the cost of running this country was £105 million and today it is £452 million.  Therefore, Fianna Fáil kept that promise to the Irish people by breaking it to the extent of £347 million, because at that time they were criticising an increase of £10 million and since then the cost of running the country has increased by £347 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare said here about ten minutes ago that Fianna Fáil always kept trust with the poor, with the unemployed, the old age pensioner, etc.  I remember that in 1947 there was a motion in this House asking for an increase of 2s 6d per week to be paid to the old age pensioner. When Fianna Fáil talk about their record in relation to the old age pension, remember they came to power in 1932 and the old age pension was 10s per week.  A war took place afterwards and prices increased for the householder and the old age pensioner. In 1948, 16 long years afterwards the £ had depreciated and was worth only about 16s and the 10s which the old age pensioner was still getting from <Col N="1984" /> Fianna Fáil was worth only 8s.  Let credit be given where credit is due, and Fianna Fáil are not prepared to give such credit: it was the first inter-Party Government who by the time they were going out of office in 1951 had increased the old age pension to 17s 6d per week, whereas from 1932 to 1948 it was only 10s.</P>
    <P>The moment Fianna Fáil get into power public and local expenditure starts careering upwards, and they have always been true to form.  Twelve or 14 years ago the amount of rates collected was less than £15 million. This year it is expected that £49 million will be collected from the rate-payers. Never in the history of this country was it more desirable or more necessary than it is at present to have a period of stability so that agricultural and industrial producers can prepare and equip themselves for the more competitive period which undoubtedly lies ahead when we enter the EEC. The only way in which tax revenue can be increased without causing inflation, without causing an increase in the cost of living, without bad industrial relations is by growth in national production, which would provide larger taxable incomes.  If public expenditure maintains its upward course of recent years it will outstrip, as, indeed, it is outstripping, the real growth of the economy.  When that happens we shall not be able to export our produce and we shall have mass unemployment. Many of our industries are affected and more will be affected as time goes on.</P>
    <P>History has proved again and again that the Irish people will endure almost any hardship if they have a clear and desirable object in view.  Where today in this country is the grand design? Where is the vision without which the people perish?  Where are the leaders in this country today who will restore us to a sense of national pride and national purpose?  I believe the answers to those questions will not be supplied by the discredited and the demoralised crew which today passes for the Government of this unfortunate nation, because it appears that their nationalist ideals have been put in the deep freeze along with their guns or they have been thrown overboard long ago.  The <Col N="1985" /> Government, in each new crisis, seem to be able to see no further than their noses.</P>
    <P>While I admit the overall economic position in Europe and in Britain has improved, it leaves no room for complacency. Absolute care is needed in the planning of national investment. There is no scope for extravagance in Government spending.  When in opposition the Government preached about this but when in power they continue to increase expenditure.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the Government should take the people into their confidence and tell them the truth.  The Government fooled the people before the general election in 1965.  They told them that everything in the garden was rosy.  They fooled the people again last year before the general election. According to the Taoiseach in his speech here on the Budget we may now be facing another crisis.  According to Fianna Fáil we are always breasting the hill but we never seem to be able to get over it.  There have been three bouts of stop-go under Fianna Fáil in the last ten years.  What they ought to do now is to replace the mink wrap they used to win the general election with a hairshirt.  That would be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil misgovernment continues almost impossible measures will have to be taken by them or by some other Government if the economy is to be put on an even keel and if the country is to be saved from what we have at present, a downhill rush towards bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>The Government have made fatal mistakes in the last two years in telling the people they never had it so good and in painting rosy pictures.  A policy of optimism based on rosy hopes and fond imagination is definitely bad for the people.  That is unfortunately what we have had from the Government.</P>
    <P>As I said, last year we had a balance of payments deficit of £60 million.  It is reckoned that this year the figure may reach £90 million.  The people may well have to pay a further price for the way the Government fooled them in the 1969 general election.  It was an election gamble which as far as the Government <Col N="1986" /> were concerned may have paid off but as far as the people are concerned I doubt if it paid off.  Inflation is becoming rampant.  As we know, in a period of inflation the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  The speculators, the racketeers and the tacateers may prosper but the ordinary people definitely suffer.</P>
    <P>The farmers of Ireland have fared badly in this Budget.  There is no denying that for many years they have been hewers of wood and drawers of water. For the dairy farmer there is very little in the Budget; for the tillage farmer there is little if anything.  The farmers represent roughly 30 per cent of our people.  Directly or indirectly they are responsible for 60 per cent of our exports.  Over the last few years they have received only 16 to 17 per cent of the national income.  They are our principal producers but they have been neglected by the Government.</P>
    <P>Last year I asked a question in the Dáil as to the average income of those engaged in industrial employment and those engaged on the land.  At that time the gap was something like £3 10s per week.  It is reckoned that the gap is now between £4 10s and £5.  Deputy Blaney, as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, announced that the farmers would need something like £21 million this year to meet the rise in costs, the rise in rates, in taxes, in costs of production, cost of living, <i>et cetera</i>.  He told them that he had made a strong case and a recommendation to the Government for £14 million.  During the by-elections in Westmeath and Kildare he made an announcement that the farmers would get this £14 million.  He was immediately contradicted by the then Minister for Finance.  When the Financial Statement was read out here we found that the farmers, instead of getting £14 million, would get only £5½ million.  So Fianna Fáil had deceived them to the tune of £8½ million. With rising costs of production and rising cost of living, instead of the £21 million mentioned by the former Minister, it would take nearer to £25 million to meet them.  The farmers this year may suffer to the tune of approximately £20 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about the <Col N="1987" /> cattle trade which we are told is booming. There is very little thanks due to the Fianna Fáil Government for the fact that the cattle trade is booming. There was a period when they had no time for the cattle trade or for the British market.  Despite Deputy Blaney's pronouncements that he was interested in the small farmer of the country, the small farmer of Donegal and the west, we find that the sheep population has dropped by almost 1,000,000 in the last seven years.</P>
    <P>Last week I saw a &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme in which farmers from Donegal took part.  The farmers said that not one of the 26 small farmers in that area of Donegal benefited from the heifer scheme because in order to qualify one had to have over two cows and the majority of them had only two and therefore did not qualify.  The Government have let down the farmer, both large and small, through the years.</P>
    <P>Things are bad in this country at the present time.  Being a constructive Opposition, having the national interest at heart, we have not only the right but the duty to ask ourselves what lasting value have we got from this huge expenditure or where is the country heading. If as a result of this huge expenditure there were more people at work, credit could be given to the Government. The Government come in here time after time and tell us halftruths. They tell us there are so many more persons employed in industry than there were last year and the year before and the year before that.  I have the figures before me of the number of persons at work in 1951 and the number of persons at work in 1967.  Fianna Fáil have been in power during that period with the exception of three years.  In 1951, there were 1,217,000 persons at work in this State.  In 1969, there were 1,079,000 at work.  In other words, there were 148,000 fewer persons at work in 1969 than there were in 1951.  We have heard too many halftruths in the last fortnight. It is time for the Taoiseach and the Government to come clean with the people, to take them into their confidence, to tell them the truth about the crises we are going through at the present time, the Cabinet crisis and the <Col N="1988" /> crisis in the Government, and to give them a true picture of the financial position existing in the country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, things are bad in Ireland today and the Government are keeping the full truth from the people. I have quoted Deputy Haughey's speech made in March to show that the Government knew last year that we were faced with an economic crisis but the Government went to the country under an umbrella of false prosperity. They fooled and deceived the people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil talk about records.  Certainly, there are many records.  We have a record national debt today of over £1,000 million and if we add to it the amount of money owed by the county councils of Ireland, by the State and semi-State bodies, the total amount owed is in the region of £1,500 million. It is costing about £120 million each year to service this debt.  The time has come when the Government must realise that the country cannot continue to pile debt upon debt year after year.  I remember 1951 when the national debt was only one-tenth of what it is now and when the Government of that day borrowed money to build hospitals to cure the scourge of TB and to build houses for our people, and at the general election that year the Fianna Fáil people outside every polling booth told the people &ldquo;put them out, the country is in pawn&rdquo;.  The money borrowed then was spent to good effect.  If the country was in pawn when the national debt was around £130 million what must it be in today when it is £1,500 million?  The unfortunate thing is that we have had to go to Canada, Germany and England to borrow money.  Two years ago we were refused a loan in England and this nation was humiliated.  We asked for a loan of £8 million and we got less than 25 per cent of it and the underwriters had to put up the rest of it.</P>

      <P>I am sorry my figures are wrong.  Less than 10 per cent.  It is time the Government realised the situation which exists here today and realised also that while they <Col N="1989" /> are taking more and more from the ratepayers&mdash;they intend to take £49 million this year&mdash;and more and more from the taxpayers&mdash;they intend to take £450 million this year&mdash;emigration is still rampant.  We are losing 25,000 people per year and if we had not got the safety valve provided by Britain, to which people can emigrate, God knows what would happen.  In the last 14 or 15 years over 400,000 boys and girls have had to emigrate to seek work in Birmingham, Coventry, London and other cities.  All these things should be taken into consideration but, unfortunately, they are not.</P>
      <P>A total of 300,000 people left the land during the last 14 years because they were not satisfied with the Government and because they were being taxed out of existence.  The Government's mismanagement of our economy is directly responsible for many of our economic ills and difficulties of today.  The decline in our affairs was caused by a deliberate decision to place party interests above national interests in last year's general election and also in the 1965 general election.  The consequences of those reckless decisions are now a concern to many people, even if they are not to the Government.  The Government still do not seem to realise our serious economic position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember the people are concerned with economics and with social conditions and they are completely dissatisfied with the Government's handling of our financial affairs.  If Fianna Fáil want to speak for Ireland in the years ahead and negotiate our entry into the EEC, then their tarnished authority needs to be refurbished and cleansed by an appeal to the people. If they cannot secure the right to speak for Ireland, then that right must pass to others.  We have now a Government which is in complete disorder.  Fianna Fáil have achieved a miracle because they took over this country when its foundations were basically strong and it was wealthy, but now we have a fumbling economy and our finances, due to a fumbling Government, are in utter confusion.  The Fianna Fáil Cabinet are squabbling, the Fianna Fáil Party are divided and the people <Col N="1990" /> have lost all confidence in their administration.</P>
    <P>We urgently need a reduction in wasteful Government expenditure; we need a reform in our archaic taxation system and we need to place more emphasis on savings, increased exports and on making a bigger national cake. The time has come for this arrogant and dictatorial Government, who have failed the people, to go.  I do not want to go back over the Dáil debates and quote many of the things that were said.  I could quote what Deputy Blaney said about collective responsibility, about a sound Government and the fact that there were no divisions in the Fianna Fáil Party, that they were united&mdash;this was on the very day that the Taoiseach is supposed to have warned him and asked for his resignation. I want to know whom are we to believe?  Could Deputy Blaney make the speech he made about unity in the Fianna Fáil Party if the Taoiseach really had warned him that day?  The important point I want to bring home to the country is that when those people criticise inter-Party or Coalition Governments they should remember that today we have a Government who are kept in power by a coalition of gun-runners, doves and hawks, and of national and international saboteurs, and it is time, in the national interest, that they resigned, went to the people and asked for a mandate.</P>

      <P>There are a number of points which came up in the debate on Friday and Saturday week last which I should like to deal with before coming to my main points on the Budget debate.  Deputy Cosgrave, the leader of the Opposition, made a point that I and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs clapped Deputy Blaney and the Taoiseach at the same time during that recent long debate.  He also made the point that even the most gullible Fianna Fáil cumann would not accept that.  I should like to tell Deputy Cosgrave and members of his Party, first, that there are no gullible Fianna Fáil cumainn and, secondly, that if anybody reiterates his loyalty to the Fianna Fáil Party then I certainly would clap him and give him <Col N="1991" /> support on the basis of his reiterating his support for the great party of which we are members.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Budget, it gives me great pleasure to see the provision for deserted wives. Here again we have a positive contribution to the welfare of the country as distinct from the totally negative attitude of Deputy L'Estrange who in his contribution said we must have this and we must have the other thing but there was no question of the pricing of this sort of thing.  While the provision for deserted wives is very welcome the amount is not sufficient, at £4 5s.  I believe it is a beginning and I should like the Minister for Finance to take the view that it is a beginning and that it is not sufficient having regard to present day values, the value of money and so on, and the very dire circumstances in which many of these unhappy women live.  There are a great many desertions.  We now recognise the social need there is to support these unhappy people in their unhappy circumstances.</P>

      <P>We should be moving towards the concept of the quality of life within the community.  I represent an urban constituency. This is Conservation Year and a sum of £100,000 has been set aside for that purpose.  More money must be devoted to the development of community centres.  Because of technological developments and computerisation people will have more leisure and they will have to be educated in the proper use of that leisure.  There will have to be a comprehensive inquiry into the problem of leisure.  We are moving in the right direction, but not rapidly enough.  There are not sufficient community centres.  All sections of the community should be embraced in a proper scheme.  The younger people should be geared to look after our senior citizens.  There should be complete integration from a community point of view and I look forward to next year when the Minister for Finance introduces his Budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance next year, the following year and the year after that again.  This brings in the whole concept of the quality of life and the living and environmental standards of our people.  All this is bound up in conservation.</P>
      <P>With regard to land ownership, another aspect of conservation, the high cost of building land must be examined into.  Young people nowadays find it difficult enough to live without being asked to pay exorbitant prices for the land on which their houses are built.  It is just not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of brouhaha in connection with the ownership of our fisheries.  I have always advocated, long before the Labour Party got on to it, nationalisation of our fisheries. The Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="1993" /> Fisheries said that nationalisation would be a tremendous burden on the Exchequer.  Nationalisation may not be an immediate priority but it will have to be dealt with as a matter of urgency. The ownership of land and water should vest in the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health adverted to a report on the care of the aged.  I do not think we can pay a high enough tribute to the efforts being made by voluntary organisations in this respect. They are doing a magnificent job in caring for the aged.  I believe people would be willing to pay more by way of taxation provided they knew that that taxation would be devoted to caring for our older citizens.  The Minister accepts the recommendation of the commission of inquiry and agrees that a national council should be established. This is an urgent matter and I would appeal to the Minister to implement this recommendation without delay.  This is above politics.  It is something upon which all Deputies agree.  If the people know where their money is going I believe they will have no objection to paying the extra few pence here and there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Chief Whip of the Government Party, Deputy Andrews, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, intervened in this debate primarily to try to give some kind of moral boost to the waning fortunes of his party at present by telling us that the Fianna Fáil national collection last Sunday was a record one. I am sorry he has left the House because I wanted to elicit further evidence of this claim.  Those of us who took a particular interest in the annual collection found all the evidence was to the contrary and that the collection on this occasion, certainly in my constituency, reached a new low level.  The Fianna Fáil supporters, the old diehards in particular, were shying away from the tables, obviously disillusioned and crestfallen by the internal strife that has shown itself in recent times and utterly disenchanted with the party that has been so discredited and which has disgraced itself so seriously. Telling us about a record collection will not convince anybody.  The only <Col N="1994" /> thing that will convince us of the true position of the Government party now is a mandate from the people as a result of a general election.</P>
      <P>We can well understand Deputy Andrews trying to raise the hopes and morale of the ordinary members of the party by a statement like this.  It must be evident to everyone that the country is in a serious mess and has been for years past.  It cannot be gainsaid that inflation is rampant, the cost of living at a dizzy height and the balance of payments deficit the highest ever.  The NIEC forecast for this year indicates that we shall have a balance of payments deficit of about £90 million.  The banks have been closed for some time and the building industry has ground to a halt as a result of the cement strike.  Nobody seems to care a damn about our economy.  In recent weeks the most senior Ministers have been proved to be more concerned with gun running than with running the affairs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the then Minister for Finance deliberately ignored the danger signals evident all around and, obviously for selfish party reasons, painted an untrue picture in the early part of the year in order to gain votes in the general election of last June.  It is true that he went on television and rightly alerted us to the gravity of the economic position but when it became known to him that the Taoiseach was about to declare a general election he did an about turn and completely changed the complexion of the picture from dark and dismal to rosy and bright and for petty electoral gains and selfish party advancement allowed a most serious situation to develop in our economy.  One would imagine that, having been caught out in that irresponsible attitude over 12 months ago, on this occasion a more sensible approach would have been adopted. Instead, on this occasion all the economic pundits and political advisers found themselves completely out of the picture when the Budget proposals were announced.  It was a lazy, indolent and irresponsible Budget and instead of doing something worthwhile to reduce growing inflation the then Minister for Finance deliberately threw an incendiary bomb into this inflationary situation. <Col N="1995" /> He must have known it would send the cost of living spiralling and make life miserable for the average family.</P>
    <P>No serious attempt was made to tax luxuries or exempt essentials.  No effort was made to tax items like jewellery, furs and costly motor cars or to single out specific items for tax purposes such as amusements of various kinds. The irresponsible decision to increase the turnover tax by 2½ per cent across the board, irrespective of the consequences, has done a serious disservice to our people.  When the turnover tax was first mooted in this House I remember the present Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Lenihan, being accused then of saying in his constituency that this tax would apply only to luxuries such as costly furs, jewellery and expensive motor cars.  We now know how untrue that was.  All commodities are affected by this tax. Anyone who got the impression on Budget Day that it was a &ldquo;cushy&rdquo; Budget involving no specific increases on traditional items such as the price of beer, spirits or cigarettes or bread and butter and essentials of that kind had a real feeling of relief that nothing had, in fact, been increased.</P>
    <P>The people were quickly shaken out of their complacency.  They got a rude awakening.  While it is true that the beneficiaries under the Budget, the social welfare classes, must wait until August or October of this year to gain their rather small increases, within days of the Minister's announcement in this House, increases in all commodities were evident; 1ds, 2ds and 3ds were added on all along the line.  The pint drinker now knows that the price of his pint was increased.  It was increased by 2d a pint in some towns and 3d a pint in others.  The price of whiskey has been increased by 2d a glass in some places and by 3d a glass in other places.  The price of cigarettes has been increased.  The price of petrol has been increased.  The price of everything has been increased as a result of this Budget.</P>
    <P>It was a shabby pretence, but the Irish people are no fools and, even the social welfare classes who in the initial <Col N="1996" /> stages were agreeably satisfied because they were securing increases of 10s or 17s 6d in their pensions, now know that they have been &ldquo;had&rdquo;.  They now know that it would have been a far far better thing if we had some price stability and no increases.  They now know that the 10s or 17s 6d they hope to get in August or October will have been completely dissipated by spiralling prices.</P>

The inter-Party Governments of recent years have been denigrated time and time again in this House by Fianna Fáil spokesmen for the things they did or the things they failed to do, but be it said to their eternal credit that, in respect of the essentials of life, bread and butter, those humane Governments were concerned about the welfare of the least well off in our community and saw to it that standards were maintained.  They achieved that end by subsidising the essentials of life.  That is a far cry from Fianna Fáil who adopt a shabby pretence of doling out 5s or 10s annually and make no attempt whatsoever to stabilise the cost of living.  They left our people the victims of every exploiter. Every exploiter, every extortioner, usurer, is given unbridled liberty to fix prices and rob our people wholesale.</P>

      <P>We have here tonight a Minister for Finance who until recently was Minister for Industry and Commerce. I do not believe in saying behind a person's back what I would not say to his face.  I accuse that Minister of abject dereliction of duty in respect of price stability.  He made no serious endeavour whatsoever to utilise the price control and legislative measures which were at his disposal.  He operated the full tenets of a capitalist society.  He allowed prices to find their own level. We all know what happens in such an economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley, Minister for Industry <Col N="1997" /> and Commerce until recently, has an awful lot to answer for in relation to the upset in our country at present, the difficulty for the average family to exist here, the difficulty in maintaining standards, the industrial strife and strikes we have had as a result of the vicious circle of wages chasing prices and prices changing wages in recent years, with no attempt at providing an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the only indications of an incomes policy we have had from the Fianna Fáil Government were admonitions that wages should be controlled; always wages, with no endeavour whatsoever to restrict profits, prices or interest. All the strictures were laid down for the working classes.  In an atmosphere of irresponsibility of this kind created by Government Ministers, how can we expect the working classes to show restraint and responsibility when we see standards eroded in this fashion, when we see wage increases quickly eroded and quickly dissipated by increases in rents, foodstuffs and the other essentials of life?</P>
    <P>As I say, the Minister for Finance has an awful lot to answer for in respect of the situation which exists in this country at the present time.  His was the policy of free trade.  His was the policy of tearing down protective barriers, of giving our industrialists a taste of free trade, of letting them feel the icy blast of freer competition with the removal of the swaddling clothes in which they were wrapped for many years.</P>
    <P>He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement signed at Christmas, 1965. This agreement was signed in anticipation of our gaining entry into the Common Market by 1970.  All those prognostications proved to be incorrect. We have had free trade virtually with Britain for the past few years and we now see all the signs of a widening gap in our balance of payments, of the order of £90 million this year.  We now see a much greater percentage of foreign goods on the shelves of our shopkeepers.  We see a dislocation of industry which is growing.  We see closures and pending closures, unemployment and redundancy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> All this was quite unnecessary because what people failed to realise was that we did not have to sign a free trade agreement with Britain. This country enjoyed free trade with Britain since the foundation of the State.  At the same time, it enjoyed protection for native industry.  To commit us to this battle with Britain was a retrograde step and has done us untold harm.</P>
    <P>It is high time the Free Trade Area Agreement was looked at again and amended before irreparable harm will have been done to our industrial sector. For dubious gains, agriculturally, we sold our industrial arm to Britain.  The Fianna Fáil Government committed us to a battle with the industrial giants of Britain and are seeking to commit us to battle with the industrial giants of Europe.  It is a battle between pigmy and giant.  It is a battle where all the advantages lie with Britain in these industries and all the disadvantages are here and are very evidently here.</P>
    <P>There is to be a general election in Britain next month.  It is my ardent hope that Mr. Harold Wilson and the Labour Government will be returned to office.  I feel pretty certain that Irish hearts and hands are working for him over there where there are many millions of Irish people as well as people of Irish extraction.  They are working with might and main to bring about a return of that great Labour Government so that they may continue their great work for the advancement of their country.</P>
    <P>Mr. Wilson is very slow to commit himself to free trade with the Continent unless and until he is satisfied he has got the best possible terms.  His association with the Commonwealth countries is preserved and similarly his great friendship with the United States is preserved.  It is difficult to understand how this Fianna Fáil Government, at this point in our history, could be so enthusiastic about signing the Rome Treaty.  Fianna Fáil signed the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain when our economy was at its weakest.  Much needs to be done before we can think of engaging in free trade with the countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> As far as my party are concerned, we want work for our people on the Shannon, on the Liffey, on the Nore and on the Suir&mdash;not on the Seine, the Tiber or the Rhine.  We are not against going into Europe but we want to go in under the best possible conditions. We want to go in as equal partners. We want to get the best possible bargain out of it.  We are not anti-European in our approach.  This party of ours is not merely nationalist in outlook: it is internationalist in outlook as well.  For us, poverty and insecurity anywhere in the world are a threat to freedom and prosperity everywhere.  We want dearly to join in a community of nations of Europe. We want to share in the growth, security and happiness of those people &mdash;but we want to do it as equal partners. We appreciate that, if Britain goes in, we have no alternative but to follow that market.</P>
    <P>The posturing of the present Government and the pretence that we are economically and financially strong enough to go into Europe at the present time is absolute nonsense.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to give deep consideration to this vitally important issue.  He knows best how long more it will take before Ireland, Britain and other countries will become members of the Common Market but, if it will take many more years to evolve, I earnestly beseech him to seek a speedy amendment of the present Free Trade Area Agreement with Great Britain which is having a most deleterious and ruinous effect on our economy.</P>
    <P>This is clearly to be seen in our shops where a greater proportion than ever before of foreign goods is on display.  This is to be seen in the virtual take-over by foreigners of our distributive trade.  This is to be seen in very many other ways.  The yawning gap in our balance of payments is evidence of this.  We must admit that all the advantages lie with Britain. We must reaappraise the situation before untold damage is done to our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2000" /> The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is now a huge joke.  It is very difficult to find anything of Irish origin or manufacture in very many of the major stores in this city.  The interlocking company, the cartel, the monopoly, seem to be the order of the day.  Everything big goes&mdash; to the exclusion of the small grocer, small trader, small factory and small farmer.  This is a standing situation. Fianna Fáil seem to accept it as inevitable. The poor we shall always have with us.  The unemployed we shall always have with us.  That everything small in this country is going out of existence seems now one of the inevitables. All our endeavours to focus attention on these things, and to seek redress, have met with little or no ready response by Government spokesmen.</P>
    <P>I have been seeking to prove, very briefly, in the limited time available to me, that the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain was essentially a bad bargain for all of us in Ireland in the agricultural sector and in the industrial sector.  I well recollect the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey, telling the Irish farmers on television and in this House that the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain would mean an extra £10 million per annum for them.  That has never materialised.  On the contrary, agricultural produce to that region in recent years has fallen&mdash;considerably in some instances.  However, the focal point is that our balance of payments has worsened from £22 million in 1968 to £60 million in 1969 and will worsen to an expected £90 million this year&mdash; 1970.  Even allowing for the appropriate price increases for various commodities the import excess from 1968 to 1970 was, at a very minimum, £33 million. It would be difficult to find a Government who have been more out of touch with the needs of the people, who have shown more indifference in recent times and, indeed, have acted so irresponsibly in so many areas.</P>
    <P>The outcome of all this has been that standards of living are falling; that we have to contend here of late with a lot of industrial strikes; that our ability to compete in the export field has worsened considerably.  All this will lead to further depression and to <Col N="2001" /> further unemployment in the very near future.  It is as if the minds and the time and the attitude of the most important Ministers of State have been devoted to other things altogether and our economy and the welfare of our country have been of the least importance. Certainly we have had a situation which has brought us to the verge of economic ruin and political anarchy. From any standpoint this country, its institutions, its economy, its standards, has reached a new low.  It is time a hard look was taken at the situation. It is time we had more sincerity and devotion to duty on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to deal, as I would like to, with the various aspects of the Budget.  We have been accused by Fianna Fáil spokesmen of opposing increases for the underprivileged, the social welfare classes generally. This, of course, is utterly untrue and cannot be substantiated.  Our every endeavour in this House is to improve the standard of living of the least fortunate in our society, the aged, the sick, the widowed, the orphaned, the infirm and the unemployed.  Every endeavour we make here is to spread human happiness among that unfortunate section of our people.  What we have opposed in this Budget is the vicious irresponsible system of turnover tax which increases all prices, bears down heaviest on those least able to bear the burden, drags down living standards and accelerates inflation.  We welcome, naturally, the increases granted to social welfare recipients but it is pertinent to point out that while increases have been granted, for the first time, I think, in the granting of increases to social welfare recipients certain categories such as contributory old age pensioners will only get a personal increase. There is no increase whatever for the pensioner's dependant.  This was a smart alecky trick.  Heretofore, when an increase was granted to a pensioner, a similar increase was invariably granted to the dependant of the pensioner&mdash;his wife and likewise his children. Here for the first time we have the tricky, unfair precedent that no increase has been granted to the pensioner's dependant.  Last year 10s was <Col N="2002" /> granted to the pensioner and 10s to his wife.  This year 17s 6d has been granted to the pensioner and nothing to his wife.</P>
    <P>I understand that the non-contributory classes will secure their increases in pension in August next and the contributory categories will be granted their increases in October.  I want to ask the Minister whether the contributory classes will be entitled to opt for the non-contributory pensions on which the increase is payable earlier, in respect, say, of the wife of a pensioner. I understand this was normal procedure in the past&mdash;that the dependant of a contributory pensioner was entitled to opt for the non-contributory pension to secure the increase at the earlier date.  I would like if the Minister, when replying, would be kind enough to say whether this facility will be afforded to the dependants of these pensioners on this occasion&mdash;that the contributory section will be entitled to opt for the non-contributory pension in August and revert to the contributory pension at a later stage if they so desire.  It might be no harm, if this facility is again conceded, to advise the dependants of contributory old age pensioners of their rights in this matter.</P>
    <P>I wanted very much to deal with matters appertaining to housing, health, education, industrial grants and various other things.  The Taoiseach speaks in such glowing terms about these things that he seems to be out of touch with the situation.  He seems to ignore the fact that we have a serious housing problem.  He said that Fianna Fáil were providing homes for our people at rents they could afford.  I contend they are providing neither of these two things.  Not only do we not have the houses for the countless thousands who are living in appalling circumstances but when it does come to determining rent we have the impostition of the differential rent which is the bane of the lives of our people, the great scourge of the tenants of this country and is causing widespread unrest and agitation as can be evidenced by the many thousands who are marching in our various cities every day.  The differential rent system is <Col N="2003" /> all right in principle&mdash;it is a principle we would all condone&mdash;but in its administration it has become a most objectionable thing, making inroads into the privacy of the lives of our tenants, stripping them bare in respect of information as to means, income and the like and imposing on them unfair rents, economic rents stripped of any State subsidy.</P>
    <P>It has reached proportions of indignation and agitation which the Government should take cognisance of and give back to local authorities the power to fix rents in accordance with the needs and the wishes of our local communities. This is not the position now. The differential rents system is imposed upon all of us in housing authorities and the penalty for not adopting that unfair and inequitable system is that State subsidies will be withdrawn and that the Minister for Local Government will not approve of any scheme but the differential rents scheme drawn up in accordance with his rules and regulations. Again, I avail of the opportunity of deploring that system and calling for redress.</P>
    <P>Very great progress has been made in the matter of education.  This is due, in the main, to the endeavours of the then Minister for Education, the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley.  If we are to have a free educational system in the real sense of the word I submit that this matter of free books be resolved.  The free books scheme as such does not exist.  An odious means test is applied to the unfortunate children based on whether or not they are in receipt of a medical card.  This is a most humiliating and degrading system which I know personally to have had a demoralising effect on little children, causing great embarrassment. I would ask the Minister to end this unsavoury system and to provide for children free books devoid of a means test.</P>
    <P>The free school transport system leaves a lot to be desired.  It is saddening to us all to learn of and, in fact, to see little children being passed on the road by school buses just because they are outside the appropriate limit laid down by the Department.  Every <Col N="2004" /> effort should be made to collect the younger children, especially those in the rural areas, whose lives are endangered on main roads and who have to be out in all kinds of weather.  The Minister should be more magnanimous in respect of free transport and relax this ridiculous stipulation of a two or three-mile limit which is being adhered to too strictly in many instances.</P>
    <P>It is not generally realised that up to ten years ago, prior to the advent of PAYE, only one of every four workers was paying income tax.  Now three out of every four workers are caught up in the mesh of income tax. I am not unmindful of, indeed, I am grateful for the very small concession made to income tax payers in this Budget, but I do not regard it as at all adequate.  Most of us hoped that the PAYE system of income tax would be a painless extraction from wages on a weekly basis.  There should be a better deal for the real producers of the wealth of this country, the working class.  I want to point out the anomaly whereby farmers are exempt from income tax and their unfortunate workers have to pay it.  The agricultural worker should share somewhat in the grants and bounties that are going, because he is the real producer of agricultural wealth.  It is a terrible anomaly that he should pay seven shillings in the £ over approximately £7 a week, while his employer, who may be a very rich man, pays no income tax at all.</P>

      <P>The Budget debate this year will surely rank as unique among Budget debates.  It started off on the 22nd April with the House being informed that the man who prepared the Budget would be unable to present it because he had suffered an accident, and on the 22nd April, just four weeks ago, the Taoiseach presented this year's Budget to Dáil Éireann and he read out to the Dáil, with an appearance of conviction and belief, a speech prepared by Deputy Charles Haughey four weeks ago.  Much has happened since.  Much <Col N="2005" /> water has gone under the bridge.  In the course of these four weeks heads have rolled, plots have been discovered. This debate, indeed, has been interrupted three times&mdash;once to get this House to agree to a token payment, the appointment of a new Minister for Justice, and then we had a marathon debate on the appointment of the other new Ministers of the Government; then we had a confidence motion and now, at the end of it all, we resume the Budget debate.  The din has subsided; the dust has cleared away and look now what happens: sitting in Deputy Haughey's seat is the Minister for Industry and Commerce of four weeks ago and Deputy Haughey's great rival for leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>This has been a most extraordinary Budget debate.  In these four weeks the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash;I will not say they have been rent asunder&mdash;but they have had a very bad attack of indigestion, constipation and then a purge to relieve the constipation and now, to conclude the debate when I sit down, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce will talk on behalf of an entirely changed Government, talk in defence of a Budget that was prepared by a man in whom the Taoiseach has no longer any confidence, a man whom he dismissed from his Government because he did not think it was proper that he should continue. Not even in the fertile imagination of some of our more sensational authors could such a story have been evolved and such a four weeks saga have been recounted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Budget always has been and should be a debate in which there is a review of the policy of the Government and an inquiry from these benches as to what the policy is going to be for the year ahead and before dealing with the terms of this year's Budget I think it is relevant to have a look at what has been happening to our economy over the last six or seven years, years in which successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance have been in charge of the economy, years in which a number of vicissitudes and <Col N="2006" /> difficulties have affected the country, but years in which there has been a significant lack of any coherent plan or policy by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>At the end of the fifties, the beginning of the sixties, a very good start was made with the First Programme. Of course, the First Programme must have caused a sensation to the then Fianna Fáil Government.  They did not understand it.  They did not prepare it. They knew nothing about it.  It was the work entirely of the then Secretary of the Department of Finance, Dr. Whitaker, who, fortunately, was appointed to that position by the inter-Party Government.  The First Programme brought to this country the first appreciation of what economic growth could be.  The First Programme put this country somewhat in line with what was happening in other countries in Europe.  We began to experience economic growth.  The trouble was that the Fianna Fáil Government of the time did not know how to use this growth.  They did not appreciate how to plan what was happening in the development of our resources and the growth of wealth in our community.</P>
    <P>We had then the Second Programme and that stated a number of economic aims and set out a number of targets but no effort was made to lay down the methods whereby these aims were to be achieved and the targets reached.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme obviously suffered from the fact that it was bedevilled by interference from the Fianna Fáil administration who were concerned to put a political complexion upon it and, of course, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> suffered very rapidly from the fact that the Government themselves refused to observe the discipline necessary to enable the programme to be a success.</P>
    <P>In 1964, inflation broke out&mdash;serious, definite, unambiguous inflation.  This inflation was not controlled because of electoral considerations.  In fact, the inflation of 1964 was initiated directly and exclusively by the then leader of the Government who wanted to win at all costs two by-elections, one in Cork and the other in Kildare.</P>
    <P>The year 1964 was a bad year, a year <Col N="2007" /> that we could not afford to experience, a year in which the progress won previously was being endangered by inflation, but no steps were taken to deal with it because it was planned to have a general election in the early months of 1965 and it was planned to get the people voting at the election in an atmosphere of euphoria created by inflation, and so on.</P>
    <P>Then we had 1965, when the present Taoiseach became Minister for Finance. I think Deputies who were in the last Dáil will remember Deputy Lynch coming in as Minister for Finance, reading out the stuff that was prepared for him, some of which obviously he did not understand.  He introduced, in 1965, a Budget designed to deal with the inflation that had been allowed to go uncontrolled in the previous year. The year 1965 and the measures then introduced led to a recession, led to the damping down of our economy.</P>
    <P>We had 1966 and then we had 1967, years in which economic growth tapered off, years in which unemployment grew and there was a general recession in economic activity.  Growth was resumed in 1968.  But as it was resumed, very rapidly the dangers of inflation began to reappear.  In November, 1968, we had this inflationary Budget introduced again by the Taoiseach, again in the absence at the time, because of an accident, of the then Minister for Finance&mdash;£19 million extra taxation. So we came to 1969.  In the early part of that year it became apparent to everybody that inflation was in danger of growing again.  As has been pointed out again and again in this debate, we had the crisis situation in March, 1969, with the Minister for Finance going on radio and television telling the people that we were facing a possible deficit of £50 million, that the country could not afford that, that there would have to be a retrenchment, a tightening of belts and all the rest.  This was followed by an inflationary Budget on the 7th May, 1969, and since then inflation has been allowed to rage uncontrolled.</P>
    <P>I have only gone back over the past six years but I suggest that that story in itself demonstrates that this Government <Col N="2008" /> have no plan, no policy, and no ability to follow any consistent action. We have had inflation, disinflation, we have had the old classic stop-go activity, but there has not been any effort whatever to follow any clear and defined road.  A few years ago there was a debate between different sides of the House as to the difference between economic planning and economic programming.  Whatever term can now be used it is perfectly clear that there was neither a plan nor a programme on the part of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>An inflationary Budget was introduced this time last year&mdash;again for what purpose?  Because the decision had been taken to have a general election. No other purpose.  There is that consistency that when electoral expediency dictates it, the requirements of prudence and caution, the national interest, cease to be important and Fianna Fáil will do anything with other people's money to buy votes and support for themselves.</P>
    <P>So we had the Budget of last year followed immediately by an election and the return of Fianna Fáil, only eleven months ago, with an overall majority.  What an amazing eleven months.  Look at them now&mdash;disillusioned, cowed, terrified, apathetic and afraid to face the people.  The year rolled on with inflation gathering in strength.  Deputy Davern may smile.  It does not matter to him that unfortunate women, the wives of workers in this city had to face the fact that their husband's earnings were being eaten up by rising prices.  Deputy Davern does not mind.  Inflation went on and we came to the days immediately before the Budget of this year.  The outcome of last year was not a £50 million deficit.  It was a £60 million deficit.  It became apparent that last year not only was the country importing and buying more than it was selling but worse than that we were financing our deficit by borrowing abroad&mdash;borrowing by the Government, by State bodies and also by ordinary individuals.  We were borrowing abroad and in that sense mortgaging our future.  In that way we were paying for the fact that we were consuming and buying more <Col N="2009" /> than we could produce.  That was a serious situation, a bad situation and an unhealthy situation.  It was a situation which was indicative of the fact that the Minister for Finance, the leader of the Government and every other Minister were being too damn lazy to face up to their responsibilities.  We were borrowing all over the world with foreign banks coming in here and giving loans to citizens at 15 per cent. Of course, money was coming in in order to keep up the euphoria, the spurious prosperity, to allow the good time Charlies and all the backslappers to wallow in a kind of synthetic wealth, but at the back of it all there was a corrosion of the value of every worker's pay packet; at the back of it all there were rising prices and there was ultimate hardship for the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Five weeks ago the Government were told clearly that unless positive action were taken the deficit in our balance of payments this year would rise by £90 million, that there were going to be further wage increases of the order of 8 per cent and that the country and the economy were going to be in a very serious position.  All the bodies charged with accepting responsibility for looking after the economy&mdash;the NIEC, the Department of Finance, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Bank&mdash;indicated clearly that we were moving into a disastrous situation. What happens?  This Budget was introduced by the Taoiseach on behalf of the injured Minister for Finance. This Budget utterly and completely ignored the situation.  Not only did it ignore the situation, which was bad, but by doubling the turnover tax the Budget was calculated further to shove up and increase prices.  In case it is not realised I can say without fear of contradiction now, on the 20th May, that since the first day of this month, every woman who has gone into a shop, a store or a supermarket has come out livid at the steep increase in prices that has taken place.  The snowballing has only started to take place. Prices are soaring.  Costs in every sphere of the economy are increasing. We have tonight an intimation that motor insurance will increase by 17½ <Col N="2010" /> per cent.  This is the direct effect of an ill-considered Budget, a most injudicious tax increase which, in a situation of inflation, is bound to make a bad situation considerably worse.</P>
    <P>This Government, and I accuse them of collective incompetence, ask Dáil Éireann to approve this Budget as a means of dealing with the present situation, a situation of soaring prices and a widening deficit in our balance of payments, and, behind all this, if one listens carefully, one can hear the pathetic bleating of the Taoiseach asking people not to increase wages by more than 7 per cent.  Seven per cent in a year in which prices will rise by, at a minimum, 10½ per cent. The Taoiseach says 7 per cent.  No one listened to him.  It was an utterly ridiculous appeal to make.  Already increases far beyond that have been granted, and more increases will be granted.  Deputy Colley, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was charged by this incompetent Government to say that he would disallow price increases if no one gave a wage increase beyond 7 per cent.  Utter rubbish.  This situation was allowed to develop by an incompetent Government concerned with other things.</P>
    <P>Why have we not got a prices and incomes policy?  In 1965, the Fine Gael Party indicated, defined and wrote out in the <i>Just Society</i> policy the proper way in which to approach a prices and incomes policy.  In 1966 our point of view was accepted by NIEC, a body representative of employers and trade unions; that body said: &ldquo;Yes, this is the only way in which real progress can be made.  It will bring stability to money and it will ensure that wage increases have a real value.&rdquo;  1966! What has been done since?  Absolutely nothing.  These incompetent Ministers have been parading themselves around the place as so many gladiators all looking for a little bit of extra notice in the eternal queue to find out who is going to lead Fianna Fáil.  That has been their concern, not the ordinary people and the trust the ordinary people imposed in them.</P>
    <P>Four years have passed without even the initial steps being taken to introduce a prices and incomes policy.  Now we <Col N="2011" /> have Fianna Fáil talking about it again.  Talking about what?  Talking about a wages policy.  A prices and incomes policy of a broad dimension is what is needed.  The problem will not be solved by controlling profits or controlling wages.  The solution will come about only with understanding, with co-operation, ensuring, as we suggested by the provision of a dividends equalisation tax, that those who earn money from profits will not gain as a result of the understanding and the concession made by wage earners. It will be a hard and difficult task, but not even the initial steps have been taken to introduce such a policy. Nothing has been done because this Government have no policy.  They have no programme.  They have no idea what they will do next month, not to mind any solution of the problem facing them now.</P>
    <P>The result has been that for the last four or five years we have had a wages/prices spiral.  Industrial relations are non-existent.  We have had a Minister for Labour for the last five or six years.  Doing what?  Making polite announcements about the things he is thinking of doing.  But he has never done anything.  We have reached a situation again, for the second time in five years, in which we have the highest strike record in Europe.  There is a cement strike which is being relied on by the Government, because it is forcing up unemployment, to help in the solution of our balance of payments difficulty.</P>
    <P>We have a bank strike and, in the course of that bank strike, the available money in circulation is being siphoned off by those who have it for other purposes.  Is this being contrived at by the Government to take some of the heat out of the economy?  Certainly, in relation to positive action, positive policy, an incomes policy, a prices policy and industrial relations we might as well be back seven, eight or ten years ago.  There is no progress, no policy.  I doubt if the Government at this moment would be able to indicate what their plans are.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation of galloping inflation, a growing trade deficit, a <Col N="2012" /> situation in which our costs of production are, for the first time ever, exceeding those of Britain.  That may have happened on an odd occasion before, but now a new pattern has been set. Does anyone realise how dangerous that is?  Is it appreciated what the consequences are likely to be?  In the situation that has been allowed to develop the cost of producing the goods we depend upon to maintain and improve our economy has put us at a disadvantage in relation to others.  With a balance of payments deficit of £90 million one just does not know what the future will hold.  The plain fact is that our £ has been endangered.  If our £ collapses great harm will be done and great suffering will be caused to many.</P>
    <P>What should the Government do? They are not going to resign.  They will hang together because otherwise they would hand separately.  Late as it may be, I would suggest that, first of all, they should try to set going the initial steps towards achieving a prices and incomes policy.  It will be a long road, a hard haul, but it is essential that the effort be made.  Secondly, I should like to see some evidence of a policy in regard to industrial relations.  I should like to see adequate and immediate steps taken to stabilise prices.  I should like to see a proper effort being made to encourage savings by proper incentives.  It is quite absurd that a situation should be allowed to exist in which it is only the fool who saves since what one saves is devalued and depreciated.  These are urgent matters because within the next couple of months we face impending EEC negotiations, negotiations which, unfortunately, so far as we know at the moment, will be in the hands of incompetent Ministers.</P>
    <P>Are we going to negotiate with the hard-headed men of Europe in a situation of disadvantage, with a balance of payments difficulty, uncontrolled inflation and a situation in which we are pricing ourselves out of export markets? If that is the way we must negotiate we shall suffer very significantly.  I have little doubt that some efforts will be contrived to remedy our present economic ills.  I can only hope it is not too late and that the harm that has been done by the year of neglect, 1969, <Col N="2013" /> which has ended in this inappropriate Budget is still controllable.  Let there be no doubt, action must now be taken by the new Minister for Finance.  He cannot afford to permit a continuance of the silly euphoria of the last 12 or 18 months.  This bubble of spurious prosperity must be pricked if the way of life and employment of ordinary people is to be preserved.  Doing that will be injurious and difficult but I hope there will at last be some resolute decision of the Government.  What was called the crisis of the past fortnight or so may pale into insignificance compared with the real dangers which face our people now in a situation brought about by neglect, considerations of political expediency and lack of any clear policy and uniform plan.  All this adds up to a very bad situation.</P>
    <P>We now have growing unemployment with close on 75,000 people unemployed. In our sister country the economic difficulties appear to have been solved.  Compared with Britain we are now in a highly disadvantageous position. We should be going into Europe, although a small country, as a strong country.  We should be going into Europe having reaped the benefits of economic growth over the past ten years.  We should be going into Europe, had we applied to ourselves through our Government the discipline that was essential to the maintenance of economic growth, in a strong way as a country that could contribute significantly to Europe's economic development. All that has been rendered impossible by the years of neglect by different Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
    <P>They talked about their programmes and their plans.  They did not believe in them themselves.  They talked about preserving the resources of the country to develop the country.  They did not do that themselves.  They dissipated our resources through the years and the result is that we have limped along, achieving a 4 per cent growth one year, not achieving it in the next year and so on.  It has been a sorry and pathetic story and it has been due to the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party have been continuously in office.  I believe the eyes of the people are now opening to realise that if we are to <Col N="2014" /> develop in a highly competitive world, one of the first things we must ensure is that every Government here are kept on their toes because there is an alternative to them.</P>
    <P>The other day the Taoiseach in the debate on the confidence motion or some such debate said that although they had their difficulties they had now composed them and they would go forward as a united party.  He went on to say: &ldquo;Anyway, who is going to oppose us?&rdquo;  I want to make it clear to Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, and every member of Fianna Fáil that that hare will not run any longer.  The people will provide an alternative to Fianna Fáil immediately they are asked to do so and our democracy will function as it should.  At the moment Fianna Fáil are in office charged with the awful responsibility of dealing with these economic problems. It will be our duty from these benches to see that these problems are tackled.  If we find in the coming months that our money, assets and resources have been endangered or devalued by action or negligence on the part of Fianna Fáil I can assure the Minister for Finance and the Government that not even we on these benches would control the mounting anger that will sweep them out of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to a number of the speeches in this debate and, in particular, to the winding-up speeches on behalf of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, the distortion and misuse of some facts, the gross exaggeration and misrepresentation of other facts and the running away from economic realities, one really is not surprised that they are over there and we are over here. However, despite that, I propose to treat the Opposition Parties with the courtesy which an opposition should deserve and endeavour to reply to the major points raised in the debate.  It will, of course, be understood that in the time at my disposal I could not attempt to deal with all of them but I shall endeavour to deal with the major ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it will be contested that the major criticism levelled at this Budget has been the allegation that it <Col N="2015" /> has done nothing to curb inflation and that Government policy in general has done nothing to curb it.  In framing the Budget the Government have been particularly concerned not to take any action which would push our economy into recession.  Growth remains our main objective and the Government do not propose to act in any way which would harm this objective unless such action is absolutely necessary.  It is, perhaps, strange to see the Opposition, including Labour Party Deputies, calling for harsher measures which would result in rising unemployment and emigration and depressed business activity generally.  The Government will continue to watch the situation very closely.</P>
    <P>One of the primary objectives of policy this year is to ensure that the balance of payments deficit does not exceed £50 million.  If there is any danger that this objective may not be achieved, the Government have made it quite clear that they will not hesitate to introduce further measures of restraint.  A £50 million deficit this year, while representing an improvement on last year's estimated deficit of £60 million, would, of course, give no cause for complacency.  Our aim is to get back to the more moderate deficits of £35 million to £40 million which were envisaged in the Third Programme but, as was pointed out in the Financial Statement, to attempt deliberately to achieve a deficit much smaller than £50 million this year might well involve excessive disruption of the economy.</P>
    <P>To listen to some of the speakers from the Opposition benches, one might well think that nothing whatever had been done by the Government to curb inflation.  Let me remind the House that last January the severest hire purchase restrictions ever were imposed.  The credit restraint of 1969-70 had increasing effect through that period.  The guidelines then set were virtually fully met.  For the next 12 months the credit curb will continue to operate and will be more stringent still.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank advice to the associated banks provides for an <Col N="2016" /> increase of 12 per cent in lending, which is the maximum increase compatible with the policy objective which I have mentioned of a balance of payments deficit of the order of £50 million. This increase of 12 per cent in bank lending in the 12 months ending in April, 1971, compares with an increase of 13 per cent in the calendar year, 1969, and 23 per cent in the calendar year, 1968.</P>
    <P>In periods of rising incomes and prices, it is not an easy task to restrain increases in public expenditure. Government services and expenditures essential to growth and to the general well-being of the community have to be maintained and improved where possible.  Nevertheless, an exhaustive review of both capital and current expenditures was carried out and very substantial economies were made in the proposals which were put forward for the current financial year from the various Departments.</P>
    <P>Indeed, cuts in the region of £30 million were made in the public capital programme and, on the current side, the cuts were in the region of £22 million.  The public capital programme which makes such large demands on national resources&mdash;it is directly responsible for more than half of gross domestic fixed capital formation&mdash;is estimated to rise by 12 per cent in 1970-71.  This represents a considerably reduced rate of increase as compared with recent years.  I should, perhaps, point out that in 1968-69 the rate of increase was 28 per cent and last year it was 23 per cent.  The smaller rate of growth in the capital programme this year should result in a significant reduction in the pressure on our resources as compared with recent years.</P>
    <P>The combination of tight hire purchase restrictions, restraint in bank lending and moderate increases in the capital programme, together with the balancing of the current Budget, should keep a tight rein on the economy in 1970 and help to reduce the inflationary pressures without, at the same time, pushing the economy into recession.  A particularly positive way of combating inflation is by the encouragement of savings.</P>
    <P>In the Budget it was indicated how, <Col N="2017" /> in order to give incentive to savers, it is proposed to introduce a new type of savings scheme which would encourage people to save by regular monthly instalments over the period of a year, to retain their savings on deposit for a further period of two years and then be paid a bonus calculated at the rate of 9 per cent per annum compound interest free of tax, which is the equivalent of about 14 per cent gross.</P>
    <P>The first quarter of 1970 saw some improvement in the external trading position.  Our provisional trade returns show that exports increased by 23½ per cent and imports by 13½ per cent as compared with the first quarter of 1969.  Overall, the import excess declined by £0.6 million in the quarter. While it is true that special factors played a part in this improvement, it is also true that, if moderation in seeking income increases were accepted, we could look forward to a continuation of the improvement and the attainment of the objective I mentioned, namely, a deficit in the balance of payments not exceeding £50 million in the present calendar year.</P>
    <P>What I have just said about credit restraint must, of course, now be considered in the context of the bank closure.  As I have indicated, the Budget was drawn up on the basis that credit curbs would continue to operate. As I have said, the Central Bank's advice to the associated banks, as issued in April, provided for an increase of 12 per cent in bank lending in the 12 months ending April, 1971. As a result of the closure of the banks, a new and important factor has been introduced which could not have been provided for in advance.  During the previous bank closure which took place in 1966 there was a significant expansion in credit.  This was not injurious to the economy at the time as there was scope for such expansion.</P>
    <P>The economic background is quite different now and any marked addition to credit beyond the limits indicated in the Central Bank's guideline could have serious effects.  If the closure should end in the near future, our problem would not be very great.  A lengthy <Col N="2018" /> closure, which I hope will be avoided, would cause more difficulty.  It is not, clear, however, that, even if the closure were lengthy, credit would expand to the same extent as on the previous occasion.  Conditions have changed since 1966 and the closure may give different results in the credit sphere.  If it should transpire that credit expands in a way that threatens to place the Government's basic objectives in jeopardy, then consideration will have to be given to the introduction of further appropriate restraints.  The developing situation will be watched carefully so that appropriate remedial action can be taken in time if it should be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is obvious&mdash;and many speakers in the debate referred to this fact&mdash;that central to our whole economy and its prospects is the question of an incomes and prices policy.  The Minister for Labour and Social Welfare spoke here earlier today and dealt at some length with this matter.  I want to say something further.  First of all, I want to underline the fact that the recent NIEC report on incomes and prices was accepted by the Government.  Within, I think, three days of its publication a meeting was held between the Taoiseach and some Ministers and representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of the employers' side.  At that meeting an <i>ad hoc</i> committee was set up to formulate the arrangements for the employer-labour conference envisaged in the NIEC report.  That <i>ad hoc</i> committee met within, I think, a week of that meeting.  The composition of the employer-labour conference has been established and they are to hold their first meeting within the next few days.  If any evidence were needed of the Government's determination to utilise to the fullest every opportunity open to them to get an incomes and prices policy operating here, it is clearly shown in the picture I have just given of what has happened since that report was published.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we had better get this quite straight&mdash;that in a democracy in which all political parties and all those who represent broad sections of the community have indicated clearly that they favour free <Col N="2019" /> collective bargaining, an incomes and prices policy can work only if there is a commitment on the part of all the people involved to make it work.  That commitment implies that there is a common good, a national interest, which is bigger, higher and more important than any sectional interest. If that is recognised, then this commitment is possible.  If it is not recognised, such commitment is not possible.</P>
    <P>I am aware that no effective incomes and prices policy has operated in other countries, at least to my knowledge. Consequently, I recognise that while one may draw up many blueprints which look excellent on paper, it is quite a different matter to get a workable policy.  I do not say that the NIEC proposals are the panacea for all our ills but I do say that they provide a framework within which the Irish people, if they are sufficiently disciplined and committed to the national interest, can operate that system, that machinery, in the interests of everybody in our community.</P>
    <P>It requires a great deal of discipline and a great deal of patriotism&mdash;a word which, perhaps, is sometimes considered out of date but is always relevant and is particularly relevant in this context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally have sufficient faith in our people to believe that this is possible. However, I think that whether or not it happens will depend very largely on the lead given by all of us in the House and by some people outside the House&mdash;in particular, by the leaders on the employers' side and on the trade union side.  I also believe that they know, as everybody in this House knows, that it is vitally important to the future of every man, woman and child in this country that that policy be effective.  What is required is that they have sufficient commitment <Col N="2020" /> to stand up and be counted when the going gets tough&mdash;and it will get tough &mdash;in operating this.</P>

      <P>The Government have clearly indicated their commitment.  I believe that the necessary commitment from the other parties will be forthcoming. If it is, then I think we can look foward to a considerable improvement in the whole situation of our economy.  I have already indicated to the House the steps which the Government have taken&mdash;the overall strategy in regard to inflation&mdash;remembering all the time that we do not want to plunge the country into a recession.</P>
      <P>The hire purchase restrictions, the credit restrictions, the reduction in the growth rate of our capital programme &mdash;all of these things are essentially features of that strategy.  But in conjunction with these measures it is essential and most important to have an incomes and prices policy.  As I have indicated, I believe it can be done.  I believe it will be very difficult.  It can be done and it is well worth the while of everybody in this country to see that it is done.</P>
      <P>Listening to some of the speeches and particularly that which we heard this afternoon from Deputy O'Higgins when he talked about spurious prosperity and the squandering away over the past ten years of benefits that might have accrued, I wondered if they really knew what has been happening.</P>

      <P>The growth record of our economy in recent years has been one of which everybody in the House can be proud because this was achieved by the Irish people in this State; all their efforts went into this.  It is one which, ten years ago, would not have been considered feasible, I think, by anybody.  I want to remind the House <Col N="2021" /> that, despite the temporary interruptions and difficulties, our growth record has been such that any other country would envy it.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten years, our economy grew by an average of 4 per cent per annum.  In more recent years, the momentum of economic growth, which was re-established in mid-1966 after the slow-down of the previous 18 months, continued strongly in the three years 1967, 1968 and 1969.  In 1967, the volume of production rose by 5 per cent.  While, in 1968 the rate of increase was of the order of 7 per cent as a result of a combination of exceptionally large increases in the three sectors &mdash;industry, agriculture and services.  In 1969, the growth rate is provisionally estimated to have been of the order of 3¾ per cent, a rate which, though below the exceptional level of the preceding year, was more in line, perhaps, with the long-term growth potential of the economy.</P>
      <P>The rapid increases in industrial production over that period were in no small measure due to Government activity in the promotion of industry, in the provision of industrial grants, in the provision of concessions on export tax relief.  The record of growth which we have had is one of which we can all be proud but we must take every opportunity to ensure that the real fruits of that growth are not frittered away in a senseless pursuit of excessive nominal income increases which are not real income increases. It is true that, as in most countries, the agricultural sector has tended to lag behind, mainly because of external marketing difficulties.  However, the future for agriculture remains hopeful, especially in view of the prospects of entry into the EEC which should help agriculture very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have made it clear in the past and continue to make it clear in the present that in the ultimate, in the circumstances of our economy, the test by which a Government must be judged and by which they must stand or fall is in the creation of new jobs. Despite the emergence of a number of somewhat adverse trends during 1969 and, in particular, the large incomes and prices increases and the widening <Col N="2022" /> of the balance of payments deficit one very satisfactory aspect of economic progress during that year was the record increase in industrial employment. Employment in manufacturing industry was, on the average, 11,000 more in the year compared with increases of 2,000 and 3,600 in 1967 and 1968 respectively.  The figures for total employment are available only for one point in the year, namely, mid-April. Between mid-April, 1968, and mid-April, 1969, the increase in employment in the total non-agricultural sector was 16,000, something that we have never remotely approached before and on this test by which we asked to be judged many years ago and still ask to be judged there has never been anything like the success of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1969.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of the economy which is, in my view, a cause of serious concern.  This was referred to by Deputy O'Higgins and I think it bears repetition because it is a matter of serious concern to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am referring to figures available on <Col N="2023" /> unit wage costs in our economy.  As a result of increases in productivity, that is, output per man hour, which almost exactly counterbalanced increases in average hourly earnings in manufacturing industries, unit wage costs showed practically no change in either 1967 or 1968.  Unit wage costs in Britain over the same period also showed little change.  In 1969, however, the picture altered dramatically.  Productivity in Irish manufacturing industry improved by about one per cent while average hourly earnings rose by about 13 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The net result was an increase in unit wage costs in this country of nearly 12 per cent as compared with an increase in unit wage costs of approximately 5½ per cent in Britain.  Even when allowance is made for the distortion of the annual figures due to the maintenance men's strike, unit wage costs in this country still rose by about twice the rate of increase in Britain.  The failure of productivity to rise more than marginally in 1969 is partly explained by the fact that productive capacity had largely been taken up by the end of 1968 and the scope for further productivity increases was limited.  However, the rapid rate of increase in average hourly earnings in 1969, which was about 1½ times as great as that which occurred in Britain, was particularly disquieting and was clearly a trend which, if it were to continue, would undoubtedly price us out of not alone the British market but every other market abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made to the social welfare increases granted in this Budget.  Suggestions were made that they would not be worth anything.  In fact, I told one Deputy last night, as he developed his theme, that if he kept on long enough he would prove that we were taking money away rather than giving it and I think a Labour Deputy was inclined to agree with him.  Just to keep the matter in perspective I should like to tell the House that between mid-February, 1969, and mid-February, 1970, the consumer price index rose by 6 per cent.  If one <Col N="2024" /> takes the position of what was needed on that basis to compensate for an increase in the cost of living for an old age contributory pensioner on his or her own one gets a figure of 4s 11d. The Budget increase is 17s 6d.  If one takes such an old age contributory pensioner with an adult dependant the necessary increase to compensate for the cost of living increase would be 9s 2d and the Budget increase is 17s 6d.  For the old age non-contributory pensioner the cost of living increase would be 4s 6d.  The Budget increase is 10s.  If one compounds with those costs the effect of the turnover tax increase imposed in the Budget one finds that for the single old age contributory pensioner the increase in cost was 7s 1d as against the 17s 6d in the Budget.  For the old age contributory pensioner with adult dependant the increased cost is 13s 2d as against 17s 6d in the Budget and for the non-contributory old age pensioner 6s 6d increased cost as against 10s increase in the Budget.  So far as the increase in the old age contributory pensions is concerned it might be remembered that since less than 40 per cent of such pensioners have dependant wives the majority receive 10s 5d per week more than what would be needed to offset the rise in living costs, including turnover tax, at the date of the Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the end of the year but I am taking the position as it was, as it could be calculated when the Budget was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been references to the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.  I should like to remind the House that this is kept under regular review and that the agreement itself provides that in the year commencing in July next there is a specific provision for an overall review of its operation.  I would also remind the House that following that review and after discussion with the British Government our Government <Col N="2025" /> would be entitled to exclude from the operation of the agreement goods accounting for not more than 3 per cent by value of total imports into Ireland from Britain in the immediately preceding year.  There are no grounds for assuming that these provisions would not be adequate for the purpose of dealing with any difficulties likely to be encountered by Irish firms as a result of the operation of that Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group, commonly known as the Devlin Report. There have been a number of references to this in the debate and it has been suggested that the treatment of that report in the Budget speech was perfunctory.  I think, however, that Deputies will appreciate that the Budget Statement is not the appropriate place to discuss a wide-ranging report of this nature in detail.  I hope to make another opportunity available to the House at a later stage to consider that report.</P>
    <P>However, there is one point I should like to make perfectly clear and it is this: the Government attach the greatest importance to this report.  If we were not alive to the problems and needs in the area covered by the report we would not have set the body up in the first instance.  It is because of the very importance of the recommendations and their far-reaching implications for the public service as a whole that hasty or partially informed decisions must be avoided.  The examination of the recommendations is being carried out as a matter of the first priority and we propose that interim decisions will be issued in so far as this is feasible.  The fundamental issue in that report is the organisation and management of the whole public service, and it is this aspect that the Government have considered first.  Central to this issue is the question of the location of the new Public Service Department, or unit, mentioned in the report.  I expect that we shall be in a position to announce a decision on this matter in the very near future. <Col N="2026" /> Deputy FitzGerald has said that the financing of the Exchequer's residual borrowing requirement of £75 million in 1970-71 will either mean depriving the private sector of bank credit or involve foreign borrowing which is both costly and inflationary.  The extent to which the Exchequer's bank borrowing will reduce the availability of credit for the private sector will, of course, depend on the total amount of bank credit that is made available and on the amount of this that is set aside for the Exchequer.  The Central Bank have already advised that new bank credit in 1970-71 should be limited to £75 million and that £50 million of this should be reserved for the public sector, leaving £25 million for the private sector.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that a large part of the finance that is raised each year for the capital programme goes directly to finance capital expenditure undertaken by the private sector. Expenditure of this kind includes advances and grants for private housing, loans to industry and agricultural grants and loans.  These and other similar expenditures represent between 35-40 per cent of the total programme. Furthermore, the availability of these grants and loans induces substantial investment from private sector funds which might not take place otherwise. Exchequer bank borrowing has been held at £50 million approximately last year and the year before in spite of increases in public capital expenditure. There is no indication that the private sector has suffered for the want of credit; in fact the indications suggest the contrary.</P>
    <P>The question of consumer prices has been referred to in the debate and a certain amount of confusion seems to me to have been created by some Opposition speakers regarding the likely trend of consumer prices in 1970. It has been suggested that prices may rise by 10 per cent this year.  This suggestion is completely unwarranted. Contrary to previous years, the pre-Budget publication <i>Review of 1969 and Outlook for</i> 1970 did not give a definite forecast of trends in 1970 because of the many imponderables in the economic situation.</P>
    <Col N="2027" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead it expressed its opinions on what was likely to happen in two eventualities.  It was pointed out that in the first eventuality, namely, acceptance of the Government's norm of 7 per cent for the first year of the new wage agreement, certain desirable results would follow, including a balance of payments deficit significantly smaller than in 1969 and not exceeding £50 million.  The other eventuality was that the pattern laid down by the maintenance men's settlement would become general.  It was pointed out that in this case the balance of payments deficit could be up to £80 million and the increase in consumer prices could well approach last year's figure of 7½ per cent.</P>
      <P>This figure was calculated as realistically as possible.  It has, therefore, to take account of the possibility that taxation would require to be increased to finance the higher level of public expenditure which this eventuality would produce.  It is still too early to forecast the likely rise in consumer prices this year, but the indications are that taking into account the effect of taxation changes, the increase will be of the same order as last year.</P>
      <P>This Budget debate has been outstanding in one respect, that is, the evident bankruptcy of ideas in the attempt at criticisms made by the Opposition Parties.  They have been clutching at straws in their endeavours to find plausible grounds for complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>None of them has objected to a single item in the broad spread of concessions and improvements which this Budget has made possible.  Of course they could not do so.  This Budget has spread those benefits far and wide throughout the community. The Government believe that the increase in the turnover tax is not a big price to pay for those benefits and improvements, and they are confident that those who have to pay for <Col N="2028" /> those benefits and improvements will not grudge it.</P>
      <P>In default of a better stick with which to beat the Government the Opposition Members have complained that the Budget is not severe enough. They would have preferred even more taxation than the £20 million which is being raised on the turnover tax.  They pretend to believe that the Budget has been designed to end up with a deficit rather than being in balance.</P>
      <P>One would have thought the Opposition would have learned a lesson from last year's experience.  We all remember that when the 1969 Budget was introduced the Fine Gael and Labour Members said it was dishonest, that the revenue would not be enough to cover the expenditure and that we would have to bring in a supplementary Budget in the autumn.  They sang this song very loudly all through the summer and indeed they resumed it again with gusto when the House reassembled.  However, the chorus began to fail as we got near Christmas without any sign of a supplementary Budget as they had been predicting.  Then it trailed off into silence.</P>
      <P>All the distinguished economists who adorn the opposite benches were proved wrong in their dismal predictions that there would be an autumn Budget in 1969.  I am sure the Opposition Parties do not like to be reminded now that there was not an autumn Budget and that the Budget of May 1969, was an honest Budget.  It is a measure of their desperate search for any grounds on which to criticise the 1970 Budget that they have to fall back again on the criticism which failed them last year. I want to assure them that it will not serve them any better this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our economist critics have complained that this year's Budget should have been more severe, not merely on the grounds that more taxation was required to finance Exchequer spending but also because the brakes should have been applied more sharply to economic activity in general.  I should like to remind the House that these are the same economists who criticised the Government for having been too restrictive in 1964-65 and 1965-66.  For years afterwards we had to listen  <Col N="2029" /> Deputy Garret FitzGerald and many others bemoaning the fact that economic activity had been slowed down too much and that the potential for economic growth which they said was lost in those years had been irretrievably lost.  Of course, they were very careful to wait until after the event before venturing that opinion.  Now, in rather similar circumstances, they are backing the other horse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are telling us that we are not being restrictive enough. I suppose that, having tried the one and having come out so wrong, it is logical enough if you accept that crazy kind of logic, that they should try the other one and see what happens.  They want us to give the economy a much more abrupt jolt in the taxation we impose this year.  They are not satisfied with the extra £20 million which the turnover tax will yield.  They would like to see us turning the screw tighter.  Of course, I do not suppose this should surprise us very much when we remember that when both these parties were in office that is exactly what they did, and look at the mess they made of the country.  Fianna Fáil are not going to make that mess again.</P>

      <P>However, if it is their view that more additional taxation should have been imposed, perhaps they might, since they did not have the courage already, tell us what taxes they would have imposed and by how much they would have increased the existing taxes.</P>
      <P>The Government fully realise the serious problem that exists in this economy at present and that that problem requires very careful treatment if we are to escape its worst effects.  We believe that the credit restrictions and the budgetary policy are the most effective means within our control for dealing with this situation as we foresee it throughout the current year.  However, it is in the field of incomes that we are most vulnerable and most dependent on co-operation from employers and employees alike.</P>
      <P>We realise that development in the economy may not be entirely in line with our predictions and we are, therefore, prepared to take further corrective action as and when we judge it to be necessary.  We shall keep a very close eye on the course of events during the year and all facets of economic activity will be kept under constant and detailed scrutiny.  We are confident that the monetary and budgetary strategies are the ones most likely to keep the economy on an even keel and that if they are matched by a rational approach on incomes we shall be able to overcome our economic difficulties and to record 1970 as another year of satisfactory progress.</P>
      <P>However, there is one thing of which I can assure the House and the country and that is that the affairs of this country are safe in the hands of a rejuvenated, dynamic and confident Government, a Government which will be implementing enthusiastically the true Republican policy and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), lines 27 and 28, to delete &ldquo;, after consultation with such interested persons (if any) as he may select,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 provides that an order shall not be made under this section without prior consultation by the Minister with such persons as appear to him to be substantially interested in the general subject matter of the order unless, in the case of an order under subsection (11) of this section, it is, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary to make the order without such consultation.  This particular amendment arises from proposals made by the Confederation of Irish Industries. They represented that consultation with interested parties should be obligatory because the principle of consultation was fundamental to the efficient operation of the legislation. I accepted the proposals provided that, in the case of amending or revoking orders, a formula can be devised rendering consultation unnecessary where I am of the opinion that consultation is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This covers all goods. The Confederation of Irish Industries <Col N="2037" /> was rather frightened at the possibility of some type of order which would prevent the marketing of some goods and it is reasonable that they should ask for consultation before the Minister makes an order.  No particular goods are contemplated.  In general, it is foodstuffs which will be dealt with; there will be orders relating to weight, size, count and so on.</P>

      <P>During the debate on Second Reading a question arose as to whether more than one of the three forms&mdash;weight, measure and number &mdash; could be covered in the one order and the Minister at the time said that this was possible. Since then it has been decided that this would permit of an order being made covering only one form&mdash; weight, or measure, or number&mdash;and that is why these amendments have been introduced in order to remove any doubt but that weight, measure and number can be covered, if necessary, in any order made under this section.</P>

      <P>As regards amendment No. 3 particularly we, in this party, have no objection.  In fact, what the Federation of Industries desired was that the Minister would perforce have to consult with all parties interested. On contemplation, as politicians who have been here for some time, one would realise that to have a Minister subject to this as an absolute rule of law might be wrong because I am sure there are crackpots among the manufacturers as there are in this House and elsewhere.  This amendment is acceptable.  It does not go the whole way but we have no objection to it.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment extends the minimum period between the date of publication of the notice of intention to make an order and the date of the making of the order from one month to two months.  This amendment was also proposed by the Confederation of Irish Industries on the grounds that longer notice would, in fact, be necessary in the event of my accepting their proposal that there should be consultation with interested parties before making the order.  It was felt it was reasonable to suggest that there should be a two months gap rather than a one month gap between publication of the notice <Col N="2039" /> and the making of the order.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(12) An order shall not be made under this section without prior consultation by the Minister with such persons as appear to him to be substantially interested in the general subject-matter of the order unless, in the case of an order under sub-section (11) of this section, it is, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary to make the order without such consultation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 12, before &ldquo;borough&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or other&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a sort of drafting amendment in order to incorporate borough authorities like Dún Laoghaire in the wording.  In the case of section 3 (1) the actual phrasing is:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; means a person authorised in writing by the Minister or by the council of a county or corporation of a county borough in relation to its functional area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is to make this read &ldquo;a county or other borough&rdquo; so as to bring in, for instance, Dún Laoghaire Borough or any other boroughs that would need to be included under this Act in order to enable local authorities <Col N="2040" /> to carry out functions in this regard.  All the amendments, Nos. 8, 9, 11 and 12, are consequential on the decision to change the wording in these subsections from &ldquo;county borough&rdquo; to &ldquo;county or other borough&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a person is charged with an offence under this Act in relation to goods packed in a container, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove&mdash;</P>

      <P>(b) that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all reasonable diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence in respect of these goods by himself or any person under his control.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a most important amendment. Again, it is an amendment put forward by the Federation of Irish Industries. We must tell the Minister it is not the &ldquo;Confederation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they change their name?  I am caught out.  However, apart from the humour in the matter, there is the situation where a man who is a director of a company or is proprietor of a business, naturally cannot see everything that is done within his business.  He has to delegate responsibility <Col N="2041" /> to others.  In this situation a person may commit an offence and may incur the most severe penalties which, in fact, include six months in jail while at the same time before God he would be entirely innocent of that offence.  I am thinking of the sort of situation that could arise in the business in which I am involved.  A few years ago a man removed a guard from an elevator top and removed another guard to adjust a belt.  While he was standing on a ladder, the ladder shook and he leaned back and had two fingers removed from his hand.  The company was responsible for the negligence of whoever removed the guard from that machine.</P>
      <P>One can imagine somebody packing goods in a packing house who may have been instructed to weigh in a certain manner and be very careful. Human frailty being what it is, you might find he might not do so and an offence might be committed under this measure.  The penalty could be six months in jail and a heavy fine.  I think it would be improper not to put into this Bill a safeguard as to what should be a reasonable defence and my amendment is to add a subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>(4) Where a person is charged with an offence under this Act in relation to goods packed in a container, it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that the commission of the offence was due to a mistake or to an accident or some other cause beyond his control and</P>
      <P>(b) that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all reasonable diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence in respect of these goods by himself or any person under his control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a wise provision because doctors differ and patients die and so do judges.  A judge might have very strong views about short weight or about descriptions of goods and would impose a heavy penalty.  Probably if the penalty was too great the defendant, on appeal to a higher court, would succeed in avoiding that penalty but in the meantime he would be subject to considerable <Col N="2042" /> criticism as a person named in the newspapers for, perhaps, giving short weight while, in fact, he did not intend to give short weight.  Just as he, in human frailty might do something wrong, those working for him did something wrong and gave short weight or a wrong description of goods or whatever the offence was.</P>
    <P>On the principle of delegation of responsibility we say that the Taoiseach is responsible for the conduct and actions of all his Ministers, forgetting about that in regard to the last fortnight or so, but one cannot say a company director who gives an instruction which is not carried out is entirely responsible for the frailty which exists in everybody, including members of his staff.  Therefore, I think my amendment provides an absolute precaution whereby an innocent person would not be held up to public odium for something that occurred in an organisation under his control in relation to which he himself had no direct part and in regard to which he had almost certainly issued an instruction to ensure it would not occur.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Donegan suggests is all very fine but may I ask who in the company will take responsibility for negligence in such a case?  As the Deputy says, it may be that the person in charge is not actually responsible for some negligence or some change in routine, a departure from the formal rules in the job.  Where does the buck stop? Who exactly will be held responsible? Is Deputy Donegan suggesting some grade employee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary's question is covered under section 7 of the Bill.  I have a great deal of sympathy for the case envisaged by Deputy Donegan.  I know my predecessor said this in reply to the discussion on Second Reading and suggested that if the Deputy put down an amendment he would look at it seriously.  I would be inclined to oppose this amendment from the point of view that it is taking the teeth out of the Bill and providing a &ldquo;let off&rdquo; in a great number <Col N="2043" /> of circumstance.  If this were written into the Bill one could expect that in 90 per cent of the cases the defence would be that it was a mistake.</P>
      <P>On Second Reading the Deputy mentioned the question of a machine going out of order.  If this type of excuse is provided to the justice and pretty well substantiated, there is no guilty intent and it would be pretty hard for myself, my agents or the local authority to establish the case.  I am wondering does the Deputy seriously feel that it is necessary for the protection of the person involved to have this amendment incorporated in the Bill.  I am not seriously opposed to it but, even without the amendment being written into the Bill, the case envisaged by the Deputy is very hard to imagine&mdash;the justice who had very strong feeling in connection with short weight taking it out on the person who presented that defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation envisaged by the Minister is one in which everyone would be trying to get out on this amendment and it would take a whole series of perjuries to bring this about.  For example, if a company director was responsible for a packing house&mdash;which is probably the place where many of these offences will occur&mdash;and if he had wilfully told the foreman to pack every package one ounce short and the foreman had told the girls or the men who were packing the articles to do so, there would have to be a whole series of perjuries before a person could get out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be more likely that a machine would go out of order.  The foreman or the forelady might be negligent in not checking the machine as instructed, perhaps once every hour.  People get bored doing that sort of thing.  The foreman might have instructed the packers to do it and they did not.  Then, would it be fair and right that the company director who knew nothing about this, and who was out trying to raise a few more overdrafts from the bank manager, should be guilty under this Bill, should be so named and, in fact, subject to this pretty heavy penalty?  I agree with the Minister that the likelihood is that he <Col N="2044" /> would not have this penalty visited upon him and if he had he would probably get away on appeal.</P>
    <P>In business one's reputation is important. The confidence the public have in a company is very important. The goodwill of companies has been sold for thousands and thousands of pounds.  The standing of a company is highly important.  It could be a far greater penalty to lose that goodwill than to have to pay a heavy fine.  I am grateful to the Minister for his approach to this matter but I think it is necessary to have this safeguard.  You can find this in other legislation.  For the purpose of seeing that an innocent person is not found guilty a good defence is defined.  This runs right through all our legislation.  You cannot say that the superintendent of this House should be criticised severely if someone does not brush out the floor some morning.  If the House becomes filthy after three months it is quite obvious that whoever has the duty to instruct the people who clean it has been negligent in not instructing them to do so.</P>
    <P>If something happens which constitutes an offence without a senior person knowing about it, it should be a good defence if the senior person can prove that the offence was due to a mistake or an accident or some other cause beyond his control and that he took all reasonable precautions.  I should like to see on the wall of every packing house a set of regulations stating that machines have to be tested every so often so that the people working there would know what their duties were.  If the Minister could see his way to accepting this amendment it would help to allay the fears of the Confederation of Irish Industries and it would augur well for the future of the Minister.</P>

      <P>That would cover a retailer or a wholesaler who would have purchased it from a manufacturer or imported it already packed.  I find it difficult to resist the Deputy's amendment because of the manner in which <Col N="2045" /> he finally presented it.  We are now on Committee Stage.  I am rather nervous about the amendment which suggests that it shall be a good defence to say there was a mistake.  This seems to take the teeth out of the Bill.  I would prefer if the amendment read, &ldquo;that the commission of the offence was due to some cause beyond his control ...&rdquo; leaving out &ldquo;a mistake or to an accident or ... other ...&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1970 : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before proceeding to the detailed provisions of the Bill, I feel I should make some general comment to place these proposals in perspective.</P>
      <P>My responsibility as Minister for Industry and Commerce relates to the industrial development and housing activities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited and any other function it may carry out except those concerned with tourism and aviation which are within the province of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, in connection with the overall review of the whole industrialisation programme, my predecessor announced that the company would function as an organ of industrial development within the Limerick-Clare-North Tipperary region&mdash;known as the mid-west region&mdash;having due regard to the overall national responsibilities assigned to the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision was intended to satisfy within the area a need that exists for services to assist industrial development at regional level.  The services to be provided by the company will, I hope, assist the redevelopment and expansion of existing industry; bring about better co-operation and use of initiative by local and regional groups and stimulate <Col N="2049" /> linkage and mutual customer relationships between existing and new industries and services.  The company will also have the task of increasing the effectiveness of the facilities being provided for development of small industry.</P>
    <P>The mid-west region is important as a key location in the west of Ireland, capable of development to a degree which would counter-balance the attractions of the eastern area for people and for business enterprises.  Limerick-Shannon has already a considerable industrial base that is suitable for planned expansion so as to stimulate and create opportunities for enterprise and employment in the region and contribute to the reduction of emigration and the improvement of social conditions in the whole area.</P>
    <P>The proven expertise of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited in the promotion and development of industry and amenity should be a great asset to the mid-west. SFADCO was incorporated as a limited liability company in 1959.  Its functions are as authorised by its memorandum and articles and the State is the sole shareholder.  Consequently the Acts relating to the company from 1959 onwards merely authorise the appropriate Minister to grant sums for specified current uses and the issue of share capital and repayable advances by the Minister for Finance for capital purposes.  This practice is followed in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The objectives adopted by the company in 1959 were related to the safeguarding of the airport and its employment potential and were in short:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to develop an industrial estate alongside the airport for industries oriented towards air freight;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to develop warehousing facilities to encourage carriers to use the airport as a break-bulk centre;</P>
    <P>(iii)  to promote Shannon as a point of entry for tourists to Ireland, particularly to western areas, and to develop and encourage commercial and passenger air services to and through the airport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> The success, which has resulted from efforts generated largely by the company, is such that it is now possible to change the aim from that of maintaining an airport to using it as a major asset in regional economic development.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the company in the development of an industrial estate have attracted attention internationally as well as given us encouragement at home.  At a recent date, over 4,500 workers were employed on the estate and these comprised about 2,900 men and 1,600 women.</P>
    <P>The staff of the company itself, plus those employed at the airport, in community services, construction and other activities, accounted for the employment of a further 2,360.  At the moment there are 30 manufacturing firms from six countries, including Ireland, on the industrial estate and 17 servicing and warehousing concerns.  The net balance of trade arising from the industrial estate, exports less imports, was over £13 million in 1969 as compared with less than £3 million in 1964.  Industrial exports from the estate are about 20 per cent of national industrial exports. Up to the present capital expenditure by the company on industry and tourism is about £6½ million of which about 90 per cent has been spent on the industrial estate at the airport, about 9 per cent on industry in the region and 1 per cent on tourist amenities. In addition, something over £5 million has been expended on housing and on the creation of a Shannon community.</P>
    <P>The capital expenditure in so far as it relates to industry and tourism has been met out of share capital subscribed by the Minister for Finance and in so far as it relates to housing out of repayable advances made by the Minister for Finance and housing grants made by me.  In addition, the company receives grants-in-aid which are used to meet industrial, including training and equipment, grants at the airport and the company's running expenses. The total amount of grant-in-aid issued to the company up to March 31st, 1970, is about £4½ million and this can be broken down roughly to £2½ million for grants to industries <Col N="2051" /> and £2 million for the running expenses of the company.  In the selection of projects for the airport, the company has placed emphasis on the provision of worthwhile skilled employment, the maintenance of a proper balance between male and female workers, aiming towards 60 per cent male employment, and diversification of industry.  This policy, despite the few inevitable setbacks, has maintained the overall stability of employment at the airport.</P>
    <P>The achievement by the Shannon Company of an average of 450 new jobs a year has been due in no small part to the customs-free facilities and special tax concessions made available at the airport.  The company has also been aided by the very significant investment in infrastructure and housing. But the expertise and dedication of the management and staff has been a major factor in getting good results from whatever natural advantages were at their disposal.  I take this occasion and opportunity of complimenting the company and its team on their enthusiasm for the job in hand and on maintaining a consistently high level of achievement.</P>
    <P>The company has recognised that an integral part of the programme to develop an industrial estate at Shannon was the establishment of a strong resident community near the estate.  Because of the industrial development proposals for the remainder of the region, and the large commuter element in Shannon's work force, this objective has now assumed increased importance.  As the population expands, every effort is being made within the limits of the company's resources to provide essential facilities appropriate to the nature and size of the community.  Apart from the State investment of £5 million in housing and community services, already mentioned, there has been a private investment estimated at £½ million.  Speculative builders are already operating successfully at Shannon Airport and the company hopes shortly to complete negotiations with a property developer in relation to town centre developments. The company's present house building programme is designed to reach a population level of 6,000 by <Col N="2052" /> March, 1974.  This is an achievable target on the basis of the current annual rate of construction.  There were at a recent date 877 completed company houses and 187 under construction at the airport to which private enterprise had added 66 completed houses and 34 under construction. The Shannon town population now exceeds 3,000 persons and its natural growth plus the expected influx should reach the set targets in due time.</P>
    <P>Planning for Shannon must, of course, now be related to industrial planning for the region as a whole. The company, with the full co-operation of the local authorities and of the regional development organisation, has already published a regional plan which represents its thinking on optimum development for industry and related matters in the region.  The publication of this plan was intended to stimulate comment on its implications. I understand that, following up-dating and examination of its capital budgeting, revisions in the plan will be made by the company from year to year.</P>
    <P>Certain action in the region does not have to await this detailed planning. Work has started at two industrial locations in Limerick city and a factory has been constructed for Scanglo Ltd. to establish an engineering operation at Newcastlewest.  The company's promotional work in attracting industry and in stimulating local initiatives in the region is, of course, a continuing process.</P>
    <P>The construction of factories and the attraction of firms forms only a part of the industrialisation drive.  Attention to the physical and social environment within which industry and workers must operate and to the provision of infrastructure is also essential.  Coordinated action by many bodies at local, regional and national levels is required before the company's efforts can bear fruit.  The co-operation forthcoming in the mid-west region is encouraging.</P>
    <P>The major new provision in this Bill is set out in section 2 which enables me, as Minister, to issue grants to the company for industrial promotional work in the region.  It includes a reference to the fact that regional <Col N="2053" /> activities are undertaken having regard to the general functions of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>The company's existing powers in relation to industry at the airport will not be diminished or otherwise affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 make it clear that industrial incentives in the region outside the airport will be payable by the Industrial Development Authority although the authority may delegate to the company powers to approve grants or other financial facilities in respect of industries in the region.</P>
    <P>Section 5, 6 and 7 are designed to make it clear, in the first place, that the conditions on which State finance has been provided for the erection and subsidisation of dwellings at the airport do not oblige the company to confine lettings to persons employed in the industrial estate and, in particular, do not imply that the widows and dependants of such persons or an unemployed worker cannot continue as tenants.  It had not, of course, been the policy of the company in the past to take such a strict view of their powers but the sections mentioned are deemed necessary to remove any doubts or anxieties which may exist.</P>
    <P>The conditions on which capital grants for housing were made to the company were related to general housing legislation and the payment of grants thereunder as it stood in 1963. Sections 6 and 7 also provide a necessary up-dating in the 1963 terminology to take account of revisions in the Housing Acts.  The effect, briefly, is to continue to make available to the company the housing grants and repayable advances in the manner to which it has heretofore been entitled.</P>
    <P>Previous legislation has set out the maximum amounts of financing which may be made available to the company under various heads for periods of about three years at a time.  The Act of 1968 made provision for the period up to about 31st March, 1971, on the basis of the company's then existing responsibilities. It was intended that any developments in the company's ex-additional financial arrangements for <Col N="2054" /> tended area of operations would be provided for in subsequent legislation.</P>
    <P>It is now necessary to extend the relevant maxima so as to provide for the financing of the company's regional industrial promotion, including the erection of factories for sale or rent as may be deemed appropriate in places in the region outside the airport.  It is intended in this Bill to provide for all the activities of the company in the period up to about March, 1973.</P>
    <P>The maximum amount which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company is at present fixed at £8 million and section 8 of this Bill provides for an increase of £9 million in the amount of such share capital which is used mainly for the provision of factories and ancillary works.</P>
    <P>Section 9 relates to the maximum amount of grants which may be provided to meet the running expenses of the company in respect of its activities at the airport and in the region, and to enable the company to give grants and other assistance to manufacturing industry at the airport.</P>
    <P>The total amount of grant-in-aid which may be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or in respect of tourism and aviation activities by the Minister for Transport and Power, is being increased from £6 million to £10 million.  In this connection, I should explain that a substantial part of the company's running expenses arises from tourism promotion and that this is now met by a special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Transport and Power is accountable but which, nevertheless, comes within the overall limitation in section 9 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill relates to repayable advances by the Minister for Finance to the company in relation to the provision of houses and community services at the airport.  The aggregate of such advances is being increased by £3 million from the existing limit of £7 million to £10 million.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 11 my predecessor was advised at the time of the making of Statutory Instrument No. 219 of 1968, which transferred to my <Col N="2055" /> Department the ministerial functions in relation to the activities of the company, other than tourism and aviation, that the relevant portions of the Ministers and Secretaries Acts do not clearly avail to adapt the principal Act in the manner necessary to achieve the desired transfer of consequential functions.  Accordingly, section 11 is designed to clarify the manner in which certain formal matters relating to the reports and accounts of the company and to approval of pension schemes shall be carried out.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are self-explanatory and are in the usual form; they relate to the date of commencement, meeting expenses out of voted moneys and legal citations.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring these provisions into operation by Order very shortly after their enactment since the company is already engaged in regional work in anticipation of the necessary legislative approval.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the House will agree with me as to the suitability of the company as an active agent in industrial promotion on a regional basis and in setting guidelines for regional expansion and co-operation in this country.  I have no hesitation in recommending this measure to the House as one which will produce tangible benefits in terms of standard of living, reduction in emigration, and improved living conditions generally, not alone directly in the mid-west region but, by its influence and example, throughout the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather interesting to find that, for a different reason, the Fianna Fáil Government have succeeded in producing an infrastructure for industry in a situation where industry will develop without their planning for it, in fact having rejected all the advice they got on planning for industry right back as far as 1964 when the National Industrial and Economic Council recommended that there should be growth centres and a declaration of where the growth centres should be, that there should be planning for these growth centres, that roads and other services should be provided through the local authorities and the <Col N="2056" /> Department to serve these growth centres.  The Shannon Development Company started with the object in mind of saving Shannon Airport, a most laudable object, but it brought willy-nilly the infrastructure for that type of modern development in industry for which my party were shouting as far back as 1964 and which is included in our policy for a Just Society which was first announced in detailed form in 1965.</P>
      <P>Since then Fianna Fáil have resisted our efforts to get them to declare where these growth centres should be, and the only progress in this regard is the small development at Galway and Waterford, when there should have been a regionalised development all over the country, backed up by the local authorities and the State Department in relation to the necessary infrastructure.</P>
      <P>We are delighted that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is succeeding and that there is such expansion there.  It has the advantage that it is building up the airport which is of great value not only to our industry but to our tourism.</P>
      <P>The building of houses for workers is something we want to see happening. I have always felt, I know not why, that when there was good housing the workers were there, that when there was good housing, living standards were good and that the mental and behavioural standards of the young people were good.  The industries seemed to come naturally after that. We have never seen a provincial town or city where there were empty houses; people cannot live in houses if they cannot get jobs.  Therefore it is laudable and proper that this Bill provides for increasing the number of houses available not only to workers but to other people if they feel so inclined.</P>
      <P>The increase in the amount of money the company are permitted to have from the Minister for Finance is in keeping with the provisions of other legislation for State companies.  Money must be pumped in if industry is to be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the provision of an average of 450 new jobs a year is quite satisfactory.  The amount of money <Col N="2057" /> they cost is extraordinary.  I referred last week to the amount of money it took to keep an extra 4,000 people in employment last year.  The figure was £23 million.  A total of 12,000 people left agriculture, so that the figure for new jobs that have to be provided would produce this net result of 16,000 new jobs.  When you divide 16,000 into £23 million in grants, apart from other incentives that are given, you start to realise how much capital is needed.</P>
    <P>As I said last week, there is a false statistic in everything, and if I were to point to the false statistic in this tonight it would be that every job creates another job, and for every person on a production line producing goods there are other people producing services for them whether they be services to provide them with recreation or the necessities of life.  Therefore it cannot be put down at so many pounds to create one job.</P>
    <P>I believe this sort of planning must be developed all over the country.  We on this side of the House have no intention of holding up this legislation and we wish the Minister well in the promotion of this project.</P>
    <P>The extension of the area in which the Shannon Free Airport Development Company would operate was first announced by the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley prior to a by-election. However, that is no criticism. Whether it was stated at such a time or for any other reason is of little consequence. The principle is right and the whole development for industry along regionalised lines is absolutely necessary. It might lose the Government votes in Leitrim if they were to announce that the growth centre would be in Sligo rather than in Leitrim, but it is necessary to say it. It is better for a man to have to move to Sligo from Leitrim than to have to move to Birmingham from Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I remember a few years ago being in Birmingham and trying to get a grain dryer from a company who were late with their delivery.  I was sitting in the office of the works manager while he made five or six phone calls to various companies within a mile or two of him, <Col N="2058" /> in Birmingham, to suppliers of equipment like compressors, switches, thermostat controls and various other things which his company did not make.  All these parts were being made within a few miles of one another.  At the end of one conversation he arranged to have a chat on his way home with the person who was supplying one component part.</P>
    <P>In this way one can see how over the centuries industry was built up in England.  One industry in an area very often became dependent on and complementary to another.  This particular type of regionalisation should come about here for another and different reason.  The saving of Shannon airport is a good development and will create and multiply industries in addition to the one which the Minister actually gets and to which he gives a grant and establishes in the area.</P>
    <P>For this reason we on this side of the House are very pleased to give such passage through the House of this Bill as the Minister desires, unless something comes up in the debate which might raise doubts as to any work on the Committee Stage.  We regard this as a good Bill, a necessary development and one which we would hope to see the Minister putting into effect by regulation as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>All parties in the House are agreed on the necessity to industrialise these areas.  Shannon has been a successful experiment.  An area, easily measurable, which did not have any industrial investment to speak of now employs the number mentioned in the Minister's speech&mdash;about 4,000. The average rate of 450 new jobs a year in that area is a pretty good achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has, of course, been at the expense of very large State investment. In 1968, the then Minister, Deputy Childers, spoke about the importance of building up a community in the area and the amount of cash that would need to be invested in the social infrastructure, houses and so on.  It is rather disappointing that private builders have not contributed and have not participated in this matter to any great extent.  There was mention <Col N="2059" /> in 1968 by the then Minister of a private builder coming in.  Is there reference in the Minister's speech to it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The State investment of £5 million in housing and community services must be compared with a private investment of only £½ million.  So the State has been involved in very heavy capital investment here in housing and services and there has not been the same contribution on the part of private investors to this heavy cost.</P>
      <P>We have learned enough about industrialisation now to know that in building up large-scale industry in an area it is very important to build up a community.  There has been certain criticism in the Press over recent months that the Shannon town to some extent was a town without a heart, a town that had no community centre.  The residents in the town have energetically set about changing this state of affairs, to give the place some community life, but it is still a big problem.  The criticism has been made that there is no natural centre to the new Shannon town, in other words, that it is a place that has no life, although there are people living there. Previous Ministers have recognised as an important problem, something to be surmounted in bringing industry to an area, the necessity to create a living organ environment in an area without an industrial tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon is an area that has been marked to some extent by bad industrial relations.  We hope it has outlived this phase in its history.  I think the Governments of the day were largely responsible for this state of affairs because the companies which did not understand our system of industrial relations before coming in to set up the industries had not been adequately briefed as to how we conducted negotiations on behalf of employees. At least it could be said that in the investment offices and the Government offices, the IDA, and so on, the word had gone out, evidently, to go soft in dealing with foreign investors in the matter of how we organised our <Col N="2060" /> employees.  The comment could be made fairly that the management subsequently made wrong decisions, acted in a fashion more in the traditions of the country that they came from than in those of the country in which they established the industries.  I hope that has been corrected now and that industrialists coming to the area are given full information about our practices in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Shannon industrial development was seen to be an integral part of a whole industrialisation policy in this mid-western region.  The Minister, even at this stage, can point to very little achievement in the surrounding area.  Newcastle West is mentioned and one other place in Limerick city.  This is an important aspect of the company's work.  While the Minister states that it is an important part of their objective that they promote industry in the region, there is little to show for it so far outside of the Shannon complex itself.</P>
    <P>It is not socially desirable that workers in this area should travel, by car, bus or otherwise, 50 or 60 miles to their work.  It is important that over the entire region industries are built up contiguous to the people's homes.  One cannot plan adequately in the area unless one has agreed on the whole strategy of growth centres.  This Government show extraordinary reluctance to comment on this sensitive area.  It is fair to say that it is a sensitive area. Deputy Barrett will be very interested in knowing the details of such industrial strategy in that western region and there are Deputies from other parts of the House who will also be interested.</P>
    <P>In talking about providing employment, the Government can no longer rely on merely directing attention to specific areas without giving the whole country a chance to understand the overall strategy in regard to growth centres.  Whatever about the political risks involved&mdash;and the Government have been involved in political risks over the last few weeks&mdash;this is a matter that calls out for clarification at an early date.  I would suggest that the Minister has nothing to lose by being honest in this matter.  He should without delay give us some idea where <Col N="2061" /> Shannon fits into the overall strategy on industrial growth policy.</P>
    <P>The Limerick region is an area which has needed the injection of Shannon.  We have had undertakings that Limerick city itself would be involved in the industrialisation drive in the surrounding regions, because as the Mayor, Deputy Coughlan, could tell you, Limerick is a place that has suffered a great deal from being deprived of industry and which has long been neglected by the Government in the matter of the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>The main point, then, is that while hoping the development of the company continues, I would say that there is a great amount of State investment in this region.  Apparently there is not a commensurate investment from private sources and this imbalance in investment in the area must be corrected. The State cannot indefinitely pay out these large sums of money and more must be provided from private sources.  While there has been progress in jobs in the locality it has been at a heavy price in the amount of cash that is being put into the area by the State.  Of course, there is one bright point in this in regard to our trading policy in the future and that is that most of the goods are exported from the area which means that the companies are competing with firms in other countries and therefore they are more efficient.  It is important, however, that the State should attempt more and more to involve private investment in the locality both in the provision of houses, in which we are presently very heavily committed, and also of services and the industries already set up in the area must more and more take on this responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers I also welcome the expansion and scope of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company throughout the region for the setting up of further industries.  The success of SFADCO speaks for itself in this regard and I am sure we can look forward to a bright industrial future in the region.  With regard to a point made by Deputy O'Leary about industrial <Col N="2062" /> unrest I do not agree with him at all.  There has been hardly any history of industrial unrest in the Shannon development area.  The only firm involved in any such unrest was the EI company and that matter has been resolved for two or more years. At that time it was emphasised over and over again by the then Minister for Labour that companies coming to the area were always warned it was Government policy that they should encourage their employees to join trade unions.  That was proved conclusively in statements at that time and therefore his contention is not at all borne out by the history of the development.</P>
      <P>In regard to the housing area, the Minister might have a good look at the situation.  This has been a very expanding community there for a number of years and, as one who has attended many meetings and listened to the complaints of the people in the area, I should like to impress on the Minister that a great feeling of frustration exists and that the people feel they are not allowed to be sufficiently involved in the running of their own town.  I would not suggest that they should have a great say in the planning of industries, tourism, <i>et cetera</i>, which are other functions of the company, but they should have some representation on the board of the company when matters concerning their own town are being discussed.  They feel this very much and I would ask the Minister to examine the matter to see if something could be done in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago they set up a community association which for a while was successful; they used to elect their own mayor every year and make representations to the company about various matters, but they found that this exercise was of such little consequence that less than 12 months ago they disbanded.  They were frustrated in all their efforts to gain any of the concessions to which they felt they were entitled.  They are not completely unappreciative of the work that has been done there, the building of houses and of the facilities made available to them, but they feel there is room for <Col N="2063" /> a great deal of improvement in this sphere.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>The matter of investment by private building companies was mentioned by Deputy O'Leary.  The reason for the lack of this investment is that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company acquired all the lands in the surrounding area over a period of years and private building firms have not been encouraged to build in the area.  They have of course always let the building of houses by contract.  No later than yesterday it appeared in the press that a Dublin firm, Sisk and Company, have been successful in their tender for a big shopping complex which is planned for this community centre.  I also notice that a Dublin firm of auctioneers and agents were appointed for the letting of the shops and space in this centre.  I have no objection to an auctioneering firm doing this, whether it is from Dublin or Cork or elsewhere, but the company should have the major say in who will be renting these premises.  There were some lettings by tender in the past and one of the complaints of the people was that firms from far away were successful while there were enterprising people in the community who would have set up different types of businesses and given more facilities to the people living there rather than having them travel to Ennis, Limerick and far distant places for simple everyday needs.</P>
    <P>We welcome the building of this shopping complex, which is a further advancement in the area, and we look forward to its success.  We all admire the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and their achievements and we look forward to further achievements throughout Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary.  If they do nearly as well there as they have done in the Shannon area there will be little or no unemployment or emigration in the region in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the extension of the activities at Shannon to the mid-western region, which includes the whole of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary.  Listening <Col N="2064" /> to the speeches made by speakers from Fine Gael and Labour one could not but reflect on their attitude to Shannon some years ago.  The dream of Shannon becoming a major airport was laughed to scorn and indeed the first inter-Party Government did everything they could in 1948 and in subsequent years when Fianna Fáil were in power, to decry industrial development of any form, or any form of development, at Shannon Airport, or indeed the development of our airways across the Atlantic.  However, what a delightful picture was painted this evening of the area&mdash;4,500 people gainfully employed, a volume of trade that earns in addition to goods coming in and going out, some £13 million a year.</P>
      <P>Now the Department of Industry and Commerce is being charged with responsibility for developing the whole of this mid-west region.  How lucky that region is to have this infrastructure of experience already there.  They are lucky to have the management and skill so vital to development in any region and it is lucky that the Government over the years saw fit to preserve Shannon.  There were people who had visions of rabbits running around the runways there.  Shannon was abandoned at a time when it was regarded as futile for Irish people to think of an international airline.  Apparently the idea was that we were just so many peasants fitted only to provide a work force for other countries.  The initiative of the Government in 1957 and down through the years since has brought us now to this moment in time at which we have this magnificent industrial development at Shannon and, indeed, industrial development throughout the rest of the country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps this is the right time at which to ask if we are progressing in the right direction.  I venture to suggest to the Minister that in any development in the mid-west there should be more Irish participation and I would urge that he emphasises to the Industrial Development Authority that this should be the policy.  There is in Ireland today the money and the ability.  There is a need for more Irish participation.  I should like to see the IDA asking for part of the equity <Col N="2065" /> instead of giving all the money by way of grant.  I should like them to insist on more and more Irish participation. In that way we could provide greater security and continued development.</P>
    <P>One must remember the trend of aircraft development in this connection. In planning a town of 6,000 population one has to think of the effect of, say, jumbo jets on such a community.  The forecast is that Shannon will be the major airport in Europe in the future and perhaps our planners might consider limiting the number of people living in close proximity to such an airport.  That might inhibit development there to some degree.  Actually, where Shannon is concerned, the aircraft fly out to sea and the residents could be so housed as to minimise for them any nuisance from aircraft coming into or going out from Shannon.</P>
    <P>I hope that the proposed development areas in the mid-west will encourage people to play their part in attracting industries to their particular neighbourhood.  Shannon could become a centre of rapid industrial development. I know that potential industrialists like areas in which they can have their own pool of labour and in which they can provide the facilities to train own pool of labour.  I should like this to be encouraged because it would prevent large concentrations of people in large population centres.  I do not think anyone cares a great deal for densely populated areas. A wider dispersal of people is the goal to aim at.  People can live much happier lives in smaller communities.</P>
    <P>The social amenities at Shannon are excellent.  Irish towns suffer from a certain barrenness from the point of view of relaxation amenities.  Amenities are developing rapidly at Shannon. This is a very welcome development. A great deal has been achieved in a very short time at no colossal expense. It is not unusual today to invest £16,000 to provide one job.  To see what is being achieved here with something like £6 million by way of grant and aid is very gratifying indeed. In addition to the permanent workers there are 2,360 casual workers coming into the building industry there and <Col N="2066" /> into other jobs.  That is a tremendous boon to the region.  Ultimately it will benefit the entire country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish it a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  It is a logical development arising out of the decision to re-align the functions of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  Hitherto the Shannon Free Airport Development Company was under the control of the Department of Transport and Power for practically everything.  It was decided at some stage to separate the functions into two clear categories and to give responsibility for industrial development in Shannon to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I agree wholeheartedly with that decision. Indeed I advocated it on several occasions in debates here.  I was critical of the fact that there were too many agencies and too many organisations involved in industrial development.  It is only right and proper that responsibility for industrial development should rest with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from legalising the new arrangement regarding SFADCO this Bill also gives new responsibility to the company in that it now has a function in promoting industrial developments in Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary as well as at the airport.  I note, according to the Minister's speech and various sections of the Bill, that SFADCO will only have responsibility for giving grants in respect of industries established at the airport.  It will not have authority or power to make grants for new industries in Limerick, Clare or North Tipperary.  That will still be the function of the Industrial Development Authority.  It is provided in the Bill that SFADCO may make a recommendation in respect of grants to the Industrial Development Authority.  I have no very strong views on this but I wonder whether it might be a better idea, and something which would really make the whole concept of regionalisation work well, if SFADCO had full responsibility for determining <Col N="2067" /> the amount of grants and other financial assistance available to new industries in all parts of this region.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason for confining SFADCO in the making of grants because the only power it has had, and will have, in regard to paying grants is in respect of industries that will be established at the airport.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, will throw some light on this.  This applies particularly to sections 2 and 3 of the Bill where provision is made for payments of grants to SFADCO and, in regard to section 3, where it is provided that the company cannot make grants to industrial undertakings other than at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The main thing emerging from the Bill is that SFADCO has now been given responsibility for promoting industrial development in a much wider area which has come to be known as the mid-west.  As the Minister rightly states, this is a very important region. I particularly welcome the fact that SFADCO will now have responsibility for industrial development in Limerick city and county and also in Clare and North Tipperary.  This is something which I have personally advocated since I became a Member of the House in 1961 in every debate relating to Shannon Airport.  I recall asking questions of the then Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, as to the possibility of assigning additional functions to SFADCO.  I could never understand why that company should have been confined purely to the airport area.  There were certain difficulties in the way, I understand, certain vested interests, and it was not possible to give the company these additional functions. While this Bill legalises these new functions of the company, that company has been exercising these functions for some time past, for over 12 months, and I am glad that already the results of the work of SFADCO are noticeable particularly in Newcastle West, to which the Minister referred, where new industrial development is taking place and where one or two new industries have been established and others are in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Industrial Estate has been a tremendous advantage to the <Col N="2068" /> mid-western region.  I am very conscious of this and I have not been ashamed to acknowledge it because so many people, in Limerick particularly, are employed at Shannon.  It is reckoned that about 65 per cent or 66 per cent of those employed at Shannon reside in Limerick city or very near it.  We in Limerick have a tremendous interest in the welfare of Shannon.  While acknowledging the advantages of the airport and the industrial estate to Limerick it can also be said that the existence of the industrial estate at Shannon, with all its infrastructure of special concessions, special incentive grants and so on, has meant in recent years that any industrialist contemplating establishing an industry in the Limerick/Clare Tipperary district was naturally attracted to Shannon Airport rather than, say, to Limerick city.  We are well aware of this and we know that industrialists who originally considered Limerick city as a location, for example, naturally crossed the Shannon because the grants were far greater there.  There were advance factories waiting for occupation there and, from the point of view of financial assistance, buildings ready for occupation and the speed with which the industry could get into production, there was every advantage in going to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The result has been that the mid-western region has not fared so well as regards obtaining new industries. I agree entirely with what Deputy Gallagher said a while ago about Limerick city.  It should be the focal point for new industrial development but we suffered in recent years from the disadvantage of not having serviced industrial sites nor advanced factory buildings and the fact that the grants applicable to industry in Limerick were less than those applying at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that this Bill will have the effect of levelling out and doing away with this differential in grants and incentives.  I particularly urge on the Minister the desirability of having the same rate of grant applied in all parts of the mid-western region.  I have been requested to make and stress this point.  Whether an industrialist decides to set up at <Col N="2069" /> Nenagh, Ennis or Limerick city or Shannon Airport the same grants and incentives should apply.  In recent years we had experience of an industrialist being interested in a certain town in the region but because he was unable to get the same grants and incentives as he got at Shannon he did not go there or to Shannon; and in some cases industries were definitely lost to the region and, in certain instances, to the country altogether.</P>
    <P>It is vitally essential that in the case of the new industrial estates in Limerick, Newcastle West&mdash;and I presume there will be advance factory buildings provided in Nenagh, and Ennis and various other towns&mdash; the same rate of grant and the same incentives will apply so that an industrialist will have a wide choice in the mid-western region.  I do not want to be parochial about this, or to claim any special concession for my home town or for our city of Limerick. All we want is an opportunity to compete on fair terms with other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that a large number of people employed at Shannon have to travel long distances to work.  This, of course, is a fact.  I should like clarification on this again.  I understand it is the intention to develop Shannon as a town with a population of 6,000 people.  I read a statement in the papers this morning from the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in relation to the development of a town and a community centre at Shannon.  I am surprised that this type of statement should appear in the newspapers on the same day as the Minister responsible is coming in here to introduce a Bill.  The Minister's statement contains little or no information in relation to the points raised by Deputy Barrett regarding the development of a new town with new services and housing <i>et cetera</i>.  These are very important factors.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the regionalisation of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary is a pilot scheme in many ways&mdash;and, of course, it is in line with the Buchanan Report&mdash;it is vitally important that, if it is to be regarded as a guideline, as the Minister said, for regional development in other <Col N="2070" /> parts of the country, every effort should be made to ensure that it works out properly.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>This decision was intended to satisfy within the area a need that exists for services to assist industrial development at regional level.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more.  There is very great need in this particular region. It is a region that was greatly neglected in the matter of industrial development. Time and time again people have asked how it is that Limerick city which has every natural advantage for industrial development&mdash;a port, a large labour pool, and so forth, and all the amenities of a modern city&mdash;has not been able to attract more industry in recent times. In my opinion the reason is that the incentives to industrialists to set up in Limerick bore no comparison to the incentives available at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I want further clarification.  The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>The company will also have the task of increasing the effectiveness of the facilities being provided for development of small industry.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the development of small industry.  I have the distinction of being the first Deputy who advocated the establishment of a special agency to promote small industries.  I have a particular and personal interest in this because of the fact that the man who helped to set up the small industries section in the Minister's Department was our former county manager, Mr. T.M. O'Connor.</P>
    <P>I want clarification on a very important point.  When the Minister's predecessor was speaking on the Budget debate he announced that new regulations were about to be introduced regarding the qualification of small industries for grants.  Up to now a small industry was regarded as one that gave employment to a maximum of 20 people.  If I wished to establish an industry employing 15 people in my home town I would get in touch with the small industries section of the Department of Industry and Commerce or the IDA.  From the Minister's <Col N="2071" /> statement it would appear that, as far as the development of small industries in the mid-west region is concerned, this function will now be exercised wholly or partly by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I am not too happy about this to be quite honest.</P>
    <P>I have already commented on the fact that too many agencies are involved in industrial development.  In the mid-west region no fewer than five different agencies will be involved in the development of industry.  We have the Industrial Development Authority exercising an overall function.  We have the Shannon Free Airport Development Company exercising complete authority in the matter of allocation and payment of grants at the airport and having now the added responsibility of promoting industry in the mid-west region.  We also have the regional development organisation. What functions will that have?  It is under the aegis of the Minister's Department. What precise function will the regional development organisation have?  We also have the county development teams and the small industry division in the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter with the Minister's predecessor here in the House on several occasions.  The most recent debate that took place here on industrial development was in relation to the restructuring of the Industrial Development Authority arising from the Arthur Little Report.  I questioned the Minister's predecessor on this very point.  I asked him to define clearly the responsibilities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the Industrial Development Authority, the regional development organisation, the county development teams and the small industries division of the Department. The Minister's predecessor assured me that, when the time came to introduce this Bill extending the responsibilities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the functions of these different organisations would be clearly defined.  There is a passing reference to every one of them in the Minister's statement but no explanation is given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> I assisted in proposals for two or three small industries and one or two large industries and I had the experience of having to bring a prospective industrialist to the IDA, to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, to the small industries division and to the regional development organisation. I apologise, Sir.  I am not quite sure whether I have the right name.  I am referring to the new organisation with headquarters in Limerick city.  I think it has overall development responsibility. It has responsibility for developments other than purely industrial developments.</P>
    <P>That is five separate agencies.  I am not saying that one or other or any of these should be abolished.  I said I have experience of dealing with every one of them.  I have never been ashamed or afraid to pay tribute to any organisation or officials who have been of assistance.  I have received the utmost assistance and co-operation from every one of these people.  I could not but be rather amazed at the duplication and triplication of responsibilities and at the lack of clearly-defined functions.  Foreign industrialists, particularly, do not like to be referred from one organisation to another.</P>
    <P>What will be the future role of development teams and the regional development officers?  I questioned the Minister's predecessor on this during the Budget debate a few weeks ago when dealing with the programme for the expansion of small industries.  He said the functions would clearly be defined.  He did not think there would be any clash of interests.  However, it has been stated, and repeated on a number of occasions, that there is a clear clash now between the Department of Finance, who are responsible for the county development officers, and the Department of Industry and Commerce, who will be responsible for the regional development officers.  I am completely in favour of SFADCO's having responsibility for the development of industry in this region.  I firmly agree with what the Minister said about the utilisation of the expertise of SFADCO in the promotion and development of industry.  It would indeed be a great asset to the mid-west.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> The industrial division of SFADCO has been responsible for pioneering an entirely new concept of industrial development&mdash;the concept of industrial estates.  I can pay tribute to the proven expertise of the people responsible for industrial promotion in the Shannon area.  I am slightly afraid that this Bill and, in particular, the Minister's opening statement do not go far enough inasmuch as he is not clearly defining the functions of the different agencies. I am sure the Minister sees my point. SFADCO will have a certain responsibility for the development of small industries in this region.  This is very complex.  I should like to see SFADCO with overall responsibility so far as industry and grants are concerned at Shannon Airport, Limerick city, Nenagh and all the other relevant areas.  I consider that the small industries division of the Minister's Department should be allowed to continue to promote small industry in all parts of the country.  I think it has been a tremendous success.  They now have the expertise and the knowledge of the special difficulties associated with the establishment of small industries.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the original Bill establishing SFADCO in 1959 are different from the present objectives. The main aim then was to safeguard the airport and its employment.  We are now aiming at using the airport as a major asset in regional development. I am reminded of the propaganda from the Minister's Department at every general election down the years in the Limerick region.  Deputy Coughlan and myself, when we were first elected in 1961, remember Fianna Fáil speakers saying that the future of Limerick depended on the future of Shannon Airport. I always held that the opposite was the case and that the future of Shannon Airport depended on the development, industrially and touristwise, of the entire mid-western region. I am glad this region will now be developed.  It has tremendous potential and natural advantages&mdash;an international airport, the port of Limerick, the great undeveloped natural asset of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, referring to the employment on the Shannon Industrial <Col N="2074" /> Estate, that there are 30 manufacturing firms from six countries, including Ireland, and 17 servicing and warehousing concerns.  In the light of our possible entry into EEC, it is very significant that, in addition to the establishment at Shannon of manufacturing enterprises, the possibilities of setting up large warehousing facilities was recognised and, up to now, 17 servicing and warehousing concerns have been established at the airport.  Concern has been expressed by certain people, in that if and when we become members of the EEC this may affect the present incentive available at Shannon for industrial development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this question on the Adjournment having asked several questions in relation to whether a port authority should have been established at Whiddy Island and port and tonnage dues levied on ships coming there with their cargoes of crude oil.</P>
      <P>I asked a question on the 8th April, 1970, which was answered by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lalor, for the Minister for Transport and Power. At column 976, Volume 245, of the Official Report he replied:</P>
      <P>Under international usage no payment may be exacted from shipping for the use of territorial waters and anchoring therein except in consideration of special services rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This right does not apply to internal waters which include bays <Col N="2075" /> and natural inlets of the sea such as Bantry Bay.  Under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, however, the right of innocent passage for foreign ships in those areas of our inland waters which had previously been considered part of the territorial seas or of the high seas is preserved.</P>
    <P>I want to say, first of all, that there is no question of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, raising any question at all of anchoring or the discharge of goods.  As far as I can see, section 5 of that Act refers merely to the free passage of innocent ships, ships that are carrying normal merchandise or passengers which were entitled to pass through these waters before regulations were prescribed or a base line defined under this particular Act.  It has nothing whatever to do with the docking of a ship, the unloading of a ship, the transfer of goods on to Irish soil or the transfer of goods from Irish soil, or passengers, in any one way. That disposes of the reference to the Maritime Jurisdiction Act.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the House to replies given to me on February 26th, 1970.  I want to stay completely in order and, therefore, I am reverting to the fact that in the reply to the question of April 8th I was told that no port dues could be levied.  The Minister for Transport and Power on February 26th answered his own questions, and made it quite clear that any natural advantages held in a harbour or outside a harbour by a State, and by this State in particular, could not be a reason why port or tonnage dues could be levied.  I quote from column 1809 of Volume 244, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: That is in respect of the lease of the foreshore to the company concerned.  Dues are collected by harbour authorities in respect of installations, which they have provided.  The installations, in this case, at a cost of £10 million have been provided by the company themselves.</P>
    <P>At column 1810 Deputy Lenihan says:</P>
    <P>At the risk of repeating myself, may I say that harbour dues in every <Col N="2076" /> country in the world, including Ireland, are in respect of facilities and installations provided by a harbour authority for the benefit of firms using that particular harbour area and dues are collected in respect of such usage.  In this case, all the harbour facilities were provided by the company concerned at a cost of £10 million.  What we are talking about, in terms of a rent, is rent in respect of virgin land under the Foreshore Act which was made available to this company.</P>
    <P>That refers to the nominal rent of £7,000 a year for the foreshore at Whiddy Island.</P>
    <P>I want to take as my main point the fact that harbour dues are charged in this country on the anchoring of ships and the discharge of goods where nothing is provided but natural facilities. I want to quote from the publication laying down tonnage rates and goods rates levied by the Dublin Port and Docks Board in respect of vessels and goods in the harbours of Dublin. Skerries, and Balbriggan, dated 1st October, 1958, which I understand is still in use except for changes in the actual rate in pence or shillings for the tonnage rate on the goods or the tonnage rate on the ship.  The special rate which refers to the anchoring of a large vessel not alongside and where no dredging was ever done&mdash;because no dredging could be done in an area which on the chart gives a depth of as much as 50 or 60 fathoms or 300 feet&mdash;is at Part III&mdash;Exceptional Tonnage Rates&mdash;C.:</P>
    <P>Any vessel which for the purpose of landing and/or embarking passengers and their personal luggage and/or mails only enters within the limits of the Port of Dublin but does not enter the River Liffey or make use of the quays or wharfs of the port and</P>
    <P>(a)  does not load or discharge cargo (other than motor cars which are accompanied by their owners as passengers)... ... ¼d per ton.</P>
    <P>That is on the tonnage rate of the vessel, not on the goods because there are literally no goods, less than 10 tons and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> (b)  loads or discharges cargo not exceeding 10 tons inwards and/or 10 tons outwards (in addition to such motor cars as aforesaid) ?d. per ton.</P>
    <P>This is in respect of where less than 10 tons is unloaded.  Where large quantities of goods were unloaded, in this case from within the Port of Dublin, at a place where nothing but natural facilities were provided, as far as I can see from this booklet, if the full tonnage rate on the goods was not charged, a reduced charge would be made.  I would say the charge would be reduced because of the fact that people would have to use lighter or smaller ships to transfer the goods to a position along the quays.</P>
    <P>At Cork, where the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and various other huge passenger ships call but obviously do not enter the Port of Cork but anchor instead outside Cork, there is also a special tonnage rate.  Of course, at that point, where those large vessels put down their hooks the position is that there never was dredging because one cannot dredge a depth of 50 or 60 fathoms any more than one can dredge a depth of 26 fathoms on the installation at Whiddy Island.  I understand that at Cork, in the case, say, of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> calling and 20 or 30 passengers getting off and their luggage, a nominal amount of three-farthings per ton on the tonnage of the ship is charged.  One might think that is a small amount but a net tonnage charge of three-farthings on the <i>Universe Ireland</i> would cost precisely £400.</P>
    <P>I now move to the position in relation to the Cork County Manager and what he feels should happen in relation to Whiddy Island.  I would refer first of all to the fact that the Cork County Manager is the manager of, I think, the largest county in Ireland&mdash;certainly one of the most important.</P>

      <P>It is one of the most important county managerships there is and he was the youngest county manager ever appointed and is regarded as a man of the highest integrity and of great ability. I should like to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of March 16th, 1970, page 5:</P>
      <P>The Cork County Manager, Mr. Michael Conlon, wants the Department of Transport and Power to establish a harbour authority for Bantry Bay and to develop the pier, which he described as &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Gulf Oil, which employs 100 local men at the oil terminal, said the company was willing to pay harbour dues if a harbour authority was established&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is a very salient paragraph.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Mr. Conlon wants an authority so that anti-pollution measures can be taken in the bay.  He says: &ldquo;I believe that we should have some physical means of stopping and controlling oil pollution.  Milford Haven has two or three tugs on constant stand-by to deal with pollution on the spot.  Taking measures after pollution has occurred is not much good.</P>
      <P>The County Council's jurisdiction should be extended in Bantry Bay. This would mean payment of harbour dues, but Gulf Oil would, as users of the Bay, have large representation on the harbour authority and so would be protected from any excessive charges.</P>
      <P>More would be involved than money.  The existing facilities at Bantry pier are completely inadequate and, to my mind, dangerous. I feel a considerable capital sum should be spent on Bantry pier by the Government, and that the Cork ratepayers should not have to shoulder the cost.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2079" /> The point I want to make is that he says that an authority should be created and that port and tonnage dues should be levied.</P>
    <P>Now I want to deal with the position of port dues.  As far back as Christmas, 1968, I addressed a question to Deputy Erskine Childers who was then Minister for Transport and Power.  He felt he should not answer and then replied to me by letter, being one of our more courteous Ministers:</P>
    <P Just="Right">10 Nollaig, 1968.</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy Donegan,</P>
    <P>You recently addressed a Dáil question to me about the gross registered tonnage of the <i>Universe Ireland,</i> which was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle on the grounds that the subject matter of the question did not fall within my responsibilities. In the light of your interest in the matter I have, however, had enquiries made of the shipowners, who have advised me that the figure is 149,608 tons, according to the certificate of tonnage issued in the vessel's country of registry, Liberia. I am also informed that the net registered tonnage of the <i>Universe Ireland</i> is 128,257 tons.</P>
    <P>If the facility in respect of ten tons and a few passengers in Cork were afforded to this company in respect of the boat itself, the position would be that the net registered tonnage, that is, the space in which goods can be carried, making allowance for engine room and the rest of it, in the prescribed formula would cost, at three-farthings a ton £400 per trip.  I understand that there are six vessels, 312,000 tons of oil being carried in each vessel.  I would refer the House to the question I put to the Minister for Transport and Power on 21st November, 1968, in reference to the port and tonnage dues in the various ports for crude oil, heavy fuel oil, petroleum oil and so forth.  I do not want to weary the House by quoting. I have not the time anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the least personal about this.  I pointed out that <Col N="2080" /> the Minister and the Government are throwing away £1 million a year and I intend to prove it.  The range of goods rate per ton in Cork is from 4s 1d to 6s 6d for fuel oil other than paraffin and petroleum, 6s 6d in the case of crude oil, and light and medium fuel oil, 3s 3d.  If Gulf Oil have spent £10 million they should get a very good reduction and I propose that a minimal figure of 1s per ton should be levied.  This would cost £15,000 per ship or £96,000 per round trip of the fleet of six ships.  I do not know how many trips in the year they would do. I have studied some of the magazines in this regard&mdash;<i>Petroleum Times</i> is one &mdash;and I just do not know the length of time it takes to travel the 11,000 miles from Kuwait to Bantry, but I would think, taking into account a period of, say, two months in dock for repairs and maintenance in each year, and something more than ten trips of the fleet, my figure of £1,000,000 lost per year is not too far wide of the mark. I do not think I have been extravagant in suggesting a figure of 1s per ton.  In the <i>Petroleum Times</i> of November, 1968, which was the issue that dealt with the advent of Bantry they say at page 1715 that they would have no objection to paying port and tonnage dues if an authority was set up at Bantry Bay.</P>
      <P>I do not know what covert arrangement or what discussions took place between Government Ministers and Gulf Oil.  I do know that in Milfordhaven they are spending £12 million in order to accommodate ships with a two-thirds draught and half of this £12 million is being subscribed by three oil companies, BP, Esso Petroleum and Texaco, and the information I have is that it is proposed to charge full port and tonnage dues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that full port and tonnage dues should be charged at Bantry, but there is no reason why, as I suggest, the Government should lose £1 million a year in this way. There are only two places in the world where these ships can load and unload their full cargoes.  Having unloaded, if they want one-third off their tonnage, they can load at Rotherdam and, when Milfordhaven is completed, <Col N="2081" /> they can go there.  Those are all the places to which they can go in Europe. In Kuwait in order to load the oil they had to create an island ten miles out at sea and to run a 48-inch pipeline under water for ten miles.  Having done that they were able at an enormous expense to get this vast quantity of oil into this huge channel and transmit it to the only natural place where it could be off-loaded, first of all by tankers, on Irish soil at a minimal figure of £7,000 a year and then pumped out into small tankers and despatched to the various places all over Europe.</P>
    <P>At Scotsman's Bay&mdash;in case anybody does not know where it is, it is outside Dalkey Island, where the <i>Coronia</i> and other large vessels have come in&mdash;tonnage and port dues are charged even though such vessels would merely call to disembark tourists or allow them three days in Ireland and go away again.  When the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> or other such ships called at Cork port dues were levied on the registered tonnage of the vessel.  Therefore the Minister's statement that no charge should be made because it was only man-made facilities that guaranteed the right to make a charge has been negatived by the fact that at Cork and Dublin where there are no man-made facilities provided port and tonnage dues are charged.  There is a preferential rate but the point is that a rate is charged. Gulf Oil are prepared to pay and I have suggested a minimal figure which could not affect their operations one way or the other, and this figure adds up to £1 million per year.</P>

      <P>I should like, first of all, to get this matter into a context of reality.  Deputy Donegan has embarked on a euphoric investigation in this regard, but there is no comparison whatever between the situation arising in a completely virgin harbour area such as Bantry Bay, where nobody wants to go and where nobody ever had any plans to go, apart from the particular project that went there by reason of Government encouragement&mdash;there is no comparison between that sort of situation and the sort of situation that <Col N="2082" /> is involved in established ports like Cork, Dublin, Liverpool, Antwerp&mdash; call it what you like.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan is putting things in an entirely wrong context in seeking to get a comparison between ports such as the established ones I have mentioned and the Bantry Bay situation.  The Bantry Bay situation was roughly this&mdash;and let us face up to it&mdash;that you had a completely naked foreshore, no installations, no harbour authority, an open area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;nobody inquiring apart from these people.  In the interests of Ireland and that particular area of Cork the Government decided to allow this investment of £10 million, which took place, with the substantial employment that took place in the course of construction of this terminal and the 147 people who were permanently employed there and the £7,000 income derived from the Foreshore Act by way of rent from this operation.  It is as simple as that and if you did not have them there you would have nobody there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that all the paraphernalia of verbiage we have had from Deputy Donegan disappears when one considers this naked fact and the sooner people in this country come down from a state of euphoria and to a state of reality the better.  If Gulf Oil did not establish their terminal there, nobody else was likely to do it.  Indeed, we have a very parallel example of this type of euphoria at the moment in regard to the Shannon Estuary itself. We have very successfully developed the Shannon Free Airport area because of the wisdom in establishing the airport at Shannon which has given rise to the need for the development of industries associated with air freight.  But despite the fact that the Shannon Estuary is equally with Bantry Bay an excellent estuary in the simple sense of being geologically and geographically an excellent estuary, it has not attracted any industry at all, despite many endeavours by many operators and many <i>entrepreneurs</i> over many years and with a guarantee of any Government assistance that would be available provided the projects <Col N="2083" /> stood up.  Similarly in regard to Bantry, bringing the thing into perspective, Bantry Bay would be Bantry Bay with nothing were it not for the fact that this particular oil company thought that this was in their interests.  Mark you, we did a very good deal to get them there, to put the investment in, to establish the employment&mdash;it is not extraordinary employment&mdash;to establish permanent employment apart from the investment they made in it initially in the construction and the further ancillary investments in regard to amenities in and around Bantry.  One cannot go into details but they are doing it.</P>
    <P>What I understand is that if we do not encourage people to do this sort of thing we can throw our hat at all investment in this country.  The very same sort of argument may be used against establishing an ore smelter here, or to establishing any type of industrial development here.  In fact the very argument used by Deputy Donegan&mdash;I want to strip it of the verbiage and the small town lawyer detailed sort of argument and get down to fundamentals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I refer to cheap lawyer stuff.  If the Deputy were a lawyer he would not make that sort of argument.  Stripped of all its nonsense, fundamentally, it comes down to the sort of argument that went on back in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s against any progressive development here.  The very same argument was used in this House by a leader of the Fine Gael Party&mdash; not the leader at the time but a former leader of Fine Gael, who was not then a leader&mdash;in regard to the whole Shannon Airport Development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the old argument about what Deputy Dillon said.  We will leave it at that.  Whiddy Island, I may say, is in the very same context.  If Deputies are honest with themselves, they will see it. Here is a situation where there is not a developed port at all; there is a completely <Col N="2084" /> open area of seaway that is available to a particular developer who is willing to give practical investment in terms of £10 million, who is willing to stay there in the form of investing further sums in Bantry and the area round it and is giving permanent employment to a certain number of people, and further employment in regard to its construction, and with whom at the present point of time&mdash;and this shows the destructive aspect of Deputy Donegan's approach&mdash;I am negotiating and my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is negotiating for further industrial development of a substantial kind in this country.  If you are going to have this sort of negative destructive approach then we will get nowhere.</P>
      <P>All I am saying is that we have done fairly well in this particular operation. We are going to do better&mdash;not just in Bantry itself but elsewhere&mdash;and if we adopt a constructive, progressive, optimistic approach towards investment on the part of people like Gulf Oil and other people of that kind this country will develop as it has developed due to our operations since 1957.  It has developed a good name in regard to industrial investment, a good name as a country of economic development.  As long as we continue that constructive approach we will make progress.  Many Deputies, some of them deceased, of the Fine Gael Party and one deceased of the Labour Party&mdash;Deputy Norton&mdash;I am referring particularly to Deputy Sweetman of the Fine Gael Party, with whom I had, not in the capacity of Minister for Transport and Power, but as a Deputy and a Senator, very constructive discussions on how this development should take place&mdash;if they were here on these benches at the moment they would subscribe totally to the point of view I am adumbrating.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan knows that one thing those highly progressive people, both in the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, who helped Seán Lemass and helped Fianna <Col N="2085" /> Fáil by pursuing the same policies while they were there in positions where these policies could be continued&mdash;one thing they always emphasised was that nothing should be done by this country in any way to denigrate, to take from, any form of external investment that could come in here and could place its confidence in the future of this country by investing in it and I would charge Deputy Donegan with doing a very destructive act in this particular case.  I am not going to go into the details of argument in regard to particular ports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can answer him very quickly&mdash;because in regard to developed ports such as Cork and Dublin that he quoted this has obtained but I certainly do not see the relevance of his particular argument in regard to areas of this country, be they Bantry Bay or any other bay in Ireland.  I do not see the relevance of his point in regard to these areas that we want to develop from the ground up.  The argument is totally irrelevant.  It does not arise at all because here we are developing areas that were never developed and certainly while I would welcome the participation of the Cork County Council&mdash;and I might say the County Manager, Michael Conlon, is a very good friend of mine; I went to school with him and we exchange all confidences&mdash; this is one matter on which we have a gentleman's agreement to disagree.</P>

      <P>In this House Fianna Fáil have met this sort of attack over the years.  You either have development or you do not have development. If you do not have development you leave Bantry Bay as it is and every bay around Ireland as it is.  You have no development in Tynagh, no development in Shannon, you have no development anywhere in Ireland.  You just forget about it and say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to anybody who comes in because you do not like the colour of their eyes.</P>
      <P>I say that we must go out and make arrangements, make agreements, encourage people in and recognise that Bantry Bay is not Antwerp, is not Rotterdam, and we must be very realistic and recognise that Bantry Bay was a completely naked waterway until we got this development into it and there is absolutely no comparison and no use in trying to equate a harbour authority for Bantry Bay with a harbour authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I saw the slightest reason for it in the way of another interest coming into Bantry Bay&mdash;and I would welcome another interest and every effort that we are now putting into it through all the agencies available to the State is being put into seeking to encourage some other interest into the Bantry Bay area&mdash;and if we could get them into it then we would have a harbour authority in the form sought by the Cork County Council but at the moment the only people who have sought to be there are Gulf Oil Company, Ltd.</P>

      <P>The fact is that right around Ireland we have admirable esturial areas, admirable harbour space available but, unless we get these specific projects up, we can do nothing about them and there is no point in talking hot air or trying to compare Bantry Bay or any other estuary in Ireland with other areas throughout the world.  We have to live within our <Col N="2088" /> means and get what we can and make the best deal that we can make within the context of what is good for us and good for the people with whom we make reasonable agreements from a business point of view.  That is practical business and that is the only way to operate in this type of situation.</P>
