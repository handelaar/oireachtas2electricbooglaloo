    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment I had been speaking on the make-up of the health boards in the south-western region.  I asked the Minister to give particular consideration to the rather unusual geographical distribution of the population in outlying districts in County Kerry. Whereas the population in the Kerry area might not be one-third that of the Cork city and Cork county areas, certainly the difficulty of administering in Kerry is unparalleled from the point of view of health administration, travelling, and so on.  As one who has been in the front line in medical practice in the outlying regions of Kerry, I want it to go on record that there are great difficulties in administering medicine in these areas.</P>
      <P>Today, the front page of the newspapers tells the story that the ex-councillors of Dublin Corporation&mdash; who, according to the Government, do not function any longer&mdash;are holding an emergency meeting amongst themselves to discuss the method of appointment devised by the Minister of local representatives to the Eastern Health Board.  It is an example of how the Minister has endeavoured to give the under-populated counties&mdash;Wicklow and Wexford&mdash;a decent representation on the health board not in keeping with its population ratio.  However, there is a great deal of discontent.  I would ask the Minister to meet the ex-councillors. We in this party believe they still function as an integral part of the local government set-up; that they are, in fact, duly elected representatives and, as such, should be considered for appointment to the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that, once again, we have boards and their subsidiary committees, and so on, which can unfortunately be used by aspiring politicians as platforms and forums from whence they can voice their likes and dislikes.  Whereas the medical profession will be represented to a certain extent, as will the para-medical professions, on the boards, I feel the interests of the patients will take <Col N="1809" /> second place in many instances to the interests of the public representatives appointed in the Eastern Health Board region and in the other regions.  It is unfortunate that we have had more or less to agree to a majority of public representatives in this connection.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into any detail about the composition of the individual health board but I should like to emphasise to the Minister that we should have representatives on these bodies who have a certain amount of experience in dealing with medical administration.  The Minister will agree that there is no policy on education in the medical administration of the health boards.  There is a diploma in hospital administration and hospital secretaries are briefed to some extent, but we are not making any attempt to train people in the administration of health boards.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Board will be the biggest health board in the British Isles.  I believe the secretary or the chief executive officer should be instructed in certain details of administration. We should not just take in some councillors or some local authority elected representatives and put them in to run it.  Even though the health boards will be subject to area control and to the control of the Minister, they will be the final administrators. As the Minister said, they will be meeting quite a lot.  They will meet at least once a month, and more often if necessary.  These boards should be as efficient as possible.</P>
    <P>In certain instances the Minister is increasing the number of public representatives on the health boards, not because he thinks this will be more efficient, but because of the strength of the representations made to him by local authorities.  This could be interpreted as being contradictory, and efficiency, which is the aim in the health services, is now lost.  In other words, the optimum which the Minister could have gained by keeping to a minimum the number of public representatives on the board will be lost.</P>
    <P>With faster travel we can now cover a bigger area with the same type of administrative board than we could some time ago.  The Minister introduced a health board which will take in parts <Col N="1810" /> of Roscommon and Sligo.  This again takes account of political considerations rather than administrative efficiency.  In certain parts of the Minister's statement I detected signs that he has leaned with the wind and with the gale coming from the local authorities and the public representatives.  I am sorry to read this into the Minister's statement.  In one or two places the logical approach has been watered down a little.  One does not like to see the trickle of water coming from the dam which will eventually result in the dam bursting.  I should like to see the Minister putting his finger in the leak now and not bowing to any pressures from the local authorities but heading all out for full efficiency in the health boards.</P>
    <P>If we refer to other bodies for an indication of their efficiency and their representation, we find that the agricultural council is composed largely of farmers or people who have agricultural interests.  An army council or a war council is usually composed of at least 90 per cent of people with military experience or a military background. A law council is usually composed of solicitors and barristers. Unfortunately, in this case the majority of the members of the health boards, who will be responsible for administering them for the next 20 or 30 years, will not have a medical background and will have no experience at all of medical administration.  The Minister has power to issue a directive or a circular to all the local bodies.  He has power to appoint people in areas where local bodies have been abolished and to advise that a person with experience in the medical profession could possibly make the health board more efficient if he were appointed to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that many of the consultants and many of the doctors who will be selected will have difficulty, because of the pressures of the profession, in attending the meetings.  I have gone through the number of doctors who are available, and I discussed this with the Minister a short time ago, and I believe there are many people in the medical profession who would be more than willing to participate on these boards, who are <Col N="1811" /> not fully engaged or fully active in the medical profession, but who have the experience which would be necessary to make the boards more efficient.</P>
    <P>We wish the Minister the best of luck in setting up these health boards and in making the regulations dealing with them.  In certain areas he has infringed the integrity of county borders and there are other areas in which he has permitted this integrity to be interfered with.  I was disappointed at that. I was disappointed that the earlier dynamic approach towards overruling county boundaries in the interests of the efficiency of the service was watered down.  I can only interpret this as being the result of local political pressure.  This local political pressure is not for the benefit of the patient.  It is for the benefit of aspiring politicians in these areas who wish to use the health boards, or possibly will attempt to use them, as forums or platforms for their own personal political ambitions.  Services in the health board areas may suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>In a private business enterprise this would not be tolerated.  Inefficiency because of attempts to provide local representation would not be tolerated. I am afraid the efficiency of these boards has been watered down because of this and the new health services may suffer as a result&mdash;how much we do not know.  I would have preferred if the Minister had stuck to his original draft of the health areas.</P>
    <P>I was also disappointed that the Minister increased the number of local representatives on the health boards. My interpretation of it, without being pessimistic, is that it could lessen the optimum effect which the Minister could have achieved by sticking to his original proposals.  In any case he says that in many cases he did not want to increase the local representation but because of the pressures he did come to a compromise on a figure which would be in between the two.  This was the easiest way out.</P>
    <P>We see in the paper today that the Dublin councillors are meeting because they are not satisfied with the way in which the representatives from the Dublin Corporation area are being <Col N="1812" /> appointed to the Eastern Health Board. I would ask the Minister to take their views into account and possibly meet representatives from this meeting.  They are duly elected representatives and, although the Government may have held that they failed in their duty when they did not strike the rate required or whatever it was, perhaps the Minister would give consideration to their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have been playing around with Health Acts and health regulations over an extended period going back to the thirties.  They changed their minds frequently.  When the last change came about in 1960 and when the unified health services Act was being implemented and the regulations set out we were told by the then Minister, Deputy MacEntee, that this was the be-all and end-all in regard to health administration.  Despite the lengthy statements he made at the time in support of that measure, that is all scrapped now and the present Minister for Health tells us the health services need remodelling, that we must change the system.  What Deputy MacEntee said was so efficient is no longer fit to continue operating and that system must be thrown aside.  If I may say something of my experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already had some agreement under the Health Act and, after prolonged discussion, the general principle of regional health boards was accepted.  What we are now discussing is that if we are to have health boards I must make proposals about them.  I gave the proposals for these regulations in fair detail in the form of a memorandum to Deputies recently.  We have agreed on the principle.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy is no doubt aware that the debate is confined to the Health Board Regulations, 1970.  This does not open up a debate on the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks are all incidental to the establishment of the health boards and to my mind are quite relevant.  I want to be helpful.  I know that there is a great deal of business to be dealt with but the question of health administration is important. It is no harm to &ldquo;recap&rdquo; on former health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We &ldquo;recapped&rdquo; for hours and a very interesting debate it was and the House then agreed as a whole on the principle involved.  They had then available as information the rough constitution of the eight health boards.  They had all that at the time of the Health Bill.  It was not a question of my producing eight boards. The general principle had already been established.  Every county council had the data for the eight health boards. The only question was the exact number of representatives from the local authorities and the consultants.  That was all that had to be done.  We even had a statement in regard to that.  That was all agreed by the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened was that the Government came to a decision and the party members had to support it.  By virtue of the Government's majority they were able to legislate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael and Labour agreed to the general principle</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have eight health boards established and one thing that strikes me about them is that we are moving closer and closer to the system of administration which obtains in the eastern part of this continent where they do not allow representatives <Col N="1814" /> elected by popular vote to have any say in administrative matters.  They are just rubber stamps.  You could not describe them, I suppose, as being elected by popular vote.  In these health boards we are following that practice closely.  We are appointing boards composed to a great extent of non-elected personnel.  I am a believer in democracy and whether you are a doctor, a farmer, a labourer or unemployed you have the right to go before the people for a Dáil election or a local authority election and get approval to become a public representative.</P>
      <P>The health boards are established and the equivalent of a commissar is appointed.  He will be known as a chief executive officer.  The main functions and duties of the boards centre around the CEO or, in Eastern European terms, the commissar.  That is what he will be.  The ordinary person who has a complaint has no more hope of getting within speaking distance of the CEO than I have at present of flying from here to New York in two minutes.  These people are not available to discuss little grievances about why a medical card was not granted or a child's medicine was not approved and the thousand and one things about which representations must be made in regard to health services. The local representative did that job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One can still make an appeal.  I made that clear in the debate.  There is opportunity for a democratic appeal by an elected representative, or a member of the county council.  In fact, anybody can make an appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is speaking about county councils, take Cork County Council.  There are 46 members elected to Cork County Council and 39 of them will not be or cannot be members of this board. With all due respect to Deputy Byrne, some of those members got more votes <Col N="1815" /> in order to be elected to Cork County Council than he got to be elected to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>What the professionals of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, be they lawyers or medical men&mdash;and there is a reasonable scattering of them on both sides&mdash;want to do jointly, irrespective of any differences and irrespective of this floor which is dividing them, is to abolish local administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy P.J. Burke could think otherwise. It is quite evident what the reason is.  Every one of us is entitled to express his individual opinions and if these people feel that local authorities should be abolished and health, social welfare and everything else should be administered from a centralised authority, let them say so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is dealing with the general principle.  He is not dealing with the regulations.  We had a most prolonged and interesting debate and we all agreed on the general principle. This spells out the application of the general principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ten regulations and what are deemed to be statutory instruments contained in this booklet. I am dealing with what the booklet contains.  It would take longer if I were to deal with the members of the board. There are so many people appointed here, I could start reading out the names of the appointees and the professions from which they are called, <Col N="1816" /> but I want to short-circuit it and not take up too much time.  I want to address myself to the new thinking of the Minister and of the majority of the Government, the thinking that is approved of fully by members of Fine Gael.  Deputy Byrne tells us here about aspiring politicians down the country and on local councils who are trying to get into this House.  He reflected on them as an unscrupulous lot.  He said they would use any means to get in here, that in discussing health legislation at local level, the composition of the boards or the areas specified in the regulations, they would not speak objectively but selfishly and cunningly. I resent that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne is miles ahead of Fianna Fáil, although they are travelling fairly fast, on the road to the abolition of local bodies.  Imagine a Deputy telling us here that the health services should be administered by the medical profession only, and I am not misquoting him when I say that.  We are to collect £8 million in Cork and give it to those fellows to administer it. There is to be no such thing as a public representative or a Dáil Deputy.  That is the new thinking of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not allow that I am entitled to comment on statements made by Members of the House?  I am addressing myself to the Members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and indeed of the Labour Party. Eyes should be opened here.  There are dangerous men moving around the legislative centre of this city.  They have more power than they are entitled <Col N="1817" /> to.  I do not know whether there is connivance or not, but the one thing I believe these people agree on is to do away with local bodies, to do away with the elected county councillor, borough councillor, urban councillor and town commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Before I finish on this point let me say I have been aware for years of the thinking behind regulations such as these by some of our top people here in Dublin and in other centres as well.  These professional Deputies, be they lawyers or medical men, are afraid of these unscrupulous representatives down the country, such as Deputy Byrne described, who have been fighting for the local needs of the people and putting their grievances at local authority meetings.  As a result at the ensuing elections some of these people may be preferred to the professionals and seats will change in this House.  Every man and every woman is entitled to contest Dáil elections if he or she wishes.  It is a good thing that there are people from all walks of life willing and anxious to go before the people.  That is my view.  Surely no one would suggest that this should be a kind of closed shop?  There are sentiments expressed here by people who could be <Col N="1818" /> termed to have superior educational standards, who think they know what is good for us, who formulate policies and hand them over and say, &ldquo;Look here, that is good enough, we know more about this than you; we are better educated; we have several letters after our names and some of us have handles before our names.&rdquo;  I am not reflecting on people with degrees or qualifications but they have no right to dictate to other people in the manner in which they have been, saying, &ldquo;This and that must happen and you do not count.&rdquo;  I want to say to all Deputies to be aware of these fellows.</P>

The health board in my district will consist of 33 members, five of whom will be appointed by Cork Corporation, five out of 31, seven will be appointed by the Cork County Council, seven out of 46, and five by Kerry County Council, that is five out of 26.  As the health board will be the statutory body all the other local members will have no say so far as health board discussions are concerned. We have a number of appointments made by the medical profession, by the Minister and by others.  Down through the years all these people attended health authority meetings in an advisory capacity but it now appears that they will be masters and the others will be servants.  They will have a dual role under these regulations.  What will happen the other elected representatives? Will the Minister not accept that each county council or borough council member should have the right to make representations at some committee level of the health services?  The committees are to be formed by the health board and I assume that the membership of the health board committees will be confined to members of the board.  There will be a local <Col N="1819" /> committee consisting of two or three members from each electoral area.  Will that be the final committee?  Will there be any district advisory committees?  At present County Cork is divided into three regions, north, south and west and we have three advisory committees meeting on a local basis to discuss local matters.  We sent a resolution to the Minister in regard to the necessity for making regulations which would cover the continuance of such committees.  I wonder did the Minister see or read the recommendation or was it thrown into a wastepaper basket before he saw it?</P>

      <P>There can be three advisory committees if Cork County Council want it for Cork county. Nothing in the regulations prevents that.  I will listen to any council that wants to split the advisory committee into more than one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <P>The Minister is going to cut adrift from any advice on health matters from several of our county council and borough council members. Apart from the health boards under the 1960 Act the county councils acted as health authorities but that will all be done away with.  Now we have this new system of appointing this chief executive officer and the nearest pattern you can find from which it was copied would be in Eastern Europe.</P>

You were there yourself, a Cheann Comhairle.  We had&mdash;I will not say the privilege&mdash;of discussions with some commissars, local chief executive officers, and hence my argument here. Maybe the system there is a good one.  It has been in existence for some years.  It is the system we are trying to impose here now.  Will the Minister deny that?</P>

      <P>The Minister said there is nothing to preclude county councils from having a number of subcommittees. The Cork Health Authority has been in existence for ten years and I have been a member of it for <Col N="1821" /> those ten years.  It could do with a little streamlining, but not the kind of streamlining proposed in these regulations. We have the advisory committees from north, south and west.  I understand the corporation has representatives on the south Cork advisory committee.  We have mental hospital visiting committees.  What will happen visiting committees to mental hospitals? How are they covered in the regulations here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the place to ask questions because, once the regulations are approved, we will have no further say.  If we ask questions we will be told the matter was discussed here in the Dáil on the morning of 23rd July and why were we not present then to ask questions.  I have a certain amount of respect for the Minister but it is beginning to decline.  It has been declining during the past few months.  I do not like these snappy comments when Deputies ask questions.  We have no retinue of civil servants to do the work for us.  I have no assistant of any kind to do any of my work.  I may not have the same capacity as the Minister and his advisers for going through each line of a Bill and analysing it.  People holding public office should not be snappy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to Deputy Dr. Byrne's suggestion about the medical profession and representation on these boards, under these regulations what channel of complaint will Mary Murphy have against a medical man, or some other public official, and what chance will she have of getting her complaint investigated? She will go to one of the medical men on the board.  He is quite likely to be a close associate of the person about whom she wants to complain. These people probably dine and wine together.  What will happen to Mary Murphy and her complaint?  It is unnecessary to give the answer.  It is happening today.  I have read the <Col N="1822" /> regulations made by the British board when it was in operation here.  The ordinary person with a grievance had a better opportunity then of getting that grievance satisfactorily investigated than she has today.  Any person with a grievance today has great difficulty in getting that grievance investigated. There is nothing in these regulations to help such people.  The person with the complaint today comes along to her local member.  He may be doubtful about the best approach but, no matter what approach is made, very little happens.  That is the position today.  It is likely to be worse when these regulations come into operation. Despite all the legislation and all the expenditure the people are not getting the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am examining the regulations from the point of view of a person having a complaint to make.  To whom will she complain? Is it to the Minister's three representatives? Is it to the medical men or the psychiatric nurse or the other people? Her only possible avenue of complaint is a member.  He will take it to the chief executive officer.  Invariably the chief executive officer is a close personal friend of the man about whom she wants to complain.  That finishes it.  That is what is happening today. Let us not close our eyes to it.  I have tried to get satisfaction here.  I know how far a person can go with complaints here.</P>

It is quite evident that, so far as this House is concerned, representations or contributions made to discussions by Members of the Opposition carry little weight.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They were reduced to size.  They were so full of themselves that they blew up internally.  They very nearly blew themselves out of this House.  This is how boards are established here.  They are established on a dictatorial basis.  Recommendations made from the floor of this House were not accepted by the Minister.  The only recommendation I know of which was accepted was to give Cork County Council an additional member on the board because, if the Minister did not accede to that request, it was most likely that the Fianna Fáil group in Cork County Council would have only two representatives on the board.  By being given an additional representative they will have three.  It is no harm to bring that to mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concluding now and I do not think I have taken up too much of the time of the House this morning.  This is what I want to emphasise here.  I will put it in a nutshell.  These regulations are completely dictatorial.  They are dictatorial in every sense of the word. They go further than previous legislation in minimising the powers of local elected representatives.  They are bringing us nearer to the day when the local authorities will be completely <Col N="1827" /> abolished.  I want the Irish public to know that.  I want the ordinary county councillor, urban councillor and town commissioner to be aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that it is mainly the professional group in this House who are trying to bring that about. They are possibly more vocal than other classifications of representatives here.  That is what is happening.  So far as these regulations are concerned, the ordinary person with a complaint to make will have no greater rights than those they enjoyed during the lifetime of the past health authorities, and those rights were not of much account.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that, despite the millions of pounds expended from central and local funds on health administration, a substantial and sizeable majority of our people are dissatisfied with the services, and there are people in the lower income group who are completely dissatisfied with them. It is well known that these small people were often treated by highly paid personnel in the health services administration in the most contemptuous way possible.  It is unfortunate, indeed, that any Member should have to get up in this House and say that about the administration of so vital a service as the health service.  It is a well-known fact that too many of our people are being treated with contempt today and have no redress.  I will resume my seat on that note.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank the vast majority of Deputies for their constructive comments on the health board regulations. I want to deal with a few of the points that were made.  Many of the points concerned matters that were already the subject of a decision by the Dáil and the Seanad in which there was no great reflection of party differences on the general principle of establishing health boards of the general size indicated in these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy R. Barry suggested that the Minister for Health should not appoint three members to each board.  In view of the fact that the central authority provides about 75 per cent of the total cost of the health services, and that the <Col N="1828" /> Minister for Health, advised by the Government, advised in turn by the Dáil, must have general responsibility for the health services, I felt that for the Minister for Health to appoint 10 per cent of the total membership of the boards was fairly reasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry also said that good doctors would be too busy to attend board meetings.  I have about 30 consultative medical boards of one kind or another, in the case of only two of which the members are remunerated.  I have had the most splendid service from the medical profession through these bodies and I have no reason to suppose that the medical profession will not be able to participate adequately in the work of the boards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne spoke about the amount of autonomy given to the health boards.  Of course they will be given the maximum amount of autonomy consistent with general health policy and consistent with the amount of money to be raised by the boards through the county councils.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked me questions about the appointment of the boards and the relationship of the new boards under these regulations to the appointment of chief executive officers. The chief executive officers and the boards will be appointed before the boards come into operation in April, giving an opportunity to the boards to get to know their work.  In that connection, I am glad to say that I have on the one hand appointed a consultative joint staff council to deal with all the matters relating to the movement of staffs consequent upon the creation of the boards and in which there will be full discussion and, on the other hand, I have appointed a very reputable firm of management consultants to assist the boards in deciding how they will carry out their activities in the enlarged areas which are involved in this way.</P>
    <P>The consultants, of course, will be instructed to do this in such a way as to ensure the best possible service to the community with maximum efficiency and with the least amount of unnecessary transfer of staff.  In other words, the consultants will be <Col N="1829" /> helping the chief executive officers and the health boards to devise the best possible system of administration.  I hope the result of those two appointments will be that we will be able to have efficient health boards which will, at the same time, be able to satisfy the public that they are engaging in proper administration and giving good service to the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan made a suggestion that the Eastern Health Board region should be divided into two.  This would mean splitting Dublin.  That would be rather like what happened in the case of Solomon and the child.  It would be most dangerous for me to split Dublin in two for the purpose of providing two health board administrations.  It is not practical policy.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the point raised already at great length by Deputy Murphy about representations. There will be no lack of opportunity for representations to the chief executive officers.  They can be made either to members of the health boards who will be skilled in these matters, and who might be the best people to take them on to the chief executive officers, or they can be made direct to the chief executive officers.  I am perfectly certain that, with the advisory committees and the existence of the Deputies and Senators in the areas, and with the presence of the health boards, there will be no diminution in the opportunity to make representations either in regard to eligibility for charges or the making of charges.  I am perfectly certain that the amount of representation will be absolutely adequate and that I have done nothing to diminish the democratic right of the people of this country to make complaints in regard to the health services made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the fact that in some cases public representatives have only a bare majority of one on the health boards. In fact the majority ranges from three, <Col N="1830" /> to two, to one.  As I said before&mdash;and I am glad to say it and Deputies on both sides have agreed with me&mdash;I do not think there will be a clash of interests at the principal meetings between professional representatives and local authority representatives.  Perhaps I shall be told I am an idealist.  I do not believe there will be such a clash. I believe they will work together and if there are differences of opinion and even votes in the health boards I should be very much surprised if one group of professionals does not vote with one group of local authority representatives against another group of local authority representatives and another group of professionals.  I do not believe there will be a continuing clash of interests, with the professionals looking angrily at the local authority representatives. I believe there will be effective collaboration between the two groups.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies from some of the smaller counties suggested that their representation was not sufficient.  I have already made it clear that the smaller counties have more representation than would be justified in order to ensure that their interests will be well looked after.  I think I can go no further in that regard.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I was very glad that, taking the debate as a whole, there were practically no complaints of importance as to the actual proposed distribution of local authority representatives on the health boards as compared with the professions.  Very few people suggested that I had appointed too many from one county or too few from another.  Those complaints were made to me when I visited every area in the country and spoke to the county councils and, as a result of listening to such representations as I received and which I felt were reasonable, I think I have managed to construct these regulations in a way that has given general satisfaction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 7 to 20 and to substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  In so far as a sub-contractor is chargeable to tax in respect of any profits or gains arising or accruing to him from a trade or vocation, he shall be treated as having paid on account of tax so chargeable any tax which was deducted from payments brought into account in the computation of those profits or gains and which has not been repaid or for which a set-off has not been given; and the Revenue Commissioners shall make regulations for giving effect to this subsection and those regulations shall in particular include provision&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  as to the manner in which, and the periods for which, tax deducted under this section is to be brought into account as a sum paid on account of the liability to tax of a sub-contractor,</P>
      <P>(b)  for repayment, on due claim made for a period (hereinafter referred to as the repayment period) commencing on the 6th day of April in a year of assessment and ending on the 5th day of the month following the date of the payment or, if the payment was made on or before the 5th day of a month, ending on the 5th day of that month, of such portion of the tax deducted from payments received by a sub-contractor during the repayment period (reduced by any amount of such tax repaid or set off) as appears to the Revenue Commissioners to exceed the proportionate part of the amount of tax for which he is liable, or is estimated to be liable, for that year of assessment, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  for repayments in cases <Col N="1832" /> where the total of the tax deducted from payments received by a sub-contractor and not repaid to him exceeds the amount of tax for which he is liable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage Deputies were critical of the provisions of section 17 on the grounds that the section would prove, in the main, to be unworkable and where it did operate the amount of the deduction would cause grave hardship.  To meet these criticisms I am proposing these amendments which I trust will meet the main objections voiced.  The new provisions will ensure that an established sub-contractor will be furnished with a certificate which will enable him to be paid contract money due to him in full without any deduction of tax.  In order to obtain that certificate he must satisfy only two simple conditions.  The first is that he should have an established place of business and the second is that he should have furnished, or undertake to furnish, accounts of his business to the Revenue Commissioners. Anyone who can satisfy these conditions will get a certificate and possession of this certificate will mean that he will not be subject to tax deductions on the amounts he receives from contractors during the year.</P>
    <P>There will, however, be sub-contractors who will not have a certificate either because they are unable or unwilling to satisfy those simple conditions. Tax will be deducted at the rate of 7s in the £ from payments made to such sub-contractors.  I agree that this is a severe deduction but the second of the new provisions will enable a sub-contractor from whom these deductions are made to claim repayment on a monthly basis of the excess of tax deducted over his proportionate tax liability for the year.  On the basis of these two provisions in the two amendments I think that I have gone as far as I reasonably can to meet the objections that were raised, to ensure that what might be called genuine, normal sub-contractors will be in a position no different from that of any other taxpayer and that in the case of people who cannot or will not comply with the simple conditions I have mentioned, they will be obliged <Col N="1833" /> to pay their tax by reason of the deduction at 7s in the £ but, on the other hand, in the case of such people I have gone as far as I can to ensure that the tax deduction does not operate unduly harshly by enabling them on a monthly basis to get a refund of tax overpaid by them in relation to their proportionate liability for the month in question.  I trust that the House will accept that this is a reasonable approach to the problems that have been raised.</P>

      <P>These two amendments go some distance towards meeting some of the points made on this side of the House during the Committee Stage.  I think they are a very useful improvement in legislation which otherwise would be extremely onerous in its operation.  It has been worthwhile having an extensive debate in order to achieve these changes.  They do not take the form proposed by the Opposition but nevertheless they go a good distance towards meeting the points made.  They contain, however, these slightly ominous phrases, &ldquo;as appears to the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo; in one amendment and something similar in the other.  In the second amendment there is the phrase &ldquo;satisfies the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.  This leaves a very wide discretion to the Revenue Commissioners in the matter.  I wonder how, in fact, in the first amendment, this will work.  Can sub-contractors be assured that in the actual operation of this provision, in so far as a deduction of tax has been made which exceeds the amount which should be payable, they will get the full amount back in the following month.  I find difficulty in following the wording as to how these repayments are to be made. Amendment No. 1 (4) (b) speaks of &ldquo;repayment, on due claim made for a period commencing on the 6th day of April in a year of assessment and ending on the 5th day of the month following the date of the payment or, if the payment was made on or before the 5th day of a month,...&rdquo; Is this a cumulative repayment?</P>

      <P>Will this be operated in such a way that people will get back immediately the amount they are due? Experience of the Revenue Commissioners does not suggest that they always proceed exactly in that way. They seem to like to keep a reserve in case of doubt.  Can people be assured that they will get back the amount they should get back?  There is a difference between people paying tax when due and, if they can argue that it is not due, not paying it until it is established that it is due.  If the tax was taken from them without their consent through this mechanism it is important that the repayment mechanism should be as equitable as the process by which the tax would have been charged in the ordinary way.  People could be in difficulties if the Revenue Commissioners adopted delaying tactics or gave themselves the benefit of the doubt which would have accrued to the taxpayer if he had actually paid the tax, whereas arguing his case where something was due to be paid he could put off the payment until such time as that was settled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has introduced amendments here which go part of the way towards what we are trying to do.  I have not had an opportunity of going into the matter to see whether or not they cover the points.  If the sub-contractor has a fixed place of business, that has been covered all right.  I do not think there will be any difficulty there.  I am still not happy that this covers the people we were talking about, the &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; and that these people may be put out of business, but perhaps that is the object of the exercise.  It does not appear that it will be possible for them to carry on within <Col N="1837" /> the law.  Some Members have said here that the result of the section&mdash;and indeed the amendment here copper-fastens this&mdash;will be to make certain contractors break the law.  Either they close their eyes to what is happening and allow it to continue or alternatively they are going to adhere to the strict letter of the law.</P>
      <P>Maybe it is impossible for the Minister to cover all the points it would be necessary to cover once he has entered into this field, but does the Minister consider that this will cover completely the type of group who will come on a site working as day labourers, hourly men, who will make a deal with the contractor to do certain work by task, lump job, call it what you like?  These men will do that job and proceed from that site to a different job altogether, not the complete gang but portion of the gang and will do the same type of work in the new job.  This may happen four, five or six times in the year and if they get used to this way of working it is possible that, during periods between one contract job and another &mdash;I am calling it &ldquo;contract&rdquo; for convenience sake&mdash;they may not be working at anything at all.</P>
      <P>There are two types who do this: one is the hard-pressed man who has a big family and he must of necessity get more money.  I explained on the other Stages of the Bill that they must do this because of the expenses for travelling and so on.  The second type is the fellow who likes a few &ldquo;jars&rdquo; and will probably consume most of what he gets over the weekend.  I can see great problems in this and I should like the Minister to assure me that most of them have been ironed out.  I am quite sure all of them cannot be ironed out but if a genuine effort is made I shall be reasonably happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to impress on the Minister that there is grave danger that this will materially affect the building industry which over the last couple of years has come to depend a great deal on this type of work.  There is one other type, the man who is fairly handy himself and decides to build his house by direct labour.  He does a certain part of the work and employs people with different crafts to build <Col N="1838" /> the house at different stages.  The people in these crafts can be found on one house one month and then they move off to another house.  They are never employed by contract as such because they prefer to do it in this way.  Does the Minister feel these people can be dealt with fully?  They are not time and material men.  They sell only their labour.  I am sorry I have come in at this time but I was engaged on something else and I was not aware the matter was being discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties envisaged by Deputy Tully will be covered in these amendments as far as it is possible to do so.  I have given a great deal of thought to this whole problem and the approach I have adopted is basically this.  First of all, you have what can be called the genuine, established sub-contractor and, as Deputy Tully says, they do not present any problem.  Then there are the people described as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; and I should like to divide them into two categories: first, those who I will not say are anxious but are willing to pay their tax, and, secondly, those who are not.</P>
      <P>If we take the first group, those willing to pay the tax, we have gone as far as possible to meet them.  It must be realised that because of the nature of the work and the way in which it is carried out, moving from one place to another, and changing from one gang to another, it is not possible to deal with them in any way except on the basis of deductions.  We are now, as I say, dealing with people who want to pay their tax and do not want to be in difficulties with the Revenue Commissioners.  What will happen in their case is the tax will be deducted from payments due to them at 7s in the £ but they will report to the Revenue Commissioners and on that basis they will be enabled on a monthly basis to get a refund of an excess deducted from moneys they receive over and above the proportionate liability for the month which they are estimated to have.  This is as far as we can go to convenience them, and I am anxious to convenience such people.  I have given a lot of thought to this and this is the uttermost limit to which I can go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> The third category is those who do not wish to pay tax, who are doing their best to avoid it, and for these I have no sympathy.  What will happen to them is that deductions will be made and they will not get in touch with the Revenue Commissioners to get a refund.  They will suffer deductions at the rate of 7s in the £ and will be suffering deductions for more than they are liable, unless they have an income from some other source, in which case it may be worth their while not to make any return at all.  These, however, will not be very many.  The bulk will suffer over-deduction but as I said they will be enabled to get a refund each month of the over-deduction.  The Revenue Commissioners will be setting up special sections to deal with the prompt repayment of tax on foot of claims under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage the Minister indicated, if I understood correctly, that the &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; who will be considered under this would be a type of sub-contractors and they might possibly qualify for an allowance for their vehicles which they use to travel to and from their jobs.  Can I take it that that will be the position, that although they are day workers and are not entitled to claim for a vehicle which they use, if they are being considered as sub-contractors they will be entitled to claim for at least wear and tear as they must use the vehicle for the purpose of carrying out the contract?  The Minister said that the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The only circumstances in which they could make that kind of claim would be where they were submitting accounts and so on as contractors.  In the case of genuine contractors they can make a claim for travelling expenses between their home and their job, where their home is also their place of business and their builder's yard, but if they are not the same places established contractors cannot make this claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But they have the habit of driving around to the yard in the morning and qualifying that way.  The people I am talking about do carry small tools which they will require and <Col N="1840" /> as far as they are concerned their homes are their builder's yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But if they are to be treated as such they would come under the earlier part where they would satisfy the Revenue Commissioners of the established basis of their business, that they have undertaken to submit accounts, and then they will get a certificate. If they come within that section then the question of travelling expenses would arise on the basis I mentioned but if they come in on the basis of deduction at the rate of 7s in the £ from the moneys paid to them they would not be able to claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I think they would not because it is a question of the established place of business and the submission of accounts. In practical terms they do not have accounts.  If they are prepared to organise themselves on a basis like that of course they would be treated like any other business but the bulk of them are not organised and would not be able to be organised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unlikely and it appears now there will be a considerable number of headaches for the Revenue Commissioners, the building <Col N="1842" /> trade, trade union officials and Members of this House as a result of this section.  I hope somebody will get some good out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is unlikely to happen. The position then will be that these people will operate loosely as a partnership but not in such a way as to justify being under Schedule B and, because of that, they will not get travelling expenses. I pointed out on Committee Stage that there is a special problem in the case of building workers.  It arises with some other types of workers, too, but not many.  I refer to the fact that their place of work changes all the time.  If people have a fixed place of work they can fix their homes in relation to it.  They can minimise travelling expenses by fixing their homes near their place of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances there is no case for travelling expenses, or the case is much less, but, in such cases, if an employer required an employee, as a condition of employment, to involve himself in additional expense of any kind, other than the normal expense of getting to and from work, and does not compensate him for that additional expense, then such an employee, even under Schedule E, if he can show that this expense is necessarily incurred and he was not reimbursed, can claim this as an expense under Schedule E.  It seems to me that principle should apply also to building workers because the building worker cannot locate his home in relation to his employment and he is involved in the expense of getting to and from work and that expense is different from and normally greater than the expense incurred by other types of employee.  It is not within his control and it is a condition of his employment that he should present himself for work at the particular place.  If the employer compensates him or collects him in a lorry and brings him to the site there would be no case.  If he is not reimbursed by his employer or compensated in some way, then the expenses are necessarily incurred in relation to the work he undertakes.  I asked the Minister on Committee Stage to have a look at this.  He said he was prepared <Col N="1843" /> to look at it but he would make no commitment.  It seems to me that there is a real injustice here.  Even without legislation, by administrative decision to apply the Schedule E principle here the problem could be solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having established that the &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; cannot overcome the problem, having got that out of the way, and having got the Minister to say that this is most unlikely to happen, I am then left with the problem in regard to &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; and other building workers.  It seems to me that the best solution&mdash;this should apply to all building workers&mdash;would be to deal with them as I propose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference in the way they operate.  The ordinary building worker normally turns up at the builder's yard and, if the job is some way away from the yard, he is either paid travelling time or transported to the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is not <i>au fait</i> with the situation.  There are building workers who may be &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; today and not &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; tomorrow.  The ordinary building worker may have to travel 30 or 40 miles directly to the site and back again.  Normally, they never go near the builder's yard.  It may be only half a mile from the site but the workers may be living 40 miles away.  Usually, what happens is a group of workers get together, buy an old car, tax and insure it&mdash;insurance is a heavy item now&mdash; and run it into town to the job.  They get no allowance whatever for this. Deputy FitzGerald is correct in saying the jobs may move but on the big sites they go direct to the site and they will do that for, maybe, three months, six months, or even a year.  They get no allowance whatever.  The Minister could solve a great many of his problems if he would consider some type of allowance to these people.  Many of these people take on lump jobs because they must earn more money than a <Col N="1844" /> job would normally pay in order to meet travelling expenses on which they are taxed.  If a building labourer has £16 a week, a married man with no family, he is taxed on £5 10s of that. In addition, he must pay his travelling expenses and those expenses average £3 to £4 a week.  That reduces his wages to quite a small figure.  The Minister could do a great deal more than he is doing if he would allow some expenses for tax purposes to these people.  If he did that he might solve this problem.  It could be done by administrative decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald brought the matter away completely from the case of the man on the lump job.  The men on a lump job form a gang and the reason the gang changes so often is that a fellow who is not able to work very, very hard will not survive.  It is not a question of his being told to go.  He realises before very long that his pace is not good enough and he moves back to day work or time work and the lump job gang recruits someone else or continues the job with a smaller group.  It is a very difficult problem and the only reason I make so much about it is that, having introduced another impediment to the earning of a decent living by a group which is already harassed and which is working so very hard, we should do something to ameliorate their position.  The Minister has attempted to improve the position by bringing in amendments but I doubt if he has reached the kernel of the problem. Perhaps he will let us know before we conclude whether or not he thinks he can recommend some alteration to help these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we are talking about a different thing.  He is allowed from his office if he is travelling on various jobs.  We are talking here about &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;.  Either the ordinary building worker who is not a &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; will be paid travelling money or he will negotiate a rate of pay to compensate him for the travelling he has to do.  In the building industry, he is in a position to do this. &ldquo;Lumpers&rdquo; are a different proposition. One may assume that the prices they fix for the job will take account of the expenses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that in most cases building workers are either carried from a regular place of business at which they have to report to the place where they work or are compensated by being paid extra money to get there or, in the case of &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;, a higher rate is <Col N="1846" /> charged to cover travelling expenses. Where a building worker is not so compensated but has to pay his own expenses to get to the place where he works, where that place of work changes and he cannot control the distance from his home to there because the place of work changes all the time, a special case can be made for being allowed expenses which cannot be made in other cases.  Even applying the Schedule E principle with some flexibility in these cases, it should come within the principle.  If they are paid for this travelling, it does not arise.  The Minister does not answer the point by saying that it happens most of the time. This is very important for people who travel long distances because of change of work location and get no compensation. If a man lives in Kells, for example, and the office is in Monaghan and the job is in Navan the Minister's suggestion is that the man travels to Monaghan before he goes to Navan and then gets the expenses from Monaghan to Navan.  All the man wants is his expenses from Kells to Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that.  The case of a man going to Monaghan and back to Navan would apply to a very small proportion of the number engaged in the building industry.</P>

      <P>The way to get experience of a job is to work in it.  My experience in the building industry&mdash;I was a trade union official&mdash;is that the people paid for travelling to the job are craftsmen&mdash;for instance, in Dublin city&mdash;who are required to go outside. The very name of the money they get, &ldquo;country money&rdquo;, explains the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that workers attached to a firm are sent outside the normal area to do a job and are paid <Col N="1847" />&ldquo;country money&rdquo;.  We are talking here about people who travel from outside the city&mdash;mostly labourers; sometimes craftsmen&mdash;at their own expense, into town to a particular site and who do not receive any payment until they report on the site and, when they are there, are paid a rate for the number of hours they work on it.  Deputy FitzGerald's point was pretty good: he developed it very well.  However, we have gone completely away from the main point.  I do not think we will get anywhere with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters which I undertook to look at and which I want to mention.  First, in regard to a point raised by Deputy O'Higgins, I undertook to see if it would be possible to draft an amendment which might go some way to meet his suggested amendment, namely, that section 23 should not apply where one man in a two man professional partnership dies.  I am afraid it is not feasible to meet the Deputy's point on a partial basis, which was what I said I would try to do.  In order to meet it at all, it would have to be met fully.</P>
      <P>If I were to meet it fully, as I have already explained to the House, logically it would require a similar amendment to section 62 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which also applies to a discontinuance which takes place when one trader in a two trading partnership dies.  However, if we were to amend section 62 of the 1967 Act in that way, there would be considerable scope for evasion, and it was specifically to prevent that evasion that section 62 of the 1967 Act was introduced.  I think I indicated this difficulty when we were discussing this on Committee Stage.  In these circumstances I am afraid it is not possible for me to meet the point raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer is that certain amendments were put forward by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy O'Higgins in connection with the granting of a lease for a period in excess of 50 years in one case or 99 years in the other.  It was suggested that they should be regarded as a disposal <Col N="1849" /> of the full interest of the lessor in the property, thereby enabling the lessee to claim the allowances.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say that it is undoubtedly the position that, where a lease of an industrial premises was given for whatever length, the fact that the lessor would be entitled under existing law to claim both initial and annual industrial building allowances would have been taken into account in determining the rent to be paid or, where this was commuted by way of a fine, in the amount of the fine.  This would be of special significance in relation to those industrial buildings which attract an initial allowance of 10 per cent and an annual allowance of the same amount, resulting in a writing-off of the total expenditure over nine years. Such buildings would include hotels, holiday camps and holiday cottages.</P>
    <P>I am sure it will be appreciated that, with that relatively short period, this allowance would certainly be a considerable factor in determining the rent or the fine, as the case might be.  If we were at this stage to make the changes suggested, I think those changes could be very strongly criticised on the grounds that a higher rent or fine would have been charged if the withdrawal of these allowances had been envisaged. In effect, there would be a variation in the terms of the lease in favour of the lessee without any right of redress being conferred on the lessor who had made his bargain on the basis that the allowances would be available to him.</P>
    <P>One proposal was to apply this to leases in excess of 99 years.  Another was to apply it to leases in excess of 50 years.  There is no particular reason why a lease of any specific duration should be singled out for special treatment. For instance, if the proposal were in relation to 50 year leases, and if that were accepted, I think it is inevitable that pressure would be exerted later on to have leases of shorter duration given similar treatment.  Ultimately this would have the effect of depriving all lessors of the benefit of the capital allowances, including those who lease their premises at an economic rent.  In all these circumstances I have found it impossible to agree to the proposals, <Col N="1850" /> having further considered the matter as carefully as I could.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not envisage the effect, or the purported effect, of the amendment I moved on Committee Stage involving the cases mentioned by the Minister such as hotels or holiday accommodation.  I suppose the same is true of the one moved by Deputy O'Higgins.  The problem I was concerned with was the effect on persons operating factories or industries in factories built in industrial estates which, because of the arrangement under which the developer provided the factories, were made available on lease rather than for sale. If the firm concerned had constructed the factory they would get the benefit of the allowance, or if the factory had been bought.</P>
      <P>The cases drawn to my attention were in respect of one particular industrial estate but I gather the same thing exists in others.  The one I am most familiar with is the Dún Laoghaire industrial estate where a certain number of factories are obviously affected.  The Minister might have the matter further considered to see whether it would be possible to frame a section at some stage that would cover it.</P>
      <P>The Minister argued on Committee Stage that this benefit may have been got in another way but I think that is not strictly so in the sense that the lease is at a relatively low rent.  The firm in question obviously had to pay a fine for it and that may vary or differ depending on the length of the lease and the circumstances of the arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time certain booklets are published by the Revenue Commissioners, laying down changes made, and so on.  The Schedule to this Bill dealing with stamp duties follows the arrangement in the earlier Stamp Duties Acts and, while it is possible, in conjunction with the other Act, to see what changes are made in each case, it is pretty cumbersome and complicated and requires a great deal of research in order to see what amendments have been made and the manner in which they apply.  There is a case <Col N="1851" /> to be made for issuing some memo or booklet which would indicate these changes clearly.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners might also consider that certain precedents are established in Revenue and, in certain cases, are known to practitioners either solicitors or accountants or both.  The number of practitioners who may not have practices sufficiently large to make them aware of these are denied the knowledge, or if not denied it, it may not come to their notice.  I think there is something to be said for issuing some sort of guideline that would indicate that precedents of a particular character apply in certain cases.  It might even be understood that these guidelines are laid down for general guidance and do not involve any particular obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to follow them in all cases.  Because of this certain difficulties or problems arise for particular practitioners.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very necessary, as anybody familiar with the tourist trade knows that in the last 12 months a number of hoteliers who had been promised money failed to get <Col N="1852" /> it.  Consequently, they are paying for their own money through the banks, having raised overdrafts.  Such people, I hope, will now be dealt with and paid speedily.  Some of them have been out of pocket for two years.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a great tendency to lump Cork with Dublin as if Cork had all the facilities that Dublin enjoys. The Minister lists the grants available to hotels and guesthouses and says that grants of up to 30 per cent are provided, subject to the exclusion of certain locations such as Dublin and Cork.  I suppose there are 1,000,000 people living within 30 miles of here.  There are three railway stations, a port and an airport, and it is the capital city and seat of Government. Deputies who must stay overnight are, as far as Dublin is concerned, tourists. If somebody wants to build a hotel and if no grant is available in Dublin or in Cork he will build in Dublin because the facilities and the people are there. Everybody in Ireland at some time each year, I suppose, has business in Dublin.  The Minister should reconsider the exclusion of Cork from grants. It seems most unfair that Cork which is one-sixth or one-eighth the size of Dublin should for certain purposes be lumped with Dublin and not given grants.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Connell last night said he thought Dublin was overprovided with beds.  At certain times I suppose every hotel is full and there are times when every area seems to be overprovided with beds.  In various locations we seem to be providing beds on a peak period basis.  As regards the sad decline in tourism this year I am willing to accept the Minister's statement that we should wait until October before deciding that the year was a flop from a tourism point of view.  The 4.6 per cent or 6.8 per cent growth which the Minister quotes for the first six months is very gratifying, but it was the result of the tremendous effort put in last autumn and winter by various tourist organisations and hoteliers on their own behalf to drum up off-season business for winter sports here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country can never compete with the Spanish Costa del Sol or the French Riviera in providing sunshine but we <Col N="1853" /> have other things to offer.  I think we could make tourism most valuable in the autumn and spring when this country is much more attractive and there is much more to do here than in other parts of Europe.  This year that was obviously happening.  The regional boards and others interested in promoting their own centres brought in people in the off-season and this accounts for the 4.6 increase.  Speaking to managers of various tourist boards, not just in my own region, I find that the number of cancellations between mid-May and the end of June was phenomenal and the number of inquiries in that period was down by one-third or 40 per cent.  All the good work done in the early part of the year to bring in tourists was nullified by the June figures.  I do not know whether trade will pick up again in this and the remaining months.  I hope it will.  I am willing to wait until the final figures are available before passing judgment on this season.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at the position of Cork city and to provide some grants as an incentive for people who want to build hotels there. Those who go into the hotel business in Cork should not be legislated against and treated in the same way as the people in Dublin where many considerations apply that do not apply in Cork.  Cork is not the capital city.  There are other sectors and areas of Government control where this discrimination arises.  I do not say there is a conspiracy but there is certainly a shrugging of shoulders and an idea that Cork is all right, that it can look after itself.  If this trend continues and is extended to all other Government Departments there will be no Cork, because it will have been wiped out. There is no reason why anybody should come there either to provide industries or hotels.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Labour a question here last year about AnCO in Cork.  He mentioned Galway and other places.  I have no objection to Galway, the Shannon region and the Dublin region coming before Cork, but the Minister's attitude and that of the Government seems to be that Cork is able to look after itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1854" /> I should like to see the guesthouse allowances increased.  We have possibly, although this would not apply over the whole country, enough Grade A and Grade B bedrooms.  With the advent of car ferries, many people coming over here are not interested in staying in the better-class hotels but want good, clean accommodation, bed and breakfast and to be able to move on a day or two later to some other part of the country.  For that reason people should be encouraged to provide guesthouse accommodation at reasonable rates.  The building of more big hotels should be discouraged and grants provided in respect of guesthouse accommodation up to Bord Fáilte standards.</P>
    <P>Holiday cottages are a new development in tourism here.  The Shannon development region was the first to do this but I believe there is another one, a ten-cottage one, on the shores of Lough Ree.  I cannot see why a minimum of ten units must be registered with Bord Fáilte.  The Minister says here:</P>
    <P>The regulations will require a minimum of ten separate units for letting to tourists to qualify for registration. Thus a person with one or two houses for holiday letting will not be required to meet the registrations standards...</P>
    <P>If people want to register and if they have not ten units they should be allowed to do so.  What the Minister seems to be doing is excluding them from the Bord Fáilte register and only catering for companies or firms of developers who can provide a ten-unit site with cottages on it.</P>

      <P>Fair enough.  I shall accept it if it is down to one.  I said in reference to a reply to a Parliamentary question a few weeks ago that it was too late to try to bring up the figures for the tourist industry for this year, that something should have been done long before that.  The problem was there long before June.  The figures were down in June but it could have been foreseen as far back as February that there would be a problem here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>How could you foresee the cancellation of bookings? The main tenet of the Deputy's opening remarks was that due to the generation of activity by the regional companies bookings were up and that it was a sudden and unforeseen cancellation of bookings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Inquiries were down as far back as last March for a number of reasons, most of which were outside the control of the Minister or Bord Fáilte, but something should have been done to counteract that.  Last year the Minister gave the board an extra £250,000 but with the increased cost of advertising in England and so on this meant that the board could do less advertising this year than last year. While the actual amount of money they got shows an increase on the books it allowed them to do less than last year.  An effort should have been made here in February or in March to counteract the position arising from things like the change of the travelling allowance in England and the problems in the North of Ireland, which obviously were going to affect tourism here.  Over last winter a campaign should have been mounted in England to show that people would be safe in coming to this part of the country for <Col N="1858" /> holidays.  We must face up to the fact that the high cost of drink and petrol is deterring tourists from coming here. The Government instead of trying to counteract these high prices increased them by imposing the extra turnover tax.  Nothing could be done about the recession in America but this was known about since January, 1969, and no effort was made to counteract its effects.  The changed policy of charter flights was another factor.  These things did not spring up on 1st June, they were known last winter.  Primarily I think the Minister must accept responsibility for this, for not giving extra money to Bord Fáilte to allow them to mount a campaign which would help to counteract, to some degree at least, these factors.</P>
      <P>In regard to the two extra directors who are to be appointed to the board I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the board should be completely restructured. These two new directors should in some way be involved in tourism.  It is very difficult with two members to bring them on from one interest because then you are excluding others but some method should be found of getting a representative from the regional tourist boards.  There is a certain amount of suspicion on both sides, between the boards and Bord Fáilte and this would help to overcome that.  I do not know if the Minister has two specific individuals in mind, or organisations from which he intends to invite nominations, but I suggest that he should include one member from the regional boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point which must be covered by anybody interested in tourism is the comparison between the amount of money which tourism generates and the expenditure on tourism.  On that basis, £11 million is ridiculously low.  Most of it I suppose is spent on the salaries of the people who run the board and on loans which are repayable at a later period.  As far as the running of the board is concerned, I do not think they are doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of trying to find out what type of staff is required to do the best job because we have now <Col N="1859" /> reached the stage where Parkinson's law seems to be developing at an enormous rate in Bord Fáilte.  We have appointments being made and then jobs found to fit the appointments.  It is time that a good hard look was taken at this position.</P>
    <P>Tourism is too important to the country to be played around with as a jobs-for-the-boys matter.  If the Minister is serious he must see this and try to arrest the trend.  We spoke a lot about the Common Market and many of us came to the conclusion that if we got into it tourism will be one of the mainstays of the country.  This country has something to offer to tourists&mdash;something which even Common Market countries cannot excel.  That being so, the Minister would have been justified in looking for double the amount which he is looking for and I do not think he would have met with any objection to that.  The situation as it stands is rather ridiculous.  We have a sizeable board, The people running it are supposed to be top line people but the rate of expenditure exceeds the amount of the grant.  When people look for grants, which are advertised widely as being available, they find that the money available has already been tied up for a number of years in advance and they are told that the grants are not available.  Something will have to be done to put the thing back on the rails.</P>
    <P>At present Bord Fáilte are just not facing up to the requirements which were laid down for them.  The Minister seems a bit surprised at comments about the drop in tourist figures for June.  Various reasons were given for the reduction.  The trouble in the north is the usual one.  The high cost of drink, food and accommodation is another favourite, but might I suggest that allied to the troubles in the north are the troubles in this part of the country.  This was one reason we had such a drastic fall.  It is a reason which we would like to forget if we could but we cannot.  If many people throughout the world know about Ireland at all they think of it as one country and the Six Counties and the Republic does not make any sense to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> People who do know and who have been in the habit of visiting Ireland for their holidays shied away from the Six Counties because of the troubles there last year and this year.  When they found a similar type of trouble being advertised as happening here&mdash; whether it happened or not is something which eventually we will have to find out, it will be some months yet before we find out whether there is any truth in the rumours&mdash;they shied away from here.  The fact that this was publicised did affect tourism and it affected the position particularly in Great Britain because many people who had already booked shied off at the last minute.  Many people in the Six Counties who had booked for holidays here also shied off.  However, I am glad to be able to tell the Minister, if he does not know, that over the last week the position has improved very considerably, particularly as far as northern tourists are concerned.  We now find that many people who cancelled bookings earlier changed their minds, apparently because of the relative peace down here at present and because the people here seem to be getting sane again.  It looks now as if we are not going to have a revolution in the Republic, at any rate until the summer is over, and so they can safely come into the Republic and have their holidays.</P>

      <P>I agree.  We appear to be getting a number of tourists from the north and from Britain and let us hope nothing happens between now and the end of the season to interfere with that trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of a regional tourist board, but that does not make me an expert.  Some people who are connected with tourism seem to think that that connection makes them experts.  It is <Col N="1861" /> ridiculous to advertise tourist facilities and spend sizeable sums in the process in countries from which we get half a dozen tourists in the year.  Our main market is much nearer home and, if we concentrate on this market, we will be doing a good job.  There is a holiday camp in my constituency.  It concentrates on tourists from across the water and from across the border.  They come in large numbers.</P>
    <P>For the amount of money this holiday camp spends on advertising and tourist promotion the number of people brought in is quite fantastic as compared with the number brought in by Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte spend far more money but do not get the same results. It is like the boy who went fishing: when he fished in a stagnant pool he caught nothing because there were no fish to catch but, when he went to a trout stream, he caught plenty of fish. Bord Fáilte should start fishing in the streams in which there are tourists.  If they do they will get better results.</P>
    <P>I was agreeably surprised to find that the number of tourists from France is growing.  When I was in that country a few weeks ago I found that the tourist board were doing an excellent job in tourist promotion there.</P>
    <P>With regard to hotel accommodation and guesthouses, we appear to have reached the limit where grade A accommodation is concerned and further expenditure on hotels of that type is just throwing money away.  All one need do to get the picture is check with the hotels to find how many are unable to fill their beds, even during the peak season.</P>

      <P>There are some hotels which cater exclusively for American tourists.  This type of tourist traffic seems to be operating reasonably well. The American tourists do not consider the prices for hotel accommodation excessive. Some of our nationals who go abroad on holiday are often surprised to discover how costly overnight accommodation can be.  The fact is that tourism is mainly aimed at Americans. <Col N="1862" /> Because of the high cost of hotel accommodation in the USA, costs elsewhere appear reasonable to Americans. Secondly, accommodation is much cheaper for a group.  I regard £8 for a very small bedroom, without breakfast, as far too high.  The accommodation is not luxury accommodation.  The bedroom is about one-third the size of what a bedroom would be in an ordinary suburban home.  It is scandalous for hotels which regard themselves as grade A to charge £8 for such accommodation.  It is something which has caused complaint to be made about hotel accommodation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medium sized hotels and guesthouses are doing an excellent job.  Prices have gone up considerably.  Prices have been raised three times since the spring in a number of the smaller hotels.  I am told the reason is because they attempted to renovate and the conditions on which they could obtain financial accommodation for this purpose from Bord Fáilte were laid down and more money had to be spent than was reasonably necessary.  The standards required were so high that they simply had to charge very high prices for the accommodation in order to recoup the expenditure.  I have had personal experience of this.  Someone asked my advice in connection with the erection of a guesthouse.  The estimate was £15,000 and Bord Fáilte gave the OK. Three times during the construction a Bord Fáilte architect visited and made major changes in the original plans. The final bill came to £21,000.  Naturally the contractor felt that he should charge a substantial sum for all the odds and ends which had to be included. The original scheme would not have cost anything like £21,000.  The only effect of the changes was to improve the décor.  This is where Bord Fáilte are overdoing things.  They insist on an impossibly high standard and the cost of providing that standard is so high that the cost to the customer must be high also.  When the whole thing was finished Bord Fáilte notified the owner that the guesthouse was being graded &ldquo;C&rdquo;.  That did not help the temper of the person who had built it.  There was a row.  Bord Fáilte inspected again and the guesthouse was properly graded.  That sort of thing does <Col N="1863" /> not help those interested in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister made a comment here which, I think, he should not have made.  On reflection, he may wish to withdraw it.  It was all the more annoying in that a similar comment was made by another Minister at a later stage.  The comment was that the proposed increases in the cost of guesthouses and hotel accommodation next year were being forced through by a number of unionised hotels around the city, the obvious inference being that it was the trade unionists employed in those hotels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Grants to seaside resorts and to major and minor resorts have been under consideration for quite some time.  Why does the money appear to be promised to the major resorts, who can overspend, while the minor resorts are left out in the cold?  During the summer, it is quite common to have a number of day trippers to the seaside resorts where I live.  There is not enough tourist accommodation there because it has been impossible to get from the tourist board the necessary money to develop the area.  The local people, through a development association, have beautified the place with the assistance of the county council.  At night, men and women paint, clean, plant flowers and so on.  We have the odd vandal who will damage overnight what has been accomplished by hard work and who, if he has a few drinks on him, thinks it is funny to do such damage.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider an alteration in the regulation to include a grant for the setting up of restaurants. A considerable number of smaller resorts have a fairly large amount of bed and breakfast accommodation but that is of very little use to people with no mode of conveyance who leave the premises after breakfast and do not get another meal there until the following morning.  Such people are really stuck if there is no restaurant within easy access where they can get meals other than their breakfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any way in which the tourist board can assist in the provision of toilet accommodation in crowded seaside resorts?  It is absolutely ridiculous that in some seaside resorts the nearest toilet accommodation is in a town several miles away. Think of the position of the crowds there on a summer Sunday afternoon. Even in some of the villages where public toilets are provided they are usually intended to cater for a relatively small number of people.  If they are used by a large number of people, it means that not alone are they inadequate but they completely spoil the whole area for everybody <Col N="1865" /> else's enjoyment.  In conjunction with the local authority, the Minister's Department might consider some scheme for necessary toilet accommodation in such areas.</P>
    <P>The whole tourist position of this country must be reviewed.  I addressed a question to the Minister yesterday about the Joyce Tower.  He said Bord Fáilte were considering the provision of £50,000 for a Joyce museum.  Among certain sections of the community and among a certain section of our visitors there is a very great interest in Joyce and in his works.  Incidentally, £25,000 of that sum would go for a house beside the Tower which would appear to indicate that somebody is attempting to get a lot of money for very little.</P>
    <P>Is this sort of thing justified?  The Eastern Regional Tourism Board are particularly anxious that this should be done.  My personal view is that with a limited amount of money to spend on tourism we are spending that sum of £50,000 on something which will be appreciated by a relatively small group, whereas large groups of people are left without the ordinary amenities because money is not available.  My question yesterday was for the purpose of discovering if this sum of £50,000 from Bord Fáilte's funds would affect any further payment to the regional board at a later stage.  If a board get a considerable sum under any heading, it is only reasonable to say to them, when they come looking for more money: &ldquo;You got that amount.  We cannot continue to hand out money to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that the regional boards in general are not doing the job they were set up to do.  In many cases there is a duplication of work. The Dublin board are operating here and the Eastern Regional Board covers an area with the exception of Dublin. Why was a separate board set up for Dublin and another separate board for the eastern region surrounding Dublin? They deal in the main with the same type of tourist who comes either from Dublin Airport or through Dún Laoghaire and who spends time in the city of Dublin and its neighbourhood.  The obvious thing is to try to find some <Col N="1866" /> type of co-operation between the various boards, to cut out the boards that are unnecessary and to have the tourist board do certain specified things.</P>
    <P>I was informed recently that the tourist boards had gone into the system of marketing.  A workshop was held in London at which a number of the tourist organisations were represented. At first it was not supposed to be for the purpose of selling tourism, and then it was.  A number of tourist representatives both public and private &mdash;let me say an enormous number of public tourist representatives&mdash;appear to have gone over there.  Other workshops have been held in Europe.  Recently there was some type of function in Japan.  I believe we were nearly the best represented nation at that function in Japan.  At the expense of Bord Fáilte, an enormous number of people travelled out there.  Japan is a very nice place and I should love to go there, but I do not think I should expect public funds to pay for me.</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible for tourism and he will eventually have to carry the can.  It is only right that he should be made aware of what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional boards have tourist information offices and development offices around the country.  The regional tourist information offices are few and far between.  Somebody said they are like angels' visits.  Sometimes they are sited in good places and sometimes not in the best places.  They are supposed to hand out literature.  This is true of all the tourist information offices: they have a certain amount of what they call saleable literature, for which a <Col N="1867" /> price is charged.  Those in charge of the offices seem to be much better pleased if they sell a few pounds worth of literature rather than hand out the big amount of free literature which the various tourist organisations make available to them.</P>
    <P>That is wrong.  If I go as a tourist to a country and I ask for tourist information, I expect to get it free.  If I am asked to pay for it, I consider that the people who are trying to sell it do not know their job.  Here it seems to be the thing to do, to sell tourist information literature.</P>
    <P>I am a trade union official and, therefore, I feel very strongly about this.  The offices are manned, if &ldquo;manned&rdquo; is the word, by boys or girls who are paid about £10 a week. They work from about 9 a.m. to about 5.30 or 6 p.m.  There is no double shift work and there is no Sunday opening. In some offices there is no Saturday opening.  If the Minister were going around this country or any country and he wanted some tourist information, like myself, he would not start looking for it until about 5 or 6 p.m. By that time, the tourist information offices are closed because there is only one person manning them and he has gone home because he has already punched in more hours than he should.</P>
    <P>If you go to a tourist information office on a Sunday and find it closed, you get the impression that tourists are not being catered for very well.  I suggest that a special allocation should be made for the manning of those offices and for keeping them open fairly late. If they did not open so early in the morning, or if they were not open for a period during the middle of the day, they could be open in the evening. They should also be open on Sundays. I suggest a double shift is the only way in which this could be done.  That would cost more money but surely, during the summer season, £10 a week is a small sum if it has some effect.</P>
    <P>The tourist information office in Dublin Airport is leased by the eastern region.  About 12 months ago facilities in the airport were improved and the eastern region got a better office but <Col N="1868" /> they have to pay a fantastic sum for it.  I would imagine that Bord Fáilte are giving a very good service to the airport but that did not seem to count because they had to pay just the same.</P>
    <P>Very many of the people who come into Dublin Airport or Dún Laoghaire are only passing through.  We have to provide the services for them at the two entrances.  They are supplied with the literature and whatever information they require, and they drive straight through our region down to the south or the west.  Despite this the Eastern Regional Tourist Organisation get a smaller allocation of money than any of the other regions.  This is wrong. Some effort should be made to ensure that an adequate amount of money is made available.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is not the proper place to raise the next matter but I think it should be raised, that is, the question of budgets.  When a budget is being drawn up surely it is ridiculous that any region should be asked to budget for a deficit.  Despite the falling value of money, despite the increase in salaries, despite the increase in various costs, the amount of money made available by Bord Fáilte to the regions is not sufficient and, therefore, the directors must sit down and solemnly budget for a deficit.  At the end of the year if they have overspent by a substantial sum, Bord Fáilte must provide that money because there is no other way for them to get it.</P>
    <P>There is something called an investment plan under which officers of the board go around and ask people such as business men for money.  I disagree entirely with that.  That idea is all wrong.  People should not be asked to hand out money, in addition to everything else, for the running of the board.  In my opinion it lowers the dignity of the board to have officials going to hoteliers or publicans and saying: &ldquo;Please will you give me £5, £10, £15 or £20 or whatever it is? We cannot run the tourist organisation unless we get money.&rdquo;  That is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in two or three <Col N="1869" /> different ways.  It may be said that this money is given willingly.  Firms, particularly those making big profits, find it quite easy to cover it.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners are aware of how this works.  It does not cost them very much and they feel it is a gesture of goodwill.  An officer should not have the job of doing this, and that is not the way our tourist organisation should be financed.  The Minister might have a look at the way the regional boards are run and how they are financed.  This system is all wrong.</P>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting putting two extra members on the board.  I do not know how the board was originally selected.  I cannot blame the Minister if it is not functioning properly.  May I suggest that the Minister should put on the board someone who knows something about tourism?</P>

      <P>We have reached the stage where only experts can do the job.  This morning, on the Finance Bill, we had various people expressing views. Some of them knew what they were talking about and some of them did not, but were just chancing their arm. When a job has to be done, if somebody has expert knowledge, he is the person to be appointed.  Two additional members are being appointed. Irrespective of the party they support or what their job is, persons who know tourism and can be of assistance, are the persons to put on the board.</P>
      <P>Tourism is such a vast subject that we could spend a long time dealing with it.  I have given the Minister my views, not in a carping or critical way, as I hope he understands.  I will conclude by saying I believe tourism is so important, not only now but for the future, that much more money must be made available if we are to get the returns we hope for.  I think the investment will be repaid a thousandfold if the business is properly run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been concentrating on summer tourism.  A bad mistake was made last year.  We thought we could carry on with summer tourism without bothering to spend much money, that we had it &ldquo;sewn up,&rdquo; and an effort was made in certain areas to <Col N="1870" /> build up winter tourism.  We have much to offer winter tourists but the backbone of tourism is the summer season.  We should ensure that we do not lose the summer tourists by trying to grab something which may eventually be a money-spinner but at present is pretty slow.  That is a good policy. I hope the Minister will give the personal attention needed to ensure that tourism is a success.  Successive Ministers have been saying: &ldquo;That is a matter for Bord Fáilte&rdquo; and are sitting back.  If Bord Fáilte made a mistake, that was their funeral.  One could not get a question answered here on the subject.  Deputy Murphy's questions about how money was distributed to guesthouses and hotels were always brushed off on the ground that this was not a matter for the House but a matter for Bord Fáilte.  The Minister must take responsibility himself and if he takes this personal interest he will be doing a very good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Bord Fáilte for the magnificent work they have been doing to promote tourism. The Minister has clearly indicated the dramatic progress made in 11 years. He pointed out that in 1959 £500,000 was made available to the board: and that today the figure has now reached over £5 million.  That is a very significant contribution to this important industry.</P>
      <P>An Opposition speaker earlier drew attention to his own constituency in regard to the administration of grants. I suggest there is a certain amount of discrimination not only against Cork but also against Dublin city.  In his statement, the Minister said that grants of up to 30 per cent were provided in the west and up to 20 per cent in other areas, subject to the exclusion of certain locations such as Dublin and Cork.  He has not given valid reasons for the exclusion of these important centres.  Dublin city has grown as an urban entity in the last ten to 20 years. In 1948-49 when another Government were in office a magnificent plan was put forward by Bord Fáilte for the development of the North Bull Island. Dublin Corporation were to be the developing agents.  Apparently, that was abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> Reference has been made to the paucity of grants in other areas for the development of amenities.  While some areas have been splendidly developed, apparently the policy of the board is to concentrate attention on seaside resorts and other areas to the exclusion of large urban districts.  I think the Minister should suggest that the board should rethink their policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a slight recession has set in during the past few months due to factors mentioned here: the increase in travel allowances in England, economic conditions in America and our own problems here. I entirely disagree with the reference made by Deputy Tully to the fact that matters that were the subject of discussion here some months ago contributed to the extent he suggested.  The Opposition had a responsibility in that period not to behave as they did: they kept us here for a weekend debate and ensured that world communications media were brought here to&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;exaggerate the situation at that time.  Deputy Tully said that people coming to Ireland regard the country as one unit.  I think events in the past 12 months have clearly shown that there is a political problem here. It is tragic that these happenings occurred, but they were inevitable because of the political situation.  I hope that, as time passes, we shall be able to solve that political problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad that steps are being taken to counter this temporary recession by an appeal to the Irish people to spend their holidays at home.  I understand that about £35 million to £40 million &mdash;and it may be much more&mdash;is being spent by Irish holiday-makers abroad. The hotel industry have a responsibility to try to ensure in their costings that they will get a larger share of the home market.  I do not know the current figure of Irish holiday-makers going abroad but I think public representatives, and particularly those in Dublin, find that the spring and early summer is one of the busiest periods with regard to applications for passports. Most of us like to go abroad once in a while but nowdays <Col N="1872" /> people seem to think they should go away for holidays even though they have not spent a holiday in their own country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Bord Fáilte, even at this late stage, are directing their propaganda towards our own people. I have a little criticism to make in regard to the national television service. Last Sunday I listened to a news broadcast in which reporters were interviewing people leaving the country after spending a holiday here.  I do not know if these people were selected or taken at random but the emphasis was on the suggestion that our prices for goods and services were much higher than they should be.  The people interviewed were going back to a country where inflation has set in during the past few months and the general economic situation has deteriorated.  The cost of food and other goods and services has risen.  It was not very helpful to have our own national communications organisation disseminating news of that kind.  Substantial sums of money have been provided by the community and it should be more sensitive in putting up programmes, particularly in a situation where the hotel industry is going through a slight period of recession.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is encouraging the development of cottage-type accommodation.  There are areas contiguous to Dublin city, and very nice rural areas in County Dublin and even in Counties Meath and Kildare where groups should be helped to develop this type of accommodation.</P>
    <P>The question of prices has been mentioned by other speakers, and I should like to join in asking the Minister to ensure that Bord Fáilte, in so far as they have any function, will keep a sharp and critical eye on this trend.  People who wish to increase their prices should justify those increases either to Bord Fáilte or to the Minister himself.  A structure of prices has been published in the brochures sent out by Bord Fáilte and other agencies throughout the country.  Thus prices are clearly printed for the guidance of potential tourists.  If prices are increased during the tourist season it tends to mislead tourists and give them a bad <Col N="1873" /> impression.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the proposal for a Joyce house in Sandycove. I would join with him in asking the Minister to examine that proposal very closely.  There are other houses in this city in which Joyce lived.  There is one in Drumcondra and I am sure the owner would be interested in staking his claim that there should be a museum there also. also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but I am surprised there is no mention of grants for amenities.  Grants for amenities are just as important as grants for bed accommodation.  That is one criticism which has been levelled at the tourist resorts in my part of the country.  Apart from the dance halls and the singing pubs, night life is almost non-existent.  The Minister should use the influence he undoubtedly has with the Minister for Justice to amend the licensing laws, especially during the tourist season, to extend the hours of opening on Sunday night.  It is ridiculous that public houses should close at 10 o'clock on Sunday night.  Incidentally I am not a publican.</P>

      <P>The hours on Sunday night should be extended to at least 11.30, even if it meant closing earlier in the day from 1 to 2 p.m. or 2 to 3 p.m.  I have spoken to many publicans about this and they tell me they make as much money between 9 and 10 on Sunday night as they make in three hours earlier in the day.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider this suggestion.  It would be appreciated by everybody in the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time gambling saloons were introduced in different tourist resorts.  They have them in France and other European countries.  We should come into the seventies with the same spirit of adventure as the French, the Spaniards and the Germans.  Now that we are joining the Common Market many Europeans will be coming to this country looking for these facilities. A licence should be given to people in different localities to set up these <Col N="1874" /> saloons.  Some people might not like them but they are a tourist attraction. There are the greyhound tracks, but they only operate two nights a week. People like a little flutter whether it is at the roulette table or at the dogs.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is satisfied with Bord Fáilte but I do not think he is when he is putting two more members on the board.  I hope, as Deputy Tully says, he will appoint qualified men. The tourist business is a ruthless business and we must have experts, men with know-how who have proved themselves in other fields.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Tully said about congestion on our beaches during peak holiday periods.  The lack of toilet facilities is often commented on, especially by foreign visitors.  Bord Fáilte should introduce a scheme of mobile toilets.  There is one in Ballyheigue towards which the Kerry County Council gave a grant.  This scheme should be more widely adopted for the different beaches during the peak holiday period.  Bord Fáilte should give a grant to the local authorities to provide these mobile toilets.</P>
    <P>In regard to the registration of cottages it would seem that the small man is being squeezed out.  The brochures issued by Bord Fáilte go far and wide and only the people registered will be contacted by potential visitors. I am glad that the Minister is allowing any man who has proper facilities and the required standards to be on that list.  Some time ago in reply to a question by Deputy Donnellan the Minister said that all grants were taken up for the next three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder in what way is the money being allocated?  Is it being allocated to the large combines, the chain hotels which have been in existence for some time?  It is well known that they have bought sites in different parts of the country and have received planning permission for the last two, three or four years, but yet no hotels have been built on these sites.  Were they anticipating that this extra money would be for them, the select few?  It is a disturbing point. <Col N="1875" /> As far as I can see, some of these people were never associated with the tourist industry but suddenly they have gone into it.  Maybe it is because the grants are good and they got a tip off from somewhere.  It is very wrong that these people should have a monopoly of all the money which is going to be available for the next two years. I may be wrong about this and if I am I will retract.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell the House whether it is the chains of hotels which have this money taken up.  I do not want to mention names because the people are not here to defend themselves, but these people have got their quota and now the ordinary people are entitled to a break.  The Minister should see that as far as the allocation of money is concerned everyone will get cothrom na féinne.</P>
      <P>Another matter is Bord Fáilte's approach to planning permission.  It seems to me that they have somebody down at Baggot Street bridge watching the newspapers every morning to see if there are any planning applications in Irish, English or Spanish and immediately they see that there is an application they shoot in a letter to the Minister for Local Government and the relative planning authorities opposing this proposal.  As far as local councils are concerned the board are letting themselves down.  Recently a farmer in Ballymacelligott who is far away from any amenity, whose house is on the side of a mountain, applied for permission to build a house and Bord Fáilte objected to it.  It is about time the Minister told these people that before they object to any application to build a house they should be sure that the people involved are contravening the Planning Act.  When I was chairman of the county council I could see this developing.  I invited Bord Fáilte to send a representative to a meeting to explain why they were doing this, but they refused.  They should have been big enough to send a representative and they should be big enough to back their play.  Surely the men in Bord Fáilte should be prepared to meet elected representatives to put their case to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> Another point is that there seems to be a number of Bord Fáilte officials going around objecting to caravan parks.  With the prices being charged in hotels, caravans will be used more and more.  We will have to be geared for more caravan traffic and we will have to provide caravan parks in different amenity areas.  It is ridiculous for the board to be objecting to these parks.  I attended an inquiry down at Castlegregory at which an official from Bord Fáilte objected because he said you would see the caravans when you were swimming in the sea.  That is ridiculous.  If caravans are not put into parks they will be a hazard as far as road traffic is concerned because they will be parked beside the road and will have no parking lights.  I would ask the Minister to tell the board that they should have a more constructive approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are a number of people in Kerry and elsewhere who are waiting for money from Bord Fáilte.  Would the Minister see that they get it immediately because many of them have to pay interest on overdraft accommodation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One matter which I should like to get on record is connected with a question asked by Deputy Tully yesterday about the proposed Joyce centre at Sandycove.  I can see a situation arising in this House whereby this proposed centre could become a political plaything.  There have been many uninformed remarks about it.  There is a very important proposal before the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, at present for a Joyce centre at Sandycove in order to centralise all the Joyceiana, to bring to one place all the paraphernalia of Joyce, his literature, <Col N="1877" /> culture and so on.  There are too many houses claiming that Joyce lived there, that they have a bed on which Joyce slept and so on.  There is an offer of a first-class library for this centre in Sandycove if, and when, it opens.  Joyce has had a belated recognition in this country.  In my view £50,000 is a small sum in the context of Joycean culture.  Deputy Tully seemed to have some fault to find with this expenditure.  Is it because it is earmarked for my constituency instead of Deputy Tully's?</P>
      <P>Joyce has done a great deal for the English language.  He has, in fact, given it a new dimension.  We have an unfortunate capacity for refusing to recognise our great men, the men who have done so much in the line of cultural endeavour.  The Americans are buying up our heritage with their dollars.  That is why I urge the Minister, Deputy Tully and the Fine Gael Party to support the centralisation of Joyceiana. It is a matter of national importance to have all this memorabilia centralised in one place.  The centre in Sandycove would be a very big tourist attraction. The numbers visiting the tower are increasing every year.  There has been an increase so far even this year.</P>
      <P>There is a proposal to have a Joyce school which would operate throughout the year.  All we have at the moment is a tower.  There are fairly important items in it but, if they are not taken out of it soon, they will be affected by the damp.  The tower is not waterproof. I regard £50,000 as an initial outlay towards rescuing our national conscience in the context of Joyce as £50,000 well spent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed hotel in Dún Laoghaire, I have been accused of bringing politics into this, but I appear to be the only one who is making any effort, apart from the Fianna Fáil councillors, to bring this hotel to Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>It is not a revolutionary sentiment.  We represent the people.  The Minister has plans in front of him but I am afraid someone is dragging his feet in this.  The people in Dún Laoghaire want the hotel urgently. I urge the Minister to ensure that the hotel is started in the near future.</P>
      <P>I think many of the grants for hotel building could be directed to the training of personnel.  It is most important that we should have trained personnel. Third-rate hotels could be brought up to a higher standard if the type of service were improved.  I think Deputy O'Leary put forward this suggestion last night.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few comments.  I feel very strongly that Bord Fáilte is beginning to outlive its usefulness.  This is due primarily to the fact that there is no proper method of ensuring that the board is accountable to anybody.  This board, like many State bodies, is allowed to operate without any responsibility to anybody.  Having regard to the amount of money handled, I think this is very wrong.  It has been successful from the point of view of advertising this country.  Its marketing of holidays is generally regarded as successful.</P>

      <P>The case referred to was a summary prosecution in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court for driving without due care and attention, brought by a member of the Garda Síochána, on the directions of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The Chief State Solicitor requested a solicitor from his office, who was handling two other cases in an adjoining court on the same day, to conduct the proceedings.  During the absence of the solicitor in the adjoining court the prosecution in question came up for hearing and the district justice requested the prosecuting garda to proceed with the case.</P>

With regard to the allegation that there was no insurance, this is the first I have heard of this matter. I do not know anything about it.  The case was brought in the usual way. It was presented to the Attorney General by one of his legal assistants. The prosecution was based on the advice of the legal assistant.  It was brought and prosecuted in the usual way.</P>

The prosecution was brought in the usual way following the usual examination in the Attorney General's Office.  It was prosecuted successfully.  The aggrieved person wrote to me early in January.  In the same month unusual facilities were made available in view of the grief suffered by the person.  In view of the fact that he felt so strongly about the <Col N="1883" /> case, he was permitted to see the entire evidence in the Attorney General's Office on one afternoon, with the assistant in the Attorney General's Office. He was given every possible facility. This was a most unusual course.  He was allowed to see all the statements which were made.  The legal official in the Attorney General's Office said subsequently that if the case were again presented to him he would come to the same conclusion and would advise the Attorney General as in the first instance.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, in answering Question No. 2 the Parliamentary Secretary went as far as 1957 only and did not give the figure for the latest available date.  I rose immediately to query this and he has kept speaking since.  He did not give the figure for the latest available date <Col N="1886" /> because I took down each list of figures.  He did not give it.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report two statements, the first giving the information on incomes requested by the Deputy for 1967, 1968 and 1969, in so far as it is available, and the second showing the total number of persons at work in 1966 classified by employment status. It is not possible to state how many people are covered by each income category as some persons are recipients of more than one type of income and, in addition, some of the recipients are not in the labour force.  The data relating to incomes are available only for calendar years while the particulars by employment status are available for census of population years only.</P>

      <P>Reliable figures for net emigration are available only for the periods between successive censuses of population.  For periods since the most recent census the only indicators of net emigration are the figures for the net outward passenger movement by sea and air.  The net passenger balance for the 12-month period ending February is thought to be the best indicator of net emigration since this is least affected by differences in holiday traffic between succeeding years. For the 12-month period ending February, 1970, the net outward passenger balance by sea and air was 7,854 persons.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that, while the net passenger balance proved to be close to the net emigration recorded for earlier intercensal periods, this was not the case in the 1961-66 period.  In the 1961-66 intercensal period the net passenger balance figure was considerably in excess of the true net emigration as calculated from the census results.</P>

      <P>While it would be possible in certain cases, under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, to provide home helps as a health service in the circumstances <Col N="1894" /> mentioned in the question, I should say that the service will not come into operation until 1st April, 1971, and that the range which can be provided from that date will necessarily have to be phased to take account of the personnel and finance available to health boards and to the high priority which must be given to care of the aged and of the handicapped living at home.</P>
      <P>An inquiry made by my Department late in 1967 indicated that there did not seem to be a demand either for nursery schools or crèches outside the cities of Dublin and Cork.  In Dublin I am aware that, apart from a number operated privately, four crèches or day nurseries provided by voluntary organisations or religious bodies with approximately 120 places have been in operation for some time, that a fifth with approximately 20 places was started recently and that a sixth, with approximately 40 places, is in process of being established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will comment on the reported statement of the chief psychiatrist of the Dublin Health Authority on 16th July, 1970, that the authority had totally failed to create a service for geriatric patients and for the adult mentally handicapped, that the authority was facing the problem a decade behind the time and that it will be five times more difficult to get nurses to work in the conditions applying in the future; and what action he proposes to take to remedy the serious deficiencies in accommodation and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen press reports of a recent meeting of the Dublin Health Authority which attributed to <Col N="1895" /> the chief psychiatrist of that authority the statements referred to by the Deputy.  So far as these statements may be taken as being critical of the work of the Dublin Health Authority it is, of course, primarily a matter for that authority, rather than the Minister for Health to deal with it.</P>
      <P>As a general comment, I think it is true to say that no country, including those far wealthier than we are, would claim that they have reached a stage where they are fully satisfied with the services that they provide for geriatrics and for the adult mentally handicapped. The chief psychiatrist referred in the quotation to deficiencies in services. The Deputy, I note, puts accommodation before services.  There are undoubtedly defects in the quality of some of the accommodation available under public authority and voluntary agencies in Dublin but the problem in the case of geriatrics is more one of developing community supportive services rather than merely adding to the number of institutional beds.  Indeed, the statistics available to me make it clear that institutional places in Dublin are on a level considerably in excess of the provision in other parts of the country and approaching double the target indications proposed in the Report on the Care of the Aged.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the improvement of the geriatric services, the Report on the Care of the Aged is being actively considered both in my Department and by the various authorities concerned.  The programme which I hope to see put into action in this area of growing importance in our health and welfare services, is one to which I attach great importance and I shall be announcing the action to be taken as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the mentally handicapped, the Dublin Health Authority in common with all health authorities in the country avail of the institutional services provided by voluntary bodies. The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap examined all aspects of the services for the mentally handicapped and recommended that there should be 2,500 places for adults centred at the special residential institutions under the control of these voluntary bodies.  Over <Col N="1896" /> 1,750 of these places have already been provided and when the schemes at present in progress or in planning are completed the commission's targets for residential accommodation for the adult mentally handicapped at the special centres will be met.  In the Dublin area 180 additional places are being provided for adults at these centres.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Inquiry saw no objection in principle to the provision of long-term care for the adult mentally handicapped in conjunction with the long-term care of the mentally ill at district mental hospitals provided it would be possible to make available suitable and separate living accommodation for the mentally handicapped. At present, there is a scheme in planning for St. Ita's, Portrane, which is aimed at providing this type of separate accommodation for the adult mentally handicapped.  The Dublin Health Authority are examining as a matter of urgency the possibility of the immediate transfer from St. Ita's of geriatric patients who do not require the services of a mental hospital so as to provide alternative accommodation for mentally handicapped patients at present housed in unsatisfactory wards.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that with the participation of voluntary bodies and health authorities in the services and the extension and improvement of facilities, including the provision of trained staff, a satisfactory service will be provided for the adult mentally handicapped in the Dublin area and in the country generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In thanking the Minister for his detailed reply may I put it to him that the very trenchant criticism by the chief psychiatrist, Dr. Ivor Browne, contained a great deal of objective analysis of the very significant deficiencies of the psychiatric, geriatric and mental handicap services in the Dublin area and therefore would the Minister make a very special attempt to keep these services, their reform and development under very urgent review having regard to the increase in the number of elderly persons in the population of Dublin and the substantial services currently being developed in the country?</P>

Is it not also a fact that the chief psychiatrist does not agree with the view expressed that there are more than enough places for both psychiatric and mentally retarded patients in the Dublin region, and that he had a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the Dublin Health Authority simply because he could not have a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the Minister and for no other reason?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in order to reduce the burden on nursing personnel and disturbance to patients, he will ensure that accommodation, separate from the geriatric units in county homes, is provided to cater for those who at present seek shelter in county homes on a short term basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is accepted that it would be preferable that casuals of the type referred to in the question should be catered for elsewhere than in county homes, the Deputy will appreciate that in many instances this would not be feasible.  Thus in three county homes I have been considering recently, the average number of admissions weekly was three, four and six and cost of the establishment and staffing of separate accommodation for such small numbers would be prohibitive. Where the numbers involved are large, as in Dublin, health authorities have set up such separate accommodation, not staffed by nursing personnel, and where voluntary bodies provide night shelters as portion of their normal activities, the services of such voluntary bodies are availed of by health authorities.</P>
      <P>The position is being kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in some county homes where there is no separate accommodation the figures are much higher than those he mentioned?  Would he also agree that casual people may sometimes come in, possibly in an inebriated condition, at night and may have to be accommodated in wards where there are old <Col N="1899" /> people who are trying to sleep and that this disrupts patients and nursing staff who may have to receive them at 4 a.m. if they arrive at that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Registration is, of course, a matter for An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>In so far as general-trained nurses are concerned I understand that hundreds of applications for registration are concentrated in the period immediately following the qualifying examinations which are held twice a year.  These applications naturally take some time to process but I am asking the board to review the position and see what could be done to expedite the issue of certificates in those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to public health nurses there are at present two main ways of achieving registration.  The first way is by means of a special training course and examination.  Certificates are issued in those cases the following day after the examination results are announced. The second way is on the basis of experience and service.  This is a concession given in 1966 for those nurses who applied for registration as a public health nurse before 1st June, 1970, and who had prior to the 31st May, 1966, a total of five years experience on this work.  The processing of these applications <Col N="1900" /> has necessarily been time-consuming and some delays were inevitable. The net current position is that all certificates which could be issued have been issued or will issue this week.  Correspondence in regard to the remaining cases is proceeding.</P>

    <P>On the instructions of the Government the Irish Delegation at the United Nations cosponsored resolution 2603A adopted on 16th December, 1969 at the 24th Session of the General Assembly which declared any chemical and biological agents of warfare as contrary to the recognised rules of international law as embodied in the Geneva Protocol of 1925.  I might add that the Government have supported at the United Nations General Assembly, at the International Conference on Human Rights at Teheran in 1968 and at the International Red Cross Conference in Istanbul in 1969 the relevant resolutions on Human Rights in Armed Conflicts.</P>
    <P>In regard to future policy I can assure the Deputy that the Government will pursue their efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere to promote effective international measures for updating and strengthening the international conventions on the law of war.</P>
    <P>Apart from the law of war I might add Ireland has taken an active part in promoting effective disarmament measures.  The most important Irish initiative in this field dealt with the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The marketing activities of Bord Fáilte are financed from the grant-in-aid for administration, operational and general expenses of the board.  The level of funds to be provided for this grant-in-aid in the current year is £2.95 million, an increase of £200,000 on the 1969-70 figure.  I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the provision allocated by them for marketing in the current year is £1,786,000 as compared with £1,916,000 for last year but that the decrease in this provision is more than offset by the amount provided for development.  The allocation of the grant-in-aid funds for administration, operational and general expenses of Bord Fáilte is, of course, a matter for the board.  As marketing and development activities are closely inter-related in the overall tourist promotional field it is not really meaningful to consider them separately.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the House, Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation have agreed to submit to me as soon as possible reports in relation to the development of tourism for the next five years and, in the light of these reports, I will be reviewing the outlook for tourism for the coming years.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The effect of the provision, however, was that, in 1909 and for long afterwards, a person who had no means whatever received exactly the same pension as a person who had means assessed up to the limit for maximum pension.  One of the many improvements which have been made in the old age pension code in recent years is that those who have no means now get a higher rate of pension than those who have means.</P>

      <P>There are at present seven officers in my Department who are working full time in the field of organisation and methods (O and M). The work has also the part-time attention of supervising officers.</P>
      <P>Because much of the work of the O and M officers in my Department is carried out for other Departments, frequently on a team basis with O and M staff in these Departments, I think I should explain that, in the Civil Service as a whole, there are 45 officers engaged full time on O and M and two occupied part time, aside from supervisory staff.</P>
      <P>The type of work done up to the present in the field of O and M has been the investigation of systems and procedures and the examination of organisation structures in various sections of the Civil Service, both indoor and outdoor, and the presentation of recommendations and advice to management designed to increase efficiency.  In the examination of procedures, O and M keeps abreast of the constant progress in the field of office machinery, conducts tests on newly-developed machines and promotes the use in the Civil Service of suitable modern office machinery of proven performance.  The development of automatic data processing and computers in the Civil Service, which now constitutes a specialised field in itself, originated from activities of an O and M character.</P>

      <P>Considerable difficulty is experienced by parents in getting their children into primary school.  A number of them avail of the opportunity of sending children of three, four and five years to these nursery schools. It helps to alleviate the overcrowding, particularly in the Dublin area, of these schools.  Surely there is a responsibility on the Minister's Department to ensure that these schools are properly run not only by qualified people but by people <Col N="1925" /> who will not undermine the character of children of that age?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if it is intended to develop and extend the mussel industry in Cromane, Killorglin, County Kerry by the induction of sufficent money to plant all the mussel seed which is available in Castlemaine harbour and which is going to waste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of years past my Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in association with the local fishermen's co-operative society have been actively engaged in the transplantation of seed mussels in Castlemaine Harbour to areas in the harbour where fattening conditions are more <Col N="1929" /> favourable and it is intended that this work will be continued.  Since 1961 the State subvention of the cost of mussel transplantation in this area has been in the region of £8,000 and a further subvention is being made towards the cost of this work in the current year. An average of about 1,500 tons per year of mussels have been relaid in recent years and it is expected that a further 3,000 tons will be relaid this year.  The success of this rehabilitation programme can be judged from the statistics of mussel landings which have risen from 15,000 cwt. valued at £7,600 in 1966 to 53,000 cwt. valued at £32,000 in 1969.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if and when it is intended to develop the vast potential for employment that is available by developing our fishing industry on European lines and so get a part of the vast market that is available for fish products in the Common Market countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of our fishing industry is already proceeding along the lines indicated in the Government White Paper entitled Programme of Sea Fisheries Development, published in April, 1962, and in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, published in March, 1969, and the results so far achieved are very satisfactory.  Since 1962, the value of our fish landings has increased by 100 per cent, and the value of exports by about 120 per cent.  In 1969, the actual value of landings of fish &mdash; excluding salmon &mdash; at almost £3 million and of all fishery exports at £3.5 million were all-time records.  The market outlets abroad for our fish are increasing and, while Britain continues to be our largest customer, considerable exports are made to the EEC, particularly to France, Germany and the Netherlands.  In fact, the exports to the EEC are achieved in the face of various import restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a town like Kells is at a disadvantage because, if a person intends to establish an industry in that general area, he will choose an area where he can get a higher grant?  In the case of Kells this might be seven or eight miles away in County Cavan. Kells is, therefore, at a great disadvantage in attracting industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of events since 1965 indicates that North Meath has not suffered in comparison with adjoining towns in Cavan.  It may have, to a limited extent, in relation to adjoining towns in Monaghan.  The history of the development of industry in that area over the past three years does not indicate that North Meath is suffering a disadvantage.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that this is one of the factors responsible for the serious increase in crime all over the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The fact is that the strength of the Garda Síochána at present is exactly 30 below what it was on 31st March, 1957.  The biggest decrease in any three year period of those covered by the question was in the period from 1948 to 1951 when there was a decrease of 482.  I suppose that is a coincidence.  Under the Coalition Governments there was a total decrease <Col N="1936" /> of 532 in the six years they were in office.  There has been a decrease of 30 in the last 13 years. That question went wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that as motor vehicles have been increased by about 8 per cent since the war, more gardaí are required and is it not true that the only reason why the Department of Justice are not increasing the number of gardaí is that they do not <Col N="1937" /> want to pay them and they are saving on the lives and property of the people?

      <P>The Minister's reply clearly indicated that the strength of the Garda since 1951 has been decreasing steadily.  At present there has been a 12 per cent increases in crime all over the country and, in fact, a 17 per cent increase outside the Dublin metropolitan area.  Surely the Minister must agree that one of the factors involved in this increase in crime is the reduction of the strength of the Garda Síochána?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>While the crime report for the year ended 30th September, 1969, was only recently published, the salient figures from it were already known and were published from time to time.  In particular the position as disclosed by the 1969 report was known and fully adverted to in the fairly comprehensive reply given by my predecessor on 3rd March last to a similar question and to which I would refer the Deputies.</P>
      <P>An increase in crime is worldwide There is a wide variety of views, even amongst experts, as to what the reasons for this may be and possibly the only point on which there is agreement is that the increase is not due to any single cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1939" /> The deployment of the Garda force and its equipment is under continuous study in the first instance by the research and planning unit of the Garda Síochána, and changes are being made in an effort to secure maximum efficiency.  About two-thirds of all indictable crimes known to the gardaí are committed in the Dublin metropolitan area and the present strength of the Garda there is over 2,300.  The detection rate in the rest of the country is very high, averaging 80 per cent, and the change in the distribution of the force in favour of increasing the strength in Dublin and in other urban areas will have to continue.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that crime could be reduced, at least to some extent, by an increase in the Garda force, but the cost of even a marginal reduction effected by an increase in strength would be great.  I certainly do not rule out the possibility of an increase in strength, which would have to be relatively large to have, of itself, much effect, but the cost to the taxpayer would be quite considerable. At present the cost on the Exchequer is about £31 a week in pay and pensionability alone for a garda with 10 years service.  I am, therefore, seeking every reasonable alternative including the provision of additional mechanisation and radio equipment before asking for an increase that would mean a very heavy additional burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>As my predecessor indicated in reply to a supplementary question on 3rd March, an important factor in recent times in relation to Garda strength has been the necessity to supervise demonstrations of one kind or another, some of them unruly, some perhaps deliberately intended to tax the resources of the Garda, but most of them, even when peaceful, requiring the attendance of large numbers of gardaí whose presence would be required if violence broke out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is rather futile to seek to make demonstrators the scapegoat for the increase in crime in the last year? <Col N="1940" /> Further, would he not consider a detection rate of 61 per cent this year as against 66 per cent in 1963 very disquieting? Would he further consider that his policy of bringing gardaí into Dublin at the rate at which they are at present being moved in here unwise in view of the fact that last year there was an increase in crime of 17 per cent outside Dublin as against 9 per cent in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the returns for Dublin show that there are certain areas in the city which have a higher crime rate than others and would he therefore try to ensure that in these problem areas of the city, gardaí would co-operate more with welfare and youth organisations in an effort to prevent crime rather than to detect it later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Moore's question, the figures provided to me by the commissioner in his annual report deal with the Dublin metropolitan area as a whole and do not differentiate between areas in Dublin.  However, if the Deputy is interested in particular areas presumably I will be able to obtain that information for him.  In regard to the suggestion of co-operation between the gardaí and local people in an effort to prevent crime, this has always been the policy of the gardaí, which I very strongly support, because I realise and appreciate quite clearly that ultimately the most effective way of combating crime is to stamp it out before it happens rather than be faced with the situation of having to apprehend people who have committed crime.  As the Deputy is probably aware, there is a very successful juvenile liaison scheme in operation in the city of Dublin whereby gardaí co-operate with youth clubs and organisations of various kinds.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Bruton's questions, he described the detection rate, which is now 61 per cent over the country as a whole, as poor and disturbing. The fact is that this detection rate is one of the highest in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But it has been falling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but only marginally, <Col N="1941" /> due to the vast increase in crime in the city of Dublin, because two-thirds of indictable crime in this country is committed in the Dublin metropolitan area.  Outside Dublin the detection rate of indictable crime is 80 per cent, which, I can say without fear of contradiction, is the highest figure of any police force in the world.  It is a well-known fact that in a large area such as Dublin the detection rate must necessarily be lower than in rural areas or small urban areas.  The most effective way, as I pointed out in reply to the questions, that I can deal with the problem in Dublin is by continuing the policy of my predecessor to try to increase Garda strength as much as possible in the large urban areas and in Dublin in particular.</P>
      <P>With this in mind I have directed that a number of steps be carried out. One of the most important ones which have just started is the recruitment of 100 clerical assistants this year to work in Garda stations.  Up to now there has been what seems to me the rather ridiculous situation that police officers who were trained to do police work and not to do clerical or secretarial work have had to spend their entire day very often typing with one or perhaps two fingers reports which a trained typist could do in half an hour. The effect of this will be to put 100 extra men on the beat throughout the country.  I propose to recruit a further 50 clerical assistants next year.</P>
      <P>Various other efforts are being made to increase the number of gardaí on police work proper and to cut down the number of gardaí involved in a great deal of non-police duties in which they became involved over the years. I am at present conducting negotiations with several other Departments with a view to trying to free the gardaí from such work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved here is not the creation or filling of posts but, simply, the allocation of duties to members of the force, which is a matter for the commissioner.  The number of members of the force employed full-time on duties connected with drug abuse was increased from four to seven in May last.  The additional members included a BanGharda.</P>
      <P>All members of the force have the duty of enforcing the law relating to drugs, including the duty of assisting in any way necessary those members employed wholetime on that work, and all members have been so instructed. Bearing this in mind, the commissioner considers that the number employed wholetime is adequate at present, but, of course, the position will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, the commissioner considers that the number employed full time at present is adequate but the Deputy would be making a mistake if he thought that only seven members were involved in the detection of matters relating to the abuse of drugs.  Every member of the force has a duty in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that every member would have a duty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out to Deputy Cluskey in earlier supplementaries, there is no questions of only seven members of the force being engaged on this problem.  Every garda has a duty to assist in it.  I might add that I do not regard this as being primarily a Garda matter at all.  It is primarily a medical matter.  The gardaí are playing their part fully in trying to combat the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are still delays in dealing with applications in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>A special inter-departmental study group was set up by my predecessor in September, 1968, to examine the organisation and procedures of the Land Registry and to furnish recommendations as to the changes that should be made to improve the efficiency of the office.  Arising from this group's reports of November, 1968, March, 1969, and June, 1969, a major reorganisation of the office, designed to provide a structure that will be capable of giving prompt service to the public, was prepared and has now reached the stage where it is being discussed in detail with the staff associations.</P>
      <P>With regard to the mapping section, the position is that an arrears clearance premium scheme that was introduced last November has effected a considerable improvement in the output of the section, and it is expected that the work there will be up-to-date by the end of the year.  Dealings and applications of special urgency continue to receive priority treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to correction, I think the Land Registry have indicated that they would accept a dealing on an ordinary Ordnance Survey map provided that it was clearly marked and provided that when it was lodged and came to be compared by the officials in the Land Registry the boundaries tallied with those on the official map.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if it is clear and the officials are able to see the proposed subdivision clearly it will be <Col N="1946" /> accepted.  Unfortunately, the problem with subdivisions is that usually a rood or something of that nature is involved and on a six-inch scale that is very small and has to be drawn with exceptional accuracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Defence Forces recruited quite a number of the FCA personnel, particularly in the Athlone area possibly because of the fact that a considerable number of people who were members of the FCA were declared redundant in that area?  This removed an embarrassing situation.  These people were, in fact, doing ordinary guard duties and even up to last week some of the FCA were on permanent duty in Finner Camp.  Does the Minister consider that the position has improved so much that these people can now be discharged, or does he realise that because of the release of members of the FCA from full-time duties serving soldiers now have to do what used to be known as &ldquo;24 on and off&rdquo;.

I understand that the local authority is engaged in a reorganisation programme designed to meet foreseeable future needs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants have been allocated to the group and the scheme may proceed.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Kilmuckridge group water supply scheme is dependent for a source on a headworks scheme to be provided by the Wexford County Council.  Such a scheme has been the subject of discussion between technical officers of my Department and the local authority.  It is understood that the local authority's proposals in the matter will be submitted at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am given to understand by the local authority that they have long since submitted plans and that the delay is in the Minister's Department and that they are awaiting sanction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Wexford County Council recently indicated to the Department that they expected that the documentation in connection with the headworks scheme would be submitted to the Department within three weeks. I take it the Deputy is accepting that these documents are not in the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister positively assert that they are not in the Department?  My information is to the contrary.  I have also had an admission from the Minister's officials that they have the documents there but are dealing with technical difficulties.  I regret to have to inform the Minister that from his reply it appears to me that he has come in totally unbriefed to answer my question. However, as he is a new Minister I do not want to put him to any inconvenience by raising the matter on the adjournment.  If I put the question down again next week will he come in and answer it properly, please?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy suggests is absolutely ridiculous as far as I am concerned.  My Department were <Col N="1970" /> informed by telephone by Wexford County Council on 20th July, which the Deputy will admit is pretty recent information, that they expected to lodge this documentation regarding the headworks scheme in the Department within three weeks.  Unless it arrived this morning or last evening it certainly had not arrived at the time they telephoned.  They indicated then that they would have it up within three weeks.  I do not know where the Deputy is getting his information.  I suggest he should go back to the county council and check the information I am giving him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's Department informed me a fortnight ago that they had the documents there but there were technical difficulties in the way and they could not give a decision.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 26 to add &ldquo;Provided that appointments of officers shall only be made on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate the Minister saying the Local Appointments Commission would have no function in a matter of this kind, that its statutory authority does not extend to this, but it is the principle with which I am concerned. I should like to see an outside independent tribunal such as the Local Appointments Commission appoint the officers to this board.</P>
      <P>The posts that will be filled by officers will necessarily be responsible and, no doubt, highly remunerated. The board should be removed from having the responsibility for making these appointments itself.  I do not want to be understood as saying that I would not have confidence in the board's ability to make a good appointment. The Minister, I am sure, will appoint a board of a high standard; but if for any reason the Minister should make a mistake in some of the appointments he makes it could follow that the appointments made by the board would not be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>There is the further difficulty that the members of the board can be subject to lobbying by candidates for these positions.  It is all very well to prohibit canvassing for posts but this society of ours is so small that it is not possible to rule that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many officers will be involved <Col N="1976" /> we do not know.  It is for the board to specify what staff is needed, but certainly there will be a chief executive officer and a number of inspectors. These jobs will be sought after and if the board has the appointment of them the members of the board will be put in a very difficult position.  I see no reason why the Minister would not relieve the board of this distasteful duty and give it to a body which is already in existence for this specific purpose and which by common admission has worked well and has fulfilled its purpose, that is, to make appointments without fear or favour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this question before on the Committee Stage.  I did not accept the suggestion of Deputy Cooney at that stage nor do I propose to accept it now. In general I think it would be inappropriate to single out Bord na gCapall for this treatment, because it would appear to suggest that they and they alone were for some unexplained reason to be relieved of the responsibility and the obligation to appoint their own officers.</P>
      <P>However, there is also a particular reason that applies to Bord na gCapall somewhat more than it does to other such bodies.  An occasion can readily be conceived in which the services of, say, an eminent riding instructor or a person with some particular competence become available and ought to be secured by the board and secured with great expedition.  If the procedure of going to the Local Appointments Commission had to be adopted they probably would not get that man because of the procedure being somewhat cumbersome.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, with the other State bodies the method of appointment of officers is satisfactory, but the ability to grasp opportunities of securing the services of particular people at particular times applies in a special way to Bord na gCapall, and for this reason I do not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Since the members of the board are not remunerated, <Col N="1977" /> which is a matter I mentioned on the Second Stage&mdash;and personally I would prefer that they were remunerated&mdash; provision must be made in the Bill for the appointment of a chief officer of the board.  There has to be somebody there to look after the staff permanently.  This particular form of drafting relates to cases where there is a paid chairman, a chairman who is more or less in full-time attendance. Whatever about the merits of the amendment, it would be no harm if there was provision for a chief officer. There has to be a chief officer of some sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just stating what has been done up to this on similar boards.  Let me give an example.  The members of the Racing Board are not remunerated but there was a great deal of talk on the Racecourses Act of 1945 about a CEO.  If the Minister thinks about it he will realise why this should be.  I am not going to press the Minister about this amendment even though there would be time to amend the Bill.  I would prefer if the members of the board were remunerated because there might be people who would be suitable to go on the board but who could not live on the expenses which would be allowed to them.  Such a person might become an officer or he might not, but there is a serious reason for having a chief executive officer when the members of the board are not remunerated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this amendment singled out this board for special treatment over other State bodies.  Secondly that there could be a situation in regard to an appointment which this board might want to make which could not be dealt with through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission or an analogous body.  His first point that it singles out the board is true, but that is only because such an amendment was never put down in regard to the other boards and this procedure was never suggested for them; but that does not mean that <Col N="1978" /> it is now wrong just because other boards did not do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Minister's objections to this was that the method was cumbersome and I concede that and I concede what he said about appointments to local authorities, but that criticises the mechanics of the system and mechanics are something that can be corrected to ensure that if this board said to the commissioners that they wanted a riding instructor and to provide them with one right away, I am sure the commission could devise ways and means of getting that done right away.  In further answer to that, the Bill nowhere distinguishes between officers and servants.  I understand that in the local government code the distinction is that one is pensionable and the other is not.  There is no distinction made here but if the board want to classify a riding instructor from abroad as a servant and appoint him there is no objection to that.  I think that would meet the Minister's objection.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Provided however that no decision to effect such removal as aforesaid shall be taken at any meeting of the Board unless there be not less than seven members present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is just to safeguard that a caucus of the board would not do anything drastic to any of their officers or servants, that there would be seven members present and so that if such a serious decision as the dismissal of an officer was involved there would be a pretty full meeting of the board.</P>

      <P>It is of course a serious matter for the board to consider the sacking of an officer or servant but it is only one of the serious matters with which the board would have to deal and for which they would have to bear responsibility.  I do not think there is any serious precedent or serious abuse of boards in this regard. It is conceivable that circumstances <Col N="1980" /> might arise in which a sufficient number of members of the board might not be readily available to deal with a special situation and in that case the board would be powerless under this amendment.  I know that the intention is to protect the interests of the officers and servants but the obligation to do that rests on every member of the board.  As I said already, there are no examples that I am aware of, of any abuses of this arrangement in other boards similarly constituted.</P>

I concede that such inquiries are generally given to barristers but I do not think we should be tied to precedent for the sake of precedent. <Col N="1981" /> A solicitor of ten years practice is at least as competent as a barrister, possibly more so because of the nature of his business; it brings him into more contact with the public and the rough and tumble of everyday dealings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned I was referring to the non-accountability of Bord Fáilte.  I do not know how much control the board has over its executive, whether it has any control over it, whether it gives its executive any guidance as to policy or whether it makes policy.  I just do not know these things for the simple reason that it is not accountable.  In principle that is quite wrong.  A board with the sort of budget this board has should be accountable; it is very dangerous to have it unaccountable to Parliament which provides the budget.</P>
      <P>Marketing activities have been rewarded with success.  Advertising has been impressive.  I have no doubt this has contributed to the growth in tourist business over the past few years. That end of the board's activities has given general satisfaction.  We should remember, however, that a great deal of the successful marketing was not carried out by Bord Fáilte alone.  Aer Lingus must get a considerable amount of credit for their projects.  There is no way of knowing how much is due to them and how much is due to Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> Other activities of Bord Fáilte have not commended themselves generally to the people in the industry.  There is the question of grading and the inspection of hotels.  A set of arbitrary rules has been laid down.  A hotel with so many bathrooms per bedrooms will get a certain classification.  Because of its age it might not be possible for a hotel to provide the number of bathrooms per bedrooms Bord Fáilte lay down as necessary to qualify.  But, in all other aspects&mdash;general appointments, furniture, management, dining room, amenities for guests over and above bed and lodging&mdash;it could be very much a grade A establishment, but it might be designated grade B because it lacked bathrooms with bedrooms.  There has been dissatisfaction, too, with the approach of Bord Fáilte in inspecting hotels: it is felt that the approach of officials has been overbearing; that they are very conscious that they are the treasurers where the hotels are concerned and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>A further criticism is that their system of receiving applications for grants, examining these applications and paying on foot of the applications, needs to be reviewed.  We have had the situation that they ran out of money last year to the tune of £½ million which had to be provided so that Bord Fáilte could meet its commitments. There is something seriously amiss with the financial control in a body where that can happen to that appalling extent.  This stems from the lack of accountability to some independent tribunal&mdash;let it be to this House or to the Comptroller and Auditor General or through some other system.  I believe that lack of accountability is directly responsible for any financial trouble in which Bord Fáilte may have found itself.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is satisfied with the board itself.  From his speech, it would appear that he is not satisfied.  He makes the remark that the existing board has done a magnificent job but that he is convinced it would benefit from an expanded membership in preparation for the challenges of the future.  That might be a <Col N="1984" /> polite way of indicating that he is dissatisfied with the way they have acted in the past.  If, in three or four years time there is further criticism of the board, will it be met by a still further increase in membership?  At some time the Minister must face the fact that there may be dead wood on the board which must be removed.  The board, in turn, may have to face the fact that there is dead wood amongst the executives which they will remove.  The tax-payer is providing money but due to Bord Fáilte's lack of accountability we do not know the system in operation between the board and its executive staff: we do not know the relationship. Does the board lay down policy or does it accept the recommendations of its executives?  Has it control over its executives?  If an executive decides he needs a chauffeur-driven car can the board say &ldquo;No. You will not have one.  You can just as effectively drive your own car&rdquo;? These are small points.  Has the board control over its executives?  Are these people absolute masters within the day-to-day workings of this body?  I am afraid they are and that is not a good situation.</P>
    <P>It would appear, too, from the Minister's speech that the amount of accommodation now being provided is adequate to meet demands.  The unfortunate experience of this past season confirms that.  In Athlone, the figures for bed nights for the month of May this year are only one-third of those of last year.  It is a startling difference.  The actual figures are&mdash; May, 1970, 324; May, 1969, 1,316.  It is a common fallacy to argue from the particular to the general but we have heard so many disquieting reports this year that it might not be fallacious to do so in this respect this year.  If that pattern prevails all over the country, then, undoubtedly, we have ample accommodation for our guests this year.  If that trend is to be improved&mdash; it would need to be improved fourfold to be a big improvement&mdash;we would only be back where we were last year and therefore there is ample accommodation for the guests we can reasonably expect for some time to come.</P>
    <P>At this stage, the bulk of Bord <Col N="1985" /> Fáilte expenditure should not be on accommodation but rather on the provision of amenities and recreational facilities for visitors.  We lack the great attribute of continental tourist countries&mdash;constant sunshine.  Given constant sunshine, it is a perfect holiday to lie all day on the beach.  We have not got constant sunshine.  Consequently we must provide entertainment for visitors.  It is not beyond the wit of Bord Fáilte to devise ways and means of entertaining visitors.  I suggest that it be indicated to the board that this matter should have priority in their activities over the coming winter and that, by and large, the finances available to them should be devoted towards putting into effect plans to provide plenty of recreational facilities for tourists.  Imagination and careful thought should be given to this and the facilities provided should be different from what people could reasonably expect to have at home.  People come on a holiday for something different.  It is important that something different by way of recreation should be available for them.  Drinking in a pub is no holiday for most British visitors.  I am sure they would like something better.</P>
    <P>It is hardly relevant to this debate to refer to the cost of living but unless the cost of living&mdash;and particularly the cost of what I might call the fringe activities of living, drinking, smoking and driving&mdash;are controlled, our tourist trade will suffer.  The facilities for getting here with motor cars are now first class.  I have heard criticism of the fares on the car ferries as compared with those on the ferries from England to the Continent.  I am not competent to comment on that apart from the fact that it has been a possible factor in the reduction of the number arriving with cars.  A more important factor is the price of petrol here.  I think Bord Fáilte could consult with the Department of Finance or with the Minister as to the possibility of subsidising the price of petrol for foreign tourists.  I do not know if this is still done on the Continent. It was done some years ago in France and as far as I remember in Italy also.  There was a special rate for tourists when they were buying petrol.  This could be a very important <Col N="1986" /> carrot to attract the Englishman over here with his motor car.</P>
    <P>In the coming winter and for the foreseeable future, Bord Fáilte should ensure that their promotional activities are beamed at the easiest market, which is Britain.  For the reason that there is no accountability to us&mdash;we are here discussing finance for Bord Fáilte and we have no control over how it is spent&mdash;I do not know what proportion of the money they spend on promotional activities in the United States or further afield.  The mass market, which is the one we should be aiming for, is beside us.  That is where the biggest effort should be made, unless, of course, we have priced ourselves out of catering for that mass market.</P>
    <P>The idea of the rented cottage scheme to which the Minister referred is a commendable development because it is novel.  It enables people to have a holiday here in a completely strange environment.  This is the attraction of going to a foreign country.  You do not want an ersatz version of what you have at home, or even a more expensive version of what you have at home, when you go on your holidays. It is important at this stage that there should be a rethink by Bord Fáilte on how they spend their money. The bulk of their spending for the foreseeable future should be to create recreational facilities here which will make a holiday in Ireland different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for a very constructive debate on this very important matter so far as our economy is concerned. I should like to emphasise one fact which is recognised by anybody in business or by anybody in any form of commercial enterprise, that is, that one must look at the long term both in regard to what progress was made in the past and what progress is planned to be made in the future.  A temporary cut-back of visitors should not be viewed with panic.  A rational assessment should be made of the situation, taking into consideration what the achievements have been over a period of time, and what they are <Col N="1987" /> likely to be over a period in the future.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to say, briefly, is that tourism is very important big business.  It is a major revenue earner and we must view the matter in a business-like manner.  That is why I insisted at all stages, in answering questions in the House, and in discussions I have had elsewhere, on saying that no real assessment of this year's tourist picture can be made until the end of the tourist season.  Deputy Barry was in accord with that point of view during the discussion today.  This makes commonsense.</P>
      <P>What we had so far this year was a pattern where the tourist business is up over the first six months of the year, where it showed cancellations for the month of June, where it is now going ahead again on July of last year and where business looks like going ahead in August, September, and October on the corresponding months for last year.  We can only have a real assessment of the total picture at the end of the tourist year.  This makes commonsense and I should like to emphasise that point while, at the same time, being well aware of the problems that face the industry in this competitive age.</P>
      <P>One must, at the same time, while facing up to the problems and seeking to achieve a solution of them, refrain from any panic stations, any immediate rushing into short term apparently remedial measures that might be of no particular value.  For this reason I asked Bord Fáilte and the deputation from the Irish Hotels Federation, after very long discussions I had with each body, to prepare for me complete appraisal in depth of where they see the future of the tourist industry for next year and over the next five years. Each body has promised to have its report to me before the middle of September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want immediate action on this front because, if there is a problem, now is the time to diagnose it, assess it, and provide for the necessary finance and the necessary action to deal with it.  For this reason I decided, following those discussions, to introduce an amendment to the Bill providing for <Col N="1988" /> my right to appoint two more directors to the board.  I agree with Deputy O'Donovan's criticism that it is not desirable to have too large a board in any commercial enterprise and that possibly the ideal board might be one of five members.</P>
    <P>I am faced with a situation in which I want to ensure that Bord Fáilte plan now&mdash;and by &ldquo;now&rdquo; I mean this autumn and this winter&mdash;for a tourist season next year that will expand at a greater rate than it expanded this year. I am inhabited at the moment in regard to the board, with members of the board having periods in office to run. I am inhibited from making any restructuring of the board at present because, eventually, this would involve legislation that might take a substantial period of time to prepare and put through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, I can assure the House that this is a matter which I am examining.</P>
    <P>My thinking behind the introduction of that amendment is to prepare now for the planning of the season just ahead of us.  We can then make a thorough examination during the interim period to see what restructuring, if any, may be required in regard to the board as a whole.  If legislation is necessary&mdash;and it will be necessary if any restructuring is to take place&mdash;I will bring that legislation before the House.  That restructuring of the board, if it is necessary, is a long term operation and I am immediately concerned with making sure that the tourist industry next season goes ahead at a far greater rate than this season.  That is why I will be bringing this amendment before the House in addition to the other matters in the Bill as originally drafted.</P>
    <P>While I am on that aspect, I should like to assure Deputy O'Donnell and a number of other Deputies who raised this matter, that my intention is to appoint two people with a complete business and commercial approach to tourism.  I want two people on the board, in addition to the present members of the board, who will adopt a thoroughly commercial approach towards all Bord Fáilte's activities in planning for the coming year and with <Col N="1989" /> particular emphasis&mdash;and here to a degree I disagree with Deputy Cooney &mdash;on marketing expertise and experience.</P>
    <P>We must go after specific products selling during the off season.  An excellent suggestion was made by Deputy O'Leary that assistance should be given by way of marketing grants, as is given by Córas Tráchtála to industry. We should seek to stimulate the people in the hotel industry, the people in the tour business and the people in the car hire business who are concerned about bringing people in here, and, if necessary, give financial assistance to them, to go out and get business.  It is in this direction of actually getting people in here that the greatest success can be made.</P>
    <P>I may add that any hotelier, big or small, whether he is the owner of a hotel chain at the top or a small hotel or guesthouse at the bottom of the scale, who did this type of marketing or selling during the off season last year has had his premises full, even during the month of June.  Every premises which was sold and marketed during the off season last winter was full.</P>

      <P>I want to examine this whole aspect to ensure that more of this is encouraged.  One must look at this industry as a business.  It is not just the hotel business alone.  Tours, car hire and a comprehensive package of facilities including entertainment are involved.  This must be considered in a comprehensive way.  No one section of the industry has a monopoly of interest in it.  We have been very successful in developing this industry and tremendous credit is due to Bord Fáilte on that score.  We must watch closely now in a more competitive age to ensure that we apply commercial criteria to its operation.  That is one reason why I propose to introduce this amendment to the Bill, to ensure that to a greater extent we have the widest possible range of experience and <Col N="1990" /> expertise, so that next season can be planned in a completely commercial manner.</P>
      <P>I deprecate many of the remarks made by Deputy O'Donnell and others regarding Bord Fáilte.  It is easy to criticise an organisation of this kind when things go wrong and problems develop, particularly when I think it can be fairly said that the problems encountered this season&mdash;I think the eventual assessment will reveal that these problems were confined to one month&mdash;relate to factors entirely outside the control of Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>We must have a thoroughly commercial approach to this matter.  You do not proceed to run down an organisation that have been rightly given credit and have, in fact, done a very good job, when temporary difficulties arise due to problems outside their control.  Instead, by adopting a commercial approach, you analyse the situation coolly and realise that there is a problem, that, perhaps, you can do something about it and examine it thoroughly.  This is what I have asked Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation to do and to report to me before the middle of September. In the interim, I am appointing two extra directors to the board and we are taking a hard look at the whole structure of the board with a view to recasting it, if necessary, as has been suggested.  This is a sensible approach towards remedying a situation involving something that is far too important to be made a political football here.</P>
      <P>When you examine the record of Bord Fáilte&mdash;it is only fair to put the fact on record&mdash;as has been said on all sides of the House when things were good and the graph was going up continuously, that the board's record is good.  The facts are there. The total income ten years ago was £44 million.  The total income from tourism this year will be over £100 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised at the Deputy.  I am coming to that. The total tourist income last year was £98 million and it will be over £100 million this year, despite the gloomy prognostications of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte are not solely responsible for that.  What about the private enterprise that went into it without any assistance from Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give me time to speak?  Seven years ago the limit in regard to grants for holiday accommodation set by this House for Bord Fáilte was £1.5 million. In this legislation we propose to increase <Col N="1992" /> that for the 1970s to £11 million.  We have exceeded the £5.5 million which had been allocated up to this.  In seven years the expansion of holiday accommodation has been such as to require the sort of assistance represented by the jump from £1½ million to £11 million.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Donnell rightly pointed out there is substantial private investment involved in this expansion but the grants given by Bord Fáilte, as a result of legislation in this House, had the effect of priming the pump.  They ensured the attraction of private investment into the holiday accommodation industry.  Of the £5½ million that I mentioned as heretofore authorised, £5 million has actually been spent and there is more than another £½ million committed.  That £5 million has generated £31 million worth of private investment, so that 14 per cent of the total investment of £36 million in holiday accommodation over the past 10 years has come from the Exchequer and the balance of 86 per cent from private sources, with some of it helped by State guarantees in the case of loans to be met commercially in the ordinary way.  The fact that a 14 per cent priming grant by Bord Fáilte has resulted in an 86 per cent investment from the private sector in holiday accommodation is an achievement.</P>
      <P>It is important also to remember that Bord Fáilte have been directly involved in the development of tourist income as can be seen from the fact that the £500,000 in 1960 for the operations of Bord Fáilte has grown to £5.55 million in the current year.  This is for the operation of Bord Fáilte, including from the capital grants given by them.  All this has resulted in more than a two-fold increase in tourist income from £44 million to over £100 million in that decade.</P>
      <P>In practical terms of bedrooms&mdash;the most practical criterion one can adopt &mdash;in 1960 hotel bedrooms numbered 15,465.  In 1970 the figure stands at 23,300.  In 1960&mdash;and this is more spectacular&mdash;hotel and guesthouse bedrooms numbered 17,800; in 1970 the number stands at 27,900.</P>

      <P>We now have 9,700 bedrooms listed under farmhouse accommodation and under general supplementary accommodation in towns, villages and cities.  There is a rising situation in regard to bedroom accommodation and these figures have been made possible by reason of Bord Fáilte financial assistance and advice.  This is the reason why we are showing confidence in the future of the industry by proposing in this measure to do three main things, apart from the matter I spoke about initially concerning the additional board membership.  We propose to double the financial provision which will be available in respect of holiday accommodation grants from £5.5 million to £11 million.  We propose to increase the guaranteed limit from £5 million to £8 million, and to introduce a further tier of holiday accommodation in the form of organising the holiday cottage idea with proper standards, registration, and so on.</P>
      <P>The question was raised in relation to the holiday cottages that the number of units I mentioned in my introductory speech, ten, was too high.  I want to assure the House that this is a matter for regulation by me and I shall certainly bear in mind what was said so constructively in the House.  I shall lower the figure to meet the wishes expressed here.  I would be inclined towards five units as being possibly a more reasonable approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of loans was raised by Deputy Dr. O'Donovan.  There is an insistence always on promoters providing <Col N="1994" /> a contribution of £1 for every £1 of loan sought to be guaranteed.  It is only a guaranteed loan, so the repayment must be effected by the private interests concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is roughly the way it works.  The question of regional organisation was raised by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Tully was critical of duplication by the regional organisations in regard to marketing.  There may be duplication here in regard to regional organisation marketing activities and central organisation marketing activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there may be some validity in that.  It is a matter that will have to be examined, having regard to the limitations of our resources, the smalless of our country, the fact that we have a number of regional organisations and the head organisation.  There is a member of the staff of Bord Fáilte on each of these regional organisations to ensure continuity and unity of policy, but this is a matter that I shall have examined.</P>
      <P>Another matter, about which I want to be categorical and which has been pressed in this House, is that grants from Bord Fáilte over a certain level should be made known to the public through their annual report, as is done by An Foras Tionscal in their annual report in regard to industrial grants. This is a matter in regard to which I am in active consultation with Bord Fáilte.  Quite a number of these grants, despite the impression people have, are quite small and relate to small family concerns.  Whether it is fair or not to reveal them is another day's work, but certainly I believe grants over a certain level should be made known in the annual report of Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone minds these small grants.  It is the large ones people are interested in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall publish them.  Let me say in fairness to the large promoters who have done a great deal of work, going out and marketing tourism, bringing in business to fill their hotels, that the percentage of the total capital cost represented by the grant should be taken into account. That is what matters rather than the amount of the grant, because the percentage in regard to the larger operations is usually smaller than the percentage in regard to the small operations.</P>
      <P>In this business the emphasis must be on the initiative of private people in so far as private people can be encouraged to enter the industry.  That is what Bord Fáilte is about.  The tourist business is a complex business.  The demands vary from year to year to such an extent that it is very easy to generalise and be wrong.  There are some areas where Grade A hotels are required.  There are other areas where that is not the right type of hotel, where farmhouse or guesthouse or moderate hotel type accommodation is required.  There are half a dozen different options in regard to bedroom accommodation and it varies from region to region and from situation to situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter into which Bord Fáilte are conducting a very detailed study&mdash;the whole accommodation requirements of the future.  Commitments have outrun the resources and that has caused a delay at the present time in paying grants.  Some people here would say this is a desirable thing; let us contain the existing stock of bedrooms and work from there.  I would not like to be too rigid about <Col N="1996" /> that, because one must look to future expansion.  If a halt is called at this stage it can have reverberations in two or three years time when the expansion is required.  It is one of those complex businesses where results often follow some years after the actual holiday accommodation development.</P>
    <P>In regard to commitments, I shall go into the attack on behalf of Bord Fáilte.  These commitments into which they entered are a reflection of the confidence held by people in the future of the tourist industry, people who built their hotels, their guesthouses and supplementary hotel accommodation, local bodies who encouraged resort development and so on.  All of this confidence has been generated by Bord Fáilte over the last ten years. If the generation of that confidence and interest in tourism has resulted in Bord Fáilte overreaching themselves it is a very good complaint.  It is a complaint which you associate with progress.  It is a plus rather than a minus.  We would be far more critical in this House if we allocated £x to Bord Fáilte and found this money underspent.  If it is a complaint, it is a complaint associated with progress and a problem associated with progress in every field of human and economic activity.  If you are going ahead and expanding and if there is confidence and progress, then inevitably both in private and in public enterprise there is a tendency to overreach the situation.  That is what happened.  Far more than Bord Fáilte ever expected, the private sector&mdash;local authorities, local bodies and private people and firms&mdash;responded to the incentives and encouragement generated by the board.</P>
    <P>That is a tribute to them and a tribute to the figures I mentioned earlier on, of more than doubling the expansion in this field over the past ten years.  Now&mdash;and to this extent I agree with the thread of view expressed by the various contributors&mdash;is the time for taking a hard look at the situation, the assessing of it, reorientating our tourist direction for the 1970s and possibly recasting the board.  What has happened in the last ten years is that the tourist business has become far more competitive than in 1960 when the Bord Fáilte grant effort got under <Col N="1997" /> way.  The tourist business in 1970 is far more commercially orientated than it was in 1960.  For the next ten years we will have to be far more commercially minded in our tourist effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the depreciation of money between 1960 and 1970, there still has been a jump from £44 million to £100 million. This is more than double the income. The inflation in that period has not been anything like that.  I have not got exact figures but certainly the depreciation in money value figures would be less than half and that is a 100 per cent increase and outside, I suppose, there would be a depreciation of about 30 per cent in the value of money but here you have a 100 per cent increase which is substantial. That 30 per cent cannot be taken as a hard and fast figure, but I would say that is what it is at the outside.  I hope I have dealt with the various points made, but if there are any points which I have overlooked I will communicate with the Deputies who raised them.</P>

This matter has been dealt with very thoroughly in the Devlin Report and a distinction is drawn between the commercial bodies and non-commercial bodies.  The whole structure of the State commercial bodies, such as the airlines, given by statute to them is admirable. However, I think in the case of the non-commercial bodies&mdash;and this is the view of the Devlin Report&mdash;where there is no commercial barometer, in the sense that it does exist in the case of the airlines, CIE, and the B &amp; I, there is a strong case for a greater degree of public accountability and closer liaison with the Department concerned with the non-commercial State bodies.  I feel very strongly about this <Col N="1998" /> and we are having it examined at the moment in the light of the Devlin Report.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to increase the membership of the board from seven to nine. Section 4 (3) of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, provides that the board shall consist of such number of members not exceeding five.  Section 16 (a) of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, increased the number to seven.  I now propose to increase the number to nine.  It is not that I like having a bigger board.  I agree with Deputy O'Donovan that the ideal number is probably five, but I am prevented by the terms of appointment from interfering in any way with the existing members who are appointed for a five year period; two of the present seven come up for reappointment in 12 months' time.  The other members will not come up for reappointment for a much longer period.  Faced with this situation and because of the urgency of immediate planning this autumn and winter for next year's tourist season I decided it was necessary to have two members, with the kind of expertise required, associated with the industry, two members who could add something to the present board from the point of view of the preparation necessary for next year, members who would be aggressive, commercially minded and commercially oriented.  As an interim measure this was the best way to deal with the immediate situation as quickly as possible so that we could appoint people immediately who would get down to the practical business of preparing proposals for next year.  Proper planning must be undertaken in the previous autumn and that is why there is such immediacy about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has clarified the situation I am inclined to view the amendment in a different light.  It is pretty obvious that something must be done to strengthen or improve the position of Bord Fáilte.  I agree with the need to improve the composition of the board. I would not agree with this if it were being introduced now as a permanent measure.  There is no way open to the Minister, technically, to effect the immediate improvement in the board which is so necessary if the tourist industry is properly to be assessed and new policies formulated on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>My first reaction to the Minister's proposal to increase the number of members of the board was one of suspicion.  I must confess that I looked on this as a way of finding jobs for two more boys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The obvious main qualifications of the two new members might, I feared, be membership of the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, the Minister has said he will nominate people with certain expertise: he mentioned in particular marketing expertise.  My idea at first was that one of the proposed members should be nominated by the Irish Hotels Federation and that the other should be nominated by the regional tourism companies.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the lack of liaison and proper co-operation between the regional tourism companies and Bord Fáilte.  If one of the proposed members of the board were nominated or selected by the regional tourism companies it might improve the lines of communication between the regional tourism companies and Bord Fáilte.  The Minister will have to elaborate on what he said here regarding the types of persons he proposes to nominate to fill the two newly created vacancies on the board of Bord Fáilte. What does he mean by a person with marketing expertise?  Would the Minister not think that the Irish Hotels Federation would be an appropriate organisation to nominate a person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> I hesitate to give the Minister <i>carte blanche,</i> so to speak, to nominate people for these two new posts.  Surely the travel industry and car hire operators and other such people could give a valuable opinion in this regard? In other words, I should like an assurance from him that he agrees with the recommendations made to him last week in regard to changing the composition of the board of directors from time to time and, secondly, that the private sector of the tourist industry could better be represented on the board of directors.  This is another way of saying that the travel agents, the car hire operators, the hotels federation might be consulted in the nomination of such a person and that the regional tourism organisations would be asked to select a person to fill the second vacancy.  I had intended to table an amendment to this effect.  The Minister is in a most reasonable frame of mind.  If he explains the situation further and gives us some idea of what he has in mind I might be prepared to accept his assurances rather than push ahead and move an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation about the proposed increase in the membership of Bord Fáilte is not adequate.  He said the extension of the Irish tourist industry has gradually become more difficult in view of international competition.  This Bill was printed on 2nd July, 1970.  He did not find that out between 2nd July, 1970, and today.  What is the real reason for increasing the membership from seven to nine?  What has happened in the past three weeks did not happen in the months of May, June and up to the 2nd July.  Possibly I would support the other reason to which he referred but which he has not dealt with in great detail.  Certainly we should have experience and expertise in the membership of the board.  Does that exist amongst the present members?  Some of them were appointed because of their various connections in the industry and particularly in the trade union movement. On all these State bodies, the most important people are the workers and they should be represented on the board&mdash;and that is so now.  We have dozens of State bodies.  We recall the <Col N="2005" /> opinion given by the late Deputy Donagh O'Malley, that, all things being equal, the Government would appoint a Government supporter.  We should try to get away from that approach as quickly as possible and appoint people for their experience and expertise.</P>

      <P>This is not a facetious or a fractious amendment.  I <Col N="2006" /> genuinely believe that, for a board which deals with one limited economic subject, you would be better with a board of five people than a board of nine people.  My chief, Deputy Corish, and the Minister may say that nine would be better than five.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my opinion.  I want to go back to what the Minister said.  It is obvious that he is not satisfied, whatever the difficulty is.  He proposes to resolve that difficulty in a certain way, by adding two members to the board.  Much will depend on how they will be received by their colleagues, the existing seven. I assume that they are reasonable men. I said last night that I do not know any of them, but I have been reminded, by inference, who one of them is, a representative of a trade union.  By a happy coincidence I do not know any of the members of this board and that is an advantage.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was intended to be progressive when he talked about enriching the expertise and experience available at board level.  That is a nice piece of alliteration, whoever the happy author was.  It does not convey much in the way of solidity or substance to a person like me.  The Minister said he was convinced that the board would benefit from an expanded membership in preparation for the challenges of the future.  We need language which grips something rather than just this euphoria suggesting we hope that by doing a certain thing we will get better results.</P>
      <P>The Minister made what I thought was a good point when he said he could not restructure or recast the board and that he wanted to do something about it.  If we could get a specific promise from the Minister that he would recast the board next year, or within some reasonable time, that would be all right.  There would be no harm in having two extra people on it for about a year but this kind of stop-gap arrangement, unfortunately, has a habit of becoming relatively permanent and remaining on for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish drew attention to the <Col N="2007" /> fact that this is an afterthought.  I am not blaming the Minister for that in the same way as we blamed the Minister for Finance yesterday in relation to the pigs.  It is a relatively short time since this Bill was printed.  He may have been thinking about it in the time available and got caught up by the time.  He might have been able to do a reasonably good job if he could have waited until after the Recess, but the money angle of the Bill is a necessary operation.  If we got a promise of what the Minister hinted at, that he intends to have a real look at this over the next 12 months, we probably would not make a fuss about giving him his two extra members for a year or so.  I am not being difficult when I say I believe five members would be better than nine.</P>

      <P>I share the doubts of the other Deputies as to whether the Minister is meeting the difficulties which he is now experiencing and admitting.  I suppose we must have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister in dealing with such a volatile industry as the tourist industry.  I suppose he has had to do his best to try to create a general feeling of euphoria, and to suggest that everything is all right with the tourist industry, when Deputies on this side of the House and on his own side of the House know from our own experience that things are more difficult than he was prepared to admit.</P>
      <P>He has now conceded that there are difficulties, that the situation has become gradually more difficult, that competition has become keener, that there are problems facing the industry, and so on.  We all share those general views and we all held them before the Minister was prepared to admit that. The question is whether increasing the size of the board by two, or reducing its size, as Deputy O'Donovan suggests, would begin to deal with this very dangerous trend in the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister said he thought this was an exceptional year.  That is something a number of people might question, or begin to <Col N="2008" /> question, in the light of our own experience living, working and, in my own case, invariably taking my holidays in Ireland.  It is possible that this is not an exceptionable year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that, on the contrary, it is the beginning of a very dangerous downturn in the tourist intake which has been so valuable from the country's point of view.  It might be the beginning of a very severe and continuous recession in the tourist industry for which this proposal by the Minister is not really the answer.  It is most frightening, from the point of view of all of us on both sides of the House that this very considerable money earner for the community may be adversely affected because of mistakes which have been made.  I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about these matters to know precisely what those mistakes were.  The whole process of finding out what these mistakes were is of such importance to the whole community that the question arises: will increasing this board by two be sufficient?  Secondly, this hope that you will get two people of expertise and experience who will make all the difference seems to me to be a rather sanguine and rather over simpliste assessment of what most of us have believed for some time is a very much more serious malaise in our tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt many of the regional boards have worked very hard and have made many important changes and Bord Fáilte appears to have done what it could but this does not seem to have been enough.  In his introductory speech the Minister gave the impression that he was thinking about two people who have old association with the tourist industry.  I wonder if I heard him properly.  Can he give us any indication as to the kind of person he is seeking?  The idea of expertise and experience is a very broad generalisation. To me it would seem to be more important to have the expertise and experience in the executives who will be carrying out policy.  The overall planning board of an organisation such as this needs rather different qualities, <Col N="2009" /> proven business experience of a very high order of the organisation and running of a very large concern.  It needs the type of people you find heading either a State company or running a great corporation like ICI or General Motors, not somebody who is an expert in some part of the tourist business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give a little more information on these two additional members that he thinks will carry out the particularly difficult job of attempting to hold, and preferably reverse what could be a dangerous downturn in the tourist business or, at least, lack of growth, so that the figures would compare more favourably in the future with international tourist figures than they are likely to do this year?  We must consider the whole question of the failure to grow at the rate expected.  If the Minister, following his consultation with the board came to the conclusion, or was led to believe, as he seeks to convey to us, that we were just having a bad year because of local difficulties we must ask if there is not more than that involved.  I do not think he made that case precisely because he did mention the difficulties facing us but I think the general impression everybody had was that if these local difficulties did not exist as regards the north and so on, this was in fact a particularly expert and experienced board and, as he said, all of us at different times have praised the qualities shown by this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister correctly informed when he is led to believe that this is an exceptional year because of local difficulties and that it is not due to factors like hotel prices and prices of consumer commodities and that we have not really met the need for an expanding tourist economy for reasons which have very little to do with the local difficulties mentioned by the Minister and that what he really faces is something much more comprehensive than the addition of two members to a board?  They will need to be very exceptional people if, by their addition to a seven-member board, they can effect things like more reasonable <Col N="2010" /> prices or control of petrol or whatever tourists find act as a disincentive, such as drink prices particularly.</P>
    <P>My main point is that I hope the Minister is not oversimplifying his problems.  I think it is a much more serious and deeply rooted malaise in the tourist industry.  I am very anxious that whatever the Minister may say to us in order to protect the industry from repercussions of ill-founded comment&mdash; he must do that as Minister&mdash;at the same time, in his private investigations into the reasons for the apparent falling-off in tourism he should examine with courage and complete honesty any factor that may be involved in this very dangerous trend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy has said in that this is not a simple or easily-assessed problem.  I am faced with a situation where, while it can be argued that there are exceptional circumstances this year&mdash;I agree that there have been but I shall not go into them in detail, particularly the trouble in the north&mdash;and while these contributed to the downturn in June which now appears to be an upturn in July, I share some of the doubts in Dr. Browne's mind and I feel we must have a thorough investigation.  That is what I have asked Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation to do.  I had a very fruitful discussion with the former Deputy Michael Mullen who led a deputation to me from the trade unionists working in the industry. Although they did not come to me on this particular point&mdash;they were concerned about service charges&mdash;we discussed the whole trend of the industry also.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure pending whatever needs to be done for the future planning of the industry, if there is a more serious problem affecting it, I propose to appoint two people of business marketing experience, relatively young people, active people and who can go on this board and contribute in a positive way towards shaping whatever proposals Bord Fáilte may have to prepare immediately&mdash;I mean in the coming months&mdash;for the tourist season next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this interim we shall have a <Col N="2011" /> general look at the whole future programme of the industry on a five-year or ten-year basis and, if necessary, we shall reshape or recast the board to achieve the objective that will become apparent following the examination to be made by Bord Fáilte and following my own investigations in the matter. That is my thinking at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any fundamental malaise or anything that cannot be rectified by having a hard look at the whole matter.  I disagree with Deputy Dr. Browne in that I do not think there is anything fundamentally wrong.  There is certainly a problem and it may not be a problem associated with this year's exceptional circumstances. There may be another problem or problems and I think this is the time to get down to having a look at the whole matter.</P>
    <P>I can meet Deputy O'Donovan's point to this extent.  At the moment under legislation members are appointed for a period not exceeding five years.  All the existing members are so appointed and therefore I cannot interfere with them.  I do not propose to appoint these two members on a five-year basis. I was thinking in terms of a two-year appointment which I can do within the overall five-year period under the relevant section of the Tourist Traffic Act.</P>

      <P>I can assure the House that the appointments I shall make in this respect will be of people of outstanding business ability.  They will be chosen purely and simply on the basis of the service they can give to Bord Fáilte through their commercial knowledge and expertise.  On this point I do not go along with Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion.  Anyway it would require an amendment of the law.  As the law stands these members must be appointed <Col N="2012" /> by the Government.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Donnell that I should confine myself to making appointments of people from specific organisations or anything like that.  Some of the appointments may come from such organisations but I want to leave myself free to appoint outstanding men who will make a contribution in a very short period.  We do not want a continuation of the situation we experienced in June of this year.  Restructuring the board and passing the necessary legislation will take a year or a year and a half.  We want to do something immediately within the limitations and exigencies of the present situation to ensure that planning will result in an upward trend in tourist business next season.  If we go through all the examination relating to a long-term solution and have a bad season next year, the situation could become very difficult indeed.</P>

    <Col N="2013" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby confirms the Transport Act, 1950 (Additional Powers) Order, 1969.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to confirm the Transport Act, 1950 (Additional Powers) Order, 1969 which was made by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance under section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950.  The order will enable CIE to operate a subsidiary company in New York to handle its coach tour promotional activities in North America.  The objects of the proposed company which will be known as &ldquo;C.I.E.  Tours International Inc.&rdquo; will be principally to promote, sell or act as agent for CIE in promoting and selling, contracts for rail, sea, air or coach tours provided by CIE either alone or in conjunction with other transport companies.</P>
      <P>CIE opened a coach tours office in New York in 1966 and another in Los Angeles in 1968.  An office was opened this year in Chicago and there is a sales office in Toronto.  CIE experience has shown that the availability to the tourist trade of on-the-spot booking facilities, with consequential saving of time to travel agents, brings an immediate increase in business and the opening of these offices has resulted in rapid development of this side of the company's activities.</P>
      <P>The offices promote and sell the full range of CIE coach tour holidays and the 1970 programme was backed by 1,000,000 brochures.  Limousine and self-drive tours are also sold, there is a hotel reservation service and an information service for individual customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE estimate that gross income from North American activities increased from £800,000 in 1966-67 to £2.2 million in 1969-70, a level which, despite current difficulties, they hope will be equalled this year as a result of a special sales campaign initiated in April.  The board has a target of £4 million a year in gross income by the mid-seventies.  Between 1967 and 1968 passengers from America on CIE tours and tours handled by CIE increased by <Col N="2014" /> about 1,700 to 51,000 but the bednights sold rose from 162,000 to 201,000.  Last year's figures were up again: 55,000 passengers and 227,000 bed-nights.  With the intensive additional campaign begun in April of this year the 1969 results should be at least equalled.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a separate subsidiary would strengthen CIE's trading identity in relation to the travel trade abroad and present a new image of its activity as well as offering incidental advantages such as facilitating the employment of locally recruited staff.  The board have assured me that the objective of developing coach tour business originating in North America cannot be achived other than by the establishment of a subsidiary company there.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a more effective CIE operation in North American will be in line with the growing importance of the North American market for Irish tourism.  The indications are that last year over 218,000 visitors came here from North America and their estimated spending at £19.7 million was about three times the 1960 level. Tourist traffic from North America is not as highly peaked as that from some other areas and consequently it has a particular value in the campaign for the extension of the season which is now a major objective of tourist policy. In recent years, this country has made a significant breakthrough into the off-season North American market and this is attributable, among other things, to the availability of extended coach tours.</P>
    <P>The new subsidiary will be established under the business corporation law of the State of New York but its powers will not be any wider than the powers already being exercised by CIE in relation to coach tour business. The new company will be subject to official control in the same way as the two other CIE subsidiaries, the establishment of which also had to be ratified by Motions of each House of the Oireachtas, namely Óstlanna Iompair Éireann, the hotels subsidiary set up in 1961 and Aerlód Teoranta, the air freight subsidiary set up in 1964.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2015" /> Section 17 of the Transport Act, 1963, applies, to Óstlanna Iompair Éireann, the provisions of sections 16 and 34 of the 1950 Act which, respectively, deal with the furnishing of information to me and the preparation, audit and presentation to the Oireachtas of the accounts of CIE.  The Transport Act, 1963, also prevents alteration in the memorandum or Articles of Association of OIE without my approval.  I propose to apply these provisions to Aerlód Teoranta and, subject to the approval of this Motion, to regulate similarly the affairs of the new American subsidiary in a Transport Bill which I shall be introducing to deal with the proposed takeover by CIE of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee and other miscellaneous matters.  Apart from these statutory controls, the original Memorandum and Articles of Association, the appointment and remuneration of directors and borrowing by the company will be subject to my approval in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The share capital of the new company will be little more than nominal in character, that is to say 200 shares all of which will be taken up by CIE at $100 each.  The members of the board will be whole-time senior executives of CIE.  The directors, including the chairman, will not be paid any extra remuneration for their services by the subsidiary.  The salaries of all other officers and agents of the subsidiary will be fixed by the board of directors.</P>
    <P>A total of 17 staff are employed full-time in the American offices and this figure is supplemented during the high season by the employment of temporary staff.  Any CIE staff working in North America will remain in the employment of the parent company, retaining any rights to which they are entitled by virtue of that employment, so that establishment of the new subsidiary will not cause any displacement or redundancy among CIE staff.  Staff locally recruited by the subsidiary company will, of course, be governed by social security regulations in force in the US.</P>
    <P>I am convinced of the necessity for and of the advantages of creating this <Col N="2016" /> new subsidiary and I strongly recommend that the House should give its approval to the motion confirming this order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise that item No. 8 on the Order Paper was so extensive a matter as we now find it to be.  I am rather interested in the fact that the Minister should come into the Dáil at this stage to move this Motion in the light of the rather disappointing results in our tourist traffic this year.  This proposal to set up a subsidiary CIE company in North America is a logical development.  I have heard that CIE ran into considerable difficulties during the year in their promotion work in the USA.  I understand that the Irish sales manager, Mr. Murphy, had to visit North America and had to take certain corrective action there.  One of the jobs he had to do was to sack the sales manager for North America.  I am glad to know now that as a result of Mr. Murphy's trip the volume of coach traffic has shown a welcome improvement.  I hope that this trend will continue and, in view of the magnitude of the North American continent, that this subsidiary will prove to be a great success. Obviously a sales organisation of this kind is definitely necessary there.  Indeed, this is an original idea in the sense that Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and so on, all operate branch offices but the establishment of a subsidiary company which will have charge of marketing and promotion in North America is a completely new idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had personal experience in Britain of the work done there by CIE representatives and I often said that wished that Bord Fáilte and some of our other State companies involved in tourist promotion would learn a lesson from the manner in which CIE have approached their work.  They are the hardest working people I have ever met.  The only thing that worries me about this is that I understand that the reduction in the volume of coach traffic this year is due to certain factors which are totally outside the factors which we outlined in a previous debate.  It is the older type of people who tend to come on coach tours and because of the economic recession in the States <Col N="2017" /> and the Vietnam and Cambodian troubles they are not inclined to travel far abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this situation is rectifying itself.  I look forward to seeing how this idea works out in the States.  If this subsidiary is a success we may have to do the same in Britain and on the Continent and we may have to approach the B &amp; I, Aer Lingus and other bodies to adopt somewhat the same procedure.</P>
      <P>There is one other point which I should like to deal with.  There is a Bord Fáilte office in New York; there is an Aer Lingus office there and we are now going to have a CIE office. Earlier the Minister was lauding Bord Fáilte and the contribution they have made to the development of the tourist industry.  I pointed out that it is impossible to measure the exact contributions that the Bord Fáilte sales offices abroad make to the actual flow of traffic here.  I would go so far as to say that Aer Lingus, particularly in North America, have been responsible for generating a considerable proportion of the total volume of traffic coming in. CIE through their coach tours and by their hard selling&mdash;and I have seen their men in Britain going out into the field and working hard there, there was no sitting down in an office answering correspondence, and at night they were showing films to interested groups&mdash; have also been responsible for attracting a great proportion of our visitors.  I wonder if the Bord Fáilte offices abroad might be commercialised to some degree so that we could measure their contribution to the flow of traffic here.  I am convinced that Aer Lingus are generating the greater proportion of traffic through their sales agents and CIE are also generating a considerable volume of business. Having regard to the great amount of work which these companies are doing, I would be very interested to know what is left that can be attributed to the work done by Bord Fáilte in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the highest respect for the <Col N="2018" /> work done by CIE in regard to coach tour traffic.  Their most recent development, some two years ago, was the 21-day British Isles tour which some people laughed at but which has become a very great success.  I wish CIE every success and I hope that this subsidiary will achieve the results we expect and which I am confident it will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, I am less well documented than Deputy O'Donnell, but I have some information on this subject.  CIE deserve great credit for the way in which they have developed these coach tours.  Some American friends, my wife and I went on one of these tours some years ago and the Americans were extremely pleased.  I have picked up on the wind that coach tours are out.  Some years ago they were the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing; now they are the &ldquo;out&rdquo; thing.  That is the information I have.  It is not just here; it is also the evolution in North America, Europe and elsewhere.  That seemed to be borne out when one saw CIE coaches going around with five or six people in them.  That has happened this year.  I am not in any way critical of this method, but it is no harm to enter that caveat in relation to it.</P>
      <P>This is called CIE Tours International Inc.  I understand from Deputy O'Donnell's last remarks that there has been a recovery in the last month or so because of certain internal action in CIE but, if they are &ldquo;out&rdquo;, then the figures the Minister has given us are not a great deal of use.  One does not really know how to assess the effect.  I suppose, as a former Minister for Finance said on one occasion when I complained about the new methods of advertising civil service posts, what everybody else does we must do.  We have a product to sell and I agree with this idea about off-season tourist traffic.  This suits us because of our climate; it is more generous than Continental climates at that time of year and there is an opportunity of getting Americans to come here on holiday in the off-season.  A staff of 17 seems quite reasonable.  Apparently CIE are making an effort to improve our balance of payments.</P>

      <P>I am a modern private enterprise individual and I accept the responsibility of private enterprise to provide money for social welfare benefits, modernisation and everything else in the management of business.  I wonder is it right that a State company like CIE should now be in America organising their own coach tours, which will go to specified hotels, owned no doubt by CIE, or perhaps to hotels belonging to Ryan Holdings in which the capital of a State company is involved. There is a conflict of interests. There are companies which run coach tours without any assistance except that of Bord Fáilte in fishing for them in the remunerative waters of the American tourist traffic.  There is something wrong.  We are tending to intrude Government agencies and Government money and semi-State companies too much into this industry.  I personally believe Bord Fáilte should do this job as the agency for both CIE and private coach tours, those private coach tours being in a position to make their own arrangements with the hotels of their choice, State hotels if they so desire. This is the basis of our economy and there is a conflict of interests here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My view accords more with the view of Deputy O'Donnell than it does with that of Deputy Donegan.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the specific product hard selling done by CIE and by Aer Lingus/Aerlínte in the US market, in the British market and in other markets has been of tremendous advantage to the Irish tourist industry.  Deputy Donegan is under a misapprehension as to the role of Bord Fáilte.  Its primary role is to sell Ireland.  This is very essential.  It is also essential to have operators, be they State, semi-State or private, under the umbrella of Bord Fáilte, pushing their specific products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2020" /> I want to pay tribute, as Deputy O'Donnell did, to the work done by CIE and Aer Lingus/Aer Línte in attracting tourists from these markets, selling the whole package product, involving carrier facilities, bedroom facilities, and so on.  The type of tourism is becoming very popular.  CIE and Aer Lingus/Aerlínte have played a very prominent part through their general publicity and their hard selling at grassroots level in developing this aspect of tourism.  This motion is designed to facilitate this operation.  As Deputy O'Donnell stated, there was a slight difficulty in April and May of this year but that has been rectified; business is up again and it is contemplated it will increase.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this operation is to facilitate the functioning of the selling organisation in the States as a separate subsidiary of its own with legal rights and acting according to American law, being able to enter into contracts and commitments in accordance with the American law.  It will enable the business organisation to have a subsidiary incorporated in America as an American company.</P>
    <P>Lest the impression might be given as a result of what Deputy Donegan said let me say that CIE coach tours are not confined to Óstlanna Iompair Éireann hotels.  They are in hotels of a particular category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>It is a tremendous advantage that, as carrier operators, they have X number of hotel bedrooms available to them by reason of the subsidiary activities.  The two dovetail. This is the most profitable aspect of the activities of CIE&mdash;the coach tour activity dovetailing with bedroom accommodation.  Very few carriers in the world have this link-up.  The whole success has been built on that foundation. It is a real success story from the financial point of view.  These tours do a substantial business outside the CIE hotels.  Where there is an OIE hotel in the area, the accommodation is provided there.  Where accommodation is required, over and above that available <Col N="2021" /> through OIE in the area, that accommodation goes elsewhere.  Therefore, this operation spills over to the benefit of the hotel industry in general and to the benefit of the tourist industry in general outside CIE and OIE.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is twofold. Firstly it enables the vocational education committees to broaden the scope of their activities through formal co-operation and collaboration with other bodies.  Secondly, it enables me to allow a vocational education committee which has been dissolved to be reconstituted without waiting until after the next local authority elections have been held.</P>
      <P>As the Vocational Education Acts stand at present, vocational education committees are empowered to pay the cost of schools or school facilities only in respect of their own schools, i.e. schools which are owned and managed solely by the committees.  As the House will be aware, my Department has been encouraging co-operation between secondary and vocational schools with the object of providing comprehensive educational facilities in each area of the country.  The intention here is that joint resources will be used for this purpose in order to make good any deficiencies while at the same time avoiding waste and overlapping both in regard to accommodation requirements and teaching resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of centres in which co-operation between secondary and vocational schools is being developed proposals have been made for the sharing of specialist facilities and ancillary accommodation, for example, science laboratories, assembly halls, gymnasia, playing fields etc., but under existing legislation the vocational education committees are precluded from contributing towards the cost of such facilities unless the ownership and management <Col N="2022" /> resides solely in the committees. The type of co-operation and collaboration envisaged could operate satisfactorily only if there were joint ownership and joint management.  The amendments proposed in section I of this Bill would enable the vocational education committees, if they wish to do so, to contribute towards the cost of the facilities in question on the basis of their being jointly owned and managed by the committee and another educational authority.  This will in turn facilitate the development of co-operation in many centres and help further to break down the barriers between the secondary and vocational systems.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted that in order to provide comprehensive educational facilities at any kind of reasonable cost and making economic use of scarce teaching skills a large size school unit is necessary.  As the House will be aware, our post-primary schools tend for historical reasons to be comparatively small in size.  In most of our towns, there are two or three such schools operating for the most part independently of one another.  In a few such areas, in which the schools need to be rebuilt, there is a fair measure of agreement that the schools should be amalgamated subject to an acceptable form of management for the new school on which the existing interests would be represented.  This form of joint-management of a post-primary school would be new to this country and, as Deputies will appreciate, there are a number of practical difficulties which will need to be resolved in consultation with the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Section I would enable vocational education committees to contribute towards the cost of such schools if they thought fit to do so.  I would emphasise that the section merely provides enabling powers and that it would be a matter for each committee to consider the circumstances of each particular case and decide for itself whether it wished to participate or not.  Similarly, of course, it would be a matter for each secondary school authority to decide its own attitude towards any such proposal. It will be for my Department to secure the maximum degree of co-operation so as to ensure that the <Col N="2023" /> greatest possible benefit will accrue to the children of the nation from the resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>Section 2 while mandatory is also enabling in so far as under its terms a dissolved committee may be reconstituted at any time up to the end of the second election year after it has been dissolved.  Under the existing legislation no reconstruction of such committee could take place until after the next local authority elections to be help after its dissolution had been held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House feel that this Bill is an appropriate step forward.  Even if the word &ldquo;co-education&rdquo; has not been used by the Minister in his opening speech, all the indications are that co-education will increase in the years ahead and with it there must be a sharing of facilities.  When one sees all the very fine new classrooms, new schools and old ones as well that lie vacant after the day's work is done, one is bound to feel that there is a wide scope for co-operation between the various secondary schools from the point of view of usage of all their facilities.  In regard to one particular future project it is mooted that perhaps teachers could move across from one school to another.  This represents another feature of the sharing of facilities.  It was not fashionable up to recently to have boys and girls taught together but within the next ten or 15 years there will be quite a lot of co-education and, perhaps, teachers will spend a day in one school and another day in another school.</P>
      <P>This is not a Bill which requires long discussion.  It is an enabling Bill. I do not think there is much objection to section 2, the mandatory section.  As the Minister pointed out, it is also enabling in as much as it enables a dissolved committee to be reconstituted. This would appear to be a proper view.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party I commend this Bill as something that has had to be done in the changing field of education.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I wish to congratulate the Minister and his Department on their awareness of the need to employ all our resources, especially in the field of education, to enable us to prepare our youth and subsequently our manhood to play their part in the new Europe that is evolving.</P>
      <P>It will be accepted, I think, that in this new Europe there will be little room for isolationism.  We can no longer remain isolated here.  As a country we cannot remain isolated.  No longer can any branch of education continue to enjoy, if that is the appropriate word, if that is the word they would use, the isolation which hitherto was theirs.  The Minister is now indicating the need, as he sees it, for the marrying of the educational branches which hitherto, I am afraid, were in competition with and suspicious of each other to the detriment of both, and to the ultimate detriment of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his approach to and his awareness of the need for our coming together now and <Col N="2025" /> treating education as we should.  No longer can the traditional archaic, connotation of education survive.  No longer can we continue, as might have been appropriate or adequate in the past, to prepare students for the Church, the professions, law, medicine, the Army and, perhaps, for Parliament, and leave the fall-outs to look after industry.</P>
    <P>There must be an acceptance of the fact that education has a vital role to play in the field of industry.  No longer can it be left to the fall-outs, or to primary school students who could not aspire to any profession, who could not aspire to the Civil Service or to clerical positions, to play their part in industry. No longer can we afford to accept that only the academic is the worthwhile member of society.  No longer can we afford a situation where we are cultivating and fostering a certain academic elite, a certain educational aristocracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never subscribed to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Deputy might not have subscribed to it does not take away from the fact that that was the position, in my opinion. There was amongst the people of Ireland, I suggest, a feeling that, unless education led to a profession or a clerical position, it was not education.  There was a certain &ldquo;snobocracy&rdquo; attaching to education.  There was a feeling that the person who had the brain should go to what was formerly described as the secondary school, and the person who had the &ldquo;hands&rdquo; might go to what was formerly described as the vocational school.  Now we have this marrying of the secondary and vocational schools and soon there will be no reference, I hope, to either and all will be described as post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this field of post-primary education there will be counselling and direction. There will be ample opportunities. There are urgent demands and, at the moment, I am afraid, we are not able to meet them.  At the moment in the field of technology there is a shortage of highly skilled technicians.  On the other hand, students from the secondary schools, having completed <Col N="2026" /> their courses, find nothing available for them.  Last week in a hotel in Dublin, students who hoped to be successful in the leaving certificate examination were offering themselves, in the absence of anything else, for interview to people from a shop in London in which they hoped to be shop boys, with the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>There is a need for technicians. There is a need for skilled men, and that need cannot be satisfied.  If the Bill which the Minister has introduced had been introduced some years ago, and if parents of the students had been told that in the years that lay ahead the white collar would disappear and the blue collar would emerge, and that it would be far better for them to send their children to schools where the sole emphasis was not on the academic type of education, those boys might now be in worthyhile positions or embarking on worthwhile careers which would be most beneficial to themselves and to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now hoping that, by giving powers to vocational educational committees which hitherto they did not enjoy, it will be possible for the vocationel educational committees to extend a co-operating hand to the secondary schools.  I have no doubt that the vocational educational committees, manned as they are by men of common sense, men of understanding, men who are not concerned with the traditional, men who are not concerned with education <i>per se,</i> will do a good job.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be accused of saying that we must not have education for education's sake.  That is highy desirable and we must have it. The point I am making is that, if we are to satisfy the demands of the 20th century, there must be an extension of that definition.  There must be more than what we have hitherto expected from education and complete awareness of the fact that, unless our education is geared beyond academic, abstract, intellectual pursuits, it will not be sufficient for the demands of this century.  I hope that, when these powers are given to committees and they are anxious to put them into operation, the hitherto conservative elements will realise, even in deference to <Col N="2027" /> the students attending those schools, that the time has come for this merging and that there will not be the opportunity and the job satisfaction for the student who continues to move along the purely academic line.  For a small minority these intellectual pursuits will still exist and it is important and necessary for all that the small minority should continue in them.  I hope, however, the situation will be avoided where an amount of money is poured into this type of education at the end of which a student is produced for whom there is nothing except a shop assistant's job in London.</P>
    <P>We will not get the type of education required unless there is co-operation between the committees and secondary school managers, unless there is understanding among teachers that all teachers are members of the one profession, that there will, and should be a movement of teachers, as Deputy Donegan said, from one school to another.  I think it will also be necessary for the Department to have &mdash;I suggested this before and I hope the campaign will be carried out through Telefís Éireann&mdash;a campaign to remind parents of the changes that have occurred and indicate how they might direct their sons and daughters. It is all right to talk of career guidance in schools but the choice is not always left to students.  In most cases the parents decide what field of education the boy will enter.  There is not yet proper awareness among parents of how important it is that a boy should have knowledge which would lead him to worthwhile skilled employment and that no longer is it sufficient for him to be able to define the ablative absolute, to quote a Shakespearian soliloquy, or be able to indulge in certain abstract exercises for which there is little place in the world today.  I do not discount the need for those things but I am dismissing the system which regarded them as all-important and regarded other matters, more important in my estimation, as insignificant.</P>
    <P>Finally, I repeat my congratulations to the Minister and his Department for showing initiative in the utilisation of our resources and for their awareness <Col N="2028" /> that, in creating the wealth this country desires, a new dimension has appeared. I would now add education to the three factors that have hitherto been accepted as factors in the creation of wealth: land, labour and capital. These, and the proper type of education, constitute for me the factors which will create what this country requires to advance socially, economically and confidently into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this much-needed piece of educational legislation first because it is in accordance with the general educational policy of the Labour Party.  It is necessary to place this on record because in the early sixties the Labour Party was accused of being unduly Utopian in advocating the reorganisation and rationalisation of our educational structure.  That this piece of legislation should come before the House and be in accord with our policy is particularly welcome.</P>
      <P>The second reason why I welcome this legislation is that I feel it will get rid of the traditional, historical, much-to-be-deplored rigidity of structure within our educational system.  While it will not completely remove that undue rigidity, it is nevertheless a valuable step towards a more comprehensive type of general educational system. Members of the House are only too well aware and too keenly conscious of the decisiveness and social wastefulness of the three systems of education&mdash; primary, vocational and secondary&mdash; operating at times almost autonomously, one would imagine, each in its own educationally watertight compartment. The extent to which these three sectors of education has tended to divide our community and be wasteful of educational resources, which are scarce and expensive, and have tended to create undue, unnecessary and profoundly distorting class divisions is considerable.  Therefore, I welcome the legislation as something that will certainly mitigate that regrettable historical tendency in our educational system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need and I think it is very much in the Minister's mind, to have greater interchange between those in <Col N="2029" /> vocational schools and those in the other post-primary sectors, between the vocational education committees and school managers in the secondary sector. There is need for greater liaison and co-operation and greater joint endeavour.  I think the concept embodied in this Bill will end a good deal of what one might describe as the demoralisation currently very evident in many respects and self-developed within the system of industrial relations. This should act as a valuable constraint in the long term on those in the teaching profession who at least appreciate that they are all in the one profession and that they have a common loyalty to one another.  The Bill is a constructive proposition and one which should contribute towards eradicating the class divisions within the profession which, I say with profound regret, still seem to be so rampant in some sectors of education.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in broadening the scope of responsibility and the capacity of vocational education committees, will make a distinctive contribution to the development of a better and more comprehensive educational system.  I commend the Minister and welcome this piece of legislation.  Section 2 of the Bill, whereby a dissolved committee, notably that of Limerick, will be reconstituted, is also welcome, because unlike certain aspects of local government where bodies are dissolved, and tend to remain dissolved, it can be said in the context of a dissolved vocational education committee, the Minister is anxious to get immediate action to have it reconstituted.</P>
    <P>Finally in regard to the form of joint management of a post-primary school which the Minister has given only in embryonic outline today, I should like to see these forms of management as broadly based and as broadly representative as possible, involving a large number of vocational education committees and involving not only the management and the owners of the secondary schools but also the teachers in these schools, and involving on a joint basis both vocational teachers and secondary <Col N="2030" /> teachers.  They should equally take part in consultations about any new forms of joint management.  Therefore the Minister should not hesitate to be flexible.  I have no doubt that in bringing forward this legislation he is making, as far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, a very constructive approach and one which we welcome in the development of a more effective post-primary education system in this country.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghábhail leis na Teachtaí a chuidigh leis an mBille seo agus na Teachtaí a labhair ar an mBille.  Tá a fhios againn uilig go bhfuil an comh-oibriú seo de dhíth go géar sa tír seo idir na scoileanna éagsúla.  Níl amhras ar bith ach go ndéanfaidh sé maitheas mór do chúis an oideachais go ginearálta sa tír.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to Deputy Donegan and Deputy Desmond for their support and the support of their parties for this Bill.  It is very considerable encouragement to me to have their support so that we can press forward with the work of developing co-operation, As I mentioned on many occasions, I am very anxious to promote co-operation between various types of schools, particularly in the small towns and rural areas so as to provide not only free education but, in so far as is possible, equality of opportunity as well.  This can be achieved only where the numbers in a school or in co-operating schools are large enough to permit of a curriculum to cover a wide range of abilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of co-operation at present between the secondary and vocational schools on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  This co-operation is largely confined to an exchange of teachers and to the common use of existing facilities.  It does not nor cannot provide for co-operation in matters involving capital expenditure, for example, the purchase of land for sites or playing pitches, as I have mentioned in my opening speech, or in the extension of existing buildings, the erection <Col N="2032" /> of buildings or the equipping of classrooms and so on.</P>
    <P>The provision in the first part of this Bill is intended to give co-operation between various types of schools the necessary impetus.  If I might just very briefly repeat what I have said in my opening statement that under the present legislation vocational education committees can contribute towards the cost of an educational establishment only if the ownership and management are entirely in the hands of the committee. Section 1 of this Bill is designed to supply the deficiency in existing legislation by making it possible for a vocational education committee to join with another school authority in assuming joint responsibility for financing and managing joint educational undertakings.  The section of the Bill deliberately refrains from specifying or defining the details of such co-operation financial and otherwise, and this is something to which Deputy Desmond referred.  We are, as can be seen from the Bill, leaving the whole matter as flexible as possible.</P>
    <P>Joint management of schools is a new venture in this country and for that reason the more flexible we leave it the more likely we are to make progress in relation to the whole matter. As I said, this makes possible the administration of co-operative measures in a manner so flexible as to meet the differing local conditions or circumstances and differing degrees of involvement of the various parties.  If, for example, a committee are to be responsible for one half of the pupils in the case of a joint venture, then it would appear equitable that they would share the cost on a fifty-fifty basis.  If, on the other hand, they are to be responsible for one-third of the pupils, then it would be reasonable to expect that their financial involvement would be somewhat of the same proportion. Of course, there are various methods by which this can be done.  It can be done, for example, on a capitation basis by reference to subject hours or to all-over teaching hours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also referred to the management of the schools and, of course, the personnel of the joint management boards will be a matter for <Col N="2033" /> negotiation and local agreement.  I could say that in the few cases in which agreement has been reached the boards of management will be on a fifty-fifty basis and under the chairmanship of the local bishop.  I stress again that the section here merely enables but does not compel co-operation, nor does it affect the independence of either of the school authorities concerned.  Of course, apart altogether from the educational benefits arising from co-operation between school authorities, a considerable economy to the taxpayer is also effected in that duplication of facilities, of buildings, of equipment, of teaching power is avoided.  For instance, if a laboratory is shared between a vocational and a secondary school, it can be fully utilised, whereas if each of them had their own the chances are that neither would be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the relevant section of the principal Act and read out the section as it is&mdash;section 108 (4) of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, which states:</P>
    <P>In either the first or the second election year after a vocational education committee has been dissolved under this section, the Minister shall by order cause a new election of members of such committee to be made, and upon the completion of such new election all the properties, powers, and duties of the dissolved comittee shall vest in the committee so elected, notwithstanding that the same may have been transferred by the Minister under this section to any other body, persons or person.</P>
    <P>This section permits the reconstruction of the membership of the dissolved committee only during the course of the first or second election year, thus, in effect, prohibiting the reconstitution of the committee at any other time.  For example, the reconstitution of the Limerick committee could not occur until 1972 which is the next election year.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill enables the Minister to reconstitute a dissolved committee at any time not later than <Col N="2034" /> the end of the second election year after the date of the dissolution of the committee.  In fact, it makes it mandatory on the Minister to reconstitute a dissolved comittee before the end of the second election year which means that the committee would not remain dissolved for a period longer than ten years.</P>

      <P>It might also be noted from the new subsection (4) (b) provided for in section 2 of the Amending Bill, that subsection (2) section 9 of the 1930 Act shall not apply to a new election.  The expression here &ldquo;new election&rdquo; has a technical meaning and it refers to the election by which the membership of a dissolved vocational education committee is constituted.  Subsection (2) of section 9 of the Act will continue to apply as heretofore in all other circumstances than in the case of the new election whereby a dissolved committee is constituted.  Again, I should like to express my thanks to Deputies for their co-operation.</P>

I have a particular problem in regard to this. There are various ways, as the Minister knows, in which this co-operation can come about.  It can come about by the transfer of pupils or by the transfer of teachers and by the sharing of buildings, provided these schools are close enough together, but there is much resentment about a suggestion which emanated from the Department <Col N="2035" /> that subjects like woodwork and metalwork, which have always been the responsibility of vocational education committees, will become a common responsibility and even carried on in rooms set aside in part of the vocational schools.  This proposal has emanated from the Department in relation to the new schools at Tallaght where there is a complex of 15 acres and where it is proposed to set up three schools.  In Tallaght, it is proposed to have one central building in which metalwork and woodwork, and, perhaps, various other activities, will be carried on.  The vocational school is in another place; the convent is in another place and the secondary school in yet another.  Nobody is directly responsible for woodwork and metalwork.  There is serious resentment about this and a schedule of accommodation was sent last Easter to the Department but still there has been no decision on it.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that the form of co-operation here is extremely important and it is a matter of serious concern to the parties involved.  The Minister will have to be very careful about his decisions as to how this co-operation should take place.  Everybody wants to see this sort of thing work; everybody wants to see this interchange of pupils and teachers between schools.  However, some subjects were traditional vocational subjects and I might say that there the vocational education committees have done a first-class job turning out people with group certificates.  We are trying to expand and to have industrial development and, therefore, it is extremely important that an organisation which has done a good job in this regard should be left with this responsibility. It should not be thrown out into the middle of an area as nobody's responsibility.</P>

      <P>In relation to the co-operation I have in mind, there will be joint management and the joint facilities would not belong to one or the other.  If, for example, it was decided that a laboratory was needed and that this laboratory would be sufficient for two schools in a small town, then if the vocational education committee <Col N="2036" /> and the management of the secondary school agreed to co-operate they would be enabled to co-operate financially as well as in the manner in which they have been co-operating up to now and they will have joint management and joint control of the laboratory.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, I have left this whole matter flexible so that local agreement and local circumstances can be taken into consideration.  When coming to an arrangement in regard to the joint management of either part of a school or all of a school, this arrangement will be a matter for local agreement.  All the matters Deputy Clinton has mentioned can be thrashed out and agreement can be arrived at. Nobody is being compelled to join in this, but the opportunity is available and I shall be very pleased if people avail of it.</P>

      <P>One of the results of this will be that it will delay the building of schools.  This argument can go on, with people refusing to co-operate, and one side saying they should have something and the other side saying they should not have it.  In those circumstances who will decide?  The Minister did not reply to what I said about the traditional subjects in regard to which the vocational organisation has done a first class job.  He now says this will go out to joint management with, for instance, a convent.  What interest will a convent have in metalwork and woodwork?  This is the sort of thing that is proposed.  These are not traditional subjects of the secondary schools.  It is as if the Minister were to decide that a traditional subject of the secondary school should now be come a subject in which the vocational authorities would have equal rights and equal say even though it has always been a traditional subject of the secondary school.</P>

      <P>I do not want to dispense any particular advice to the Minister on this innovation.  We have to keep a very open mind.  I am rather concerned about some of the speculations in regard to this development, particularly outside Dublin city area; to put it delicately, those in the non-vocational sector will be more inclined to get for themselves the best of all possible worlds.  I would urge the Minister to be rather tight-fisted and to be very tough with those who want substantial State assistance to expand their line quite dramatically.  When it all boils down, this would be their own private property.  This is the sort of thing that could be done more effectively on a joint basis between the local vocational education committee and the management of the local secondary schools.  I do not want in any way to detract from or lessen the tremendous contribution made by those engaged in the traditional secondary school sector, but I am extremely conscious of the pressures which can be exerted so dramatically and so influentially at the secondary level when it comes to the provision of language laboratories, science laboratories and so on.  This is an extremely costly educational infrastructure. In the dispensing of funds the Minister should tend towards the vocational education sectors.  I share Deputy Clinton's concern in this.  Those who would stand to gain must be prepared to shed some of their own developments, developments which might be very valuable and very fruitful from their point of view.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Clinton's anxiety.  I maintain that as and from now we should cease to differentiate between the vocational school and the secondary school.  I cannot understand why there ever <Col N="2038" /> should have been this differentiation. In the vocational school students are trained to follow certain vocations. Likewise, students in the secondary schools are trained.  We should do away with this &ldquo;they&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;.  Vocational schools are now giving tuition in subjects which were hitherto regarded as traditional secondary school subjects&mdash;French, German and so on. Because one type of subject was taught at point A and another at point B we cannot continue perpetuating this difference.  We must discontinue the suggestion that there is any difference between the vocational school and the secondary school.  There is none.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>In case there is any misunderstanding, this Bill in no way takes from the standing of vocational education committees.  As I see it, it enhances their standing.  We are not denigrating the contribution made by any type of school.  In fact, I should like here to express my appreciation of the work done by all types of schools.</P>
      <P>With regard to co-operation, let me take an example: take a small town in which there is a convent school, a brothers' school and a vocational school.  Each working on its own might have 140 pupils.  With 140 pupils it is not possible to provide the broad curriculum which is essential if we intend to develop the individual abilities of the different children.  I visualise co-operation between all three and, instead of having 140 children at each of the schools, we would have a total enrolment of 420 children.  One could then provide a broad curriculum and develop all the abilities of all the different types of children attending these schools.  In achieving this co-operation the rights of all three groups would be respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, my concern here is that we have provided free education but we have not yet succeeded in providing equality of opportunity.  The child attending a small school where it is not possible to make a broad curriculum available cannot hope to compete with a child attending a very much larger school in a bigger town.  Therefore, one of the reasons behind this <Col N="2039" /> Bill is to endeavour to provide this equality of opportunity in so far as that is possible for all the children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody agrees with the sort of co-operation outlined by the Minister.  My complaint is that he should set up an additional institution&mdash;a limbo&mdash;in a centre where you have three or four large schools.  That is what is proposed in the particular instance I gave to the House: nobody is responsible and traditional subjects are taken away from the vocational authorities who always did them and always did a good job. It has all appearance of disregarding the great need for turning out more and more technicians in this country. We have to be very careful about this. Otherwise we shall get anything but co-operation; we shall get opposition in no uncertain terms.  It is building up in the case with which I am acquainting the Minister.  I trust he will use his influence to ensure that this sort of thing does not go on for too long.</P>
      <P>You have this argument about the schedule of accommodation in these new schools and you have a situation where you have three or four different architects who are supposed to be co-operating. But they cannot draw up their plans until a schedule of accommodation is agreed on.  If we are going to take away the traditional subjects from the responsibility of the body that normally carried them out, it can cause endless arguments.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of Deputies.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm two orders made during 1969 under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, and the Finance Act, 1962.  It is a statutory requirement that such orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made if they are not to cease to have statutory effect at the expiration of that period.</P>
      <P>The first of these orders, No. 178, was necessary because of a decision by the customs co-operation council regarding the classification of certain trailers in the Brussels tariff.  As the House knows this country's customs and excise tariff is based on the internationally accepted Brussels nomenclature form of customs classification.  The effect of the council's decision was that some trailers, which were already liable to duty, were being reclassified at a tariff heading where duty was not payable. The order ensured that the trailers in question remained liable to duty on reclassification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second order, No. 180, was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance. It provided for the fourth tariff reduction on goods of United Kingdom origin in accordance with the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  In addition, the order provided for the maintenance of the special tariff concessions in favour of certain goods of Northern Ireland origin and implemented the remaining tariff concessions, at 55 headings, arising out of the Government's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  The order also transferred the licensing powers in respect of a number of duties on wheaten products from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="2041" /> and made a number of minor changes in the Customs tariff.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to give any further information required in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech is refreshing after a rather garrulous day in the House.  Apart from that, it seems to treat mildly the fact that we are discussing the fourth reduction in tariffs under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and also we are discussing under 55 headings the harmonisation of tariffs in relation to the Kennedy round on our accession to GATT.  These are majjor matters and should be accepted and discussed as such in the House.  This is, of course, an absolute necessity in the preparation for freer trade.  We are facing a further freeing of trade and a move towards Europe.  If Britain is there, then we shall have to be there with them, and there is nothing exceptional in the harmonisation of our trading relations so that we will find ourselves wading into the waters of Europe rather than jumping off the deep end of the pier when we have not learned how to swim.</P>
      <P>Therefore, this present exercise is one of necessary self-discipline, it is not one we may enjoy; and for certain of our industries it is not one that will bring greater profits and greater employment.  For certain industries it may bring at worst complete destruction or at best no greater employment and less profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, it would be a very stupid politician or business man who would not accept what I have said: that the freeing of trade is happening through the EEC and through the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. Then the only sensible thing that could be done was that we should harmonise our tariffs so that we would be ready for accession to the EEC when the necessity for such arose&mdash;and that will arise when Britain goes in because 74 per cent of our external trade is with Britain.  Without Britain we could envisage a reduction of living standards, a reduction in employment, heavier emigration and many other ills. That does not mean that the self-discipline we must impose upon ourselves <Col N="2042" /> will not bring some of the ills I have mentioned.  It may be that the action we may have to take over the years may have that effect.</P>
    <P>There arises now something our party have been discussing in great detail.  I had two interviews today with the leader of my party in relation to the serious nature of this matter.  At this stage, there should be a definite policy direction to the effect that there is a great necessity for us, in our approach towards EEC and in relation to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, to defend the jobs we have.  Previously I quoted the old Irish proverb: An té nach bhfuil láidir ní foláir dó bheith glic&mdash;Those who are not strong must be clever.  We must remember that proverb in our approach to the harmonisation of trade, the reduction of tariffs, and the removal of quotas in certain areas one of which, of course, is the removal of the quotas on footwear on July 1st.</P>
    <P>We must ask are the Government doing their job.  Yesterday we had an amendment on the question of whether growers of tomatoes for export should be free from income tax.  The Minister felt we could not do this because now that we are negotiating with the EEC any new removal of taxes or any departures would place our negotiators in a difficult position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was only one of the excuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an interesting excuse from the point of view of the matter we are now discussing.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was intended as a preparation for entry into the EEC.  In their approach to this, the Government are like a train on railway lines.  They are running along with 10 per cent on the 1st July each year for every year commodity. In relation to our accession to the GATT and our support for the Kennedy round, we have taken 55 specific commodities and reduced the tariffs on them to harmonise with this international arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this party we think there is a necessity for an individual approach to the problems of industry and <Col N="2043" /> particularly of individual industries. The Government should not have approached this with a global 10 per cent but on the basis of 10 per cent for the industries that could take it.  There should have been a different approach to the industries that could not.  There is an absolute contravention of that agreement by Britain in respect of the deposit scheme which Britain introduced to prepare herself for entry into the Common Market.  I have already indicated to the House the subject matter of a very well thought out paper presented at the Council of Europe which seemed to prove that the only way Britain could prepare herself for the Comon Market was by budgeting for a surplus for 12 years.  That would be 12 years in which they would transfer a great deal of money from abovethe-line expenditure to capital moneys from direct taxation during the year. The purpose of this was to see that her balance of payments would come completely into line.</P>
    <P>In direct contravention of this agreement, Britain took a different stand. Some economic adviser discovered a different method of doing it.  As we know, you had to deposit vast millions when you exported to Britain.  This discouraged many exporters to Britain. By a happy accident, we had at that time, in the hands of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, overseas securities which had gone, to a certain extent, out of date so far as interest rates were concerned and this cushioned us against the sad results of Britain's policy.  In fact, it was advantageous for the Government to sell some of them and, even though they lost the interest rate in respect of the deposits, they will eventually find themselves better able to re-invest at higher interest rates, if they so wish, to preserve our overseas investments if that is the proper financial policy, which it would not be in order to discuss now.</P>
    <P>The fact is that Britain contravened entirely and absolutely the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and did so for far longer than the statutory period of 18 months which is available under the agreement.  If any sector of your <Col N="2044" /> industry, your employment or your people are being hurt, you have the right to invoke a clause and to reinstitute tariffs or quotas for a period of 18 months.  Britain continued to do that for more than 18 months and that is a direct contravention of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I also want to point out in relation to the 10 per cent reduction that the difference between the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the EEC is that there is no court of justice in that agreement.  The decision on the deposit scheme was taken unilaterally by Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>Might is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Britain did it, as Deputy Clinton has reminded me, on the basis that might is right.  There was nothing we could do, short of perpetrating another economic war, the results of which would be far too serious to contemplate.</P>
      <P>As a small nation we must consider how we should approach our accession to Europe.  If one is to take the broad spectrum of industrial production in which we have reduced the tariffs on imported goods by 10 per cent and in respect of which there is a tariff book as thick as my wrist and which includes thousands of items, there must be certain items which cannot bear the 10 per cent without going to the wall.  The Fine Gael Party are absolutely certain that we must prepare for Europe and for the freer trade conditions that are coming.  It is absolutely necessary to impose disciplines on ourselves.  Perhaps the Government were too involved in other matters which were serious for their own party and could not address themselves in detail to the economic problems, but that is no excuse.  Surely over those thousands of items, there were items on which a tariff reduction of less than 10 per cent or no reduction should have been imposed. We could have invoked the section of the agreement under which that could be done for 18 months.  Surely that would have been the right policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer in particular to the footwear industry and to the electrical goods industry. We are not certain if the electrical goods industry will be hit to a <Col N="2045" /> very serious extent, but we know it is one of the vulnerable ones.  There should have been discussions with the Department about how those industries could be made viable and how inside the 18 months their jobs could be preserved. We are now at the top of the hill in relation to the fourth reduction of 10 per cent.  The first 10 per cent reduction did not hit anybody.  The second made a few people worry.  The third was more serious.  The fourth is getting very near the bone.  An individual approach should have been adopted by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to items of choice.  Let us take the footwear industry and imagine a young lady going into a shop to buy a pair of shoes. She may be going to a dance or having an evening out.  Ten pairs of shoes are produced to her and seven of them are continental or British on which the total tariff at the moment is 22½ per cent.  She would buy by choice.  People in this House who are nearer to the matter might insist on buying Irish. Anyway we do not need fashion shoes. We probably have big flat feet as it is. That lady would buy by choice and the likelihood is that she would buy a pair of foreign shoes because the range of Irish shoes available to her since this quota was removed on 1st July would be smaller than the range of shoes from abroad.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Maurice Dockrell telling me about the situation in regard to wallpapers.  Choice is very important.  To give an example.  In relation to this highly detailed 10 per cent reduction there should have been an individual approach.  I understand that if you go to a wholesale builders' provider in Britain you may find in the wallpaper room 8,000 different types of wallpaper manufactured by 30, 40 or 50 firms.  We have been happily carrying on here on the basis of one wallpaper factory producing perhaps 50 or 100 designs&mdash;I do not know.  Certainly, the figure is nothing near 8,000.  If wallpapers were to be bought on choice in this country there is no doubt there would be trouble.  Therefore, this is also a sector where the individual approach should have been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2046" /> There should have been some nursing of the ailing child, a realisation that there are sectors where individual attention is necessary, a removal of the global approach in regard to grants, a removal of the global disqualification, very often, in the case of grants and substitution of the approach that would ensure that we got the very best results.</P>
    <P>My short term in the Council of Europe and some association in business with continentals have led me to believe that when we move from the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area and become members of EEC we shall find that continentals are absolutely unscrupulous, that from France to Italy and right across the Iron Curtain they will take the pants off you if they can. This is the sort of business approach that has not existed in these islands where, if you are doing business successfully, it is likely to continue.  Often, it is done on a great measure of trust. That is not so on the Continent.  I warn the Minister and the Government they must approach Europe in this way.  Surely there should have been an individual approach in regard to thousands of these items?  Perhaps in the British environment you would be all right but not in the background to the EEC environment.  While we may not be able to invoke any section of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in regard to these items, statements should have been made by the Minister's predecessor and by himself in regard to these sectors.</P>
    <P>There seems to be&mdash;it may be a political thing&mdash;great reluctance on the part of every Minister for Industry and Commerce to say: &ldquo;Things are not so good in that sector.&rdquo;  It might seem that to say that would lose votes but I would disagree with that.  Probably there would be great condemnation for a Minister and a Department that would announce that it was necessary in certain sectors to have special tactics and arrangements.  If one were to judge the British performance in regard to the deposit scheme solely on what was done, one might say that the British were as bad as the continentals, that they also deal on the basis that might is right to get away with as <Col N="2047" /> much as they can.  I do not think this is so.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, in regard to this set of tariff reductions I am utterly convinced that there was a case over the line for an individual approach and for invoking the 18 months clause in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement whereby certain items might be exempted at this stage from the 10 per cent tariff reduction. When that had been done there was also a need, having given the child its medicine, to attend to the child's general health, to look at those sectors and see what injections of special grants could be given to ensure that those industries would preserve themselves and that every job here would be fully preserved.  The preservation of these jobs in my view is probably far more important than the creation of new ones.  If one takes the number of new jobs created each year and compares it with the number of jobs provided in manufacturing industry at the moment, a loss of 20 per cent in present jobs of long standing would set us back, not-withstanding all the millions we spent on grants and all the incentives we gave, decades rather than years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out very strongly that the Minister might have indicated rather brutally under this imposition of duties legislation that the tariffs are beginning to bite rather sharply.  Admittedly, it is with the fifth reduction in 1971 that the real bite will come.  That gives us merely 12 months.  Even now, with the fourth reduction of 10 per cent there are many selected items on the list which will undoubtedly begin to bear increasingly the brunt of competition from imports. On that basis it is as well that the fore-bodings and concern expressed, and the points the Labour Party have made in respect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement should get a further hearing on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to point out that the Government anticipated that when these successive 10 per cent reductions were being introduced there would be parallel reduction with simultaneous accession to the EEC.  Even by the most conventional assessment it appears <Col N="2048" /> that we shall have gone to the sixth reduction&mdash;to put it that way&mdash;and it will be in two years time, after successive reductions, that Ireland will be entering the EEC and, therefore, the full effect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and simultaneous entry into the EEC itself will be felt only then.  Certainly, the timing and the anticipation of the Government seem to be rather cockeyed in this case.  I point out this because, after all, this was one of the fundamental criteria of the whole operation of acceptance by the Government of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  It was an interim preparatory agreement prior to entering the EEC.  It has begun to bite rather sharply even though, as yet, the birds have not come home to roost in respect of the EEC negotiations.  It is important to point out to Irish industry the imbalance which now exists.</P>
    <P>We are not speaking in any sense as economic Jeremiahs, or deliberately raising the white flag, or suffering from any undue inferiority in respect of our industrial and economic growth but we would point out that, with the reduction of tariffs this July and another reduction coming in July, 1971, the economic situation will be worsened.</P>
    <P>I do not want to digress unduly but we must bear in mind the dislocation caused to industry by the bank strike and its effect on our manufacturing credibility throughout the world.  There is also the substantial downturn which has occurred in the tourist industry in the first half of 1970.  Then there is the regrettable, almost intractable, absence of an effective prices and incomes policy.  I do not think it is unduly hysterical or lacking in objectivity to say that with a 10 per cent tariff reduction on top of all those difficulties, we are in an extremely difficult economic position.</P>
    <P>Next week on the adjournment debate we shall be discussing the general political and economic competence of the Government.  That is not an awe-inspiring prospect from our point of view but we shall send the Government off on their holidays in a reasonable frame of mind.  However, it behoves the Government during the <Col N="2049" /> summer recess to put their collective Cabinet imaginations together&mdash;and admittedly, they are very limited now with the departure of certain Ministers, notably Deputy Haughey&mdash;and find a solution for the economic situation.  I do not believe an emergency autumn Budget or anything like that would be adequate.  However, with the sharp bite of the fourth tariff reduction together with the extremely dangerous inflationary tendency and the fact that our imminent entry into the EEC has fallen apart, the situation certainly merited more than a one-page comment from the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  Admittedly, after two full days in the Dáil there is not much inclination to discuss the matter in depth.  Nevertheless, with these misgivings and, speaking with some hindsight, which is the privilege of the Opposition, I should like to hear the Minister's views on the total effect of the 10 per cent reduction in tariffs we face.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the line taken by Deputy Donegan in relation to this Bill.  It is unwise to have an across-the-board tariff reduction when it is possible to avoid this and when we have industries that need nursing a little further and need whatever additional assistance we can give them for a further period.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond has just said we are going through serious economic difficulties at the present time and that we should use every device at our disposal to assist people in industry and at least to keep in employment the people who are in employment and make sure there will be no further reduction.  There are at present 70,000 people unemployed.  In a serious situation of that kind we should take a very keen look at every move we can make lest any such move should have the effect of reducing employment still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Order, No. 178, it has been possible&mdash;I do not know under what authority&mdash;to reclassify a certain commodity, a commodity which, under the Brussels nomenclature, is not now dutiable.  It has been possible for us to take these trailers out and put them in under a different classification.  I do <Col N="2050" /> not know where this authority is given to the Minister, but it is a good thing that it is there.  If it can be done in the case of certain trailers, I see no reason why it cannot be extended somewhat further without breaching any existing agreement.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Donegan, I personally would not be over scrupulous in our approach to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I have discussed with some members of the British Parliament what I consider to be a number of breaches of the agreement of which the British side have been guilty since this agreement was entered into and they agree quite frankly that they have breached the agreement.  As Deputy Donegan says, if it was breached it was because might was right and there was very little or nothing we could do about it.</P>
    <P>We should protect industries that need this extended period of protection by being selective and by going through the large number of items of the various industries and saying: &ldquo;We will not reduce in this case.  We cannot because the industry would suffer and employment would be reduced&rdquo; or: &ldquo;This industry needs further nursing and while we can reduce by a small amount we certainly cannot reduce by the full 10 per cent.&rdquo;  There is no question but that this would be accepted. It probably would be resisted but while they were fighting against it and while we were opposing them, all the time this industry would be getting the benefit of this period.  It would not be advisable to adopt this procedure on a broad basis and without being selective, because our industry must be prepared for the competition it will meet in the circumstances of free trade. We must move as fast as possible towards that competitive position in industry, but we must do it carefully and selectively.  There are industries and sectors of industry where, if we were to provide this shelter for as long as possible, we could do a certain amount of good, sufficient good to carry them through to a point where they would be able to stand up to the European competition we shall meet in the future.  I have a feeling, which I think is shared by Ministers, that commitments <Col N="2051" /> into which we have already entered will be honoured and that we can make a strong case for honouring them if and when we get into the EEC.</P>
    <P>I was surprised and disappointed to hear the Minister for Finance trying to make the case, when opposing an amendment of mine recently, that we were in a straitjacket, that we had now made our application and there was nothing further we could do, that we could be accused of all sorts of things.  The British could not care less about what they are accused of and I would say the same about continental people I have met.  I would not describe them as being unscrupulous but I would describe them as being hard-headed business people who realise that in industry and commerce the world over you have a hard fight and you make whatever case you can and do whatever you can possibly get away with for as long as you are allowed to get away with it.</P>
    <P>If it is to the advantage of any sector of our economy to refuse to carry out this reduction at the present time, or for a further period, we should resist it.  I am at least as anxious as any other Deputy to ensure that industry will succeed and that employment should arise from making things at home.  Here we have a particular item, trailers and these, as far as I know, are made only by one firm which is tantamount to a monopoly.  I understand that these are really good trailers which nobody could fault and I understand that this industry gives a lot of employment and we should be anxious to ensure that employment would continue to be provided.  I understand also that they are making the maximum effort to build themselves up to the point at which they will be competitive even within the EEC.  This industry needs to be supported but it is quite a dangerous thing to do if there is no opposition.  I should like to hear the Minister tell the House that protecting this single industry will not impose on the people who buy these trailers, the farmers, a much bigger price for trailers than otherwise they would have to pay.</P>
    <P>I would agree, that even if they are <Col N="2052" /> somewhat dearer, that because of the employment and because of the desirability of having an industry that can be built up still further, we should permit this and we should be anxious to do it.  However, there is a danger which I should like the Minister to recognise.  I should like him to assure the House that we are not protecting the industry to the point where we are putting a serious burden on the backs of people who in some cases are probably less well able to pay.  Otherwise I agree with this protection.  I have the greatest admiration for the industry and the manner in which it has been built up as well as for the product being turned out.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think we have taken the easy way out in this Bill. We have just carried out this tariff reduction across the board.  The Minister could find himself in difficulties that if it were known he was going to do this he would have a clamour from every industry.  However, he is in the happy position that he now has a fairly detailed report on every industry because such a survey was carried out over a number of years in order to find out what these industries would be up against in the circumstances of free trade.  Having this information, the Minister should go through it with a fine comb and decide that a further 10 per cent tariff reduction in this case is going to deal a very severe blow to this industry, a blow from which it is unlikely to recover, and if it gets this extra bit of time and if it is desirable because it is giving good employment, then the Minister should take out that particular industry and be man enough to say: &ldquo;We are going to protect you regardless of what the other industries will say, regardless of what the people will say, that this is picking out and favouring a certain industry.&rdquo;  If he were to set up an independent board to look at the report they could pick out the weak spots and take them off the Minister's shoulders so that he could not be accused of being politically partial to one industry or to one sector.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that I think this is taking the easy way.  In taking the easy way and, perhaps, being too impetuous <Col N="2053" /> about getting this extra effort put in by industrialists to equip themselves to meet the competition which they will definitely meet in a very short time, we may be too impetuous to get to that point.  It would be well worthwhile if we had set up this body to examine and select the industries in which we think this tariff reduction should not take place, certainly on the full 10 per cent or at a reduced rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Donegan and Deputy Clinton and Deputy Clinton seems to confuse the issue.  I am a bit confused about what he is advocating.  On the one hand he asked the Minister to be selective and when he is selective, or if he tries to be selective in order to protect some firm, the Deputy comes down on the other side and says: &ldquo;Take care that you are not going to impose a burden on the backs of the community which the community is not able to bear.&rdquo; I heard all this talk before.  I remember the time when we were told that a great number of our industries were a burden on the backs of the primary producer but I am not going to refer to that.  I do not see how the Minister could set out here to justify selectivity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy wants to set up a board to go into other cases. Deputy Donegan said that he was in favour of free trade and talked of harmonisation but he left out rationalisation. No more than any other Deputy I have no desire to see tariffs reduced at the expense of employment, but we either mean what we say or we do not. I believe there is no such argument as &ldquo;I will&rdquo; and &ldquo;I will not&rdquo; in this.  For the last six or seven years the Government have been advocating adaptation, encouraging firms to adapt their current methods in order to propel us into Europe, if this comes about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We still have a high tariff wall.  Bear <Col N="2054" /> in mind, this is a preferential tariff.  It does not apply all round.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was mentioned.  That agreement helped our industries.  Those who slated it made no reference whatever to the increase in industrial exports since that agreement was negotiated.  Admittedly we suffered a setback when Britain introduced levies against certain of our products. As I said earlier, trade is not a one way traffic.  We cannot hope to face for Europe without taking some medicine of some kind.  Several industries here were well protected from the start and if some of these are not now able to meet reasonable competition there is just nothing any government can do for them.  The Government and the various agencies of the Government would be prepared to go a long way, but there is a limit.  In a matter of this kind one cannot be too selective because, if one is, Deputy Clinton, Deputy Donegan, or some other Deputy, will accuse us of being selective. Most of our industries are small. Early on we set out to give them all the necessary advice so that the skills required would be there.  If some did not heed that advice, then it is just too bad for them.  One side of the issue is argued and there is no reference whatever to what is happening on the other side.  That causes me to think that there is a certain amount of confusion.  I do not see what the mythical board about which Deputy Clinton talked could do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a myth.  I think we have been reasonably successful and I cannot see all the hazards the Deputy visualises on the road to Europe.  We live in changing times. There are elements which can hamper and hamstring.  Some of these are very real at the moment.  The only hope I have is that, faced with an element of competition, we will be able to purge ourselves of some of this inward thinking. I know more about the footwear industry than Deputy Donegan does; I am actively engaged in it.</P>

      <P>If there is any industry which should be reasonably equipped and reasonably competent to face competition it is the footwear industry.</P>
      <P>There is one point on which I should like some information from the Minister. Recently I have noticed large imports of secondhand machines.  Some of the earthmoving equipment is fairly obsolete.  It is lying idle in yards throughout the country.  The equipment is repainted and shellacked to look like new but, when one puts it to work, one discovers that it is anything but new.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 180.  It provided for the fourth tariff reduction.  It is the order of 1st July, 1969.  The House has been talking specifically about next year when we will have the fifth order. We have already had the fifth order and the next one on 1st July, 1971, will be the sixth.  In actual fact, therefore, we are 10 per cent further down without this catastrophe about which Deputies talked.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carter has to some extent stolen the show from me in the comments he made.  They were the kind of obvious comments that would automatically arise on Deputy Clinton's each way backing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton spoke about unemployment.  There is far less industrial unemployment here than ever before despite the allegations about the effect of the fourth or fifth round of cuts in duties that have taken place.  I agree with Deputy Donegan when he says that a number of our industries need a certain amount of nursing, encouragement and protection at this stage.  The agreement entered into provides in this year, the year that <Col N="2057" /> commenced on 1st July, 1970, that our Government may conduct a review as to where specified difficulties will exist. Two industries are threatened by reason of modification or elimination of import duties.</P>

      <P>Check the records.  The Deputy did not.  I listened carefully to the Deputy.  I did not hear him make such a reference.  He was suggesting we should do this.  I am saying provision was made for so doing.  This is a particular exercise which my Department is actively engaged in at present in relation to seeing what can be done in regard to the minimum number of industries that now appear to be in some little way affected.  Certainly, there is no reason at all why any impression should be created that there are a huge number of industries suffering from this.  Deputy Donegan loses no opportunity&mdash;fair play to him&mdash;of referring to the footwear industry.  He knows there was a postponement of the withdrawal of the termination of the quota over a two year period.  This sort of quota restriction was terminated on 1st July of this year without any serious objection from the manufacturers. I am sure the Deputy is pretty fully aware of this.  In actual fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in close contact, naturally, with the industry as a whole. There has been no outcry against what Deputy Clinton calls the across-the-board reduction of 10 per cent.  Both Deputies on the far side of the House stressed the fact.  In fairness to Deputy Donegan, it must be conceded that at all stages he stressed the necessity of industry here being prepared and endeavouring to prepare itself as fully as possible for our entry into the EEC. This was the purpose of this exercise by way of preparation for this.  Certainly, it would be wrong were I to accept what Deputy Clinton says, namely, that we should pick out single industries for protection because of this <Col N="2058" /> desperate difficulty of appearing to give preference to one industry rather than another.  Again, I do not want to refer to the one to which the Deputy himself referred but you cannot have this thing both ways.  In that, we should endeavour to come to agreements and abide by agreements.  I do not think that two wrongs at any time make a right and I certainly would not support their approach to the problem.</P>

      <P>I would point out that we already had an extension period in the retaining beyond two years of the quota for the footwear industry, and the manufacturers were fully in agreement with the withdrawal of the quota this year.  This was the duty free importation quota, a quota which would allow a certain amount of shoes to be imported.  Now there is a duty where there was not a duty before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill outlines the content of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969 and describes in detail the <Col N="2063" /> further provisions now contained in this Bill.  When the 1969 legislation was before the House it was explained that this second Bill would be needed to deal with various matters of detail in connection with the changeover and that the Decimal Currency Board were studying the matters which would need to be included.  The Bill now before the House is based on the board's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The board's bulletins and other publications are supplied to Deputies as they are issued and copies are available in the Library.  Many Deputies will therefore be already aware of the general background to this legislation and of what is involved in the introduction of decimal currency on 15th February, 1971.  It may help, however, if I mention some salient points about the changeover.</P>
    <P>Our decimal system will be the £&mdash; new penny system.  The Irish £ remains unaffected, of course, by the change of currency system and it will be the major unit in the new system as it was in the old.  On decimal day, 15th February, 1971 the banks, Government Departments, CIE and a large number of business firms will switch to the use of decimal currency for all their transactions. Decimal day will also see the issue into general circulation of the three bronze decimal coins:</P>
    <P>the 2 new pence&mdash;value 4.8d.</P>
    <P>the 1 new penny&mdash;value 2.4d.</P>
    <P>the ½ new penny&mdash;value1.2d.</P>
    <P>The three cupro-nickel decimal coins are already in circulation and are being used as their £sd equivalents in value. These coins are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>the 50 new pence&mdash;value 10/-</P>
    <P>the 10 new pence&mdash;value 2/-</P>
    <P>the 5 new pence&mdash;value 1/-</P>
    <P>From decimal day these three coins will begin to be used in their decimal denominations.</P>
    <P>An overnight switch from £sd to decimal currency working by all shops and businesses in the country is not possible.  Up to decimal day all transactions between firms and between individuals must be in pounds, shillings and pence.  To enable businesses to change to decimal currency working cash registers and other machines <Col N="2064" /> throughout the country must be converted or replaced.  This machine task has to be spread over a period since the capacity of machine suppliers is not unlimited.</P>
    <P>There must therefore be a changeover period beginning on decimal day. During that period both currency systems will be legal&mdash;except that cheques must be written in decimal currency&mdash;and the old 1d, 3d and 6d coins will continue to circulate for the purpose of £sd cash transactions.  It is not possible at this stage to forecast precisely what length of changeover period will be needed by businesses; but it seems likely that the switch to decimal currency will be completed in all sectors within a year or so following decimal day.  In the interest of efficiency it is desirable that the changeover period should be as short as possible.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Bill itself, the purpose of which is to establish the legislative framework for effecting the changeover.  It does not attempt to legislate for every decimalisation problem. Statutory arrangements are required only for cases where serious inequity or large-scale administrative difficulties could otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the interpretation of the Bill.  The effect of section 2 is that cheques must be written in the new currency on and from decimal day.  Section 3 is intended to facilitate the banks in the days preceding decimal day, when they will have the massive task of converting all their customers' balances to decimal terms. Section 4 provides for the conversion to decimal terms of £sd amounts written on cheques and similar instruments drawn before decimal day but not paid in until on or after that date. Section 5 prescribes the method of conversion as from decimal day of references to shillings or pence in bank balances.</P>
    <P>This conversion will be done on the basis of the Whole New Penny Conversion Table given in the Schedule to the Bill.  The banks will account only in whole new pence.  This Table therefore gives the amounts in whole new pence which are nearest in value to £sd penny amounts up to 2s. Some individual debtors or creditors <Col N="2065" /> may gain or lose marginally through use of the Table.  However, the maximum loss or gain will be 1 1/5d and this will usually be negligible in relation to the total due.  In the overall the Table will give equitable results because it is designed so that increases and decreases due to rounding, balance out.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of money transactions in general.  During the changeover period it will be possible to make in cash an exact settlement of every £sd debt because the £sd system will still be legal and the old coins will be in circulation.  If an amount to be paid includes old pence, however, it will not be possible to write a valid cheque which settles the debt exactly. Section 6 of the Bill therefore provides that £sd amounts paid by cheque during the changeover period will be converted to decimal currency on the basis of the Whole New Penny Table, so that a valid cheque can be written for the resultant amount.  Under section 13 of the Bill the Whole New Penny Table is also prescribed as a basis for settling in the new currency &mdash;whether in cash or by cheque&mdash;any £sd amounts that have to be paid after the changeover period.  At that stage the decimal system will be the only legal currency system and the £sd coins will have been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The position of regular weekly or monthly payments such as mortgage repayments, ordinary life assurance premiums and hire purchase instalments is dealt with by section 7 of the Bill.  As in the case of any other £sd debt, a person making such a payment will retain the right to pay the existing £sd amount in cash during the changeover period.  If he prefers to pay in decimal currency during the changeover period he will be free to convert the shillings and pence on the basis of the Whole New Penny Conversion Table and to pay that amount.  After the end of the changeover period the payment must be made according to the whole New Penny Table.</P>
    <P>A special arrangement is however necessary in regard to premiums payable under industrial life assurance policies or friendly society contracts. A large number of such contracts involve <Col N="2066" /> very small weekly cash payments and many of these do not convert exactly into decimal currency terms. Application of a conversion table individually to such small payments would in some cases cause a relatively appreciable change in the amount of the payment.  Section 8 of the Bill will enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make regulations prescribing an equitable solution to come into effect as from decimal day.  It is intended that these regulations will prescribe that the total £sd amount payable over a period of four weeks will be converted into the nearest equivalent in decimal coins that is, to the nearest nearest half new penny.  For example, a premium of 1d a week&mdash;that is 4d for a four weekly period&mdash;will become 1½ new pence payable over four weeks, that is to say nothing in the first week and a new halfpenny in each of the following three weeks.  In this example the policy holder would be paying slightly less than before but in another case he might have to pay a fraction more.  Benefits payable under policies will not change.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 contain an important group of provisions concerned with conversion of statutory references to amounts of money which include shillings or pence.  The bulk of statutory references to £sd will not give rise to any difficulty as they will convert exactly to decimal currency terms.  In some cases, however, it may be necessary to make some slight adjustment if the amount does not convert exactly. Section 10 of the Bill gives the necessary powers to enable this to be done. The powers in this section will not be used to make any changes that are not required for decimalisation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 14 of the Bill will ensure that the changeover to decimal currency does not invalidate any contracts or other formal documents which contain references to amounts of money in £sd.  For example, if after the changeover a person makes a will which mentions an amount in £sd.  For example, if after the changeover a person makes a will which mentions an amount in £sd, it will not be invalid.  However, all payments under £sd contracts and other legal documents will fall to be made in <Col N="2067" /> decimal currency under section 13 of the Bill after the changeover period. The Bill does not say how all £sd references mentioned in contracts or other legal documents are to be converted to decimal terms.  There is no need for it to do so.  References to £sd in these documents need be altered only at the instance and with the agreement of the parties concerned.  Different methods of conversion may be appropriate depending on the type of reference involved.  Many £sd references in contracts and agreements are not payable sums but merely items in a calculation&mdash;perhaps, a unit price in a contract for the purchase of thousands of units.  Where it is decided to convert these references exact conversion rather than application of a conversion table will be appropriate in order to minimise the differences between final amounts for payment.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that the changeover to decimal currency will give rise to an overall increase in price levels.  There is no foundation for this. Many prices will not be affected at all by the changeover to decimal currency. There will be no reason to alter the prices of articles costing £1, £2, £3 and so on because the £ will not change. Similarly, the prices of articles costing 6d or any multiple of 6d will be exactly convertible because sixpence is worth exactly 2½ new pence.  For other prices the use of a new halfpenny conversion table is being promoted. This table gives to the nearest half new penny the decimal currency amounts corresponding to £sd amounts involving odd pence and is so constructed that over the whole range of prices up to one shilling increases and decreases cancel out.  The use of the new halfpenny table, the good sense of traders, the force of competition and the public alertness which will result from the activities of the Decimal Currency Board, will all combine to ensure that decimalisation as such will not result in an overall increase in the level of prices.  Furthermore, any apparently unjustified price increases coming to notice will be investigated by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>During the changeover period those <Col N="2068" /> who sell goods or services will offer them at a decimal price or at an £sd price.  Once a shop has gone decimal, their prices will be decimal prices only and it will not normally be open to the customer to decide that he prefers to pay an £sd price.  There will not be two prices.  This does not mean that people will have to make a point of carrying both currencies.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since sixpence in the old currency is exactly equivalent to 2½ new pence, exact change can always be given if customers tender in sixpenny multiples.  The Decimal Currency Board will impress this point on retailers and the public.</P>
      <P>Up to the present a great deal of the Decimal Currency Board's activities have been directed towards getting businesses&mdash;large and small&mdash;to identify everything that needs to be done and to set about preparations in good time.  From the board's contacts with business firms and organisations throughout the country they are satisfied that the business community generally is responding well to the call for efficient preparation.  No intractable problems have been encountered but there is still a proportion of traders who have been dilatory in setting about the task of preparations.  These should take action without further delay.</P>
      <P>An important part of the board's future work will be to prepare the general public for the use of decimal currency so that they will understand it thoroughly.  A special publicity campaign will be conducted for this purpose. Timing is, of course, important here.  If the familiarisation of the public were done too soon the effects would have disappeared somewhat by the time the public came to use it.  In the six weeks before decimal day the board will switch the weight of publicity over to the general public.  A special explanatory leaflet will be sent to each household in the country, and I feel confident that the public will come up to 15th February, 1971, with the knowledge of decimal currency fresh in their minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think so. I am very popular in my party.  The Deputy's father used to be.  This is a Bill on which there can be no disagreement. We have studied this measure. There are certain things you could say might have been done.  It is the right of the Government to do what they think should be done as long as they are the Government.  There is one question as to whether or not the florin or the two shilling piece would have been a better unit.  The flaw in that is that we might be different from Britain. From our tourist point of view that might be an asset.  We have not done this.  We have the pounds and the pence.  The pounds and the pence will produce a difficult situation as far as the changeover is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might well be that the florin would have been a better unit except that there is the point that we would have been different.  If being different is wrong then we would have been wrong but if being different is right, as far as we are concerned, selfishly, then we would have been right.  It is just a point to think that we could have had ten florins to the £ rather than 100p.  It is something on which a decision was made by the Department of Finance with the previous Minister in on the discussions.  There is the point, however, that many people have said that the florin or two shilling piece might have been a distinctive unit for us. With ten of them to a £ we could have done very well and then one-tenth of that would have been about 2.4p.  This would have been exactly in line with what is here on the pence, which is the 1p.  This is just a point.  The Government took the other decision.  Maybe they were right or maybe they were wrong, I am not saying which.  Personally I would have preferred the florin <Col N="2070" /> and I should like to hear the Minister saying whether he considers that there would have been any merit in having the florin as a unit.</P>
    <P>The statement by the Minister that the Irish £ will be unaffected is incorrect. Our experience in regard to turnover tax was that when the 2½ per cent went on there was difficulty, particularly in regard to the smaller units of purchase, as there was no convenient coin to produce 2½ per cent.  Half-pennies have been more or less out in the last few years and what happened was that when the 2½ per cent was added the increase to the consumer was more of the order of 4 per cent. I am not arguing now about whether or not the Government should have put on the 2½ per cent.  I can visualise a situation whereby a 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax if applicable would be necessary&mdash;I am not making a political point of this but merely saying that when you put 2½ per cent turnover tax on you end up with a figure of around 4 per cent real increase. Here you have the situation whereby you just shake up all the currency and at the lower levels you have the 1.2d which is the new ½p and the 2.4d.  which is the 1p and 2 new pence is equal to 4.8d.  Imagine the prices on such articles as the box of matches or the bar of soap, articles at the lower levels.  I cannot visualise any unit of production, or any supply service agreeing that there must be a reduction in the cost of the article.  The statement by the Minister that the £ would be unaffected is quite incorrect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Deputy's point.  What I meant was the parity of the £1 unit.  Is this what the Deputy means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  So we are not in disagreement.  I am saying that when this change occurs in the lower levels for things like the bar of soap, the box of matches or the razor blade, all of those things which are used every day, the prices will be corrected and they will be corrected upwards.  The Minister of course has dealt with the situation which arises when you get up into the pounds and somebody might lose 1.2 pence paying a bill after decimal <Col N="2071" /> day.  This on one pound is quite small, on £1,000 it is of no consequence. so we do not have to worry about that. However, I do want to make the point that this will further increase the cost of living.  That is not to be taken as a criticism of the Government.  I do not make it as such, it is merely stating a fact.  If there has to be a decimalisation day then this will occur. I hope the Minister will not accept this as a criticism but just as a fact.</P>
      <P>The question of cheques is one to which we must address ourselves. After decimal day cheques must be written in decimal money.  I hope that what will happen, if the cheque is written in old money, is that the local manager will correct the cheque and honour the cheques.  In Ireland if a cheque is refused for any reason it is tantamount to having stolen money. Rumours spread around and so you must not have a cheque refused.  In regard to cheques being refused the local bank manager may pass it or he may not.  I hope that arrangements will be made so that a cheque written after decimal day in old money terms will be corrected by the bank manager, and then having&mdash;it is quite impossible to make a speech here with the Labour Party having a chat.  I have chats with the Labour Party all the time but it is quite impossible to make a speech with that party having a chat when into your ear comes this thing which you half hear and half do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister has undertaken in the last <Col N="2072" /> paragraph of his speech that such cheques will be met.  Is this correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is true.  They will be entitled to convert in accordance with the tables set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an important point here and that is if a man was rogue enough to write a cheque after decimal day in old money terms for £100 1s 11d knowing that such cheque would not be met he would really have committed a criminal offence.  It is very important that this should be publicised, that if the cheque is written in old money it will be met, and for what period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in agreeing with the Deputy I may have been misleading him.  This point is important.  The position would be that cheques which are written before decimal day in £sd and are presented for payment after decimal day will be converted in accordance with the whole new penny conversion table and will be met, but cheques which are written after decimal day in the £sd system will, strictly speaking, according to law be invalid. I would expect, however, that banks would deal with these as they deal with those written at the start of the New Year when people by mistake inscribe the year that has just passed.  This happens regularly; the banks deal with these cheques and I expect the banks will equally use their discretion in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that this should be publicised in the newspapers: if a man is careless enough or so uninformed as to write a cheque in £sd after decimal day, if he is honest and his bank manager knows him the cheque will be met.  At the same time, we should be warned against persons who deliberately and of fell purpose make this mistake because they do not want cheques to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a business man. The Minister practised as a solicitor. We both know there are people who will take advantage of a situation and I think it would be a very very good idea <Col N="2073" /> if the Press were to publicise this.  It would be simultaneously a warning and a possible deterrent.  Those who accept cheques as payment for goods could suffer.  I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily, but this is important.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the florin might have been the unit of currency.  Possibly the difficulties internationally were such that this could not be done.  It is a pity. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most people wish this Bill had been introduced 30 or 40 years ago.  It would have made life for a section of the community much easier down through the years. Presumably it is being introduced now because of our imminent entry into the EEC.  It is one of the tangible effects of entry.  I doubt if people have taken a great deal of notice of the symbols on the coins.  The 2s piece still looks the same.  The fact that it is ten new pence has not made any great impact because the value of the coin has remained more or less stable.</P>
      <P>Decimal day is just six months away. The promotional campaign initiated by the Decimal Coinage Board has not really got across to the public generally. There have been promotional campaigns in all the major towns and business people are beginning to realise that this change is coming more quickly, perhaps, than they anticipated. They are beginning to wake up to the need to adjust their prices, in some cases in both the new and the current coinage.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the promotion that will take place between now and decimal day to educate people generally in regard to this new coinage. It is the experience of doing business in the new coinage which will ultimately educate the public.  People will &mdash;unfortunately for themselves, perhaps&mdash;learn by their mistakes.  That is the way in which a great many of them will really be educated.  The hard school of experience will be more effective than all the lectures and campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the previous speaker when he says the 2s piece would have been a better unit for us to start with. I believe the 10s piece would be a far <Col N="2074" /> better unit for many reasons.  The British, who initiated this system&mdash;we seem to have copied them somewhat slavishly&mdash;made the mistake of deliberately holding on to their £ sterling more, I think, for old time's sake than for any practical reason.  The 10s piece can be converted into 100 new pence and would more readily identify itself with the old system of currency.  It would have been a much better unit. There would, too, have been some relationship between the 10s piece and the American dollar.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a plea to the Minister for the retention of the 6d piece.  I tabled questions some months back about this.  I believe there will be a great deal of confusion if this coin is dropped.  It would be a much more useful coin than the new 5d.  The sixpence is used in a variety of transactions. The normal postage rate is 6d. A great many slot machines operate on sixpences.  The sixpenny bit had, unfortunately, been dropped when the parking meters were installed and I believe that was the factor which prompted the authorities concerned to make parking 1s.  It would have been far better to retain the sixpenny piece. That has been done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Again, toilet meters will be affected by this change.  Presumably the old penny meter would in due course have been revised upwards.  A heavy coin was needed to operate it.  I wonder has the Minister any ideas as to how these meters will operate with the new currency. Food dispensing machines require coins to operate them, though these may not be affected because most require a 2s piece and the ten new pence will fill the bill here.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is over-optimistic when he says prices will not increase as a result of decimalisation.  I hope he is right, but I do not see that being the course of events.  A number of commodities will be affected by the change, particularly small items in the sweet and confectionery trade.  Papers and periodicals will likewise be affected.</P>
