      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before answering the first question I should like to inform you, Sir, and the House, that before leaving his home this morning the Minister for Finance met with an accident which has resulted in concussion. He is now in hospital and has been ordered to remain under medical observation for some days.  Therefore, I will introduce the Financial Statement myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues express regret in regard to the accident of the Minister for Finance?  We hope he will be all right shortly.  We fully understand the situation.</P>

      <P>I should also like to express, on behalf of the Labour Party, sympathy with the Minister.  He would have required sympathy today and it is just too bad that he does require it for another reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the present position of the talks between Britain and Ireland on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was discussed by Irish and British Ministers in London on 19th and 20th February last.  Since then there has been continuing contact between the <Col N="1682" /> two Governments on various aspects of the agreement such as the question of the supply of Irish butter and cheese to the British market for 1970-71, the arrangements for which were announced recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not admit that this agreement is working very much to the advantage of Great Britain and to our disadvantage and that our adverse trade balance with Britain has increased from something like £1 million a year to £60 million or £70 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that contention.  As I explained before, the adverse trade balance is not due to any appreciable degree to the operation of the agreement and so far as it is, the adverse trade balance is being brought about to a large extent by the import of capital goods for further production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>How can it be called a free trade agreement when Britain can send in what she likes to the detriment of our industrialists while we can export to Britain only a small percentage of our surplus of butter and bacon, for example?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has sought a meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, to discuss EEC entry negotiations and the political situation in the Six Counties; and, if not, when he will seek such a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the political situation in the Six Counties I would refer the Deputy to the replies I gave to similar questions on the 4th and 24th February last.  With regard to Common Market entry negotiations there are no indications that there is need at present for discussions at Prime Minister level on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the situation in Northern Ireland the Taoiseach has simply referred us to <Col N="1683" /> answers he gave in February last.  Since February&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that since February there has been a deterioration in the north and such a deterioration would surely warrant his being in touch with Mr. Wilson on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some deterioration in certain respects but I want to assure the Deputy and the House that the Government are keeping in close touch with the situation. We want to ensure that anything which requires to be done will be done in the best interests of achieving, first of all, peace in the Six Counties and ultimately the unity of the country.  We want to avoid taking action that would be inimical to these two objectives.  I can assure the Deputy that nothing that requires to be done will be left undone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain how it could be inimical to the attainment of these objectives for him to keep in touch with <Col N="1684" /> Mr. Wilson?  If he is not keeping in touch with Mr. Wilson himself will he say how it is being done?  Is it simply at ambassadorial level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy as a result of his own experience will know how Prime Ministers can keep in touch with each other without personal meetings. Everything in that direction that is necessary is being done.</P>

      <P>Various aspects of modern farm methods, such as the use of pesticides and other chemicals on crops, the use of drugs in the treatment of animals and the disposal of farm waste, which could involve human and animal health considerations, are under continual review by my Department.  In certain cases, existing legislation includes safeguards to control the use of potentially harmful chemicals and drugs.  As the Deputy is aware research institutions both here and abroad are also conducting investigations, on a continuing basis, into the problems of environmental contamination arising out of modern farm practices.</P>

      <P>The latest available information is contained in the census of population which was taken on the 9th April, 1961.  At that time, 43 per cent of the 676,402 existing dwellings had not got a piped water supply and 46 per cent did not have flush toilet facilities.  Since the date of the 1961 census, 58,000 grants have been paid for the installation of piped water and sewerage services in existing private dwellings.  In addition, 92,000 new dwellings have been built&mdash;practically all of which are fully serviced.  While up-to-date figures of the number of serviced dwellings are not available, it is obvious, from these figures, that a substantially higher percentage of dwellings is now serviced than in 1961. It is intended to include particulars of sanitary facilities in the census to be taken next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The assumption underlying the Deputy's question is not correct. Expenditure on unemployment assistance is financed from the Exchequer. However, certain urban local authorities are required under section 26 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933 as amended, to make an annual contribution to the Exchequer towards the cost of unemployment assistance in their areas, in each of which the higher scale of unemployment assistance rates is applicable.  These authorities, numbering sixteen in all, are the councils of the cities and of the larger towns with populations in excess of 7,000.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a table showing the amount of the contribution payable for 1969-70 by each of the contributing local authorities and the annual level of unemployment assistance payments in their areas at current rates.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, concerning expenditure on unemployment assistance in the functional areas of the non-contributing local authorities, I regret that the information available in my Department does not enable me to supply the particulars requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Following is the table:</P>

      <P>The answer is in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to have published with the Official Report. The statement shows the mileage of each Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for the period from 2nd July, 1969, to 31st March, 1970, and the total cost in each case.  The cost has been calculated on the basis of the average inclusive cost per mile.  This is 2s 2d and covers petrol, oil, tyres, maintenance and depreciation, and also the salaries and subsistence allowances of the official drivers.</P>

      <P>Substantial overall economies have undoubtedly been effected as a result of this reorganisation.  It is, however, impossible to relate the costs for any particular period under the new system to the costs which would have been incurred if the reorganisation of the system had not taken place.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take <Col N="1708" /> Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>No import duty has been payable on leather footwear for many years. Accordingly no duty-free licences for leather footwear have been issued in the years mentioned in the question.</P>
      <P>A statement showing types and quantities of rubber and plastic footwear for which duty-free licences have been issued in the years 1968 and 1969 will, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, be circulated with the Official Report.  Figures for the year 1967 are not available.  It is not the practice to give the names of the persons to whom duty-free licences are issued and my Department has no information as to the value or origin of the imports.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that quota licences outside the appointed quota are issued for certain special types of leather footwear.  In accordance with statutory requirements a statement giving the names of recipients, the number of licences and the quantities licensed has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for the years 1967, 1968 and 1969.</P>
      <P>At the request of a section of the footwear industry, quota protection on leather footwear, which was due for removal on 1st July, 1968, in accordance with arrangements made under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, was continued for a further period of two years with the agreement of the UK authorities and will be discontinued on 1st July, 1970. As from that date leather footwear will be subject to the following tariff rates:</P>

I would ask the Minister whether he is aware that to allow the duty-free importation of this special type of shoe would enable our athletes to train and to compete on equal terms with international competitors?

The total amount of footwear imported into this country, whether under quota or under duty-free licence, is so small relative to the total consumption of footwear that it cannot be of any significance in regard to difficulties arising in the trade.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands why his Department refused to give a trade union (name supplied) information requested about service of its members with the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The request from the trade union to which the Deputy refers was for particulars of the years of service credited <Col N="1714" /> to each of the Land Commission gangers in County Meath.  These particulars were furnished to the union on 10th April last but, in accordance with normal practice, the names of the individual gangers were not supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is reasonable to ask for the names of the men so that a comparison can be made in relation to the service with which each man was being credited so that he would be able to know whether he was getting credit for the correct amount of service?  It is very bad labour relations for a State Department to refuse to give information which is given by every employer in the country except this particular section of the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The information originally sought was not in regard to service with the Land Commission but in relation to the years of service credited to each of the gangers in County Meath.  Apparently the commission took the view that it would be inappropriate to supply this information without the approval of the men concerned and that it would not be proper to do so.  The Deputy apparently was annoyed about this and was in touch with the Land Commission and stated the people concerned were all members of the union.</P>
      <P>As a result, there was consultation with the Labour Court.  As a result of that consultation, the commission furnished the information as requested and this included service other than that with the Land Commission.  They took the view that they would be open to criticism if they gave personal information of the kind asked for about identifiable employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Does the Minister now say that the Land Commission are entitled to refuse to recognise a trade union as representing a number of employee members?  All other employers have given such information. the only employer who has refused being the Land Commission.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the report on the survey referred to by the Deputy has not been published, but that some details of it were given by one of the speakers at a recent seminar in Dublin on &ldquo;Youth Employment&rdquo;. If my information is correct, these interviews were conducted in 1966-67; the boys concerned had left school before they reached 14 and most of them had not received any form of post-primary education.  The advent of the free education, free transport and free books schemes has transformed the situation since that time but as I mentioned in my Estimates speech there remains the problem of the small <Col N="1716" /> minority who do not now continue at school on a voluntary basis.  We need to study the special requirements of these children and how to cater for them.</P>
      <P>My awareness of the need for the provision of a system of pupil guidance is evidenced by the fact that a system of guidance for all post-primary pupils throughout the country has been initiated.  For this purpose courses of training as guidance teachers in their own schools were given to selected teachers in 1968 and 1969 and it is intended to hold a further course this summer.  It is proposed to continue with the provision of training programmes until the services of a guidance teacher are available in all post-primary schools.</P>

      <P>My Department has <Col N="1717" /> already sanctioned an appropriate grant towards the cost of erecting the proposed new special school in Carlow for children who are mildly mentally handicapped. It is not the practice to make public the arrangements made between my Department and the school manager in respect of grant and local contribution for any particular school, but I may say that in deciding the proportion of the cost of the project which would be met by State grant, all relevant considerations were taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister not state what exactly the grant is?  The local community in Carlow subscribed most generously to this school and it is regrettable there is no sign of a start being made.  The site is available, the people there have worked hard, and recently a letter came from the Department, dated 15th April, notifying the school manager that alternative accommodation should be found in the meantime and that the Department would pay the cost.

      <i>Introduction</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach (for the Minister for Finance) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of brevity, I am confining my Financial Statement this year as closely as possible to the measures I propose to take to deal with the economy as I see it developing during 1970.  I am omitting much of the usual background material and commentry on the state of the economy.  These will be found in the various official publications issued within the last few weeks and in a supplementary statement which is now <Col N="1719" /> being circulated in the House.  This departure will enable me to go straight to matters of more immediate budgetary interest and will, I hope, commend itself to Deputies.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Outturn of Current Budget 1969-70</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Budget of May, 1969, was aimed at balancing expenditure and revenue at £393 million.  The rising tide of inflation throughout the year carried both expenditure and revenue, virtually in balance, to the higher level of £411 million.</P>
      <P>The steep rise in incomes, prices and consumer expenditure created remarkable buoyancy under the heads of income tax, customs and excise duties and sales taxes.  Supplementary Estimates, excluding those giving effect to budgetary changes, amounted to over £20 million.  Higher pay for public servants and a Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture were among the extra charges which fully absorbed the unusual growth in revenue.</P>
      <P>While the higher level at which the Current Budget was balanced is an unmistakable reminder of the inflation we experienced last year, it is worth remembering that the achievement of a balance was a marked improvement on the preceding year's performance when the deficit of £8 million added to the inflationary forces then at work in the economy.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Outturn of Capital Budget 1969-70</i>
      </P>
      <P>Expenditure in 1969-70 on the public capital programme was £173.4 million &mdash;an increase of £6.6 million on the figure of £166.8 million originally provided. Excluding the air companies, expenditure on the programme amounted to £152.4 million which was £20 million, or 15 per cent, more than expenditure in 1968-69.  Residual borrowing by the Exchequer was £60.9 million, of which £10.9 was raised by means of a Deutschemark bond issue and the balance of £50 million was provided by the Irish banks.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The external situation</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before turning to the current domestic situation, which holds the centre <Col N="1720" /> of the stage on which the Budget is presented, it is well to mention certain aspects of the external scene which bear on the likely trend of our development in the year ahead.  As our main hope of economic growth lies in expanding our exports, especially to the British market, developments there are of special significance.</P>
    <P>The British import deposit scheme, though reduced in scope, is being continued for a further year.  As Deputies will be aware, however, the Government have also extended the special credit facilities for these deposits.</P>
    <P>We have recently secured an increase of 4,000 tons in our quota for butter supplies to the UK market in 1970-71, making the quota, at 30,000 tons, our highest ever.  Our quota for cheddar cheese exports for 1970 remains the same as for the last two years.</P>
    <P>Live cattle and dead meat continue, under the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, to do well.</P>
    <P>All in all therefore it is hoped that our exports to the UK, the annual value of which increased by 58 per cent between 1965 and 1969, will continue to expand at a satisfactory rate this year.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the tariff cuts due on 1st July next mark the halfway stage in the elimination of tariff protection against imports from the UK and underline the urgency of using the time remaining to us to improve our competitive position.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Diversification of markets</i>
    </P>
    <P>A programme of special measures was introduced early in 1969 to encourage exports to markets other than the UK and efforts to conclude new trade agreements with countries with which we have not formerly done much business are being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>
      <i>EEC prospects and developments</i>
    </P>
    <P>In view of the progress made in the European Communities since the summit meeting at the Hague in December last, we can now look forward to the opening of negotiations within a few months.  If they proceed satisfactorily, our accession could take effect in 1973.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, which has just <Col N="1721" /> been published, sets out the implications of membership of the Communities. I hope it will help all those involved in the economy and indeed the public at large, to form a clearer view of what membership entails.  The extent of the benefits we will gain from membership will to a great degree depend on the adequacy of our preparations. Much has been done already. Agriculture is more efficient and is in a better position to benefit from participation in the common agricultural policy than it was ten years ago.  The industrial sector is more solidly based, more diversified and a good deal more competitive.  But the overall state of preparedness of industry and agriculture is uneven and capable of considerable improvement.  We must use the remaining time to push ahead with the work of preparation before our accession to the Communities takes place.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of</i> 1969</P>
    <P>On the home front, 1969 was a year which saw both welcome and unwelcome developments.  Having regard to the information and comment already published I do not propose to do more than mention the highlights today.</P>
    <P>The numbers employed in the nonagricultural sector are estimated to have shown a record increase of 16,000 between April, 1968, and April, 1969. This more than outweighed the estimated decline of 12,000 in numbers engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Exports rose by 11½ per cent in the year.  For the first time, industrial goods formed a higher proportion of total exports than agricultural goods.</P>
    <P>Imports rose by 19 per cent.  The rise in exports and in net invisible receipts was not sufficient to match the rise in imports and there was an estimated balance of payments deficit of £60 million, a disimprovement of £38 million compared with 1968.</P>
    <P>A significant proportion of the increased imports were capital goods which will help to broaden and strengthen our economic base.  Given the level of external reserves and the extent to which capital goods will build up our productive and export capacities, the large rise in imports of these goods is not in itself perturbing.  What <Col N="1722" /> is disquieting, however, is that the rise has been accompanied by a large increase in imports of consumption goods.</P>
    <P>Obviously we cannot continue to maintain a high rate of increase of both capital and consumer imports.  If we are to maintain a large volume of capital imports for development, we must accept a slower rate of growth in domestic consumption and therefore in imports of consumer goods.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Balance of payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>The widening trade gap of the past two years has been reflected in the growing deficit on the current balance of payments.</P>
    <P>A surplus of £15 million in 1967 gave way to a deficit of £22 million in 1968: last year, the deficit was about £60 million.  This year, despite a small improvement in the first quarter, the deficit could be substantially higher. This trend has grave implications for the economy.  Unless we abate the excessive increases in domestic consumption and costs, the gains of the past decade and our potential for further progress in the seventies could be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Despite our balance of payments deficits, our external reserves have not fallen because the development policies which we have been pursuing have resulted in capital continuing to flow in here from abroad.  We must not, however, allow this capital inflow to blind us to the very real necessity to reverse the present trend towards excessive deficits.</P>
    <P>Our aim must be to get back, as quickly as possible, to the moderate external deficits envisaged in the third programme, or, indeed, to improve somewhat on that target in view of last year's large deficit.  This year, we must make a start towards this objective by ensuring that the deficit does not exceed £50 million.  To attempt deliberately to achieve a much smaller deficit this year might involve excessive disruption in the economy.  To allow a deficit markedly in excess of £50 million could expose us to the dangers I have already mentioned.  The Government will continue to keep the situation under review and will not hesitate <Col N="1723" /> to take such further corrective measures as may be necessary to ensure that the deficit is kept within manageable limits.</P>
    <P>Besides the deterioration in the balance of payments, there were two other worrying developments in the economy in 1969.  They were the sharp rises in incomes and in prices.  Non-agricultural wages and salaries rose by more than 13 per cent, while consumer prices increased by 7½ per cent.  These, in conjunction with the increase in the external deficit, were the outstanding features of the inflation which we experienced during the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inflation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Prices here are now moving upwards faster than in most other countries in the OECD and the dangers for the future wellbeing of the country if the trend continues are obvious.</P>
    <P>In the last two years the consumer price index in Ireland rose on average by 6 per cent, a rate exceeded by only three other OECD countries&mdash; Iceland, Yugoslavia and Portugal.  The United States and the United Kingdom both registered increases of about 5 per cent.  We cannot sustain such a rate of price increase and have satisfactory economic growth as well.  If prices continue to rise and our unit wage costs to increase as they have been doing, our goods will cease to be competitive on either the home or the export markets.  Employment will suffer and, before long, our living standards will fall well below the level to which we have become accustomed in the last decade and which we now take for granted.</P>
    <P>Inflation, of course, brings many other ills in its train.  It discourages saving and the continuing investment required to sustain our economic advance.  It increases the cost of public and private borrowing.  People on fixed incomes, pensioners and the poorer and needier sections are the most severely hit.  If we are to realise our national objectives of an increasing prosperity equitably shared among all, of equal educational opportunity for our children, of better housing, health and social welfare services, we cannot <Col N="1724" /> allow the considerable advances already made to be halted by failure to bring the situation under control.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increases in money incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The sharp increases in prices in recent years reflect the rising trend in demands for greater money incomes. Scarcely a year passes without claims for increases well above what the rise in national production would justify. Under threats of disruption of their business, the tendency of employers has been to buy industrial peace at too high a price in labour costs.  The inevitable and unvarying result has been increased price levels which negatived part, at least, of the nominal gains.  It is significant that the difference between the average annual rate of increase (8½ per cent) in money incomes in the decade to 1969 and the annual rate of increase of national productivity (4 per cent) is roughly equivalent to the increase in the consumer price index in the period.</P>
    <P>Despite the evidence of the futility of excessive increases in money incomes, the trend is towards higher claims in each successive round.  The enduring damage caused to the economy and the extent to which our potential for greater prosperity is irretrievably lost on each occasion, have attracted widespread comment. Less attention has been given to the real hardship caused to many of our people as a result of the selfish pursuit of larger incomes by their more fortunate brethren.  Rising levels of social welfare benefits and the expansion of the social services have provided compensation for some, but there are many ineligible for those benefits who have been unable to prevent their living standards from being disimproved.</P>
    <P>The Government are increasingly concerned about the position of the lower-paid and weaker sections.  It is clear that no real progress can be made in improving their situation relatively if strong organised groups, by a brutal exercise of their bargaining power, not merely leave little or nothing to spare for anyone else but, by the very size of their inflationary gains, reduce the purchasing power of incomes which are already too small.  The proposals <Col N="1725" /> which I shall shortly announce are evidence of the Government's determination to ensure that the weakest do not go to the wall in this process.</P>
    <P>Total incomes have been rising more than twice as fast as national output, and employee income&mdash;which represents 60 per cent of the total&mdash;about three times as fast.  The Government have availed of every opportunity to bring home to those directly concerned, both employers and unions, the need to act with restraint and moderation if the free collective bargaining system is to survive.  At the beginning of 1969, guidelines on income developments for the year ahead were issued by the Government.  Later, when the terms of the maintenance settlement were announced, every effort was made to bring home the consequences of a general extension of the settlement.</P>
    <P>In the Budget in May, I provided for substantial improvements in children's allowances and other social welfare benefits in the belief that, if the position of the lower-paid workers were improved, existing pay agreements would be allowed to run their course and a policy of moderation adopted when new agreements came to be negotiated.  In a further move to improve the income position of the lower-paid, I removed a substantial number of them entirely from the income tax net by increases in personal allowances.  Around the same time, a public service pay agreement weighted in favour of the lower-paid workers was negotiated.  We hoped that this would set a headline for new agreements in other employments.</P>
    <P>In the event, however, while existing wage agreements were allowed to run their course, the inflationary scale of the maintenance pay settlement spread to other categories of workers according as new agreements were negotiated from the autumn onwards.  In December the Taoiseach announced that, in the Government's view, increases in overall incomes in 1970 should be kept within a limit of 7 per cent.  He suggested that, in this year in new agreements, the increase should be limited to about 30/- a week per adult male worker. <Col N="1726" /> Having regard to the expected growth in national productivity, this could not be considered particularly restrictive. The Government backed up this norm for overall pay increases by a policy in the prices field, in an effort to introduce realism into wage negotiations. It was announced that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when considering applications for price increases, would disallow increases in labour costs attributable to pay increases in excess of 7 per cent or 30/- a week.  In this way, the Government are trying to protect the consumer from having to bear the full cost of excessive pay increases.</P>
    <P>It is beyond doubt that the principal need at present is for a more orderly and rational development of incomes if we are to bring the present inflationary situation under control and to avoid the widespread disruption which the increasing readiness to resort to strike action is causing.  Now, more than ever, with EEC membership as well as free trade with Great Britain in prospect, we need to maintain our competitiveness both at home and abroad and to fight rising costs by every means at our disposal.</P>
    <P>The suggestions put forward in the recent NIEC Report on Incomes and Prices Policy are broadly in harmony with views outlined in the third programme. They have already been welcomed by the Government as providing an institutional framework within which a more sensible development of incomes can be considered.  Last week the Taoiseach and Government Ministers met the Irish Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss the report.  The meeting was helpful and constructive, and I look forward to continued co-operation from both sides of industry in putting into effect the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>While, however, institutional changes should help, they will not, in themselves, solve the problem.  What is also required is a fundamental change of attitude, based on a full realisation that what is at stake is an increased standard of living equitably shared amongst all our people.  If the arrangements recommended by NIEC are <Col N="1727" /> approached in this spirit, it should be possible to come to an agreement which would give the economy time to absorb the current wage settlements and avoid the recurrence of similar increases in the future.  A development on these lines is essential if present inflationary pressures are to be eased.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service pay policy</i> 1970</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments in 1969 was the pay agreement reached in May with the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning pay increases for State employees.  This agreement made a valuable contribution, in the difficult circumstances then prevailing to an orderly advance in incomes over a wide range of public employments. The term covered by the agreement ended on 31st March last.  While I do not underrate the many problems involved, I am hopeful that, with the goodwill and co-operation of the trade unions and associations concerned, it will be possible to make a new agreement on rather similar lines to cover the period from 1st April, 1970, onwards.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Monetary Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the fight against inflation one of the principal weapons is monetary policy.  In the past twelve months it has been employed to reduce pressures in the economy while maintaining investment in infrastructure and in the capital equipment necessary for further growth.</P>
    <P>Credit restraint will continue to be necessary this year.  The Central Bank has accordingly advised the Associated Banks to restrict the increase in lending to approximately the same amount as last year.  This would enable bank lending to grow by about 12 per cent which is the maximum increase in lending compatible with the policy objective I mentioned earlier of a balance of payments deficit in 1970 of the order of £50 million.  Finance for consumption goods and less essential services will be restricted to ensure that sufficient credit will be available for financing the requirements of productive investment projects and of exports. A scheme of favourable interest <Col N="1728" /> rates on credit for the export of capital goods is being prepared and details will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>Before credit restraints can be removed, we must achieve a substantial and sustained increase in the level of corporate and personal savings.  Increased saving is a powerful weapon in the battle against inflation&mdash;and one available to most of us.  By foregoing current consumption, savers can help to attack the problem at the core.  In this way they play a significant part in the development of the economy and in the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New savings scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>While savings have been increasing in recent years, they are not yet sufficient to finance the level of investment we need.  The size of recent wage increases should enable a much larger section of the community to save and I look forward to an increase in the proportion of income saved in the years ahead.  So as to give every encouragement to savers, I propose to introduce a new type of saving scheme under which those who save by regular monthly instalments over a period of a year, and retain their savings on deposit for a further two years, will be paid a bonus calculated at the rate of 9 per cent per annum compound interest.  This bonus will be free of tax.  The attractive terms of the scheme have been specially designed to encourage people to leave their savings intact for a number of years.  The administrative arrangements are in train and the necessary legislative provisions will be included in the Finance Bill. The scheme will come into operation in the autumn.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prize Bonds</i>
    </P>
    <P>Prize bonds continue to attract investment but it has been represented to me that the scheme would be more effective if the bonds were available for purchase at all times.  I am happy to adopt this constructive suggestion and hope to introduce the revised arrangements shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The primary economic strategy of <Col N="1729" /> this year's Budget must be to keep the economy, which is already buffeted by the winds of inflation, squarely on course during 1970.  This means that our objective must be to reduce the growing inflationary forces.  I have already indicated how, in the area of monetary policy, our efforts are directed to this end.  Also, I have pointed out that most of us can ourselves contribute to the achievement of this overall objective by saving more.</P>
    <P>Public expenditure is a field where reductions are often vociferously demanded&mdash;generally, I might add, by people who, almost in the same breath, are urging increased State support for various purposes.  The Government have been conscious of the need to moderate its growth in 1970 in order to make the fullest possible contribution to reducing inflationary pressures. To this end, the entire range of the expenditure proposals, both capital and current, for 1970, has been subjected to an exhaustive and critical review since the autumn.  As a result, the Estimates presented by Departments have been substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that further significant reductions are not possible without policy changes of a major order and without drastically reducing or abolishing some of the services, benefits and supports provided by the State.  Many of the significant advances of the 1960's would have to be sacrificed and there would be a serious upset of the existing economic and social patterns.  The Government do not believe that measures of this type are necessary.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure is particularly difficult to moderate in the short term. About one-fifth of the total is accounted for by the servicing of the public debt, which is mainly determined by the capital expenditure of earlier years.  Approximately one-fourth represents the remuneration of the public service, that is, of the teachers, the Civil Service, the Army and the Garda Síochána mainly.  About 45 per cent consists of other expenditure by way of grants and other payments in relation to social welfare, <Col N="1730" /> education and agriculture.  A large part of the remainder represents moneys provided for State bodies engaged in work of a developmental nature. Given the present social and economic policy of the Government, the difficulty of making any substantial further reduction under these heads will be appreciated.  Apart from the problem of maintaining the volume of existing activities in the face of steadily rising costs, pressure is constantly mounting for greater expenditure by way of an extension of the scope of the existing services and the introduction of new ones.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Budget 1970-71</i>
    </P>
    <P>The public capital programme dominates national capital formation.  It is therefore necessary to provide it with sufficient funds to maintain and, if possible, to increase national investment.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the excessive demand pressures now building up, some check must be placed on the expansion of the public capital programme. The programme for 1970-71 has, therefore, been set at a level which represents an increase of 12 per cent, excluding the air companies, on expenditure in 1969-70, as compared with an increase of 15 per cent last year.  If wages and other prices do not rise immoderately, the programme should ensure continued economic growth combined with reasonable provision for social investment.</P>
    <P>When provision is made for other expenditures of a capital nature such as debt redemption and re-financing, the total of public capital expenditure comes to £223.6 million.  After account is taken of the amounts likely to become available from normal domestic sources, a balance of £75 million remains to be found from banks and other sources, including borrowing abroad.  Towards this amount, £6 million has already been raised by way of a dollar loan on the international bond market.  Part of the balance may be obtained from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development if discussions at present in progress are successfully concluded during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" />
      <i>Current Budget</i> 1970-71</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central Fund services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The estimates of receipts and expenditure published yesterday show that total current expenditure is estimated to cost almost £453 million in 1970-71 as compared with £411½ million in 1969-70; the percentage change is marginally greater than the corresponding figure for last year.  The central fund services have risen from £77 million last year to £88? million for the year ahead.  This increase arises almost entirely from the heavy Exchequer borrowing required to finance the public capital programme and the relatively high interest charges prevailing, which are an indication of the world-wide scarcity of capital at a time of exceptionally high demand.</P>
    <P>As long as we are determined to provide more housing, more schools and hospitals, more factories to provide more jobs, and more development generally, we must be prepared to face up to a growing national debt and to meet the cost involved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Supply services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The non-capital supply services, which comprise the bulk of current expenditure, are estimated to cost £351.7 million in 1970-71.  This is £24 million greater than the amount provided for them last year.  This increase, which of course does not include any changes made in the Budget, is accounted for in the main by increases in education (£6 million), health (£5 million), social welfare (£4¾ million), post office (£2¾ million) and agricultural grants (£1¾ million).</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue</i>
    </P>
    <P>The estimation of the likely revenue inflow at existing rates up to 31st March, 1971, is fraught with particular uncertainty in view of the exceptional buoyancy experienced last year and the difficulty of predicting the effects of inflation in 1970.  However, I have taken the view that last year's buoyancy is likely to continue throughout 1970-71.  On that view, the estimate of revenue is some £9¼ million above the estimate of expenditure as presented. <Col N="1732" /> Welcome though this is as an easement of the Exchequer financing problem, it is a symptom of the underlying inflation caused mainly by excessive income increases.</P>
    <P>The published figures would appear to disclose an opening surplus of £9¼ million for budgetary reliefs.  Unfortunately this is not so.  The estimates of expenditure provide for the payments which we know will arise this year and which, when the Book of Estimates was being prepared, could be quantified with some precision.  As indicated in the White Paper they exclude other contingent liabilities which could not be accurately measured at that stage but which will undoubtedly have to be met during the year.  The principal item is the increase in public service pay which is due to be negotiated following the expiration on 31st March, 1970, of the 11th round pay agreement with the various staff associations and representative bodies. Furthermore, there are some associated items which, though considerably smaller, are still of significance and must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Taking a realistic view of these commitments, in the light of an over-all cost of remunerating the public service now in the region of £120 million, I am providing £10 million to cover them.  This does not include the cost of any pay adjustments in the post office.  As this service is intended to pay its way, these will have to be met by raising post office charges rather than by increasing taxation.  My apparent opening surplus is thus transformed into a deficit of £¾ million.</P>
    <P>In view of the extent to which I have taken revenue buoyancy and expenditure commitments fully into account, I could not make the usual deduction for errors of estimation.  Departments are being informed that they must keep within their allocations and that any unforseen expenditure claims must be met from savings elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>I come now to the over-all strategy of the Budget.  Need I say that it involved difficult decisions on priorities, the balance of advantage and the attempted reconciliation of conflicting requirements?  I have been the recipient of a great deal of advice from a <Col N="1733" /> wide variety of sources and, while there has been general agreement on the diagnosis of our illness, there has been nothing like unanimity on the treatment to be applied.</P>
    <P>The symptoms are easily recognisable. We have dangerous inflationary pressures which are threatening our future prospects for growth and development and at the same time are causing serious social injustice.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that one of the major functions of this Budget must be to correct this social injustice to the greatest extent that fiscal action can achieve.  This immediately poses the problem of raising considerable sums from taxation, either direct or indirect.  I have come down firmly against direct taxation.</P>
    <P>The incidence of direct taxation on individual taxpayers is already relatively high and there are sound general reasons for a reduction rather than an increase.</P>
    <P>Income tax is paid by a comparatively small section of the community. Furthermore, it has changed significantly in character in recent years and can now represent a considerable burden on a wide variety of small incomes.  Its weight falls on many individuals with incomes which are below the level in real purchasing power at which an income tax should normally apply.  Nor does the argument which has been advanced for an increase in direct taxation on this occasion for its disinflationary effects really stand up to close examination.</P>
    <P>Because of our system of PAYE, for most taxpayers the impact of an increase in income tax is immediately felt in the paypacket and consequently is little different in its effect on pay claims from a corresponding amount of indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>In the Budget speech last year I pointed out that direct taxes tend to discourage effort and to have widespread disincentive effect but that significant changes in our direct taxation structure could only be undertaken in the context of a comprehensive recasting of the general pattern of taxation. I am taking a considerable step in this direction this year.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that, whatever <Col N="1734" /> our difficulties, some relief must be given this year to income tax payers and especially to those with small incomes upon whom it bears very heavily.  The reliefs which I shall now mention have been framed as carefully as possible towards this end.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Minimum earned income relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to introduce a new feature in the earned income relief which will give a minimum allowance of £125 for single and widowed persons and £225 for married couples.  The new provision will raise the exemption limits for earnings from £332 to £374 for single persons and from £365 to £399 for widows and widowers.  The exemption limit for married persons will be raised from £565 to £649.  The new relief will benefit all single and widowed taxpayers with earnings less than £500 per annum and married taxpayers with less than £900 per annum.  About 50,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reduced rate of tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose also to make another important change in the income tax system which, while it will be of advantage to all taxpayers, will provide a proportionately greater relief to those in the lower ranges of taxable income. My proposal is that the first £100 of taxable income will be charged at two-thirds of the standard rate, namely at 4s 8d in the £ instead of at 7s in the £. The principal objective of the relief is to introduce an enhanced measure of graduation into the system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Age relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>For persons over 65 years, age relief is allowed on unearned income at the same rate as for earned income, but it applies only to the first £600 of such income.  This allowance will be brought into line with the new form of minimum earned income relief.  In the case of a single or widowed person over 65 years of age, there will be a minimum allowance of £125; a married couple will receive a minimum allowance of £225.  The limit of qualifying income for age relief will remain at £600 for <Col N="1735" /> single and widowed persons but will be raised to £900 for married persons.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>For persons with total incomes, whether earned or not, of less than £450, earned income relief or its equivalent is granted, irrespective of the age of the taxpayer.  I propose to raise this limit to £500 and to provide that the relief will be a flat £125 where the total income is below that limit.  Marginal relief will apply for income slightly above £500.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wife's earned income allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>Representations have frequently been made to me by various organisations that the tax code bears harshly on married women who take up employment and, because of its deterrent effect, causes a shortage of labour, very often highly trained, in certain sectors.  I propose to increase the present allowance for wife's earned income from £45 to £74.  The combined married allowance and wife's earned income relief will then be twice the single allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PAYE</i>
    </P>
    <P>For the purposes of PAYE, the benefit of these various changes will be given by making appropriate adjustments in the employees' tax-free allowances. A special explanatory leaflet will be issued as soon as possible.  The new system will come into operation as soon as the revised certificates of tax-free allowances reach the employers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cost to Exchequer</i>
    </P>
    <P>The cost of these proposals in the current year will be £7.4 million.  The cost in a full year will be £8.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>The vital contribution of agriculture to the development of the national economy is fully recognised by the Government.  It is expressed in concrete fashion in the increasing amount of State expenditure in relation to agriculture which last year reached the record level of £90.5 million.  Despite significant increases in agricultural <Col N="1736" /> output and State support, agricultural incomes continue to lag behind other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's policy to do whatever is possible to promote a more equitable relationship between farm and other incomes.  By far the best way to close the gap is by better husbandry, by improving and rationalising marketing, to increase the output and income of the individual farmer.  Unfortunately, as many other countries besides ourselves have learned, this is not always easy to achieve and direct assistance from the Exchequer must be provided on a continuing basis.  My problem of course is to find the resources to do all we would wish.  The Government have given careful consideration to this issue and have taken into account the representations made by the various farmer organisations in their recent discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>It has already been announced that, as from 1st May, liquid milk producers will be getting an additional 2d per gallon which, with the increase of 1d last February, gives a total increase of 3d per gallon.  This represents an additional £¾ million a year for liquid milk producers.</P>
    <P>It has also been announced that the prices on which the export support payments for beef and lamb are calculated were being increased by 1½d per lb and 3d per lb respectively as from 6th April.  The additional value of this to the livestock and meat industry is estimated at £1¼ million a year of which the Irish Exchequer will bear about £¾ million.</P>
    <P>As the decision to increase the support prices for beef and lamb was made after the volume of Estimates was prepared, I must provide in this Budget for the extra cost of £¾ million to the Exchequer.  The Government have in addition decided to provide a further £4¼ million in the present financial year making a total budgetary provision of an extra £5 million and bringing total Exchequer support for agriculture this year to £96 million.  The additional £4¼ million will be applied mainly for the benefit of producers of beef cattle, creamery milk, sheep and <Col N="1737" /> pigs and for certain other items, including farm buildings and horticulture.</P>
    <P>The need for developing beef production is clearly indicated by export possibilities and prospective membership of the European Economic Community. It has been decided to provide £1.5 million for the beef cattle incentive scheme in addition to the £2.4 million already included for 1970-71 in the volume of Estimates.  This extra provision will enable the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to increase the present grant of £12 for all qualifying cows to a new scale of £21 for the first qualifying cow, £19 for the second and £16 for each cow thereafter.</P>
    <P>Many farmers, particularly smaller farmers, are still largely dependent on creamery milk.  These are faced with increasing wage and feed costs.  To improve their position, the Government have decided to provide an additional 1d per gallon on up to 7,000 gallons a year for each supplier.  This increase will apply as from 1st April, 1970.  The cost to the Exchequer this year is £1 million.</P>
    <P>The Government are especially anxious to encourage and assist sheep farming, both because the long-term market prospects for lamb seem reasonably good and because in the main our sheep farmers are less favourably situated than other farmers. We have decided to provide an additional £1 million for sheep farmers in the form of an increase in the hogget ewe grant from £1 to 30s, to extend this grant to all areas, and to increase the mountain lamb subsidy from £1 to 30s.</P>
    <P>To help offset rising labour and feed costs, the guaranteed minimum prices of top-grade pigs up to 150 1b weight will be increased by 10s per cwt dead-weight with effect from 4th May, 1970. I am providing £240,000 for increases in the cost of bacon and pork export price support during the year.</P>
    <P>The farm buildings scheme will be rationalised and improved at a cost of £260,000.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of grants for mushroom <Col N="1738" /> units will be introduced at a cost of £150,000 and a sum of £10,000 provided to assist the marketing of horticultural produce.</P>
    <P>Other additional aids and incentives include an improvement in the milk cooler grant scheme&mdash;£10,000&mdash;the promotion of group farming (£25,000), a classification system to ensure better presentation and marketing of Irish beef abroad (£50,000), the establishment of a shorthorn herd-book and intensified promotion of dairy products on the home market (£50,000).</P>
    <P>I believe that these measures represent a well-balanced and effective package of aids and incentives and that farmers generally will recognise that, in the serious and difficult situation in which we find ourselves, we have made a special effort to meet their claims.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Concern</i>
    </P>
    <P>I come now to the social aims of the Budget.  In pursuance of the policy enunciated in the programmes for economic expansion, the Government have consistently raised the level of the social welfare payments well above what would be necessary merely to offset increases in living costs and so have brought about a positive and real improvement in the position of the recipients.  At a time when organised bodies and groups representing a wide variety of interests can bring pressure to bear in various ways for excessive income increases, there is a particularly strong moral obligation on all of us to ensure that those who cannot speak effectively for themselves are not left behind.</P>
    <P>A genuine and widespread feeling of social concern is the hallmark of a humane and civilised society.  It obliges us to see that the poor, the sick, the unemployed and the aged get as big an income increase as can be afforded. It also manifests itself in greater consideration for their physical and mental environment and in practical efforts to lighten their lot and make their lives brighter and better.  While extreme poverty is, fortunately, no longer a general problem in this country, the human spirit can be wounded by the apparent indifference of the well-off <Col N="1739" /> to the deprivation of others.  Many voluntary organisations are devoting their efforts to meet these needs and often find that sympathy and compassion are more appreciated than material help.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>For some year's past, it has been the practice to give flat-rate increases in insurance and assistance rates, eroding somewhat the differentials which recognised the contributions paid by insured persons towards the cost of their benefits.</P>
    <P>This year, it is proposed to give graded increases, involving higher amounts for the insurance classes.  In this year's circumstances, these increases are considerably greater than heretofore.</P>
    <P>For example, the basic rate of contributory old age pension will be increased by 17s 6d a week to £5 a week, and the non-contributory old age pension by 10s a week to £4 5s a week.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of disability and unemployment benefit will be increased by 15s a week to £4 10s a week, and the personal rate of unemployment assistance by 10s 6d a week to £3 12s and £3 6s a week in urban and rural areas, respectively.</P>
    <P>Widow's contributory pension will be increased by 15s and 12s 6d a week, as appropriate, to £4 10s a week, and the widow's non-contributory pension by 11s 6d a week to £4 5s a week.</P>
    <P>The increases in other rates follow a broadly similar pattern.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of assistance for deserted wives will be brought into operation on 1st October next.  Under the scheme they will qualify for a weekly allowance equivalent to the non-contributory widow's pension which as I have said will then be £4 5s per week.</P>
    <P>A new scheme was introduced the year before last and extended last year whereby an allowance is paid to a person who looks after certain incapacitated pensioners at home.  This is now being extended to cover necessitous persons over 70 years of age, whether they are pensioners or not.</P>
    <P>New insurance schemes for limited <Col N="1740" /> retirement pensions, at age 65, invalidity pensions and death grants will be brought into operation on 1st October next.</P>
    <P>Last year, children's allowances generally were substantially increased at a net cost of £5 million a year.  This year, I believe that it is necessary again to come to the assistance of families with children.  It is proposed, therefore, to give an increase of 2/6d a week in the allowance for every dependent child in both the contributory and assistance classes.  In addition, the age limit for these allowances is being raised to 18 years for all such children.</P>
    <P>Under the general scheme of children's allowances, the present allowance is forty shillings a month for each qualified child after the first two.  This allowance will be increased by five shillings in respect of each such child with effect from 1st October, 1970.  The present allowances of ten shillings for the first qualified child and thirty shillings for the second qualified child remain unchanged.  As with the increases granted last year, the increases now proposed will be recovered in part from persons paying income tax by reducing the allowance under the Income Tax Acts for each child who benefits from the increase.</P>
    <P>The disabled persons maintenance allowance and the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, administered by the Department of Health, will be increased in line with the improvements in the social assistance rates.</P>
    <P>The increases in the assistance rates and in the Department of Health allowances will take effect, as usual, from the beginning of August next. The increases in insurance benefits will be paid from the beginning of October, three months earlier than usual, and will coincide with the effective date for the increases under the children's allowances scheme.</P>
    <P>The various increases in rates and the extension of services will cost the Exchequer £8.8 million in a full year, and £5.4 million in this financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Care of the aged</i>
    </P>
    <P>The recent Report on the Care of the Aged examines the problems and difficulties <Col N="1741" /> confronting old people.  It suggests guidelines for the co-ordination and improvement of the services catering for their needs and how public and voluntary organisations might best direct their efforts in this field.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health accepts in principle the recommendation that a National Council for the Aged be established and in the meantime will appoint a social work advisor in his Department who will visit local areas and encourage the establishment or extension of voluntary agencies to take care of the aged.  He visualises a continuing extension of activity over the whole field of community service and is considering how best local community association development can be promoted, and the formation of some national organisation for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the recent report aim at improving the existing services and providing new ones designed to enable aged people to remain in the community and avoid the need for institutional care.  Many of the recommendations have already been implemented or are in the course of implementation.  Many others have been accepted in principle and will be put into practice as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A basic concern must be to provide an adequate income for elderly people. With this end in view, old age pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, have been increased substantially in the past decade.  This year again they are being increased further as I have already announced.  The increases are well above what would be needed to offset the rise in living costs and so they should give the old age pensioners a modest improvement in real terms in their standard of living.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant and encouraging developments in recent years has been the part played by voluntary bodies in undertaking specialised services such as home-nursing, meals-on-wheels, laundry services, community centres and so on.  I would like to pay a sincere tribute to them for their dedication to the cause of providing care and comfort for those in greatest need.  Organisations of this kind, because of their close acquaintance <Col N="1742" /> with local conditions and because they can be more flexible and compassionate in their approach, are able to ensure that public money provided for social and charitable purposes is spent to the very best advantage.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that I should endorse in a very special way the work done by these voluntary organisations and provide practical assistance for them to intensify and extend their valuable work.  The Health Estimate already includes £100,000 for grants by health authorities to these voluntary organisations.  I am adding an extra £150,000 this year to this sum making a total provision of £250,000 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free travel</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Budgets of 1967 and 1968 made free travel, free electricity and free radio and TV licences available for certain old age and blind pensioners. Last year, these schemes were extended in full to persons in receipt of Northern Ireland or British old age pensions.</P>
    <P>It has often been represented to me that, if the husbands or wives of veterans of the War of Independence or of old age and blind pensioners are under 70 years of age, they are not eligible for the free travel and that this can detract unduly from the value of the facility where this type of married couple is concerned.  I propose therefore to extend the concession to them.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Inflation bears especially hard on pensioners.  Last year I indicated that I had accepted the principle of parity for State pensioners but that because of the cost involved we could only move towards this position over a number of years.  I went a good deal of the way in 1969 by bringing pensions up to a level based on the rates of pay in force on 1st February, 1964. It has been decided to make a further advance this year.  The general effect for most pensioners who retired before 1st June, 1968 will be to relate their pensions to the rates of pay in force on that date.  This involves an average increase of about 14 per cent for the various groups of public service pensioners, including retired civil servants, <Col N="1743" /> gardaí, teachers, members of the Defence Forces and local authority pensioners and their widows where service terminated before the eleventh round.  Corresponding increases will be made in military service pensions and other Army pensions, including special allowances.  The increases will apply as from 1st August next.</P>
    <P>I have offered a new retirement scheme to temporary full-time State employees who have not hitherto been pensionable.  Lump sums will be paid on the same basis as applies to established staff.  The pensions will vary with the amount of social welfare benefits payable in each case.  The scheme represents a major improvement in the terms of employment of upwards of 10,000 unestablished State employees. These pension improvements will cost £1.16 million in the current year and almost £2 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Itinerants</i>
    </P>
    <P>One of the welcome signs of an awakening sense of social concern and community responsibility has been the growing interest in our itinerant population and the widespread anxiety to reduce, if not eliminate, the particular hardships which are a feature of their mode of life.</P>
    <P>Under the suspices of the Department of Local Government, a great deal of dedicated voluntary work has been put into helping them to settle in permanent locations and to become integrated into the community.  I am satisfied that if this work is to progress as rapidly as we would wish, additional financial assistance is required to encourage local authorities and voluntary committees to intensify their efforts.  This assistance will include subsidy for local authorities of up to 100 per cent of the cost of providing a fully serviced camping site, with separate accommodation for each family, on lines approved by the Minister for Local Government.  In appropriate cases, accommodation provided for itinerants by the repair or reconstruction of existing houses will qualify for the subsidy.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to increase from <Col N="1744" /> 50 per cent to 90 per cent the existing subsidy payable to local authorities in respect of social workers employed wholly or partly on the work of rehabilitating itinerants.   Assistance will also be given towards the cost of accommodation provided for itinerant families by voluntary committees.</P>
    <P>The education of itinerant children presents special problems and financial assistance in certain cases will be made available to voluntary committees engaged in this work.  The extra cost to the Exchequer will not be great in the beginning, but it will, of course, rise in proportion as the improved facilities are, hopefully, increasingly availed of.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aid to developing countries</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is salutary to remember that general standards of living in Ireland are, even at the lowest levels, much better than those in many countries less fortunate than ours.  One of the aims of the third programme is to increase aid to poorer countries&mdash;the developing countries as they are usually called. We have been helping these countries to the extent of more than £1 million a year, excluding private contributions. For 1969-70 the figure was £1.4 million, the increase mainly taking the form of extra purchases of World Bank bonds by the Central Bank.  The subject of our future contributions to the developing countries is currently under review and it has been accepted in principle that we will increase our subscription to the International Development Association.  We will also continue to increase our contributions in other ways according as our resources permit.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conservation</i>
    </P>
    <P>This is European Conservation Year and we in Ireland are reviewing the growing problems presented by urbanisation and by rapid technological change and development.  Conservation is about people and their natural surroundings and there is need of widespread enlightened regard for the preservation of our basic resources.</P>
    <P>The greater leisure opportunities that we now enjoy create an increased dependence upon the natural environment for recreation and relaxation and, <Col N="1745" /> as a consequence, call for increased understanding, greater care and better management of that environment.  We possess a rich natural heritage of great scenic and recreational value.  Our rivers, lakes and coastal waters have as yet suffered little and in the main we enjoy freedom from the worst problems of atmospheric pollution.</P>
    <P>Society at all levels must play its part and the Government must give direction and leadership to this collective effort.  We have a large number of institutions which have contributed much to different aspects of nature conservation.  The campaign sponsored by the Irish National Committee for Conservation Year has already done much to increase public awareness of the need to ensure that our environment retains its quality and that all our natural resources are wisely used.</P>
    <P>To give practical assistance to this valuable national endeavour, I am making a special allocation of £100,000 to be administered by the Minister for Lands as the Minister primarily responsible for conservation.  In the main this extra sum will be devoted to meeting the immediate organisational costs of the development of a comprehensive national programme for conservation.  As improved facilities for environmental studies are also needed, part of it will be spent on building a new field study centre at Gartan Lough in County Donegal.  This new centre will be available for environmental field studies by parties of teachers, university and secondary school students, and professional groups concerned with aspects of the environment; it will also provide a base for research activity.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Western development</i>
    </P>
    <P>The development of our western counties occupies a central and fundamental position in all our economic planning.  A fair amount of success is now being achieved in development generally and particularly in industry, which is expanding throughout the entire region.  The Industrial Development Authority which has primary responsibility for industrial promotion has been reorganised and strengthened <Col N="1746" /> and is establishing new regional offices to spearhead an intensive drive in each region in close co-operation with the county development teams, local authorities and local groups.</P>
    <P>It is believed by many of those actively engaged in the work of western development that, in addition to the general campaign for industrial development, a special effort at local level is needed and can be generated in the smaller towns.  The county development teams, working with local groups, will initiate a promotional campaign to attract projects suitable for location in these towns.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that very often success or failure in the establishment of a small local industry depends on the immediate availability of a premises in which either staff training or the operation itself can commence immediately.  Suitable premises are not generally available.  It has been decided to provide in each western county a limited number of prefabricated buildings for use in such cases.  When permanent premises have been secured, the prefabricated building can be moved to service the next project to come along.</P>
    <P>The cost of the promotional campaign and of the temporary buildings will be borne by the Special Regional Development Fund, which has already been widely used in providing facilities for development opportunities.  A sum of £300,000 for the fund is already included in this year's Estimate for my Department and I am providing an additional £100,000 in the Budget for the fund for these purposes.</P>
    <P>As a further incentive to industrial development in the west, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is relaxing the conditions on which the small industries programme operates in that area.  He will shortly announce an extension of the upper limits of employment and capital investment for western industries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Gaeltacht</i>
    </P>
    <P>The economic and social development of the Gaeltacht continues to be a main aim of Government policy.  This is reflected in the increased provision in the Estimates which will enable the <Col N="1747" /> Minister for the Gaeltacht to expand various improvements schemes, such as development of co-operatives, holiday accommodation, <i>et cetera.</i> In addition, substantial additional capital is being made available to Gaeltarra Éireann for grants for various industrial and other projects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>When the cost of income tax reliefs, additional aid to agriculture, social welfare increases and other benefits are added to the opening deficit, I find myself requiring £20 million by way of extra taxation.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the manner in which the total amount of money required for these purposes could best be raised.  I have already indicated why I do not propose to have recourse to direct taxation. If the sum were to be raised solely from the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;&mdash;beer, spirits, tobacco and petrol&mdash;such high rates would be needed that diminishing returns would almost certainly result.</P>
    <P>The rates of the selective wholesale tax have been increased twice in the past sixteen months.  The additional sum I need could not be raised from this source without pushing up rates to undesirably high levels with, perhaps, the risk of dangerous side-effects on particular industries, and disturbing seriously the existing patterns of trade.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Turnover tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The turnover tax, with its low rate of 2½ per cent, which has remained unchanged since it was introduced in 1963, and its broad tax base which covers virtually all goods and services, offered the best prospect of producing the amount required without significantly affecting the price of any particular commodity or service, or prejudicing the operation of any particular sector of production and distribution. The Government have decided, therefore, to increase the rate of turnover tax from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent with effect from 1st May, 1970.  It is estimated that this will yield an additional £20 million this year.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the purposes to which this money will be devoted.  I <Col N="1748" /> do not think that there will be any substantial opposition to the various benefits on which the money will be spent.  There should not, therefore, be any great cause for complaint at the extra taxation required.  In many ways the turnover tax is the fairest method for raising so large a sum.  It is a tax on spending of almost every description. Those who spend most, pay most in tax.  Each individual whose expenditure covers more than essentials can decide to moderate the impact of the tax by reducing his spending; if the yield of the tax falls short of expectations because of increased savings, I shall not complain.  For a large number of wage and salary earners, the extra cost of essentials will be fully offset by the income tax reliefs I have already described.  The increases under the social welfare code will more than compensate for the increase in living costs since the last revision of that code and for the increase in those costs likely to occur in the current financial year.  I want to emphasise that the rise in prices attributable to the proposed increase in the turnover tax should be little, if anything, in excess of 2½ per cent, that is to say, about 6d in the £.</P>
    <P>Before deciding to raise the rate of this tax, I gave very serious consideration to the economic effects likely to flow from it.  Its impact on the economy is, in my view, not likely to be any greater than would the raising of the same amount by increasing the other indirect taxes, or the direct taxes, or any combination of them.  Income increases already secured and still being obtained in the course of recent rounds have so far exceeded what could be rationally justified that they can, without any hardship, absorb the effect of the increase in turnover tax.  I am seeking, in as comprehensive a way as possible, to cushion adequately the many sectors who have not participated in these increases.  The tax on essentials will still be almost the lowest charged in any of the countries of continental Europe.  Exports, of course, are not liable to the tax and will therefore be unaffected by it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Added-value tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The new structure will represent a system of sales taxation under which <Col N="1749" /> about two-thirds of the yield will come from a broadly based retail sales tax at a relatively low rate, and the remainder at higher rates from less essential goods.  This system bears some resemblance to the system of added-value tax which is prescribed for the European Economic Community and which we will have to adopt as a condition of membership.  A White Paper was issued in June, 1968, in which the nature and operation of an added-value tax was fully discussed.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that the added-value tax is the most efficient system of collecting a turnover tax extending to the retail stage.  It is also the form of sales taxation most suited to modern conditions.  I would stress that such a change will basically merely be one in the method of collection&mdash; under the added-value system the tax is payable in fractions over the various stages of production and distribution instead of in one sum at the wholesale or retail stage.  The system I have in mind will contain special provisions for small traders and for farmers and I am confident that it will not entail any serious problems for traders generally. It is the intention to have extensive consultation with all the trading and other bodies affected with a view to evolving a system which will be fully understood by all concerned and will be so designed as to facilitate them in every way possible within the framework of the tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Report of public services organisation review group</i>
    </P>
    <P>This completes the strictly budgetary part of my Financial Statement.  Before I come to my conclusion, there is one other important matter to which I wish to refer.</P>
    <P>The report of the public services organisation review group, which was published last September, contains a wide range of far-reaching recommendations for the reorganisation of the whole public service.  Broadly, the report covers three main subjects&mdash;the structure and organisation of the public service, the management of that service and the distribution of functions among Departments of State and between Departments and other bodies. <Col N="1750" /> The central feature of the report concerns the arrangements for the overall organisation and management of the public service through the functions of planning, finance, organisation and personnel. The Government have decided, in accordance with the group's recommendation, to establish in Departments specialised staff units for these functions, separate from the executive functions of Departments.  A first task of these units will be to examine systematically the executive operations so as to produce the most efficient allocation of responsibilities.  The guidelines for each Department contained in the report will provide an excellent starting point for this examination.</P>
    <P>The report makes a number of recommendations in regard to a central co-ordinating public service unit to operate under the Minister for Finance. The future shape of this unit has been engaging the Government's attention for some time.  The Government accept the group's conclusion that the organisation and personnel functions should be strengthened and that new institutional arrangements are desirable.  I hope to announce detailed proposals in the near future.</P>
    <P>The group also identified a number of problems for immediate attention. In accordance with their recommendations, early discussions will take place with staff associations with a view to improving the present system of promotion at higher levels.  Management advisory committees, consisting of the secretary and all officers at assistant secretary level, will be set up in Departments in order fully to involve the top staff in overall management; these committees are already in operation in some Departments.  The adaptation of recruitment procedures will be continued.  Consideration of other aspects of the report is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Modern Ireland needs a modern public service.  The Devlin Report provides a blueprint of how this might be achieved.  The Government are determined to carry out the changes needed to ensure that the public service is efficient, economical and adaptable.</P>
    <P>This is the first Budget of the nineteen seventies&mdash;a decade which offers hope of great technological advances <Col N="1751" /> and social improvements.  In the sixties we were determined to shake off the economic stagnation and depression which we had tolerated far too long. We succeeded beyond the expectations of most.</P>
    <P>The seventies hold problems of a different kind.  Steady economic growth, gradually increasing employment and soundly based prosperity are well within our capacity provided we are willing to wait until the harvest and not try to pluck the fruit before it is ripe.  In the past year or two we have shown signs of an impatient spirit, a wish to enjoy the product of our labour before we have earned it.  This desire for advance payment is mortgaging the national future and is self-defeating. We have had an ample evidence of how costs rise when we try to take more in incomes than the increase in the national product.  Nobody gains in the long run from this but many suffer immediately.  I trust it is not too much to hope that we may have learned that lesson from the last decade and may be guided by it now.</P>
    <P>We may for a while be able to achieve economic progress and increased employment in the face of rising prices and growing external deficits. This would, however, be a shortsighted policy.  If we are to avoid economic disruption and upset, we must contain and reduce the inflationary pressures in the economy.  This year we are aiming at a reduction&mdash;to £50 million or even less&mdash;in the external deficit.  I <Col N="1752" /> have already made it clear that, if there is any danger that this objective may not be achieved, the Government will introduce further measures of restraint.</P>
    <P>Our success in the field of economic growth has given us a greater awareness of the need to ensure that its fruits are justly distributed.  Ours should not be a society of which it can be said that the rich get richer and the poor poorer.  Our first concern must be to provide a decent minimum standard for all our people and to raise that standard progressively as our national prosperity advances.  We should be proud to proclaim that those in greatest need have the first claim on the fruits of our progress.</P>
    <P>We are a people who in the centuries of hardship and adversity were renowned for our concern for each other. I refuse to believe that this noble tradition will disappear at the first taste of material prosperity.</P>
    <P>This Budget seeks, by a judicious redistribution of incomes, to protect those worst hit by inflation from its severest impact.  If its purpose is recognised and its message of social concern accepted, then the one tax change it contains will be looked upon simply as a tempering, in the interests of justice, of increases already received and not as a stimulus to further demands.  I believe that it will, and that a balance of equity having now to some extent been restored, all sections will combine in restraint to give the nation and its economy the respite it urgently needs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>SUPPLEMENT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT</b>
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">ECONOMIC GROWTH</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" />
      <Col N="1754" /> 1969 was the final year of a decade of exceptional progress in Ireland's economic history, a decade which opened with the country heavily dependent on the agricultural sector and on agricultural exports, which saw the spread of economic planning techniques in the public and private sectors and which witnessed the transformation of the country into an expanding and increasingly industrialised economy.  In real terms, our GNP grew by almost 50 per cent over the ten years 1960/69 while the sectoral product of industry almost doubled.  In 1959, over 35 per cent of the labour force were engaged in agriculture and only 24 per cent engaged in industry.  Today, the numbers engaged in industry exceed those engaged in agriculture. This means that more of our labour-force are in better-paid, more productive jobs, average hours worked have fallen, and unemployment and emigration have been reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <b>The challenge of growing competition</b>
    </P>
    <P>All this has been achieved against a background of increasing competition on world markets.  Most of the principal importing countries, including the UK, have consistently followed highly protectionist agricultural policies. On the other hand, our industrial sector has faced the growing challenge of the international movement towards free trade, represented in particular for us by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the prospect of membership of the European Communities.  In these circumstances, the support extended to the agricultural community and the various tax-concessions and incentives offered to industry have undoubtedly been of key importance in ensuring a successful transition.  In the depressed years of the 1950s, the idea was current that our economy was so dependent on external trade that we could do little to plan our own development.  Today, even though a much higher proportion of our GNP is dependent on foreign trade, we can refute such a defeatist outlook and, backed by the experience of a decade of successful economic development, look forward to the continuing expansion of the economy with much greater confidence than seemed possible ten years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Industrial output and exports</b>
    </P>
    <P>The expansion of the industrial sector has been outstanding.  Since 1959, when the first Programme for Economic Expansion commenced, manufacturing output has increased in volume at an average annual rate of 7 per cent; over the decade as a whole it rose in value by an estimated £500 million&mdash;by 95 per cent in current terms and by nearly 70 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>Exports have provided the basis for this development.  Industrial exports have increased in value from £51 million in 1960 to some £218 million in 1969, including £38 million from the Shannon Industrial Estate; the increase in volume amounted to over 240 per cent.  Industrial products now account for about one-half of our visible export earnings compared with about one-third of a much smaller total in 1960.</P>
    <P>
      <b>State aid to Industry</b>
    </P>
    <P>Much of this unprecedented growth can be attributed to the system of generous State aids and incentives to private industry developed over the years.  First introduced in the 1950s, this system was improved and extended during the past ten years to ensure that industry would make the maximum <Col N="1755" /><Col N="1756" /> contribution to the growth of the economy.  New industry and adaptation grants amounting to £70 million were approved by An Foras Tionscal in the ten years ending 31 March, 1969, of which £34 million had been paid by that date.  The Industrial Credit Company provided industrial firms with capital amounting to over £42 million, of which about £32 million represented direct financial aid in the form of loans and investments.  The special tax reliefs applicable to new exports and capital investments have also provided a powerful stimulus to industrial expansion; some idea of their value to industry may be gained from the fact that they are estimated to have cost the Exchequer about £10 million in 1968/69 alone.</P>
    <P>A variety of other State measures have supplemented the financial and fiscal aids, all of which were designed to evoke a rapid development of industry over a broad front; these include the promotional activities of the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the scheme of technical assistance grants, industrial training schemes, State-sponsored industrial estates, the Small Industries Programme and other specialist and advisory services provided by a number of publicly-financed organisations operating in this field.</P>
    <P>Clearly, State assistance for the industrial promotion programme has been effective in generating the desired momentum of expansion.  Fixed capital investment in manufacturing industry has risen strongly and is estimated to have amounted to a gross figure of well over £300 million in the ten-year period ending in 1969; over 350 State-assisted enterprises, representing a total investment of £100 million (including working capital), were attracted from abroad.  Some 50,000 new industrial jobs have been created in that time, with the annual increment increasing in recent years.</P>
    <P>These figures reflect solid achievements in the national drive to expand the industrial sector.  The economy now has a broader and more sophisticated industrial base on which to build in the seventies.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Manpower Policy</b>
    </P>
    <P>Considerable progress is being made in implementing manpower policy. AnCO now have three training centres in operation at Shannon, Waterford and Galway, which can train about 1,000 people a year.  Priority in these centres is given to training unemployed or redundant workers, including those who have left agriculture, to semi-skilled level.  It is encouraging that those trained in the centres have been welcome in industry.</P>
    <P>Training at all levels in industry must be improved.  The main incentive will be the levy-grant system provided for in the Industrial Training Act which AnCO aim to have in full operation throughout manufacturing industry before the end of 1972.  To reap the full benefits of this system it is essential that industry be equipped in time with the specialist skills needed in industrial training.  An Industrial Instructor Training Centre has been opened in Dublin, and the Irish Management Institute, in consultation with AnCO, are running courses in the management of industrial training.</P>
    <P>Manpower policy aims at making better use of the undoubted aptitudes of Irish workers; it also aims at making the working of the labour market more efficient and more humane.  For this reason, a National Manpower Service has been established to take over responsibility for the placement and guidance functions from the Employment Service.  It will aim at giving individual workers informed, objective and sympathetic advice about their employment problems.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Welfare and Economic growth</b>
    </P>
    <P>The increased prosperity brought about by the rise of almost 50 per cent in the real gross national product over the decade is reflected in a betterfed, better-housed and better-educated community.  In the interests of fairer <Col N="1757" /><Col N="1758" /> redistribution of wealth, the Government have applied a substantial share of this growing affluence towards financing substantial improvements in the social services as well as higher supports to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In 1959/60 total Government expenditure (including the public capital programme) amounted to £172 million or 27 per cent of GNP.  Last year (1969/70) the total had risen to £588 million or about 41 per cent of GNP. This massive allocation of resources to purposes for the common good laid the foundation for the welcome improvement in general living standards that we experienced in the sixties.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EDUCATION</P>
    <P>In 1959/60 public expenditure on education was £19¼ million.  There were 492,000 pupils in primary schools, about 100,000 in secondary, vocational and technical schools and somewhat less than 11,000 in universities and colleges.</P>
    <P>Ten years afterwards, in 1969/70, public expenditure on education has increased almost four-fold to £70 million, primary school numbers have remained fairly static: but there has been an increase of 100 per cent in the numbers attending full-time second level education and there are almost 19,000 students attending universities and colleges&mdash;an increase of over 70 per cent.  The bare figures, however, only hint at the revolution in education that has taken place in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Primary education</b>
    </P>
    <P>In primary schools a new child-centred curriculum was introduced and is in operation in about 200 schools as a pilot project.  It will be extended gradually to all primary schools as teachers acquire the necessary expertise and experience.  Almost 160,000 new pupil places have been provided in modern schools with the latest standards of lighting, heating, cloakroom and sanitary facilities.  Children living long distances from school may avail of the free transport scheme.  There have been extensions and developments in the provision of facilities for mentally and physically handicapped children and the provision of further facilities is currently being examined.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Second-level education</b>
    </P>
    <P>At second level the decade saw the establishment of State comprehensive schools, the provision of a common intermediate certificate for secondary and vocational schools and the introduction of a generous scheme of grants for secondary school building.  Then, in 1966, the free post-primary education scheme and free transport scheme were introduced together with rationalisation of the post-primary curriculum to provide a comprehensive range of subjects and facilities to suit each student's needs and abilities. In 1968, the foundation of the Career Guidance Service was laid when 32 selected teachers attended a Departmental summer course in guidance techniques.  A further 90 teachers undertook a similar type course in 1969 and it is proposed to hold courses each year until the services of a guidance teacher are available in each post-primary school.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Technical and technological training</b>
    </P>
    <P>To cater for the expanded demand for skilled technical personnel as envisaged in the OECD report published in December 1964, a number of regional technical colleges were planned.  Five of these are already in operation in Waterford, Dundalk, Carlow, Sligo and Athlone and it is expected that a further one will be opened in Letterkenny next September. The contract for the Galway college has been signed and the Cork college <Col N="1759" /><Col N="1760" /> is at an advanced planning stage.  A site is being purchased and planning has commenced on the Institute of Higher Education at Limerick which will cater mainly for the higher technological needs of this region.</P>
    <P>
      <b>University education</b>
    </P>
    <P>Increased demand in the sixties for university education has led to an ever-increasing involvement of the State in the financing of university institutions. In 1959/60 the State provided almost £1 million for universities; in 1969/70 the corresponding figure was in the region of £7½ million.  In order to facilitate a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education and to further its development in the most efficient and economic manner possible commensurate with the maintenance of a high academic standard, the Higher Education Authority was set up in August, 1968, and will shortly be established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>
      <b>Growth in outlay</b>
    </P>
    <P>Total expenditure on income maintenance&mdash;employment contributions as well as public outlay&mdash;almost trebled between 1959/60 and 1969/70 rising from £33½ million to £96¾ million.  Government expenditure on social welfare rose from £25½ million to about £59¼ million.  During this period, increases in social welfare payments substantially exceeded the rise in the cost of living with the result that the old, the unemployed and other under-privileged classes of our society are now far better off in real terms than they were in 1960.  For example, in 1960 a married man on unemployment benefit with three children received a total of 61/- per week, whereas today he receives £8.19.0., virtually a three-fold increase, compared with a rise of 54 per cent in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Expansion of coverage</b>
    </P>
    <P>Apart from the substantial improvements in rates of benefit, the range of social welfare services is far wider than it was ten years ago.  We now have old age contributory pensions, occupational injuries benefit, allowances for home-care for incapacitated pensioners and free travel, electricity and television licence schemes for pensioners.  In addition, there have been notable improvements in existing schemes, in the provision of allowances for children of old age pensioners, the liberalisation of the unemployment assistance means test for smallholders, the abolition of the employment period orders, the doubling of the period during which unemployment benefit may be received, the continuation of payments for children of widow pensioners to age 21 where the children are undergoing full-time education, and the extension of the duration of the cheap fuel scheme by two months.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the pre-budget level of services, Government expenditure on social welfare in 1970/71 will be over £64 million, while total income maintenance expenditure will be almost £106 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">HEALTH SERVICES</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Health Act, 1970, which provides the legal basis for the pattern on which the health services will be structured during the seventies, makes it appropriate to look briefly at what has happened in this field in the sixties.</P>
    <P>The total of current and capital expenditure on health, inclusive of payments of the deficits of the voluntary hospitals, rose from £19 million in <Col N="1761" /><Col N="1762" /> 1959/60 to an estimated £61 million in the past financial year.  This steep rise illustrates the extent of the improvements made.</P>
    <P>The financing of the health services has given rise to considerable problems at both local and central levels.  The Exchequer has come to the aid of the ratepayers to a degree significantly beyond the 50 per cent which is its statutory obligation.  In 1970/71, grants to health authorities will cover 60 per cent of their total health costs.  If account is taken of the health element in the payment of the agricultural grant, three-fourths of public expenditure on health is now borne by the Exchequer.  As well, the Exchequer makes grants-in-aid to cover the deficits of voluntary hospitals, thus reducing the cost to the health authorities for Health Act patients treated there.  This grant-in-aid was £2¾ million in 1969/70 and an estimated £3.2 million in 1970/71.  While the health authorities must continue to contribute to the financing of health expenditure, the national character of these services is acknowledged by the fact that the Exchequer bears such a high portion of their cost.</P>
    <P>In 1966 the income limit for the middle income group was raised from £800 to £1,200, thereby rendering eligible a substantial additional number of persons for certain health services, of which the hospital services would be the most important.</P>
    <P>Any major swing in the direction of free-for-all services would have been intolerably costly for the national economy and, indeed, would be possible, in the foreseeable future, only by calling on resources essential for development purposes, a diversion which would be self-defeating since it could not be afforded at this stage.  However, we should not lose sight of what can be fairly described as the impressive advances made during the sixties both in the extension of the scope and the raising of the standards of the health services and the progressively larger sums made available to finance them.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AGRICULTURE</P>
    <P>The ever-growing amount of State aid to agriculture reflects the Government's desire to promote the agricultural industry and enable the farming community to contribute to, and to share in, the national economic expansion. It consists of expenditure on education, research and advisory services, grants and subsidies to reduce production costs and increase productivity, and market aid and price supports.</P>
    <P>The level of Exchequer assistance, which is now running at £90 million a year, has increased dramatically.  It was £26 million in 1960/61, £54 million in 1965/66 and £77 million in 1968/69.</P>
    <P>New schemes introduced during the past decade included support for beef, mutton and lamb exports, the calved heifer scheme, the brucellosis eradication scheme, the scheme of headage payments for farrowed sows and mountain sheep, the incentive bonus scheme for small farmers and the beef cattle incentive scheme.  The largest single item in the present programme of State aid is support for milk and other dairy products which absorbs £30½ million, or one-third of the total, as compared with little over £2 million ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The massive aid to agriculture is reflected in the growth of agricultural exports which doubled in the ten years to 1969.  Cattle and beef are the main export items and last year these amounted to £87 million or 53½ per cent of agricultural exports.  Other major agricultural exports last year were dairy produce: £21¾ million; bacon and pork: £14½ million; mutton and lamb: £5 million; and horticultural products: £5 million.</P>
    <P>Wider use of modern machinery, extension of rural electrification and the <Col N="1763" /><Col N="1764" /> application of new techniques have eliminated much of the drudgery traditionally associated with farm working.  Total agricultural incomes at current prices amounted to little short of £200 million last year and were 50 per cent higher than the figure for 1960.  When account is taken of the fall in the numbers living on the land, this represents a substantial improvement in income per head in farming.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC CAPITAL PROGRAMME</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years expenditure on the public capital programme, the main component of the capital budget, has increased fourfold.  It amounted to £44 million in 1959/60, the first year of the first programme for economic expansion.  It rose steadily during the period of that programme and was then stabilised in the region of £100 million over the years 1964/65 to 1966/67.  Expansion took place again in 1967/68 and the programme is now not far from £200 million.  It has exercised a strong influence on national investment and economic growth and has been one of the most important features of the economic development of the sixties.</P>
    <P>During that decade there have been significant changes in the relative composition of the programme which reflect Government policy in regard to social and economic development.  Investment in housing, education and health has more than kept pace with the overall increase in the programme and has represented about one-third of total investment for the last few years.  There has been a steady increase in the proportion devoted to industrial grants and credit in pursuance of the policy of increasing industrial development under the three programmes for economic expansion.  Expenditure on fuel, power and telecommunications has maintained a fairly constant proportion as has investment in transport and other essential infrastructural services which are needed in a developing industrial economy.  On the other hand, investment in agriculture has declined proportionately over the period, mainly because of a reduction in expenditure on tuberculosis eradication following the achievement of attested status in the mid-sixties.</P>
    <P Just="Center">HOUSING</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic rise in housing output, in the reconstruction and improvement of dwellings and in expenditure on the provision of sanitary services facilities during the past decade.</P>
    <P>Over 13,800 dwellings (of which about 4,650 are local authority dwellings) were completed in 1969/70, compared with 6,342 in 1959/60.  Capital expenditure on local authority dwellings has risen from £3.3 million to over £17 million in the ten years and the subsidies on borrowing for local authority housing were £8¾ million in 1969/70, compared with £4½ million ten years ago.  In all, more than 98,000 dwellings were completed in the sixties at a total cost to the State and to local authorities of £284 million in capital and subsidies.  In the period 1967/68 to 1969/70, £3 million was provided for a special land acquisition and development programme in the Dublin area to assist in the provision of reasonably priced sites for private housing.  As a result, the housing authorities concerned have over 50,000 sites available for housing schemes.</P>
    <P>The total number of reconstruction grants paid in the sixties was over 92,000 compared with almost 53,000 in the preceding ten years.  The further improvement of dwellings by the installation of water and sewerage facilities is evidenced by the almost seven-fold increase in the number of grants paid, from about 1,500 in 1959/60 to just under 10,000 in 1969/70. The total number of improvement grants paid in the decade was over 60,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" />
      <Col N="1766" /> In addition, capital expenditure on sanitary and miscellaneous services has grown from £1½ million to £5½ million in ten years.  Loan charges incurred by local authorities on sanitary services capital works continue to be subsidised.  Payments of State subsidy in 1969/70 amounted to £1.2 million compared with £0.3 million in 1959/60.</P>
    <P Just="Center">LOCAL AUTHORITY FINANCES</P>
    <P>The significant feature of local authority finances in the past decade has been the threefold growth in Exchequer assistance towards current expenditure, from £24½ million in 1959/60 to £74¼ million in 1969/70, as compared with a doubling of the amount collected in rates from £21½ million to £43¾ million.  In other words, every extra £1 from rates has been matched by about £2.5s. from the Exchequer.  Rising costs of maintenance and the improvement and expansion of services are reflected in an estimated increase in Exchequer grants of £9½ million this year, while the additional charge on the rates is only £5¾ million.</P>
    <P>To take one aspect of local finances, the Government's desire to ease the burden of the cost of the health services on ratepayers is evidenced by the increase of some £10 million between 1966/67 and 1969/70 in the Exchequer grants to the health authorities.  The grant for 1970/71 will show a further increase of £4½ million on the 1969/70 figure.  This includes a special contribution of £2½ million to ensure that the increase in rates attributable to health services costs does not go beyond 2/- in the £ this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FISCAL ASPECTS</P>
    <P>The major developments outlined above could not have taken place without a substantial expansion in current Government expenditure.  This entailed a corresponding increase in revenue which necessitated a number of changes in the system of taxation.  Fiscal policy plays an important part in development.  While it is now regarded primarily as a means of influencing the level of demand in the economy, its historic purpose is to provide the cash necessary to pay for expanding Government services.  To fulfil these functions, the tax system must be so designed as to divert to the Exchequer an adequate share of the growing wealth of the economy.  It is also used to provide incentives for the achievement of economically or socially desirable objectives and, by a suitable choice of rates and allowances, it distributes the cost of Government services among the different sections of the community in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the sixties, Government tax revenues amounted to only 17 per cent of the gross national product (as against 24 per cent in 1969/70) and, of this, the bulk (62 per cent) was derived from customs and excise duties.  Income tax, at the standard rate of seven shillings in the pound, yielded less than 4 per cent of GNP in 1960 and held little prospect of improving its performance under the existing machinery.</P>
    <P>
      <b>PAYE</b>
    </P>
    <P>The introduction of the pay-as-you-earn system in 1960, more than anything else, helped to transform the income tax into a modern broadly-based fiscal instrument, yielding a steady flow of revenue throughout the year and a growing proportion of GNP every year.  In 1969/70, with the standard rate no higher than it was in 1960/61, and in spite of the granting of many personal reliefs and industrial incentives, the yield of the income tax had grown to an estimated 6¼ per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Sales Taxes</b>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" />
      <Col N="1768" /> The system of indirect taxation has also undergone change.  The heavy dependence on customs and excise duties levied on a narrow range of commodities&mdash;tobacco, beer, spirits and oils&mdash;was not well suited to the needs of a growing economy.  A sudden change in consumer tastes, or a disruption of world supplies, could result in a sharp reduction in revenue.  It was necessary, therefore, to broaden the base of the indirect taxes.  The introduction of the turnover tax in 1963 and the wholesale tax in 1966 has gone far towards achieving this aim.  These two taxes now yield about 12 per cent of Government tax revenue (or nearly 3 per cent of GNP).  Customs and excise, though still among the most important sources of revenue, account for slightly less than half of the total.</P>
    <P>Like the pay-as-you-earn system of income tax, the sales taxes have smoothed out the rather severe seasonal fluctuations in the flow of tax revenue thus easing the day-to-day financing problems of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE PUBLIC SERVICE</P>
    <P>The public sector here, as in most countries, has been called upon to play an increasing part in general economic and social development in recent years.  In order to attract staff of the standards required for these new tasks, recruitment policies and procedures have been and will continue to be radically revised.</P>
    <P>Certain basic general service grades have been reorganised, management consultants have been engaged, work measurement has been introduced in appropriate cases and the techniques of organisation and methods, management by objectives and operational research have been applied on a wide front.</P>
    <P>Computers have made their appearance in many offices and a central computing unit is being set up in the Department of Finance to supplement existing services and to increase the facilities for the practical training of civil servants in the field of automatic data processing.  Automatic data processing will play an important part in the extension and development of the planning, programming and budgeting system (PPBS) which, as envisaged in the third programme, is being applied in the public service.</P>
    <P>There has been a spectacular growth in the amount of training given to public servants, either within the service itself or by agencies such as the Institute of Public Administration.  A comprehensive policy of staff development for civil servants has been prepared by the Department of Finance including formal and informal training, education, career planning and systems of motivation and appraisal.  The implications of this policy are being discussed with Heads of Departments and with the staff representatives.</P>
    <P>Further changes are being considered in the context of the report of the public services organisation review group.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INTERNATIONAL MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS</P>
    <P>Following the devaluation of the French franc and the revaluation of the deutschemark in the last half of 1969, the international currency situation has become relatively calm.  Sterling has greatly strengthened which is a source of satisfaction to us since Britain is our principal trading partner and our major source of tourist income.</P>
    <P>International liquidity has been improved somewhat by the special drawing rights scheme which the International Monetary Fund introduced last January.  Drawing rights to the value of $3,400 million have been allocated <Col N="1769" /><Col N="1770" /> by the Fund to the various participating countries, our allocation being $13.4 million, and further allocations of $3,000 million have been agreed for each of the next two years.  It is hoped that in time the scheme will make a significant contribution to international liquidity.</P>
    <P>The Fund has decided to increase the members' quotas or subscriptions by an overall amount of 36 per cent or $7,600 million.  This will represent a sizeable addition to international liquidity which should help to keep up the volume of world trade.  The amount of our increase is $41 million, i.e. about 50 per cent of our previous quota of $80 million.  This will give us greater drawing rights on the Fund.</P>
    <P>Basic problems in relation to the efficient functioning of the international payments system remain and are currently the subject of wide-ranging discussion at the IMF.  Some time is likely to elapse before these discussions are concluded and it is too early yet to say to what extent they will be fruitful.</P>
    <P>Last year a loan of $14½ million to finance part of the ESB's development programme was obtained from the World Bank, a sister organisation of the International Monetary Fund.  The possibilities of obtaining further loan assistance from the Bank are at present being explored.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Interest rates</b>
    </P>
    <P>International interest rates reached record levels during the past year but have recently shown some tendency to decline.  Rates have tended to be high because of the heavy and widespread demand for capital required to finance development programmes and the fact that savings are proving insufficient. Action taken in various countries to control inflation has also given a strong upward push to the cost of money.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that we should be affected by these developments but, fortunately, we have so far been able to maintain a relatively high level of investment.  Our ability to continue to do so depends largely on our success in moderating excessive demand pressures and in increasing the volume of domestic savings.</P>
    <P>NATIONAL SCIENCE COUNCIL</P>
    <P>The application of the fruits of research and development can have an important influence on our economic growth.  It is obvious that the development of new industries and methods, our competitiveness in international markets, the maintenance of employment and general economic and social progress will depend increasingly on the excellence of the scientific and technological knowledge which we can marshal and use.</P>
    <P>The National Science Council is charged with the task of advising the Government in these matters.  In the field of research, the Council considers that the encouragement of research in our universities and colleges is of great importance, so that the scientific thought in these establishments can be mobilised to the greatest extent possible for national objectives.  In 1969 a new scheme of grants for research projects in science and technology was initiated and provision is being made for the continuance of projects begun last year and for the commencement of new ones.</P>
    <P>Funds are also being made available for the promotion of university-industry co-operation.  The National Science Council has advised that one important way in which the universities could co-operate with industry would be by establishing centres of excellence in particular technologies. These centres would help to raise the level of technology in existing industries and encourage the promotion of new science-based industries.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>THIRD PROGRAMME</b>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" />
      <Col N="1772" /> The first annual review of progress under the third programme has recently been published in the &ldquo;Review of 1969 and Outlook for 1970&rdquo;. It shows that substantial progress has been made in line with the programme's projections&mdash;particularly the 4 per cent real growth in GNP in 1969 and the net increase of 4,000 in employment.  While the sectoral product of agriculture showed a decline in 1969, both industrial and other domestic sectoral products exceeded their projected rates of growth.  The rate of growth of exports was less than the programme's expectations, and some ground remains to be made up in this area.  However, capital formation &mdash;a key element in the structural changes in the economy which the Government are trying to promote&mdash;rose very fast last year, largely due to a 14 per cent rise in real terms in the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>The structural changes in our economy and in our economic and social environment which the third programme seeks to effect would make the achievement of full employment a feasible objective for this country by the end of the present decade.  This the Government are attempting to accomplish by policies to promote individual enterprise and initiative, to improve the quality of our work force and human relations in the workplace, to eliminate restrictive practices and to develop procedures for the noninflationary determination of prices and incomes.  Vigorous efforts are being made to increase the scientific and technological input into Irish industry and to rationalise industrial location so as to make Irish industry as competitive as possible in meeting the challenge of free trade within a wider European Community.</P>

      <P>A few minutes before he concluded the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;This is the first Budget of the nineteen seventies.&rdquo;  I thought he was going to say the first Budget of 1970!</P>
      <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One possible benefit of a political party being a long time in office is that it may learn by its own mistakes, but not even this can be said of Fianna Fáil.  When listening to the Taoiseach today with his talk about inflation, with his expression of good intentions, with his determination to impose corrective measures some time in the future, one could not help thinking about what happened in this country in 1965 and 1966 following the deplorable mismanagement of our economy in 1964 and the years preceding it.  That is sufficiently recent to be remembered by members of the present Government.  Prior to 1964 an inflationary situation was allowed to grow uncontrolled and uninterfered with by a Government afraid to grasp the nettle and grasp it firmly.  The result was that in 1966 the bills for inflation had to be paid.  They were paid, as they always will be, not by those who neglect the economy, but by the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>We had, in 1966, under the leadership of the present Taoiseach, measures introduced to restrict credit, to impose extra taxation, to bring about the whole depressive deflationary kind of recession associated with &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; policies.  The result was unemployment, increased taxation and a measure of misery for a great number of people.  I hope we will never have to experience that again.  I am bound to remind the House, and the Taoiseach and his Ministers in particular, that it was not until 1967 that this country surfaced from the misery of the last recession brought about by Fianna Fáil incompetence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1967 the present Minister for Finance assumed office and he took over a situation in which we had reached a modest surplus of £15 million in our balance of payments&mdash;small but significant.  We had apparently pulled out of the recession that had been brought about by inordinate living <Col N="1784" /> and the country's course appeared to be set in the right direction.  All that was necessary then was to keep things pointed in the right direction&mdash;a little prudence, a little care, a little consistency in the pursuance of correct policies.  Above all at that time what was needed and what we demanded from these benches time and time again &mdash;when I say these benches I mean all the benches in the Opposition&mdash;was a prices and incomes policy.  We directed the Government's attention in 1967 to the importance of working out a proper prices and incomes policy. It could have been done then when the situation in the post-depression period was fluid and flexible.  Prudence, care, a little consistency&mdash;that is all that was required but the facts and the record show that these characteristics have, in fact, been singularly lacking in the last two years, 1968 and 1969.  They will be known as the rake's progress years so far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1968 the first signs of a fresh, new inflation began to appear.  Personal consumption increased in that year by more than 10½ per cent, public consumption by 16 per cent and prices started to rise steeply, reaching almost 5 per cent in that year.  The result was that, at the end of 1968, the small surplus of £15 million in our balance of payments had been turned into a deficit of £22 million.  One would have expected in that set of circumstances, with the obvious re-appearance of inflationary symptoms, that some mild corrective action might have been taken.  Prudence would have dictated that course because inflation threatens the way of life of ordinary people. It may create a situation of temporary euphoria, it may be fine for ministerial complacency but the end of the road of inflation means fewer jobs and more people out of work.  I suggest that in 1968 prudence would have dictated some steps.  Instead of taking action the Government dithered and hesitated.  There was what we have come to expect now&mdash;the usual paralysis in Fianna Fáil leadership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The political exigencies of 1968 were more important than <Col N="1785" /> the jobs and the way of life of ordinary people because a referendum had to be faced.  Because of the political test of the referendum an inflationary Budget was introduced in the spring of 1968, a Budget which, in its terms, had the effect of puffing up the incipient inflation that was already there.  We had the referendum and we know what happened.  Following the referendum we had the second Budget of 1968, which was a frankly deflationary Budget, no doubt justified.  Maybe its object was too extreme but it represented a Government decision to deflate the economy and it imposed £19 million worth of fresh taxation and obviously indicated a frantic effort by the Government to tackle the problem of new inflation.</P>
      <P>From the autumn of 1968 to March of 1969 the Government were apparently set on pursuing this policy of deflating the economy, sufficient to tide over the obvious economic difficulties. Apparently they were set on that course but obviously not succeeding because by March 19th of 1969 the situation had become so serious that the Minister for Finance, who was faced then with a widening deficit in our balance of payments, now approaching £50 million, took time on radio and on television to proclaim a state of national emergency and to tell everybody that we were in the middle of an economic crisis.  To prove it the Government the following day slashed their own salaries by 14 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know what would have happened if this line of thought had been pursued&mdash;the March 19th crisis, the reduction in the Government salaries, the declaration of a national emergency, the appeal to the trade unionists for God's sake to lay off, everybody was to tighten his belt and we were to wear the hair shirt and to face courageously the difficulties surrounding us.  We do not know what would have happened because the following week that crisis was swept under the carpet and was forgotten in a sudden outbreak of economic sunshine.  We had a Budget <Col N="1786" /> introduced on May 7th which was an inflationary Budget.</P>
      <P>In any country, no matter how strongly or weakly the Government may hold office, it is of the utmost importance that when a Government, a Minister for Finance and a leader talk in relation to the economic problems of the people they should speak with sincerity.  It is of the utmost importance that their words should command confidence because if there is a credibility gap between what is said on non-controversial economic affairs by the leader of the Government or the Minister for Finance the outcome can only be harmful.  In the spring of last year there was a huge credibility gap created between the Government and the ordinary people.  Every trade unionist, everyone concerned with organised labour, every employer, the ordinary people throughout the land who watched a Minister bluff and bluster between crisis and prosperity in a matter of ten days, or so, wondered who to believe in the end.</P>
      <P>Of course we know that behind this change of course was again a decision based on political expediency.  The Government had decided on an early general election and, therefore, it was necessary to forget all talk about crises, balance of payments, national emergencies, tightening of belts and all the rest of it.  An election budget, an inflationary budget had to be introduced, and that was done.  That was all over last June and one would have expected that from that on there would have been a more responsible approach to the national finances because the Irish £ is important to the Irish people.  It represents their security.  It represents the savings of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since last June all the economic indicators have been flashing red signals of danger.  Since last June the spiral of rising prices has continued with renewed velocity.  In 1969 so steep was the rise that the consumer price index now stands at 7½ per cent higher than it did in 1968.  In 1969 the rate of growth of our exports dropped by one-third. We were beginning to price ourselves out of foreign markets.  Private and <Col N="1787" /> public consumption rose 11½ and 13½ per cent.  A steep rise in imports, a drop in the export trade, and it was perfectly clear that inflation had entered on a new stage.  It was being maintained and spread by domestic support.  In 1969 the country was rather like a dog eating its own tail.</P>
    <P>Of course the deficit in the balance of payments rose from £22 million to £60 million.  That was bad enough for the people concerned about the future of the country, and there were people who stood up to be counted and who spoke out.  Not only were the economic indicators flashing warning signals but Professor Fogarty in the Broadsheet a short while ago, having talked about the problem of prices and what might have been had a prices and incomes policy been pursued, gave a clear warning that the £ was in danger.  In September, 1969, the Central Bank pointed out that inflation instead of being brought under control appeared to be getting worse.</P>
    <P>In another comment in the same report the Central Bank pointed out that there were many points of similarity between the present situation and that of 1964, that the economic and social stakes were high and the right choice of policy and determination in carrying it through would have a most important influence on the economy for the years immediately ahead.  They said that what was at issue was whether the present high rate of inflation should be allowed to continue until it made our exports of goods and services uncompetitive at home and in foreign markets and forced a severe contraction of production and employment, or should be reduced below the rate of inflaction in Britain thus opening the way to a steady expansion of production, employment and re-alignment.</P>
    <P>That was the view expressed by the Central Bank in September last.  There was a clear choice: were we to jeopardise by inaction, by failing to exercise prudence, employment and production and the whole progress of our economy?  That piece of advice went unheeded.  At the same time the Economic and Social Research Institute <Col N="1788" /> in a summary and appreciation of the economic situation stated that allowing present trends to continue meant running the economy with no safety margin and went on to suggest that if things continued as they were the choice might be between devaluation and deflation.</P>
    <P>On November 12th the Governor of the Central Bank stated that it was clear that a strong effort to restore confidence in the value of money was overdue.  Other statements were made, all indicative of the growing and mounting concern on the part of economists, research units and different bodies all concerned with the state of the economy.  Clear warnings were given to the Minister and the Government. We know that nothing was done. As I say, 1969 ended with a serious deficit in our balance of payments of some £60 million.  The Taoiseach said it was fine that although we had that deficit our assets had increased.  He said that was due to the fact that we were pursuing development policies here at home and that was encouraging the inflow of foreign capital.</P>
    <P>With respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that is gilding the lily a little too much.  Of the £77 million of foreign money which came flowing into this country last year, £31 million came as a result of State and State-guaranteed borrowing at 15 per cent and £45 million came into this country because of customers who went to non-associated banks avoiding the restrictions of the Central Bank and borrowed at 15 per cent.  With this foreign borrowing we have been financing a deficit in our balance of payments. That surely is indicative of an economy facing very real danger.  We are now paying 15 per cent to the foreigner to allow us to import more than we can earn, 15 per cent which we will not pay to the Irish saver, to the person who wants to save his money in this country.  Would it not be much wiser if the Minister, instead of encouraging that situation, increased the interest available for savings and really got Irish money working hard to save Irish money?</P>

      <P>However, nothing was done and this Budget has been introduced following the issue of a number of documents and economic surveys of one kind or another.  Most Deputies have read them so I will not trespass on the time of the House by going into them in any detail.  The NIEC Report and the special document on credit policy issued by the Central Bank, especially for this occasion today, repeat in very clear words the concern felt with regard to the state of the economy.  In fact, the NIEC report is the most virulent indictment of Government inefficiency that has ever appeared in any such production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That report in every line condemned the Government for failure to do what was their bounden duty and suggested that as a result the country was now facing in 1970 the situation in which there would be a further increase of 7½ per cent in the consumer price index and the deficit in our balance of payments was likely to rise to £90 million.  That report and the Central Bank Report both indicated that, at a time when the possibility of continuing to live by borrowing from abroad was becoming more improbable, if we were to save the country from absolute disaster something would have to be done.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank put forward certain suggestions.  First, a sharp credit restriction&mdash;sharp because of the neglect of the Government in the last 12 or 18 months&mdash;and a reduction in bank credit from £120 million to £75 million on the basis that there would be a reduction in Government expenditure and an actual balancing of the Budget.  The Central Bank stated that these measures are the minima required to achieve a balance of payments deficit in 1970 of £50 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NIEC go further.  They insist on a balanced Budget but they say in view of the neglect, delay and lack of prudence in the last two years in addition to balancing the Budget it is necessary now to take from £80 million to £90 million out of circulation.  All of those measures will be necessary to achieve <Col N="1790" /> a deficit of only £50 million in the coming year.  Since he referred to them, apparently the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance read those reports and apparently also they are concerned with the balance of payments deficit.  I do not see anything in this Budget to deal with this.  I see a lot of pious expressions of hope, a parade of good intentions and the same plea &ldquo;Please do not increase your pay beyond 7 per cent&rdquo;.  This plea came from the Head of the Government before Christmas at a time when pay increases were running at the rate of 13 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Budget I see the credibility gap growing ever wider. I do not believe anybody would take seriously what is now said on economic affairs by either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance.  The rake's progress of the past two years is continuing. One might expect that even a rake who spent two years away from home might at some stage begin to show evidence of repentance.  However, this is not the case.</P>
      <P>We welcome the benefits in this Budget but I must be responsible and stress that this is a dangerous Budget. The big problem at the moment, what is feeding our own inflation, is the fact that every week prices are rising.  Professor Fogarty pointed out all we could do for this country if only we could solve this problem and have a proper prices policy.  In a dramatic passage, which I think is worth reading, he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But look at the effect on development ! The Irish salesman visiting Britain or Germany or America could quote a price of 12s where today he quotes £1.  The Industrial Development Authority, talking to firms interested in coming to Ireland, could point to Ireland as the cheapest country in the world from which to export.  The Irish housewife, comparing the price of foreign and Irish products in the shops, would see a price of 12s on the Irish product where she sees £1 today. There would be no need for a Buy Irish movement; no one in his senses <Col N="1791" /> would buy anything else.  Export orders would be pouring in.  We could bury Buchanan and all his works under an avalanche of applicants to build factories anywhere in Ireland.  We could afford to pick and choose among those applicants and to insist on a proper degree of Irish participation, Irish directors on the board and scientists in the laboratory, and encouragement to native Irish enterprise.  Emigration would vanish overnight and the people would be streaming back. The farmer coming off the land would have no need to chase a job; recruiters for Irish firms would be chasing him.  In fact the resources of the country would be overstrained to the point where it would be necessary to choke off the rush of foreign firms and export orders, probably by valuing up the Irish £.  The Irish tourist going abroad would find that his pound was worth perhaps 30 shillings in Britain and $3.50 or even $4&mdash;instead of $2.40&mdash;in America.</P>
    <P>This could be achieved by a prices policy.  We are doing nothing about it but watching the situation develop&mdash; prices rising and continuing to rise.  It is certain that prices will rise by 7½ per cent this year and there is nothing in the Budget to deal with that situation. This means that our home-fed inflation will continue.  At the moment our unit costs have risen dramatically. They have outstripped our nearest competitors' and that apparently is going to continue.</P>
    <P>What is the solution?  I am going to suggest that the very worst solution is to double turnover tax.  In this Budget the cost of living this year will increase by 7½ plus 2½ per cent&mdash;a 10 per cent increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>All of this is occurring in an inflationary situation.  I mention these matters because it seems to me that this Budget has adopted the wrong approach.  I do not know if the Minister is going to achieve a balance. He has made an estimate of buoyancy which is 80 per cent more than last <Col N="1792" /> year.  He has not taken into consideration the fact that there will be expenditure which is not in the Book of Estimates, as there was last year.  We will watch and wait because it is our concern to see a restoration of confidence in our economy.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said there will be further measures taken if necessary.  It might have been more honest, more courageous and better in the interest of instilling confidence, if he put all the cards on the table today instead of concentrating on the desirable social welfare benefits and saying &ldquo;if necessary, something will be done in the future&rdquo;.  We will be concerned to see that this Government, with its majority here in this House, will act with prudence from now onwards in the interests of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is only natural that those of us who are Members of this House should, like the public on a day like today be concerned primarily with taxation and the concessions made by way of allowances. There are, however, many other very important factors to be considered in the light of the type of speech made by the Taoiseach today and the type of speech made by various Ministers for Finance introducing Budgets into this House in past years.</P>
      <P>There are some notable omissions from the Financial Statement.  There was scant reference to employment. There was no reference of any kind to the £9 million assistance to the agricultural industry.  It is only right, I think, that I should ask the Taoiseach why such a short reference to that much lauded document, the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement?  It got little more than half a page.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another remarkable feature of the Financial Statement was an over attack on the trade union movement.  I refer to what the Taoiseach said about the bargaining power of trade unions and his description of it as a brutal exercise. There is nothing in this document about profits, excess profits, about those who exploit people, about those who inflate prices.  There may have been a very short reference but there was not the same admonition as there <Col N="1793" /> was in the case of the trade unions. There was not the same attack made as the attack made on those who are trying to get proper salaries and proper wages.</P>
    <P>I was astounded to hear in the very first part of the speech, where concessions and taxation proposals were announced, that the emphasis would be on indirect taxation.  I am sure members of the Fianna Fáil party are careful to listen to the Minister for Finance when he goes on television: I well remember&mdash;I think it was about this time two years&mdash;listening to the Minister talking about indirect taxation: he said he did not like indirect taxation because it hits the less well off.  Here we have a reversal of the Minister's policy in regard to taxation because in this Financial Statement, through the mouth of the Taoiseach, the Minister says that the emphasis will be on indirect taxation.  In the two years that have elapsed the Minister seems to have lost his concern with the people who are less well off.</P>
    <P>In somewhat of a boastful fashion the Minister states that traditional items are not being taxed.  He mentions tobacco, petrol and cigarettes.  He mentions other items that are regarded as traditional items for increased taxation. He forgets, and so do those who cheered his speech, that not alone are all these commodities being taxed under this Budget but every single item purchased in the shops&mdash;with the exception, I think, of medicines&mdash;will be taxed.  The taxpayers will be asked to contribute another £20 million per year.  We forecast this in the last two weeks of the by-election campaign and we were told we were the prophets of doom and that there was no such suggestion but this Budget will certainly hit the less well off because everything will be taxed.</P>
    <P>This Budget was described as one designed to re-distribute income.  It is asking people to pay more for bread&mdash; the pensioner, the widow and the orphan, those who are sick and those who are unemployed.  Is this Fianna Fáil's idea of redistribution of income? They ask all these to pay, according to the Taoiseach, an extra sixpence in the £.  So far as prices are concerned, the <Col N="1794" /> reliefs given and the extra allowances will be eroded to the extent of many shillings per week in the normal family circle.</P>
    <P>I refuse to believe&mdash;we got this kind of assurance when the original turnover tax was being introduced&mdash;that the increased tax will mean an increase of only sixpence in the £.  It will mean much more than that because the Fianna Fáil Government have no interest whatever in price control.  I think it must have been all of four years ago that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Dr. Hillery, introduced here what was described as the Prices Bill.  He did that because the members of this party had been badgering him, and various other Ministers, for years to introduce some sort of price control.  We were, of course, told at first that price control was impossible except in times of emergency but, as far as wages and salaries are concerned, we have had that emergency for quite a long time now.  I wonder was the Taoiseach thinking about what he was saying yesterday when he made reference to a conference he had with the trade union movement and the employers and he told us, as if for the first time, that now the machinery for price control would be tightened up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  Why has it not been as strong as it should have been following the enactment of the Bill and the setting up of the machinery? The sort of promise the Taoiseach gave should have been given years ago and it should have been implemented years ago.  I do not believe that this&mdash; this was the experience we had when the tax was introduced originally&mdash;will be confined to 2½ per cent.  People will be exploited, as they have been exploited up to this, in the purchase of goods.  Unless the Taoiseach implements the promise he made yesterday he will find that the workers will once more have to take steps to ensure that their standard of living will not be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reliefs are welcome but they will <Col N="1795" /> not disguise the failure of the Government's policy over the last year.  It is, I think, pertinent to ask who will pay for these increases.  The Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and various other Ministers have said that we would have to make sacrifices to correct an inflationary situation.  There is no suggestion here that there should be a tax on land, on property speculation, on excess profits and it is abundantly clear to me, because this is a turnover tax and because it applies to every commodity one can name, that, in the words of the Minister for Finance, the less well off will be hit the hardest. The lowly paid body of workers, the people with £18 and £20 a week, are asked to make sacrifices whilst those who are well off will get the benefit of the income tax concessions and will not be asked to pay in proportion to the incomes they have or to the wealth that is available to them.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody should be kidded into thinking that this is a Budget under which assistance is given on a wide scale to deserving people. It is nothing of the kind.  It is tantamount to feeding the dog with his own tail because the people who will get these allowances will have to pay more and in a bigger way than those whom the Taoiseach dared not mention.</P>
    <P>I regret the absence of the Minister for Finance because of an accident which befell him this morning, but I do not think he could be very proud of his own or his Government's performance over the last year.  Electorally, I suppose Fianna Fáil can be proud in terms of seats in this House, but the year as a whole for the great mass of the people can only be described as a very bad year, bad for the economy and bad for the people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is optimistic about 1970: so was the Minister for Finance about 1969; but in 1969 national income rose by only 3¾ per cent as compared with 5½ per cent in 1968. The Minister himself in an optimistic mood said here last year that he expected an increase of 4½ per cent and that it should be a year of satisfactory growth.  He said this without taking the necessary steps to ensure that it <Col N="1796" /> would be such a year.  It was a year in which Fianna Fáil got the greatest number of seats since 1957, but it could also be regarded as the year of what was perhaps their greatest failure in the past decade.  In that year there was a decrease in growth rates.  In 1969 there was a crisis in the balance of payments: prices increased by 7.4 per cent.  The NIEC have forecast that the balance of payments will go up by the end of the year to £90 million and again there is no indication that the Government have any plans to prevent this.</P>
    <P>Apart from the price increases that will arise out of this Budget the NIEC have forecast even under pre-Budget conditions, that prices will rise by another 7 per cent.  That is the record.  We are entitled to ask who is responsible for this crisis.  One gets the impression from the Government, and particularly from the Minister for Finance, that somebody other than they is responsible.  They look out with a bovine stare, tell us we are in a crisis and suggest that somebody else is to blame.  It should be made abundantly clear that as far as our economy is concerned the Government are responsible. If prices rise, that is the responsibility of the Government; if the balance of payments gets out of hand, that is the responsibility of the Government&mdash;and there is no use in this House or in after-dinner speeches blaming the trade unions, the farmers, or any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the 7.4 per cent price rise in 1969.  The Government by their budgetary policy&mdash;let us not always blame those who sell goods&mdash;were responsible for 3 per cent of this rise, particularly as a result of the Budget that the Taoiseach, acting as Minister for Finance, introduced in November, 1968, after the referendum that proved so disastrous for them.</P>
    <P>There is also&mdash;and this is part of the reason why prices went up&mdash;the increase in the cost of imports and the general inflationary situation brought about by panic price rises, by people stepping up the price of goods in fear or, if you like, in anticipation of wages going up.  Wages did not go up within a certain period.  In any case, there was <Col N="1797" /> no real price control and questions from this side of the House to the various Ministers for Industry and Commerce asking for more inspectors and wider control were met with rebuffs and suggestions that the machinery was adequate.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that I am a full-time official of a trade union, nor have I ever been such, but I am not very much impressed by the admonition now being given by the Government to workers to show restraint in seeking wage increases. The Government must remember that in the campaign prior to the election of 19th June the Government boasted of the prosperity of the country. The workers took the Government at their word and not alone, therefore, did they seek compensation for an increase in prices but in accordance with the Government's description of the country they sought, as I think they were entitled to do in view of the Government's attitude, a better standard of life.</P>
    <P>It is now suggested that this was wrong.  If it was wrong and if the Government were false to the electorate, they have themselves to blame if they regard these wage demands as excessive.  If this is described as irresponsibility the Government could and should be described as behaving irresponsibly in the campaign preceding the last general election.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about the balance of payments which increased by £38 million between 1968 and 1969. Again they cannot look blankly at the people and blame them.  The Government could have taken some measures to correct that situation prior to the general election but because there was a general election they refused to do so and preferred the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party to the interests of the people and the country.  Again, this excessive balance of payments problem can be attributed to the Government, particularly when one has regard to the figures for imports and exports for the years 1968 and 1969.  We had a trade gap of £218 million for 1969.  We are entitled to ask what was the reason for this.  The Government could have taken measures to ensure that would not be so.  Why did we have an increase <Col N="1798" /> in the trade gap between the year 1968 and 1969 of £54 million?  We are entitled to ask where did this occur.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must know that of the £54 million increase in the trade gap, £47 million arose out of our trade with Britain.  Now, may I ask: what price the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement?  Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce now repeat the advantages he said would accrue from that agreement?  In respect of agriculture will the present Minister for Finance, the former Minister for Agriculture, tell us whether or not in the first year of that agreement an extra £10 million went into the pockets of the Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>The frightening thing so far as we are concerned&mdash;we opposed that agreement&mdash;is that it is still operating. There have been discussions in London over the past few months but nothing seems to have emerged.  It appears, to judge by the silence, that we are going to reduce our tariffs again on 1st July and so allow in a flood of British-made goods which will add to our balance of payments problem and make it much more acute than it is at present. We regard this Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, and said so <i>ad nauseam</i>, as a bad bargain for agriculture and industry.  We have only to look in the shops to see its effect on our industry.</P>
    <P>As regards manufactured goods&mdash;remember we are about to compete with the countries of Europe&mdash;in competition with Britain, which is just one country, in one year there was an increase of £20 million in imports of manufactured goods.  There was an increase of £5 million in the import of foodstuffs.  We are an agricultural country; we expect to do well in selling to Europe; but in one year we find an increase in food imports of £5 million. Now, as we predicted, we are feeling the crunch of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the reduction of our tariffs.  It must appear to anybody having regard to these figures and other figures available from Government sources that this situation will become worse and will have an effect on employment here and put men out of work.  The sooner the Taoiseach and members of his Government <Col N="1799" /> decide to scrap this agreement entirely and negotiate a new one&mdash;particularly in view of the fact that we have not got into Europe by 1970&mdash;the better.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to an increase in beef and cattle exports.  I do not know whether my figures will stand up to the Taoiseach's but as far as I can gather, beef exports were down from £25 million to £24 million in 1969 as compared with 1968.  The boasts we heard about the number of cattle we could sell to Britain have not materialised because in 1968 we exported 591,000 store cattle to Britain and in 1969 that figure dropped to 533,000. It was down by 58,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I never knew that before.  In any case the promised increase in cattle exports did not materialise. The Taoiseach must be conscious of this because it was the view expressed by Mr. Lemass when he was Taoiseach.  He said it was never intended that this agreement would obtain for so long, in the expectation that we would be in Europe by 1970.  It was said that it was intended that this agreement should be the necessary spur to industry to be more efficient for the EEC.  Now in view of the increase in the import of manufactured goods it does not appear that the agreement was the necessary spur to industry.  It was also intended of course to strengthen our hands in negotiations <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British market and our special connection with it.  It has done neither and for that reason I say the agreement should be scrapped and an endeavour should be made to have a better agreement negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need remind the House, particularly Deputies from farming areas, of the widening gap between agricultural and industrial earnings.  I do not believe that the extra £5½ million now being given to the agricultural industry will improve <Col N="1800" /> that situation.  Last year the gap between industrial earnings and agricultural earnings worsened by £80 per head.  Farming income was £640 compared with £975 for industrial earnings of adult males.  Therefore I do not think the Minister for Agriculture should get hot under the collar when he is asked by the President of the ICMSA or the NFA to get a better deal from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not refer at length to the employment figures but he did say that last year there was an increase of 16,000 in non-agricultural employment. I am not going to refer back to the Second Programme for Economic Expansion in which they promised something like 78,000 jobs over a period of ten years.  That prediction has not materialised and I do not think we can be particularly proud of the fact that having regard to the fall of 12,000 in agriculture the net increase in industrial employment was 4,000. People may regard it as being big but it is not big enough if we are to keep our people at home or to make any sort of inroad into the high unemployment numbers.  Our unemployment figure is higher than that of most European countries.  We have not made any advance so far as employment is concerned in the last four or five years. The boasts of the Fianna Fáil Party and their spokesmen are very hollow when one remembers that in 1965 we had 1,069,000 employed and in 1969 the figure was exactly the same.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister for Industry and Commerce doing?  I do not know how many factories are closing; I do know there is a lot of publicity when a factory is being opened.  We all welcome the establishment of new factories but with all this publicity over the establishment of factories we have the same number of persons employed now as we had in 1965.  There has been no improvement whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what has already been said but I do want to refer to the worsening of the balance of payments position.  Last year the Minister for Finance forecast that the balance of payments would be of the order of £55 million but, as it turned out, it was £60 million.  As I said for political advantage he deliberately did <Col N="1801" /> nothing.  Deputy O'Higgins has described his political antics in March and April of last year when with a doleful face he told the people that they would have to tighten their belts because we had the greatest crisis we had had for many years.  Of course many people believed him but when the Dáil resumed in the second or third week of April and he was questioned by a Deputy about the crisis he said that it had disappeared.  We would like to know if there was a crisis in March and if there was how did it disappear or did it disappear merely because the Taoiseach decided there was to be a general election in June, 1969?  The general election was not the only factor; the fact that by-elections were pending was another factor.  I have no doubt that if these by-elections had not intervened, if there had been no reason for by-elections, we would have had a mini or a maxi Budget on the lines of the one introduced after the Referendum in November, 1968.</P>
    <P>In March last year the Minister for Finance, his advisers and the Taoiseach knew what the balance of payments was.  It was at the highest rate ever but the Government refused to take any action at all.  Therefore as far as the economic situation is concerned there is no point in the Government blaming this situation or that situation.  If we have an economic crisis, if prices are going too high, if the Government consider that wages are too high and if they consider that the economy is not what it should be it is their responsibility and their's alone.</P>
    <P>As far as this Budget is concerned I want to say that in accordance with what we did in 1963 I will not nor will any member of my party vote for a tax proposal which says that bread will be taxed, a proposal which says that children's shoes, clothes and stockings, that coal and so on and all essentials will be taxed in order to provide relief not so much for the lowly paid workers but for those in the upper income brackets. We will not be party to any proposal which taxes all these things and which will not result in a great improvement for the people who need it so much.  This was described as being a Budget or an instrument that <Col N="1802" /> would re-distribute income, a Budget of social justice, but it is not.  What is being given out with one hand is being taken back in excess with the other. For that reason my party will not vote for the increase in turnover tax to the extent of 2½ per cent.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purposes of the Bill are firstly to increase the limit of authorised capital expenditure by the ESB for general <Col N="1807" /> purposes and, secondly, to provide for certain amendments in the superannuation code of ESB employees.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation the board are entitled to incur capital expenditure for general purposes, that is to say, for all purposes other than the electrification of rural areas, up to a limit of £225 million.  While actual expenditure up to 31st March, 1970, amounted to about £187 million the board, of course, must enter into commitments for substantial expenditure some years ahead.  Deputies will appreciate that, in general, it takes five years from planning stage to commissioning stage for generating stations.  Therefore, at any given time, the board are committed to expenditure on generating plant up to five years ahead.  Capital for transmission and other expenditure does not have to be planned quite so far ahead. I propose in this Bill to increase the limit to £290 million.</P>
    <P>The board's total installed generating capacity at present amounts to about 1,410 megawatts.  They expect to commission 706 megawatts of additional capacity, half of which will be oil fired, to meet the demand up to 1974-75.  This additional capacity includes a 40 megawatt extension to the milled peat fired station at Shannon-bridge, County Offaly.  This will absorb the production of the last major bog suitable for harvesting by Bord na Móna's advanced methods.</P>
    <P>The additional capacity also includes the 280 megawatt pumped storage scheme at Turlough Hill, County Wicklow.  A pumped storage project depends on the utilisation of relatively cheap electrical energy available from thermal generating stations to pump water during the night from a low level reservoir to a high level reservoir.  This water is utilised the following day to produce peak load energy and in this way the station acts as a storage centre for electricity.</P>
    <P>Although the scheme has received a certain amount of publicity, Deputies may not be fully aware of the magnitude of the work being carried out.  The scheme, which qualified for a loan of about £6 million from the World Bank, and which will cost over £12 million, <Col N="1808" /> was largely designed by the board's own engineers and is regarded as being unique in civil engineering projects in Ireland.  Turlough Hill will be the sixth station of its kind in Europe and only two others in the world are technically more complex, in terms of the height and quantity of water used.</P>
    <P>I think the board have, perhaps, tended to be unduly modest with regard to the Turlough Hill project. They have every reason to be very proud of this development.  Deputies should take the opportunity to see the scheme for themselves, as I did, and I have no doubt that the board would be delighted to show them around.</P>
    <P>When the Turlough Hill area was first proposed as a location for the project, there was considerable disquiet about the dangers to the amenities of this beautiful part of the country. It is, therefore, necessary to point out that the board have so designed the scheme that virtually nothing will be visible from the road.  On their own initiative, the ESB engaged a most eminent landscape architect to advise on the problems associated with the project and, despite a number of public statements to the contrary, they have closely followed the recommendations made and have every intention of doing so in the future, if at all practicable.</P>
    <P>Controversy at present surrounds the proposed routes of the transmission lines from the scheme.  I do not propose to add fuel to this controversy except to point out that the decisions in this case will be for the appropriate planning authorities, from whom the ESB have sought planning permission, and that interested parties can lodge any objections they may have with the appropriate planning authority.</P>
    <P>Also included in the additional capacity being provided in the next few years&mdash;and another innovation as far as the ESB are concerned&mdash;are two 13 megawatt gas turbine units at Pigeon House.  These small sets can be started independently of outside electricity supply and would reduce the time required to restore supply to the Dublin area in the event of the main Dublin stations being temporarily out of action.  They can also be utilised for <Col N="1809" /> peak load, thus avoiding the necessity for installing large uneconomic units&mdash;&ldquo;peak lopping&rdquo; as it is called.</P>
    <P>The question of erecting nuclear stations has been posed from time to time both in the press and here in the House and I take this opportunity to explain the position.  The competition posed by nuclear power generation for conventional thermal stations has led to rapid and substantial improvement in the technology of thermal generation in new, larger, higher-temperature units, giving greater efficiency and hence lower cost.  In our circumstances, it is necessary to bear in mind the size of station suitable to Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>The more competitive nuclear stations erected abroad have so far all been of very large capacity, approaching our total installed capacity.  There is a problem in accommodating large generating units on the ESB system because of the base load running which they require, and the risk involved in overdependence on single units.  However, the continuing growth in demand for electricity in Ireland is making it possible to use larger and larger units so that the time when nuclear generation may become viable is moving closer.  In addition, producers of nuclear generators are now tending to give more consideration to the production of competitive medium and smaller sized units.</P>
    <P>Apart from pure economics, we are becoming to a greater extent each year dependent on oil, and generation from native sources of energy, already practically fully developed, now represents an ever decreasing percentage of output. Diversion into nuclear generation would be a safeguard on security grounds.  It is thus in the national interest to lessen our dependence on any one energy source.  The ESB have already arranged for the training of some of their engineers in nuclear technology and are continuing to study the overall situation.  Ireland may well have its first nuclear power station before the end of the seventies.</P>
    <P>The demand for electricity continues to grow at a remarkable rate.  The rate of increase over the past four years was as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1810" />
    </P>
    <P>By way of comparison, the increase in demand in European member countries of OECD has averaged between 5 per cent and 6 per cent in recent years; further comparisons show that, in the five-year period ended March, 1968, the average annual increase in electricity consumption per inhabitant was 11 per cent in Ireland, 5.1 per cent in the UK, 6.1 per cent in France, and 7.6 per cent in Italy. The growth in demand here is, of course, a sign of economic strength and an indicator of the improving living standards of our people.  Our economic growth is conversely to a great extent dependent on our continuing to invest increasing amounts of public capital in the provision of electricity to meet the increased demands.</P>
    <P>The board had been estimating future demand for electricity on a 9 per cent compound growth basis but they are now raising this estimate to 10 per cent.  Estimating increases in demand for electricity up to five years ahead is a hazardous and onerous job. There is the danger, on the one hand, of over-estimation in which case the unused generating capacity would bring serious losses and, on the other hand, the danger of under-estimation. resulting in load shedding because of inability to maintain supplies.  Future demand is affected by the course of general economic progress in the country in the period concerned.  The ESB, I might say, employ the most modern techniques of forecasting and they are aware of the latest developments internationally in the determination of more precise statistical standards for the peak load security level.</P>
    <P>To meet the expected growth in the years after 1974-75, the board expect, during the next two years, to approve the construction of up to 500 megawatts of further generating capacity estimated to cost £25 million.  A further £5 million expenditure in respect of generating capacity being provided up to 1974-75 will also arise during the next two years.  Finally, improvements to the transmission and distribution <Col N="1811" /> networks and other works costing about £35 million are expected to arise for approval by mid-1972. These sums total £65 million which is the amount of increased capital expenditure being authorised by the Bill. Further amending legislation will then be required, giving the House another opportunity to debate, in a general way, the affairs of the board.</P>
    <P>The enormous new investments now necessary to keep pace with the sustained and continuing growth in demand involve a serious financial problem.  During the next seven or eight years the board will have to provide as much capacity again as has been provided up to now.  Their capital expenditure is now running at over £20 million a year.  Having regard to the amount of capital left available after meeting the other competing demands for capital in the Irish market, the board can no longer attract their full requirements by the traditional long-term loans, as in the past.</P>
    <P>The board have, therefore, to resort to foreign borrowing and credit financing which involves high interest rates and repayment in a shorter term.  This involves higher revenue charges and greater reliance on internal financing. As indicated in last year's ESB report, this is one factor leading to increased prices.  As long as the present general financial position persists, I cannot rule out the likelihood that further price increases may be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I might say that the board's charges, taking into account the increase which came into effect in January, still compare favourably with most West European tariffs for domestic consumers.  In regard to industrial consumers, there is, admittedly, cheaper power for big industrial users in Norway, Sweden and Switzerland where there are adequate supplies of cheap hydro-power.  French, British and Dutch tariffs for big industries give about the same order of costs to the user as those of the ESB.  I am sure the House will agree that it is a major challenge to the ESB to maintain electricity prices here at attractive levels.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in recommending the <Col N="1812" /> increase in the board's limit on capital expenditure to the House.  It is a warranty, a clear evidence of progress being made and of confidence in our prospects for the future.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill deals with certain improvements in the pension schemes for ESB employees.  The first manual workers' pension scheme which came into operation in 1943 provided a maximum fixed pension of £3 a week and a retirement benefit of £200.  Over the years the pension rates have been increased from time to time but it became obvious that a scheme based on fixed amounts was no longer appropriate. Substantial improvements in the pension entitlements of manual workers have recently been negotiated between the board, the workers, and the unions.</P>
    <P>The principal improvement is that a worker with full service can now get a pension of half his retiring pay, together with a retirement benefit equal to one year's wages.  Payment of pension is guaranteed for five years following retirement and a worker may, before he retires, exercise an option to provide his wife or other dependant with a pension for life should she survive him.  Death benefits payable under the scheme have also been improved. The worker's contribution rate under the new scheme is 5 per cent and there is an equal contribution by the ESB.</P>
    <P>Many ESB workers serve in a temporary capacity for some years before they are appointed to permanent and pensionable posts with the board and admitted to membership of the pension scheme.  The new scheme will enable workers to reckon for pension purposes one half of such service, excluding the first two years which are regarded as a probation period.  One of the objects of the Bill is to amend the existing statutory provisions to enable this credit to be given.</P>
    <P>The new benefits represent a considerable advance on those which applied formerly and the new scheme which was initiated by the board, is, in my opinion, a practical demonstration of their concern for their staff.  I am confident that the new scheme will provide a valuable contribution towards the growing improvement in <Col N="1813" /> staff relations which the board are so anxious to foster.</P>
    <P>The pension scheme for general employees of the ESB also came into operation in 1943.  Persons who were more than 40 years of age on the date the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, was passed could get a supplementary allowance of up to 10 free added years for pension purposes.  Persons who were less than 40 years of age when the 1942 Act was passed and who were entitled to reckon only half their prior service for pension purposes have in recent years been pressing strongly for the grant to them of a similar concession. Representations have been made on a number of occasions by members of the Oireachtas.  The Government have reviewed the position in the light of the decision to reckon unestablished service in the Civil Service in full for pension purposes and have decided to amend the 1942 Act, to enable the under-40 group to claim credit for the whole of their prior service.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed in the Bill are in line with improvements in pension benefits elsewhere in the public service and I am, therefore, recommending the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no objection to this Bill.  It has been found necessary to introduce the Bill because of the continued growth and progress of the work of the ESB.  It is no harm that on an occasion such as this we, in the House, should remind ourselves and remind the public of the tremendous contribution which has been made by this State-sponsored body to the economic and social development of our nation. Nowadays, we tend to take the ESB for granted just as we take electricity for granted, so that very often there is no appreciation of the colossal strides that have been made by the ESB since their foundation in the 1920s.  It is only fair that we should put on record our acknowledgment of the tremendous work which has been put into the development of this organisation by ESB employees at all levels.  Those who are responsible for the running of this giant organisation deserve our greatest praise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> Now that we have reached the 1970s, when we are looking towards Europe, we might well recall the tremendous energy and foresight which was characteristic of the great men who pioneered the development of electricity in this country.  As a member of the Fine Gael Party, I take pride in putting on record our appreciation of the great work of two men in particular, one was my former distinguished colleague, Mr. Paddy McGilligan, and the other was Mr. Paddy McLoughlin. I have no doubt but that the Minister will agree with my sentiments in this regard.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this Bill arises logically from the growth and development of the ESB.  While looking over previous amending Bills in the Library last evening I noticed that each stage of the development of the board is on the records of this House.  For example, it is interesting to know that in 1960 the authorised capital expenditure of the board was £100 million; in 1963, under the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, this amount was increased to £160 million; in 1965 another amending Bill increased the figure to £225 million and the present Bill seeks an increase to £290 million.  Therefore, in one decade alone there is an increase from £100 million to £290 million. This is a threefold growth and is a remarkable performance.</P>
    <P>Of course, as was pointed out in the most recent annual report of the ESB and as the Minister pointed out in his speech, to meet both present commitments and future needs it is important that the flow of capital for the electricity supply industry be ensured.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, a considerable amount of forward planning is necessary and I, as a layman, can realise and appreciate the amount of forward planning that must be done in relation to this industry.  Therefore, it is obvious that capital is a vitally important factor in the development of the ESB and in the extension of the electricity network of the country.  Since their establishment, the ESB have made continuous progress and there has been an increasing demand for capital.</P>
    <P>Certain problems have arisen with <Col N="1815" /> regard to the financing of the ESB.  In referring to these problems the Minister has indicated that he cannot rule out the likelihood that, for as long as the present general financial position persists, further price increases will be unavoidable.  I got the impression that the Minister tended to slide through this question of finance for the ESB.  I have read in detail the most recent report of the board dealing with the whole question of capital.  This is spelled out in much greater detail than was given to us by the Minister but I assume that he took it for granted that anybody who would be interested in the Bill would take the trouble to read the annual report.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying to the debate he will give us some indication of what steps might be necessary in the light of present information in order to ensure that the capital requirements during the coming years of the ESB will be met.</P>
    <P>In the report of the ESB for 1968-69 I notice that the board's capital is running at the rate of about £20 million per annum.  The report makes the point that the continuing provision of funds to meet commitments is a major problem because of the world shortage of capital.  The report goes on to outline the general steps taken by the board in recent times to obtain additional capital.  They have obtained capital from many sources, from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and from Irish, German, Swiss and American bankers who are in a position to avail themselves of the financing arrangements in their own countries.  As the Minister pointed out, a very high rate of interest has to be paid in many cases.  However, this is the point on which I should like further clarification from the Minister.  It states here:</P>
    <P>A stock issue on the home market during the early months of this year was planned but had to be deferred due to the instability of international interest rates at the time.  Whilst the board is pleased to have succeeded in meeting immediate requirements, it is concerned at the prospects of securing sufficient long-term <Col N="1816" /> capital finance at a reasonable cost to its consumers.</P>
    <P>This is a very significant statement and it has serious implications.  It may well be that the Minister may have to come back to the House to seek further capital for the ESB.  I shall leave it to the Minister when he is replying to this debate to elaborate a little more on the likely financial requirements of the ESB over the next decade and also on the steps that may have to be taken to ensure that they will be able to press ahead with the tremendous programme that has been laid down.</P>
    <P>Looking at the figures for electricity sales in the last two financial years, for example, one can appreciate that this is a colossal growth industry.  In a breakdown of the sales figures for these two financial years one finds that industrial sales are up by 13.6 per cent, domestic sales by 13.3 per cent, and commercial sales by 9.1 per cent.  An interesting point I have noted is that there has recently been a growing demand for high-load capacity, the technical term for industrial users.  The ESB report points out that there are prospects for substantial development in the near future under this heading. With the growth of industrialisation in this country and the possibility of the establishment of major industrial concerns such as ore smelting which has been very much in the news of late, demand for electricity will continue to increase.  I understand that the proposed ore smelter will use electricity in what I think is a process of electrolysis.  I am glad the ESB are conscious of an increasing demand for electricity and are making plans to cope with it.</P>
    <P>The increase of 13.3 per cent in domestic consumption in 1968-69 over 1967-68 is very remarkable; in fact, as far as I can gather, it is one of the highest in western Europe.  There are obvious reasons for the increase in domestic demand for electricity.  People realise more and more the advantages of electricity for domestic purposes.  It is safe to assume that this demand will continue and we must also face up to the difficulties which may confront the board in the matter of raising adequate finance to meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> The Minister made reference to the possibility of utilising nuclear energy in the generation of power.  I understand it is the intention to set up a special board to examine this whole matter. The report says:</P>
    <P>The board has commenced the first stage of its nuclear development programme by sending the first team of engineers for training in nuclear technology to the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.</P>
    <P>Apparently these engineers will return and others will then go abroad.  The interesting point here is that it is probable that work on the first such station will commence in the mid-70s.  That is much nearer than most people realise. I for one was looking to nuclear development as something ten or 15 years away.  I believe this is a very expensive source of power and I am wondering if this does not present an ideal opportunity for cross-Border co-operation on the part of the two Governments in this country, a joint effort on the same lines as the Erne hydro-electric scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to turf stations, and the 1968-69 report reads:</P>
    <P>The fact that supplies of turf will continue to be available on the present scale for so many years ahead raises a special problem.  The board must now decide between a policy of heavy expenditure to maintain these stations for a very extended period and a policy of capital investment to install new and more efficient plant.  A detailed study of this problem is in hand.</P>
    <P>I presume this report was written at least some months ago and, perhaps, the Minister will tell us whether this study has been completed and, if so, what decision has been taken.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased also to note from my examination of certain reports and documents in relation to the work of the ESB that the board are very conscious of the need to ensure that the natural amenities of the countryside are not interfered with by the laying of cables, the erection of power stations and so forth.  It is also gratifying to note that there is close co-operation between the ESB and the Department of Local Government and that every <Col N="1818" /> effort will be made to ensure that there will be no unsightly developments which might spoil the natural scenic attractions of the countryside, which are so important nowadays from the point of view of the tourist industry.  It is imperative to ensure that scenic amenities are not ruined.  I understand high tension cables cannot be laid underground because of technical problems. I appreciate the position and I trust reasonable steps will be taken. An elaborate system of landscaping is being carried out at Turlough Hill in an effort to preserve the surrounding countryside in its natural state.</P>
    <P>Because of an alarming experience I had a couple of years ago I would urge the Minister and the ESB to educate the public not to tamper with electrical fittings unless they are qualified to do so.  The public must be made aware that even extensions of electricity supply to a farmyard should be carried out only by properly qualified people.</P>
    <P>While the rapid growth made by the ESB since their establishment has been very satisfactory there is one cloud on the horizon, which has become darker in recent years, and that is the question of industrial relations. In the annual report for the year 1968-69 it is stated that there were one official and 11 unofficial strikes in the ESB.  I do not want to lay the blame on anyone but I think the ESB should follow the example set by Aer Lingus, which is now an outstanding example of satisfactory industrial relations. I hope the investigations and inquiries which are taking place will bear fruit in the very near future so that harmonious relations can be established.</P>
    <P>The main point of this Bill is to make provision to increase the limit of authorised capital expenditure by the board.  As one who has been critical about the pensions paid in another State company under the aegis of the Minister's Department I am glad to see that steps are being taken in this Bill to improve the pension scheme and bring into it those who were previously excluded.  I agree with the Minister that the new benefits represent a considerable advance on those which applied formerly.  I am confident <Col N="1819" /> that this new scheme will help to improve staff relations.  The ESB are to be commended for their Christian and humane approach to pensions.  I only hope the Minister will do something about pensions in CIE.</P>

The pensions section of the Department of Finance is the only section I have not served in, so I am not an expert on pensions, but I know the way the pension scheme was worked.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Substantial improvements in the pension entitlements of manual workers have recently been negotiated between the board, the workers, and the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;recently&rdquo; can be interpreted in many ways, it could mean <Col N="1820" /> any time from 1943 to the present day. The Minister is just as well aware as I am about how long this has been going on.  The actuaries found the manual workers' pension fund to be in a surplus five or six years ago.  When actuaries find that a pension fund is in a surplus I can tell the House that the fund must be overflowing.  I must ask the Minister to allow me to look at the provisions in the Bill.  As discussions have been going on for so long I am sure a delay of a week or two will not matter at this stage.  I came across this when the more senior of the manual workers&mdash;men who were really technicians and who at that time, five or six years ago, were earning about £1,000 to £1,200 a year&mdash;retired.  Under the existing scheme they only got about a quarter, £250 a year.  This has now been rectified to give them half, which is what they were pressing for.  When some of these cases came before the Manual Workers Tribunal this was a subject of serious concern.</P>
    <P>Straight away I want to draw attention to section 3, which reads: &ldquo;...but excluding the first two years of such service&rdquo;.  As a person who has always sympathised with the underdog and as befits a person representing the Labour Party in this House, I want to ask why the first two years of service are excluded. If the Minister would take this phrase out of the Bill I would let him have all Stages tonight.  I suppose we must look over his head to the old lady in Merrion Street.  Do not mind the old lady in Merrion Street.  I remember on one occasion dealing with men who were in Ordnance Survey in 1916 and had lost their pensions.  There was a delay of 12 months while I was answering the late Deputy W. T. Cosgrave and assuring him that the matter would be dealt with tomorrow.  Then I suddenly woke up to the fact that the file was under the table in the pensions section of the Department of Finance.  I kicked it from under the table and kicked it through the two House of the Oireachtas all by my little self in about a fortnight and nobody said a word to me. If the Minister agrees to take this phrase out he will not get into trouble with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, or with anybody.  I am not being irresponsible in this because I am <Col N="1821" /> certain there is plenty of money in the fund.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom O'Donnell has said everything I want to say on this.  We all know the great significance of the coming of electricity to rural Ireland.  We remember children poring over their books at night by the light of oil lamps and I remember when I was a little fellow stepping into mud which went over my boots when I went outside the back door at night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks not on what is in this Bill but on what is left out.  I notice it is proposed to develop more power stations.  I regret that provision is not made for the further development of the ESB power station at Arigna.  This would involve using the large amount of what is referred to as &ldquo;crow&rdquo; or &ldquo;craw&rdquo; coal which exists there.  This problem is not new to the Minister.  He is well aware that a number of approaches were made, originally to the Department of Industry and Commerce and later to his Department, to have this situation investigated.  This was done but I was never fully satisfied with the conclusions that were offered to me.  I would urge on the Minister, now that the ESB and his Department are disposed to go into the further development of power stations, to go into this question of Arigna again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell has said, it is very difficult for a layman to understand the problems involved in the production of electricity.  At the same time when decisions are made on problems such as this they should be made in a manner understandable to us laymen. We were told at the time that the object was to produce 15mw and that this would involve the employment of 300 men; that it would take a halfpenny more per unit to produce electricity <Col N="1822" /> at Arigna from this coal than to produce it at Ringsend from oil and that this would represent a subsidy of £1,000 per man per year.  Those are colossal figures and no same person could urge on any Department to establish an industry in those circumstances. However, it has never been accepted locally that 300 men would be employed on this operation; and if there is this discrepancy between the number of men the Department say would be employed and the number which the local people think would be employed, there must be some discrepancy all along the line.  I would ask the Minister, his Department and the ESB to have another &ldquo;go&rdquo; at this problem.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that oil is cheaper but I asked a question here, at the time of one of the many crises in the Middle East, as to where we would stand if we had no supplies of oil from the Middle East.  My recollection is that the reply was not very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned co-operation between north and south. Everybody must go along with him on this, but here again a problem has struck me about this.  I understand that the position in regard to the line from Maynooth to Tandragee is that this provides electricity from either side when there is extra demand for it on the other side.  I have always felt that this extra demand will be made on the unit producing the cheapest electricity and I feel that this will militate against our turf-fired stations, where the costs of production are highest, and perhaps against our present coal fired unit in Arigna.  If at any time extra electricity is wanted, naturally the unit producing the cheapest electricity will be thrown into the grid.  Again, on that I have not got a satisfactory answer.</P>
    <P>It is probably unfair to ask the Minister to answer either of those questions now because they are outside the scope of the Bill and I am perhaps completely out of order, but I felt it was an opportune time to ask them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tom O'Donnell has dealt very ably with many of the points which I wanted to raise and I shall be very brief.  I should <Col N="1823" /> like to join with him in paying tribute to the ESB and its staff for their great achievements down through the years. I certainly appreciate very much the contribution they have made by the provision of electric light for homes and farmyards, electric heating and many other amenities.</P>
      <P>I had electricity installed long before the ESB was set up because I had to use engine driven dynamos in my business.  I had almost reached the stage of harnessing a river on my own land, and I might still do it for my own use if the price goes up.  Electricity was a great boon to the country. Refrigeration was a great problem in periods of slump for people engaged in my line of business, handling of fowl and exporting turkeys, lamb and other products.  There were no worthwhile refrigeration plants at that time.  That involved serious loss to the farming community.  We have gone more and more into production of carcase beef, lamb and chickens and the ESB have solved many problems for us.  There are hundreds of refrigeration plants throughout the country.  Beef and liquid eggs, for instance, could not be stored without them.  We are indebted to the ESB for providing them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell quoted a great many statistics.  He is almost as good as Deputy FitzGerald in that regard.  I will not bore the House with any statistics.  The ESB had not a completely free hand with regard to the installation of power stations.  In the case of Bellacorick in North Mayo I would say they were pushed or prodded into carrying out that work.  I am very glad that they were.  I will not go so far as to say that there were political reasons.  While I am sure it was not good economics it brought great social benefits to the area.  We must look ahead.  I am gravely concerned that, with the passage of time, the supply there may deteriorate to such an extent as to jeopardise employment in that region.  That would be the last straw. I would ask the ESB to see if it is possible to have hydro-electric schemes put into operation in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to read some time <Col N="1824" /> ago about the Turlough Hill scheme in Wicklow.  Wonderful things can be done today.  Similar schemes could be put into operation in the west where they are very badly needed from the point of view of giving stability to small towns and providing employment. I like the idea of diversification of plants.  If we have a nuclear station somewhere around Athlone a bomb can be thrown at it or someone put a match to it.  It is a great insurance policy to have power stations located at different points.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine why the gas-powered station is located in Dublin. We seem to be found of putting everything in Dublin.  It is also a good idea to have emergency equipment.  In my case it was necessary to have an emergency engine which could be used in case of break-down.</P>
    <P>People with the responsibility which the ESB have&mdash;and they are shouldering it in a wonderful and creditable way&mdash;will pay heed, I am sure, when I remind them that we in the west feel that hydro-electric schemes could be in operation there.  It might be possible to harness the River Moy, now that drainage work has been carried out, or other rivers.  It should be possible to store water for release when necessary.</P>
    <P>The proper location for the nuclear-powered station would be somewhere in the North Mayo region.  It would give employment there.  This evening the Taoiseach referred in passing to the problems of the west.  We hear many references to those problems but do not seem to be able to get any of these schemes located in the west.  Consideration should be given to the question of locating the nuclear-powered station in Mayo where it would be of great benefit from the point of view of providing employment and giving the people new heart and new life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Gibbons has a problem similar to mine, that is, the problem of rural depopulation.  I am well aware how serious it would be from the point of view of local employment if the Arigna power station were to go out of production.  I have not studied the economics of the Arigna station.  We have a turf-fired electricity station in north Mayo and the Minister is well <Col N="1825" /> aware of the benefits which accrued to Crossmolina and other areas.  I am pleading with the ESB to consider the Mayo region.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister and the ESB for their annual report.  It is a useful and valuable document.  I usually take the trouble to read it.  Great credit is due to the people who initiated the ESB schemes in the early days.  We have come a long way since then.  I remember some engineers who went into the employment of the board at that time and I was amazed at the progress they made, how they rose from the ranks to the very top.  We had to learn from the Germans and other foreigners because we had not the trained personnel.  We learned and developed.  It is impossible to estimate the contribution made by the ESB in terms of an improvement in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>We are an agricultural country.  The contribution the ESB have made in providing the power for refrigeration plants for the many thousands of tons of carcase beef, lamb and poultry is second only in importance to their contribution in providing electricity for our homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House has indicated by its welcome, this Bill is indicative of the economic and social progress made in our community in recent years.  As Deputy O'Donnell correctly pointed out, this measure which seeks to secure financial resources up to £290 million for the ESB, represents a three-fold increase in such capital requirements in the past decade. There is no better barometer of a country's social and economic progress than its rate of electricity consumption. In recent years we have in some cases doubled the demand for electricity per inhabitant in Ireland.  All the indications are that this trend will continue to develop in the 1970s.  The ESB, with very practical projects for extension of power facilities to 1974, have come forward with this request, showing detailed requirements involving the expenditure of £65 million.  It is to secure that necessary capital that this Bill is now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> There is tremendous confidence both at home and abroad in the ESB and in its progress from the capital point of view.  For instance, this was reflected on the Irish stock market in the successful ESB issue last month of £9 million.  Similarly, the World Bank, which apply the strictest international criteria when measuring a project in which they wish to invest, applied this strict criteria to the ESB and its structure.  They decided to invest £6 million, or 50 per cent of the total capital cost of the Turlough Hill project in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a number of matters regarding the recent ESB report.  I shall not echo the admirable praise he lavished on the ESB as I am sure we all agree with him, but he did strike a note of criticism regarding the unfortunate matter of industrial relations in recent years.  This was one of the reasons the ESB last September asked the international consultants, McKinsey &amp; Co., to work on a thorough examination of the entire structure and operation of the ESB, from board level, through management down to all levels of staff.  I was very keen on having this investigation carried out and had numerous discussions with the board of the ESB who were anxious to tackle the problem and get to the root of the trouble to remedy the matter of industrial relations.  I am glad that the report which was published last week has been well received both by the staff members themselves and outside people including trade unions, all of whom were concerned that there should be an improvement in labour relations.</P>
    <P>I share with Deputy O'Donnell the wish that the proposed reorganisation will ensure an easing of the labour relations situation.  Already the recommendations have been implemented by the board.  A general manager has been appointed, the functions of chairman and general manager have been separated; various sections or departments within the board have been assigned on modern management principles to labour relations, public relations and the commercial side.  The whole tenor of the report was that responsibility should be devolved as much as possible through this complex organisation <Col N="1827" /> in accordance with the most up-to-date techniques.</P>
    <P>However, the work does not finish with this preliminary report, important though it is.  It will continue for some further time and McKinsey &amp; Co. are going in detail into every aspect of the ESB administration with a view to applying this idea of greater responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donovan raised a point in regard to superannuation.  If the House will agree to give me all Stages of this Bill I can assure the Deputy that I will consider having an amendment moved in the Seanad to meet his point of view&mdash;possibly instead of &ldquo;the first two years of such service&rdquo; to say &ldquo;excluding the first year of such service&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Deputies have raised the question of the economics of the various turf-powered stations.  I should like to emphasise that originally these turf-powered stations, particularly the milled-peat stations, were quite favourable from the economic point of view.  However, reduced oil costs have made them less favourable.  In this sphere of balancing the turf development aspect with the power aspect there is a need, as Deputy O'Hara suggested, to balance the social and economic issues involved. A big employment factor is involved in turf production rather than in power generation <i>per se.</i> There is no change in Government policy in that respect; the policy remains to utilise our own resources to the maximum extent and to continue to do so.  The Government have given practical evidence of that recently in requesting the ESB to proceed with the erection of additional power facilities at Shannonbridge to utilise the western bog which stretches into South Roscommon and East Galway.  The board are proceeding with their plans for an extra power station there to use the remaining turf facilities available in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hugh Gibbons raised the matter of the Airgna power station. As Deputies are aware, this 15 mw station built in 1959 provides an outlet for the bituminous coal mined there. The proposal to which Deputy Dr. Gibbons referred is one to extend the power facilities in the Arigna area in order to utilise the low-grade coal which is in considerable supply there. There are technical difficulties involved because of the type of ash resulting from this low-grade coal.  There is the difficulty of getting boilers which would contain such ash.  That is one aspect of the technical problem involved. The economies of it also present a problem in that the production <Col N="1829" /> there would be about twice the cost of production in an oil-fired station.  There are both technical and financial difficulties.  I am naturally very keen on this development because it is in my own constituency.  I have had discussions with the Arigna collieries and we are having a complete re-examination of the whole matter.  At the moment I am awaiting a report.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful for the general welcome given to the Bill and I appreciate the remarks made about the ESB.  It has proved itself an excellent organisation.  As I said, it is at the moment having a very thorough look at itself, with the aid of international consultants, with a view to streamlining the organisation.  It is a very complex organisation and it is likely to become even more complex in the future with the development of nuclear power.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy O'Hara's view that we should use different power resources.  It would be a great mistake to depend on one particular source for power.  That is why we have moved on to a balanced development in this respect&mdash;oil-fired stations, coal-fired stations and turf-fired stations.  When it is warranted we shall have a nuclear energy station in the 1970s.  That will further diversify our power facilities. Location has not been decided but we will seek to locate it west of the Shannon. I share Deputy O'Hara's wish in that respect.</P>

      <P>Labhair an Teachta Herbert inné.  I nGaeilge a labhair sé ach ní raibh a fhios agam ag an am gurbh í an chaint a rinne sé a chéad óráid sa Teach so.  Óráid an-mhaith ab ea í agus dá bhrí sin deinim comhghairdeas leis.  Tá súil agam gur minic a bheidh an Teachta Herbert le cloisteáil againn sa Teach seo.</P>
      <P>I was not aware last night that the speech I heard from Deputy Herbert was his maiden speech.  I should have complimented him on it.  I apologise now for not doing so.  It was an excellent speech.  He spoke in Irish and I hope he will continue to speak in Irish in the future.  His contribution was a worthwhile one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald will, I think, go on record as having said more than <Col N="1831" /> anybody else on this very important subject of education, but I was very impressed with what Deputy Tunney said.  His father came from my own county and I think he must have passed on to his son a little of the Mayo touch.  Deputy Tunney certainly showed a grasp of the problem.  I understand he is a teacher.  He pulled no punches.  He was not afraid to tread on people's corns on such controversial items as salary and conditions. It would be worth the Minister's while and that of his officials to read Deputy Tunney's contribution because of its depth and the reasonableness of his approach.  If we could achieve the objectives set forth by Deputy Tunney and Deputy FitzGerald we would have a worthwhile educational policy.</P>
    <P>Last night I paid a well-deserved tribute to the older generation of teachers, both lay and clerical.  Lest it might be thought that I was a bit more generous on the clerical side as against the lay, let no one run away with the idea that the lay teachers in the past did not make a very important contribution to education.  They were out and about amongst the people.  They laboured in the face of great obstacles and difficulties.  Many of them had to walk long distances in the old days, sometimes five or six miles.  Later they had bicycles and later still they got cars.</P>
    <P>In the old days the teachers, and I have been a witness of this, cycled five or six miles to school on wet mornings, and stayed there until 4 p.m. or 5 p.m., helping their pupils in every way.  They had none of the modern aids like radio or television.  It was all hard work and they merit a high place in Heaven. They were really wonderful people and I have personal experience of it.  Out of meagre salaries and allowances they provided pencils, copybooks and on many occasions even food for the poor, and they could ill afford it.  I am not trying to take from the present generation of teachers but today there are social benefits and other things.  Maybe we protest too much.</P>
    <P>The Minister, referring to primary education, said that £25,258,000 was being spend on education this year, an <Col N="1832" /> increase of £796,000.  It is a slight increase but it is fortunate that it has been possible to provide it in this time of credit squeezes and financial difficulties. I should like to see the amount substantially greater but, of course, the Minister, like his colleagues, had to go to the Minister for Finance to bargain with him as hard as he could to get all he could for the various proposals put forward.</P>
    <P>I think that in the national schools in recent years&mdash;I have a good knowledge of them because there are a number near me&mdash;the children are getting far better opportunities to learn than in times gone by.  First of all, most of those schools in my area have central heating.  One may ask what that has got to do with education.  It has a lot to do with it.  So have proper toilet facilities and other such amenities, because when children are comfortable at school, when they are not shivering from the cold, they can learn much better.  Furthermore, electric lighting has been installed in practically all our schools and if the day is dark and a child has defective vision, the light can be turned on. These are all advantages from the children's point of view and I hope they will be continued and extended. However, as I have said, the increase of £796,000 does not seem sufficient. As I have said also, perhaps the Minister for Education was not able to persuade the Minister for Finance to give him more.</P>
    <P>A controversial subject in many areas is the closing of small schools. A former Deputy of the House, Deputy Calleary, went around with me to try to iron out this problem and we found it a very delicate and difficult operation. Very often we found that what I might call troublemakers in an area got whispering campaigns going.  They were people usually who had no children going to school themselves but, perhaps, they owned a local shop and had some vested interest.  God bless the chemists, if ever you meet one of those fellows you are in real trouble. It seems the mother occasionally sent a note with the child going to school to get some odds and ends and, therefore, the chemists had a vested interest. <Col N="1833" /> Deputy Calleary and I worked in co-operation as best we could because we considered it was to the advantage of the people in the area to put aside sentimentality, the grá-mo-chroí attitude, because the fundamental objective was to try to get good education for the children.  I am glad to say we were successful.  For instance, a school was closed within a mile of me and I did not hear a word of protest.  The school bus was provided and I was afraid the mothers would be out in front of it.  Not a word was spoken.</P>
    <P>I feel this is for the good of parents and children and far be it from me to lecture them on how they should educate their children.  I never go beyond giving a word of advice when I think it is needed.  According to the Minister's figures, which are useful because they show the way the pendulum is swinging, 724 schools were closed, 390 of them one-teacher schools and 307 two-teacher schools. I sincerely hope that some of the problems confronting parents, church authorities, teachers and so forth will be ironed out.  This is progress and I have seen it work in my area.</P>
    <P>It should be appreciated in this context that some of the older generation had greater ties with their national schools than may be the case today. Many of them may not have had the advantage of a good basic education. Many of them went to England and to America.  They came back and there was a lot of sentiment attached to the old school.  Now, however, many of them are getting around to the idea that in a central school there are more advantages to be gained for the children&mdash;more efficiency, better staffing arrangements, different teachers for different subjects.  People are beginning to realise that a lot of the changes taking place are worthwhile and in the long term are in the interests of the people, particularly the children.</P>
    <P>Recently there was to be a meeting with the Minister for Lands on the question of a local school.  It so happened that he was absent and I dealt with the problem myself.  It was a question of dealing with trivial problems. There was even a suggestion of closing the school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> I said that I could make a good political football out of this, and as a politician turn it to my advantage but I advised them that all this marching and protesting would not further their children's education.  I advised them to take up the matter with the Department. This was done.  I had only to throw a match to the powder and off it would have gone but instead they brought the matter to the notice of the Department and their reply was satisfactory. They were able to meet them and the expenditure involved was quite small.  Therefore it would be a good thing if somebody with an even temper and some influence in the locality would get in on these things and instead of being concerned with the vested interests of, say, the chemist or the local shopkeeper, point out that the all important thing was the education of the children and that a lot of good would come from the proposal.</P>
    <P>The idea of keeping record cards in respect of pupils in the fifth and sixth classes is very good.  It helps to keep parents, and the teachers in the next school, informed as to the aptitudes of the children concerned which is a very important point.  It is very important that at that stage &ldquo;tabs&rdquo; should be kept on a child when he goes to another school, whether it would be a vocational school or a secondary school, so that the teacher would have an idea of the child's capabilities.  Anyone who rears a family will know that children, even in the same family, have different aptitudes. One girl may like needlework and baking while another girl would find them abhorrent.  The same applies to boys.  It is very important that their aptitudes should be channelled in the right directions.  I know how unsatisfactory it can be if a young man finds himself in the wrong job.  I had a relative who started as a teacher but is now a dentist.  He spent four years teaching and he was glad to get out of it and, as I say, he is now practising dentistry.  Those four years spent as a teacher were lost to him and this was because his father pushed him into this profession which he did not want to pursue.  We have too much of that and the card system will do something to rectify the position.  It will benefit the <Col N="1835" /> child, the parents and the teachers in the new school which the child attends.</P>
    <P>No matter how good a school may be it is wellnigh impossible for a teacher, whether cleric or lay, to advance the child unless the parents are involved in education.  It is sad if parents are not involved and lack of involvement cannot be readily or easily compensated for.  Where parents are not really concerned or interested it is just too bad.  The parents' interest should be encouraged to a very great degree.  I hope that the Minister will be able to communicate this either on radio or on television to the parents and appeal to them to become involved for the benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with special courses for principal teachers in national schools and said that last year some 600 attended these courses and that he is optimistic that the figure will go up this year.  I regard this as progress which is very necessary.  The world is changing and we must change rapidly with it.  But while we may take note of all the new developments around us there are a great many old things to which we should cling.  I am referring in particular to our Gaelic culture and language and all such things.  It would be sad if, while we are developing, any of these wonderful things were lost in the process.  The question of compulsory or non-compulsory Irish has been raised.  Neither I nor any member of my family ever experienced any difficulty in learning the language.  It is a pity that parents in the main try to downgrade the language.  If you visit Germany you hear the people speaking German.  The people of every nation speak their own language.  I suppose certain agents from abroad like to downgrade our language but whenever I meet that view I give them their answer.  I am sure the Minister will do likewise.</P>
    <P>The question of career guidance is of great importance.  I have a first-class opportunity of observing this.  I know the parents and the children in my area and as I told the Minister last night three buses pass by my door every school morning going in different directions.  My children went to the <Col N="1836" /> local national school which is on the side of the Ox Mountains and in Foxford, the nearest town to me, there is a newly built secondary school; in Swinford a mile or two away there is another secondary school.  The school in Foxford is run by the Sisters of Charity and the school in Swinford by the Sisters of Mercy.  I am well aware that long before we got free education many of my neighbours paid the school fees of £10 or £12, which I suppose was a lot of money, and there was a sort of tradition that if the mother went to the Convent of Mercy in Swinford the daughter went there also.  I suppose this would apply throughout the country.  There are two first-class vocational schools, one in Swinford and one in Ballina, where according to my information you cannot get standing room.  I do not want to be critical but I do want to protest about the delay in carrying out the extensions to the Ballina school where the position is serious and were it not for the reopening of Corballa school in county Sligo which was able to take some of the overflow from Ballina, we would probably be reading about the position in our newspapers.  Many children could not be accommodated.  I would ask the Minister to see what can be done about providing the necessary extensions in Ballina.</P>
    <P>Swinford vocational school has made remarkable progress in recent years.  I speak on behalf of all the children in the area and not because a member of my family attends the vocational school there.  In this respect, I agree with Deputy Tunney's remarks. The children have made remarkable progress.  My son, who is attending the vocational school, passed his examination with honours.  That shows that if a child is given the opportunity of following his preference in respect of a school it can prove a great advantage because the child is happy when he goes to school in the morning.  I hope my son will sit for his leaving certificate. Next year, I expect that there will be from 20 to 25.  People have discovered that their thinking has in some cases been wrong.  They now realise that the education available in the technical school is not second-rate <Col N="1837" /> or third-rate but is suited to the requirements of the pupils.  Swinford has always been a centre in that respect.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, there has been emigration and migration from that area to Britain.  The majority of the people who went had no education beyond the primary school.  It would be an invaluable help to such young people who emigrate if they could receive training in a technical school before leaving this country.  They would be skilled workers, then, and would be able to take jobs other than digging, building construction and other unskilled occupations.  When a child leaves the technical school, every effort is made by the teachers to secure a job for him or her in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not wish my remarks to be construed as taking, in any way, from the magnificent work of the teaching orders.  I merely wish to draw attention to the very real benefits available through technical education for children who partake of it.  For instance, we are short of technicians.  We must provide work for our own people rather than import people from abroad for certain jobs.  I recall the appeal of a priest on television one night&mdash;I think he is at Shannon Airport&mdash;to those in charge of education to realise how necessary it is that our young people, before emigrating, should receive training in a technical or other school. He had noticed that, when workers were engaged on building sites, the Irish boys had the pickaxes and shovels.  When the white-collar workers came along, his congregation at Sunday Mass began to change: at that stage, the foreigners came.  He appealed to those responsible for education in Ireland to give our young people a new deal by changing the system.  Incidentally, he expressed appreciation of what was being done.</P>
    <P>Career guidance is very important. The choice of career is a decision which a person may have to live with for the rest of his or her days.  This has been the cause of many young people turning to drink.  They felt they were failures in life.  If young people are well-equipped educationally they can face the world courageously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> On the question of vocational education I wish to say something about our young girls.  This country earns over £90 million a year from tourism. More could be done to provide bettertrained personnel to staff hotels and guesthouses.  Many young girls study French and Latin.  That is all right, but these girls might be more suited to domestic economy training.  That is where career guidance could help in a big way.  Parents could also help because they understand their children. I am speaking from experience.  One girl in my family followed a domestic science career which other members would find repugnant.  In a family one girl may have a preference for domestic economy.</P>
    <P>We have the finest food in the world in this country.  Quite often in hotels one will find that due to bad handling the food is spoiled.  Recently in a town of about 6,000 people I stopped for a meal.  I had a steak which was not properly cooked or presented.  It cost me 15s.  I would not mind the price if the food had been handled properly. This kind of thing leaves a bad impression on people coming into our country.  Girls with an aptitude for hotel work should be encouraged to pursue a career in that line.  I am convinced there are jobs in hotels and guesthouses which would be better for the girls than having to emigrate.  We must also keep up nursing and teaching staffs.  If a girl wishes to become a nurse or a teacher she should be encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>More use could be made of television for educational programmes.  There are some educational programmes in the middle of the day and some on Sundays. If it were possible after consultation with the Minister, the parents' organisations and the teaching organisations, I should like further programmes to be shown at suitable times. Children are very fond of watching television.  It is a medium which could be used to their advantage.  It could prove a very suitable medium for improving the education of our children.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take particular note of a little storm which is looming on the horizon.  I know <Col N="1839" /> something about a little school at Behy near Ballina.  The parents in the region have got together.  People in and around this area near Ballina have traditionally sent their children to that school at Behy.  They are determined to continue to send them to that school.  When these people are determined they are used to digging their heels in.  Some of them are civil servants while others are business people or members of the farming community.  They had proposals at a rather advanced stage.  The local engineer or architect of the Office of Public Works in Ballina was dealing with this case.  I do not wish to mention the name of a reverend gentleman who is trying to press ahead for some action.  I would be glad if, at the earliest possible date, the Minister and his staff would pay particular attention to this case.  I gave the reverend gentleman an assurance that if I got an opportunity I would put down a Dáil question or raise the matter in the course of the discussion on this Estimate. I gave the parents an assurance that I would raise this matter.</P>

That is as far as I can go at the moment.  On Sunday night last I met the parents at a petrol filling station and I pleaded with them.  I told them they would get nowhere with the Department and that problems are not solved by protests or window breaking.  I told them they should take my advice.  I would be glad if something could be done to prevent a nasty situation arising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said in his opening remarks we are discussing the allocation of approximately £70 million towards the Estimate for his Department.  Our function here is to comment on the manner in which that money is allocated and to recommend, where we feel there should be recommendation, the best channels <Col N="1840" /> for development in education.  Normally&mdash;and it is particularly appropriate on Budget Day&mdash;one hears on every Estimate in this House and during every debate, demands for more money and in recent times we have had an indication from the Higher Education Authority of their estimate of the necessary expenditure in the universities over the next few years. There is always difficulty in reconciling the amount available with the demands which exist.  One can appreciate, particularly in the field of education which is not immediately productive and where one cannot see immediately the benefit of the investment, that the money available is not necessarily as much as one would wish.  Nonetheless, there is one thing on the figures alone which is very significant.  In the last ten years the investment in education in this country has been quadrupled.  Unless the money is being spent very foolishly and without any regard for positive planning and programming&mdash;and I do not think this is so&mdash;there has been an immense and complex development in the field of education.  The signs are that this development will not be retarded but, if anything, will continue on its course of almost self-propulsion.</P>
      <P>Our function, then, should be to ensure that we limit as little as possible the activities of those professionally involved in education.  Deputy FitzGerald, who made a very exhaustive contribution and who did some thorough research into the Estimate, adopted the wrong approach from the beginning when, in doctrinaire fashion, he said there were five clear objectives in any educational programme.  He said we must gear our plans to those five objectives, some of which at times cut across the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where he got those five clear objectives from, and secondly I do not think, looking at them, that they contain what any of us would want from any educational programme. An objective which comes immediately to my mind, one which Deputy FitzGerald did not include in his principal objectives, is the development of the human personality, what the Greeks <Col N="1841" /> called psyche.  To my mind that is the basic thing.</P>
    <P>The only reason I mention it is that I think we should not channel ourselves in education in the same way as we do in economics.  In education we cannot expect to realise an objective immediately.  It may take five or ten years.  However, we can see what the general direction of the programme should be.  We should try as far as possible to encourage those engaged in education to achieve the desired objective.  The start may be small.  In many spheres of education from inauspicious beginnings great progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Department of Education, in consultation with the national schools&mdash;and, I am sure, with the INTO who are concerned about it&mdash;introducing the system of record cards for pupils particularly in the fifth and sixth forms.  We may talk about autonomy in the universities, but we can also talk about autonomy for national teachers.  The answer, of course, is that none of them is entirely autonomous.  However, when this step is introduced and when these report cards come to be issued, they will be of benefit to parents, to teachers and to the secondary schools which these children will ultimately attend.  I regard this as a step of great importance.</P>
    <P>Of course, what is of greatest importance is the effective utilisation of our resources, the main one being the children themselves.  For too long, children after their primary education have gone to the wrong schools because of misconceptions on the part of their parents.  Deputy O'Hara spoke very effectively on this.  He said his son goes to a technical school, which is the kind of development we are trying to encourage, and the neighbours wonder if the family have come down in the world.</P>
    <P>I have a view, which is not confirmed and in respect of which I have not got much experience, that the people best equipped to find the direction in which the child should go are the teachers, in consultation with the parents.  The teachers are the people who spend most time with the children and they are the best fitted <Col N="1842" /> to advise both the parents and the children.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the Minister's approach to career guidance both in the secondary and in the primary schools.  Deputy FitzGerald suggested we should have fully qualified career guidance officers.  My reply to that is that the people best equipped to give career guidance are the teachers.  With a little extra training they can be competent in this field.</P>
    <P>Career guidance did not exist as a science ten years ago yet, according to Deputy FitzGerald, we should now set up a special department to deal with it.  I do not suggest, and I am sure the Minister does not, that three weeks' study of this subject is sufficient. However, it is a start.  Let us hope it will be two months in the following year and so on until such time as the teachers, who are the people most fully versed in the business of education, will have the necessary training to give career guidance and, if necessary, take a special class in this subject twice a week.  There should be no overlapping.  The children should be guided by people whom they know, and whom their parents know, rather than having the children reticently tell a few facts to an outsider.</P>
    <P>It is important that the money spent on education is used effectively.  From my experience there has been too much bias towards what is called academic education.  It is academic in the broad sense.  Too many people are allowed to come out of the secondary schools with a pass leaving certificate and to wander about aimlessly &mdash;even in recent times when job opportunities were there.</P>
    <P>This is the opposite of what the position should be.  If anybody has to wander it should be the employers looking for suitable trainees, whether it be in the field of management or in the technician field.  This trend has been arrested somewhat but not sufficiently. We must try to ensure that young men like Deputy O'Hara's son will be directed to the right schools. The old system must not be tolerated any longer.</P>
    <P>One finds in a debate on education that it is hard to maintain a reasonably <Col N="1843" /> coherent and consistent line of thought.  I began to speak on national schools, digressed for a moment to secondary schools and from that went on to career guidance.  Now I wish to refer briefly to rationalisation in the national schools.  I cringe when I hear people suggest that this is part of a strange idea of somebody in the Department who has a wish to kill rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is important is that a school should be recognised for what it is, the centre of education.  It may also be a community centre but that should be a secondary consideration.  It is for that reason that so many people have looked on the school as they might look on their local creamery or the local garda station as being part of the community.  There has been resentment in some instances but all that is changing. Who can deny that a child would be more comfortable in the bigger and better school, because some of the old ones are anything but comfortable? The conditions in some of these old schools were probably detrimental to the health of both teachers and children. I regret that some of these old schools are still in existence but they are very few.  Such conditions are more likely to prevail in a small school where there may be an indolent manager or where extra expenditure may not be warranted, rather than in a big school where the extra expenditure will be warranted and where pressure from parents and teachers will ensure that work is carried out more expeditiously. The Minister and his Department must deal and will deal with these priorities and ensure that improvements are carried out where necessary so that we will not have a situation in which those who are fortunate will enjoy proper conditions and facilities while others will not. Teachers, and particularly women teachers, fall ill so we must aim at having a constant pattern.</P>
    <P>On the question of rationalisation another factor in a three- or four-teacher school is that the teacher can do the job for which he was educated and trained, namely, the education of children rather than have to spend his <Col N="1844" /> time in controlling the children.  On this question, I have sympathy for some national schoolteachers.  While I do not accept the British ratio as being absolutely desirable, the ratio aimed at in universities there would appear to be one tutor to eight undergraduates, according to Deputy Dr. FitzGerald. This leaves one with a sense of awe on realising that some national schoolteachers here are probably teaching 30 children at a time.  At least, I understand that the average is 30 children per class and this means that there may be even more.  Of course, this imposes a restriction on any educational programme and it is for that reason that I am glad to see a change in the position.  This change is being effected by the Minister and his Department. I hope that one of the results of this change will be that children, when they leave national schools in rural Ireland and commence their post-primary study, will not be retarded by comparison with their counterparts in urban or city areas as hitherto they have been.  This, of course, did not stem from any fault of the teachers.</P>
    <P>My own experience has been that children who came to us at the age of 13 or 14 from primary schools in rural Ireland took some little time to catch up with their counterparts in the town who were then 12½ or 13. It was obvious that there was no basic difference in their learning capacity. In fact, they probably had a greater intellectual capacity because of the environment in which they were brought up but their development was impeded to some extent and they did not reach the full flush of their educational promise for about three years after leaving the rural national school.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald spoke at length on the question of age of entry to secondary schools.  I share his views on this matter.  Perhaps there are reasons for the age restrictions but the important thing is that if a child has the educational capacity and the personality to proceed to secondary school nothing should hold up his development in that regard.  Is this restriction imposed because the child at 15 or 16 <Col N="1845" /> is too young to enter the Civil Service or because of the age of entry to the university?  If the latter is the case, the minimum age for entry to the university should be reduced.  What is so sacrosanct about age that it should concern us so much?  It is not such a sacrosanct factor in most European countries.  If we are fortunate enough to have some boys or girls who mature earlier than others we should ensure that their talents will be made available to the country with the least possible delay.  It is for that reason that I support Deputy FitzGerald's view on this matter.  It seems to me to be a rather officious restriction.</P>
    <P>The school transport system ensures that children in rural Ireland are now going to school two years younger than used to be the case when children had to walk, maybe, three miles to school. They now start at four years instead of at six years.  This will also help to compensate the children of rural Ireland for any lack of opportunity they might suffer by comparison with their city and town counterparts while, on the other hand, compensating for any lack of opportunity on the part of city children by comparison with their rural counterparts.  For instance, biology, zoology and nature study should be taught to a greater extent.  Children in the country get lectures of a very enlightened type on botany and perhaps it would be a good step to provide similarly for city children.</P>
    <P>I am greatly encouraged by the changes that have occurred in schools, the practical things, the encouragement of observation in students of every level, from shells at the seashore to everything else.  This must continue to be encouraged.  What we shall be developing is the whole personality, the whole man.</P>
    <P>There is another facility that did not exist very much in my time, that is, an adequate library, which should be available in primary schools, indeed in every school.  In regard to the secondary schools I would recommend past pupils associations to follow the example given by some that I know and with whom I am associated, to donate some of their most suitable types of reading material &mdash;let others be the judge of what would <Col N="1846" /> be suitable&mdash;to the libraries in the various schools.  In some ways this would effect a saving and would also help to ensure a positive association between these organisations and the schools themselves.</P>
    <P>The same opportunity does not arise in national schools.  There is some provision in the Estimate for libraries in national schools.  As regards various types of committees, vocational committees and library committees, I have a suspicion, confirmed by experience, that there are people on these committees who have neither the interest nor the knowledge to act on them, apart from times when they are campaigning and wish to have it to say they are members of so many committees. The provision of suitable libraries is a vital and complex business and I would make this plea that those who are on committees and have not an active interest should get off them as quickly as possible and leave it to those who have.  I have known teachers who were frustrated by the fact that they could not get library facilities for their school.  If there was an effective library committee they would ensure that the teachers who wanted libraries would get them.</P>
    <P>In these days when there is so much mass-media influence it is more important than ever to teach children how to read, how to assimilate what they read and how to accept or reject&mdash; and sometimes rejection is at least as important as acceptance&mdash;things that are said on the mass-media or appear in print.  Because things are read in the newspapers they get the authority of permanence.  Only today we have seen in one of the evening papers how fallible print can be.  When something is said on television it has the aura of absolute gospel.  This is happening around the country.  I am hoping our children will read more widely and develop a power of questioning what they read, so that anything that is printed in the newspapers or said on television will not just be accepted immediately as being the gospel.  This will lead to an enlightened society, and that is what education is all about.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would recommend to the Minister to encourage the provision <Col N="1847" /> of library facilities in primary and secondary schools.  I would also suggest to the teachers, to both the ASTI and the INTO, that they make strong claims and use strong pressures to ensure that adequate library facilities are made available in schools. Without a broad base of information in education, education in the sense we understand it might in the long run be a useless or even a dangerous weapon.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed to hear that while in the last three years there has been an increase of 41,000 in our secondary school student population, some of our schools are not availing of the special grants for science laboratories and various facilities of that sort.  It is at the beginning of the secondary school that this problem of the last few years has arisen, because education in the primary schools was always available under the Constitution; it is only in the last few years that secondary education has been subsidised by the State and in many cases provided free. It is regrettable that these grants to which the Minister referred in his speech, which if not a lengthy speech, was a very comprehensive one, are not being availed of.  Is it that so many of those engaged in secondary education are still determined to cling to the old ways, are still determined to turn out these boys and girls with a pass leaving certificate when the whole emphasis is now on adaptability and achievement in particular fields?  If this is so I am sure it is they who will be the losers.  I would encourage the Minister to go a little further than just offering inducements to the technological side.  If this trend continues for some time he will have to take what will be essential if, perhaps, unpopular steps and wield the axe in regard to further grants for certain accommodation in secondary schools.  Let us be blunt about this: the money is limited, must be limited, and we must see it is used in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is a suspicion I have that the technical colleges are not being availed of.  If this is so it is a national disgrace.  These are the launching pads for a new era, the launching <Col N="1848" /> pads that will bring people eventually towards technical and business advancement. Let me say in passing I was particularly thrilled that in the Limerick area, embracing North Tipperary, which I represent, a third level institute to meet modern demands is to be established.  This third level institute must not be a repeat of the facilities provided in other universities. However much we would like a university, with all its trappings, in our own area the important thing is to provide institutes to cater for present needs.</P>
    <P>A school of business administration is very badly needed.  If Limerick wants a third level institute a school of business administration, or something like it, should be set up there.  Every single major town in America has a business school but we have not one here. Rathmines is doing a very good job, such as it is, but it is not a school of business administration.  If we intend to sell to Europe people will have to be properly trained in business administration, because unless we have skilled market research people studying the latest developments and the newest sales techniques it will be like trying to sell wigwams to Indians.  We shall have to make real efforts to provide business administration courses. Schools of business administration should be set up in all our major cities and the sooner it is done the better it will be for our economy.  There are many schools of business administration on the Continent which teach people how to exploit markets with products inferior to those we would be putting up for sale.</P>

      <P>The business administration course in UCD is a very advanced one.  I want courses for salesmen.  When we say that we shall be able to sell to the French and Germans in the Common Market are our salesmen going to try to sell our goods in English or will they be able to speak in the native tongue?  I know the Labour Party have no enthusiasm for Europe anyway but if we are going to sell to another country we have to speak their language.  I am not talking here about high science; I am talking about practical things.  This is obviously a matter which needs immediate consideration.</P>
      <P>Education is such a wide field that those of us who are interested in it could speak <i>ad nauseam</i> about it.  One of the important things about education is that we should have a comprehensive and planned programme at every level and co-operation between every level whereby the secondary school would be in communication with the primary school and between them they would determine the appropriate level of entry to secondary school.  Similarly, the to secondary schools would be in communication with universities and the third level institutes and vocational schools would be in communication with schools of technology so that between them they could decide the appropriate curricula and the appropriate entry standards.  In my view there is no such thing as a particular standard for a particular level of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald said that university autonomy should allow universities <Col N="1850" /> to determine absolutely the standard of entry but I categorically disagree with this if it is meant to be taken as it was said.  I do not think anyone taking a broad view about education could accept that universities should be able to determine absolutely the standard of entry.  In fact, universities should be allowed to advise on the appropriate standards in secondary schools, and I would like to commend those universities who have done this and ask those who have not done so to be reasonable about this.  I have the same regard for university lecturers as I have for primary, secondary and vocational teachers.  I remember at one university hearing an academician say that because he was an academician he had a special right of free expression.  In my view he had no more right than a national school teacher.  If university autonomy means that a university will cut itself off from other streams of education then I am against it but if it means communicating with the other spheres of education then I am all for it.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Deputy FitzGerald that I am all for the security of tenure which he was talking about because this will mean that university staffs can actively contribute to the welfare of the university by expressing their own view, even if it is an unpopular view.  I am all for giving everybody, at every level, the same security.  It is probably fair to say that this security of tenure is less characteristic of the university than it is of any other group.  The other organisations will, I think, take up the cudgel for bad teachers and sometimes there are bad ones, even though they are limited in number.  When I say &ldquo;bad&rdquo; I mean ineffective teachers. I hope that the Minister will at least sympathetically answer what Deputy Dr. FitzGerald spoke about, security for university staff, and that some system of appointments will be arranged which will ensure this type of security.</P>
    <P>May I say, in conclusion, that I see education and its limits not as being three, four or five channels clearly defined in a doctrinaire fashion.  I see it on the broad basis where one level <Col N="1851" /> shares with the other the responsibility for the total programme.  I hope that this Estimate will lead, as Estimates, in the last few years particularly have led, towards further development and that this time next year we will be spending still more money and that, if we are spending one-fifth as much money next year, we will be making twice as much progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not propose to make a comprehensive speech on this Estimate but there are a few matters which I should like to deal with.  In the first place I want to say, without hesitation, that very considerable progress has been made in the field of post-primary education in the last few years.  It would be anything but gracious to say otherwise. There are people who would complain that the new post-primary education scheme came into operation too quickly and before either the buildings or the teachers were available to operate it.  With that I do not agree. I feel that the late Minister for Education was right to push it on immediately because if we had waited until everything was ready, until we had the buildings and the teachers, I am afraid it would not be in operation yet or for a number of years to come.  Indeed free post-primary education did not come a minute before its time and while I give credit where credit is due it must be said that this was one of the last countries in Europe to avail of such a scheme and that the children of this country were entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Free post-primary education has brought with it teething troubles as was to be expected.  One of them that strikes me as something that should be eradicated is an apparent conflict between the various educational establishments. Indeed it could be described as more than a conflict; it might be described as something like an unseemly war, between the traditional secondary schools and the vocational school committees. That is a bad thing.  The duty of the vocational education committees is to provide secondary and post-primary education where it is not otherwise available.  At the moment the vocational schools are apprehensive <Col N="1852" /> lest they be gobbled up by the traditional secondary schools and the secondary schools are fearful that colossal vocational schools will be built on their doorsteps and that they will be gobbled up.  The Minister should set up some sort of machinery or use his good offices to have friendly consultation between the various interests that I am talking about and see that duplication is avoided because if there is duplication there will be waste of effort and waste of money.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be able to tell the Minister how this atmosphere that I am convinced exists can be dissipated and how the problem can be solved but I want to let him know&mdash; I am sure he does know&mdash;of its existence and to suggest to him that it is his duty and that of his advisers to try to get rid of it.  I am afraid this tug-of-war is going on, not alone between the managements of the various institutions, but also between the teachers, and there is canvassing for pupils and allegations that catchment areas are designed to be injurious to one school or another and that trespass and poaching and all sorts of things are going on.  This is probably one of the teething troubles of a new scheme but it should be tackled now because when this attitude is abroad unnecessary buildings may be erected and if the problem is tackled this may be avoided.</P>
    <P>I am and have been for many years, since I was associated with a vocational education committee, a great believer in the idea of the comprehensive school.  I believe that all students should have an opportunity of deciding whether they want to earn their living by their heads or by their hands.  There are probably far more happy technicians in the world than happy people who pursued solely academic education and were forced into &ldquo;pen-pushing&rdquo; jobs.  When I say that there should be co-operation between the traditional secondary schools and the vocational schools, I mean if one is to take over the other both types of education should be available.  It is an undoubted fact that down through the years the traditional secondary schools provided the only form of post-primary education that was available <Col N="1853" /> and provided it in many areas at the minimum cost.  If they had not been there there would not have been half the education there was.</P>
    <P>The question of residential scholarships is something which affects my constituency.  It is not possible to offer day schooling to all students because of distance.  In mountainous or isolated districts it is not possible to provide day education.  When a case is made in that respect the Minister should be generous about residential scholarships and should meet parents who cannot, without great hardship, send their children to day schools.  When dealing with residential scholarships it might be pertinent for me to mention the case of Church of Ireland students who are dealt with by way of a blanket grant which is given to a committee of the Church of Ireland and churches other than the Catholic Church to administer themselves.</P>
    <P>I know that <i>per capita</i> these Protestant students are getting more than it would cost if they went to a convenient day school but because they want to go to their own denominational schools, they are dealt with by what I call a blanket grant and the scheme is operated through a commission. The net effect is that, while it is costing the State more, the parents have put their hands in their pockets and put up some money.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what I am trying to show better than I have said it, perhaps, I will quote from a letter I got. I will not read it all because it is confidential.  I will read the part that will clarify what I am trying to say. It is from a Protestant parent and says:</P>
    <P>It has just been announced that fees for day pupils attending Protestant schools in my area are being increased by £21 to £101 per annum as from next September.  The maximum grant under the free, post-primary education scheme which, as you know, can only be obtained after passing a rathor humiliating means test amounts to only £40. Thus the poor parent has to find £60 per child to bridge the gap. Some, of course, can get relief <Col N="1854" /> through scholarships, etc. but the majority can get no such relief and, indeed, some who would be entitled to relief feel the tests involved are offensive.</P>
    <P>That is a problem to which the Minister should direct his attention. Before I got this letter I had a case in my own constituency where a parent considered he was entitled to a residential grant but the board operating held that he was not.  He could not be said to be poor but he could not be said to be a wealthy man. That is another of the teething problems of this new scheme with which the Minister should deal.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I want to say about the new, free, post-primary education scheme.  The other points I want to mention are just a few miscellaneous points that struck me. There is the transport scheme which serves the secondary schools and in some instances the primary schools.  It sometimes happens that the school bus passes some children who, for some technical reason or another, are not allowed to be collected.  It may be that they are just inside the three mile area, or it may be that it is held that they should be going to one school instead of another.  If the Minister can, without doing violence to the regulations, he should try to be as flexible as possible in this matter.  We all come across incidents&mdash;I just cannot bring them to mind at the moment&mdash;and complaints from parents which we can understand but which are utterly impossible to explain to the parents.  I appeal to the Minister to be as flexible as possible.</P>
    <P>The next point is the conditions in the primary schools.  Some of them are a disgrace.  The toilet facilities and the conditions of the toilets attached to some primary schools are a positive disgrace.  We have inspectors of hygiene of one kind or another in our towns.  Local authorities have health inspectors inspecting the people who serve cups of tea and inspecting hotels and lodging houses and boarding houses.  There should be some inspectors who would see to it that the toilet facilities attached to primary schools are properly maintained.  Perhaps it is <Col N="1855" /> only at the time of by-elections that these toilet facilities are brought to our attention.  They would open your eyes and close your nostrils.  At least minimum standards should be maintained in them.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Irish language I agree with Deputy O'Hara and others that we should preserve our national language and our national culture.  Everybody of my age and younger should be able to converse in Irish without any trouble, but the solid and the sad fact is that we cannot. Indeed, people in their early twenties will tell you: &ldquo;Oh, I can understand what they are saying but I cannot talk it.&rdquo;  Without starting any controversy or political argument about it, the reason is that the system of reviving the Irish language has failed, and I do not think the most enthusiastic lover of the language would not concede that.</P>
    <P>The great percentage of people of 25, 30 or 40 years and up to my age, without disclosing any State secrets, should be able to come in here and converse in Irish if they had any interest in it, because we all had an opportunity of learning it at school. Most of us got secondary education and, when we were turned out into the world, we had a sufficient knowledge of the language to be able to conduct an intelligent conversation through it, but the fact of the matter is that we had not sufficient interest in or love of the language to do so.  That does not go for any political party; it does not go for any particular section of the community; it goes for about 95 per cent of the people I am talking about.</P>
    <P>If the language is to be revived, if it is not to be lost, some genius will have to come along with a suggestion as to how it can be revived.  I will throw out one for what it is worth. I believe that, if you create an atmosphere in this educated age, in this age when people are so interested in education, where Irish people would not regard themselves as educated unless they could carry on a conversation in Irish, then we would succeed. How are we to do that?  I do not know.</P>

That was the method which was adopted.  There was more time devoted to Irish and there was more of the stick devoted to it.  Since the State was founded that has done a lot of harm. It created an antagonism to the language.  Probably everybody left school and gave three cheers and said: &ldquo;Now I will not have any more trouble about Irish&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am trying to be helpful.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary thinks the revival of Irish has succeeded; maybe he thinks the methods that have been in operation for the last 40 years have been successful.  If that is the case he <Col N="1857" /> will find himself in a minority of one. The great lovers of the Irish language will have to concede that the effort to revive the language has been a failure. I should like to hear from the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary some way by which it might be successfully revived.</P>
      <P>Somebody on the Fianna Fáil benches yesterday evening seemed to think that there was something to be said for physical punishment, even in vocational schools.  I do not think this is so.  When I was in secondary school I remember there were some teachers who had perfect control over their classes without using a cane and the students responded very well to them. However, there were other teachers who had less control over their classes.  The students had much less respect for them and invariably one found that the latter group of teachers were the ones who resorted to the use of the cane. Any teacher who has to resort to physical punishment is failing in his job and is certainly not a good teacher.</P>
      <P>Reference was made today to the question of accidents occurring in schools.  I think the Minister replied to a Parliamentary question today and said that the insurance against accidents was a matter for the manager. Accidents occur at school that would not be covered even by insurance, because to succeed in a claim against a manager or the teacher under an insurance policy one must prove that the buildings were defective or dangerous or that there was not proper supervision.  It is comparatively easy to establish whether the building was defective or dangerous but it is extremely difficult to prove that there was not proper supervision.  The general test is: was the teacher doing what a normal prudent parent would do?  I throw out the suggestion that there should be some compulsory form of insurance to cover at least the expense in which parents might be involved in such accidents at schools, whether there was anybody to blame or not.  A scheme similar to that of the voluntary health insurance might be applied here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point I should like to deal with is the recognition of English-trained teachers as primary teachers here.  I have a couple of cases at the moment <Col N="1858" /> where ladies trained in very good schools in England have come home here, have got married and want to become primary teachers.  I know they can become primary teachers subject to their doing oral Irish and singing. The people I am speaking about have no objection to doing oral Irish but one of them is completely unable to sing, and she would find this qualification impossible to fulfil.  I do not think that the question of singing for ladies teaching in primary schools is the important and indispensable qualification it might have been formerly. In the old days there were many two-teacher and indeed one-teacher schools.  In the one-teacher school if the teacher could not teach singing that was the end of it; in a two-teacher school if the man could not sing the lady teacher had to be able to sing and then singing was a compulsory qualification.  However, with the abolition of small schools and the establishment of central schools with four teachers it is most likely that one teacher will be able to teach singing. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to drop the subject of singing as a qualification for teachers who have come back from England and want to settle here.  He could make it a condition that such a teacher would not get employment in a school unless there was some other teacher there available to teach singing.</P>
    <P>I have a final parochial point I should like to raise regarding a new technical school in Cavan and a reconstruction job at Belturbet.  These plans have been in hand for some time and there appears now to be a delay in dealing with them.  I do not think these two schools I have mentioned should be affected by the most recent credit squeeze or the recent re-adjustment of the planning programme as they have been at the planning stage for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the Minister very long.  I am intervening because I have been asked to convey to the Minister that, although he may not be aware of the fact, he dropped a bombshell in parental circles when he announced he was increasing university fees by 25 <Col N="1859" /> per cent.  Parents should have been made aware of this beforehand.  Perhaps the Minister may not know it, but in the average family where the parents intend to send their children to university a certain amount of long-term planning is called for.  The Minister should also consider that those who live in country districts&mdash;I admit they would be the minority of people attending universities&mdash;are already incurring very heavy expense.  In many cases they probably had to make arrangements with the banks&mdash;not a very easy thing to do nowadays&mdash;to obtain the funds necessary for their children's education.  They now find themselves having to pay the extra 25 per cent increase in fees.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not make it clear when he made the announcement whether this was going to become effective immediately or whether it will be left until after the summer recess. I should like to suggest to the Minister that he would consider that anybody who is already at university should be allowed to continue on the basis of the fees that apply at the moment.  It costs approximately £500 a year to educate a student&mdash;that is anybody living outside the university centre.  If you add another 25 per cent to this it will be realised that there is a considerable imposition on the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all this talk of free education we should not forget that there are a number of poor people who live in Dublin, Cork, Galway or wherever the educational facilities exist who are barely able to educate their children. This extra 25 per cent will cause considerable hardship.  I know the Minister has already interviewed students and told them there is nothing he can do about the matter.  I do not know if he has been in contact with the parents but I am intervening in this debate to put forward the case for the parents. This has been a gaffe of the first order and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the decision.  He should not make any increase whatever for those already studying and if he applies this new scale he should wait until the beginning of the next academic year, which is the autumn.  By doing this any person then <Col N="1860" /> entering university will know exactly where he stands.</P>
    <P>The transport scheme requires examination.  A great many people believe there should be no differentiation. All should be entitled to the same privileges.  That sounds fine but, very often, when one tries to apply socialistic principles, one hits hardest the very people one does not intend to hit. Unless a child lives two miles from a school he is not entitled to free transport. I know several instances of working-class people with quite large families living just under two miles from the nearest primary school.  These children are not entitled to free transport. In the same area the children of well-off farmers are transported free because they live over two miles from the school.  I suggest that the Minister should take another look at the scheme. Some amendment could be introduced whereby those who are able to pay would pay a small amount.  That would enable everyone to benefit from the scheme.  The need to write repeated letters to the Department trying to get free transport for some child will no longer exist because everybody will be entitled to transport.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of transport available to secondary schools. There is one type of child for whom I would make a particular plea.  I refer to the mentally handicapped.  It is highly desirable that free transport should be provided for mentally handicapped children to the nearest school for this particular type of child. There is a problem in my area.  We have a school for moderately handicapped children.  It is proving very successful.  There is a regulation that one may transport children only a certain distance to such school.  I think the distance is 18 miles.  To my knowledge there is no other school for moderately handicapped children within a radius of 40 miles.  It is no good asking the Minister to open other schools because he will not do that.  The ratio of mentally handicapped is too low to warrant the opening of several schools. It would not be an economic proposition. On the other hand, providing transport over a distance of 25 miles would be a simple solution to the problem in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> Again, on the question of transport, the buses travel on the main roads. That may not be the fault of the Department.  Transport arrangements have, as far as I know, been handed over to CIE.  With all due respect to CIE, if it is possible to make an unutterable mess of transport, then CIE will do it.  The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary must have had innumerable letters about children who have to walk half a mile or three-quarters of a mile in order to pick up a bus on a main road.  Surely a little liberalisation is possible.  Such liberalisation would be beneficial to the children.</P>
    <P>There is another point upon which I should like some clarification.  There are schools listed for improvement and extension.  There is a priority list.  At the moment there is something in the neighbourhood of 80 rural primary schools needing extension or re-building. There are a great many schemes on foot for the closing of two-teacher schools.  This policy has been very strongly resisted.  It may be good policy to centralise schools but it is foolish to close two-teacher schools when the funds are not available for the extension of existing schools.  Not so long ago in County Wexford there was a scheme on foot to close the Ballinafad school.  The parents resisted that; so did the manager.  The school was left open.  About a year later it was discovered that an extension would have to be built to the school in North Wexford to which it was earlier proposed to transfer the children from the Ballinafad school.  The position now is that this school cannot even cater for the pupils in its own area. Until such time as the Minister is in a position to add the requisite extensions or build new schools it is puerile to talk of closing schools, be they two-teacher or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have spoken about career guidance.  With the large advance in secondary education great numbers are now getting the leaving certificate.  I am sure Deputies get letters from constituents saying their children have passed the leaving certificate and there are no jobs available for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> It is not the function of the Department of Education to secure employment for people but if we are going to turn out the finished product in greater numbers it is time something was done to deal with that problem.  I suggest, therefore, as part of career guidance the Department should get in touch with secondary schools responsible for turning out these large numbers of qualified students so that something will be done to find employment for them rather than have them a financial loss to the country as a whole.  I am sure the Minister knows, as I do, that many of these students when they have finished and when they answer every conceivable advertisement unsuccessfully, end up by emigrating to Britain where they can get into banks straight away and command fairly good salaries.  There is no use in educating more people unless we are able to absorb them into our economy.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked some questions in regard to the examination in oral Irish. I believe the idea of this examination was to get people to speak Irish as against learning it in an academic way. I was told that 21,093 students were examined last year and that there were 262 examiners who were paid £5 daily or a maximum of £30 which makes the total cost of the oral examination £9,000 to the State.  If oral Irish is intended to make people speak Irish&mdash; I do not know if it is successful or not &mdash;I respectfully suggest to the Minister that money could be better spent by sending a few hundred people to the Gaeltacht to learn to speak the language there.  That is the only way one learns to speak a language.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to education in regard to the Common Market.  All the talk on the Government's side is to the effect that we are on the doorstep of the Common Market.  I do not know if there is any plan to mould our educational system into alignment with the requirements of membership of EEC.  The Minister and I were at Strasbourg together.  He speaks Irish and, as he knows, I speak some European languages, not as well as he speaks Irish but at least I was able to find my way about in Europe. If we get into the Common Market <Col N="1863" /> what we need is what every European has: two or three languages.  I should like to know what plans the Department have to meet that situation.  This is one of the outstanding problems that the Department should be thinking and planning about day and night because we shall be at a tremendous disadvantage if we go into the European Community without a good knowledge of European languages.  I do not think we shall be in it for a good many years yet but if we do go in we must plan things so that we shall be able to talk and bargain with the people concerned.  You can only drive home your point if you can speak their language.</P>

Thaispeán na Teachtaí uilig go raibh suim acu i gceisteanna an oideachais agus gurbh é an rud ba mhó a bhí de dhíth orthu ná cuidiú a thabhairt chun fadhbeanna an oideachais a réiteach. Is maith an ní é seo.  Sílim go mba cheart ceist an oideachais a scarúint ó chúrsaí polaitíochta.  Sílim freisin gur theaspáin na Teachtaí uilig, cé is moite de chúpla duine, go raibh suim mhór acu san oideachas agus ins na páistí agus go raibh sé de dhíth orthu an córas oideachais is fearr a dtiocfadh linn a bheith againn sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>B'fheidir gurab é an rud is fearr domsa a dhéanamh i dtús ama ná labhairt fá dtaobh de cheist na Gaeilge. Ba cheart dom is dócha a insint cad iad na fáthanna go rabhamar ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a athbheochaint, an fáth go raibh an polasaí againn, na haidhmeanna a bhí againn, an dóigh in a dtiocfaidh leis na scoileanna cuidiú leis an athbheochan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is fearr dom i dtús ama labhairt fá na fáthanna go bhfuilimíd ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a athbheochaint.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá an Ghaeilge againn sa tír seo le corradh le dhá mhíle bliain agus sílim go n-aontódh achan duine go mbeadh sé millteanach sa lá atá inniu ann ligint don Ghaeilge dul i léig.  Ní hé amháin go bhfuil <Col N="1864" /> sí againn ar feadh dhá mhíle bliain ach chomh maith le sin tá sí á labhairt go fóill i gceantracha áirithe sa tír mar theanga dhúchais agus tá sí á labhairt ag cuid mhaith de mhuintir na hÉireann taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht cionns gur leo an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Ar an ábhar sin, sílim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo.  Tá fáth eile ann fosta, sé sin, go bhfuil chuid mhór de shaol agus de chultúr na tíre seo fite fuaite sa Ghaeilge.  Ní hé amháin go bhfuil tionnchar ag an nGaeilge ar ár gcultúr i gcoitinne ach tá tionnchar aici ar an litríocht a chum cuid mhaith daoine sa tír seo i mBéarla, sé sin, ar an litríocht Anglo-Irish.</P>
    <P>Is an aidhm don pholasaí atá againn ná an Ghaeilge a bheith ar a thoil ag achan duine sa tír.  Sílim go bhfuil sé de cheart ag daoine óga na tíre seo an Ghaeilge a bheith acu agus níl ach an t-aon dóigh amháin a dtig linn an Ghaeilge a thabhairt dóbhtha na í a thabhairt dóbhtha ins na scoileanna. Tá sé de chead acu nuair a fhásann siad úsáid a bhaint as an nGaeilge más mian leo nó gan úsáid a bhaint aisti.  B'fhearr liom féin go mbainfeadh siad úsáid aisti.  Ach sílim go bhfuil sé de cheart acu an Ghaeilge a bheith acu agus iad a bheith i ndán, más maith leo, an Ghaeilge a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ann a deir gurb é an polasaí atá againn ná an Ghaeilge a chur in áit an Bhéarla.  Ní fíor sin.  Is í an Ghaeilge teanga na tíre seo, teanga ár sinsir ach is teanga an-thábhachtach ar fad an Béarla agus sílim go bhfuil an t-ádh linn an Béarla a bheith againn.</P>
    <P>Ach ní fheicim go bhfuil rud ar bith in éadan forás an dá theanga in éineacht agus go bhfuil sé indéanta an dá theanga a bheith ann.  Ar a laghad, mar a dúirt mé, tá sé tábhachtach an Ghaeilge a bheith ag an glúin óg.  Ba mhaith liom a chinntiú arís d'achann duine nach é an polasaí atá againn deireadh a chur le Béarla ach an dá theanga a thógáil in éineacht.</P>
    <P>Tá an scoil iontach tábhachtach ó thaobh athbheochaint, na Gaeilge ach ní féidir an Ghaeilge a athbheochaint ins na scoileanna amháin.  Bhí sin ar cheann de na dearmhaid is mó a <Col N="1865" /> rinneadh san am atá thart dar liom. Cuireadh tús le polasaí na hathbheochana sa mblian 1922.  Bhí mothúcháin láidre ag cuid mhór de mhuintir na hÉireann cionns nach raibh cuimhne eachtraí 1916 i bhfad uathu agus go raibh cogadh na saoirse ar siúl.  Bhí sé de nós ag cuid mhaith daoine pé méid Ghaeilge a bhí acu a labhairt.  Sílim gur mheas na daoine a bhí i mbun an oideachais ag an am sin go leanfadh na mothúcháin láidre seo ach tá a fhios againn anois nach leanann mothúcháin den saghas sin ach ar feadh tamaill gairid.  Leanann siad faid a bhíonn tír ar bith i dtrioblóid ach ina dhiaidh sin, nuair a bhíonn an baol thart, athraíonn cúrsaí agus ní bhíonn na mothúcháin chéanna ann.  Níl mé ag cur milleáin ar bith ar na daoine a bhí ann san am mar shíl siad go dtiocfadh leis na scoileanna iontu féin an Ghaeilge a athbheochaint ach tá a fhios againn go maith anois nach dtigh sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh suim a bheith ag muintir na hÉireann sa Ghaeilge taobh amuigh de na scoileanna mar leanfadh na páistí de labhairt na teangan ach go dteaspáinfeadh an pobal suim a bheith acu sa Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den scoil.  Ach tá na fórsaí idirnáisiúnta taobh amuigh de na scoileanna iontach láidir agus ar an ábhar sin ní bhfaigheann na páistí seans an Ghaeilge a chleachtadh.  Mar gheall ar sin téann an Ghaeilge i laghad de réir a chéile agus mar adubhairt an Teachta Mac Giolla Phádraig cúpla bómaite ó shin tá cuid mhaith daoine faoi 40 bliain d'aois i láthair na huaire ar cheart an Ghaeilge a bheith acu ach tá sí caillte acu.  Sílim gurab é fáth atá leis sin cionns nach bhfuair siad seans an Ghaeilge a chleachtadh taobh amuigh de na scoileanna agus gur imigh a gcuid Ghaeilge i léig.  Is é ceann de na rudaí is tábhachtaí a chaithfimíd a dhéanamh ná athrú i meoin mhuintir na hÉireann a thabhairt i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Do thiocfadh linn é sin a dhéanamh tríd na hathruithe atá ins na módhanna múinte i dteagasc na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna.  Sílim go gcuideodh módhanna múinte Bhuntús Gaeilge go mór leis sin.  Go deimhin, tá siad ag cuidiú <Col N="1866" /> go mór le hathrú meoin a thabhairt do na daoine i leith na teangan.</P>
    <P>Chuaigh mé féin thart ar roinnt de na scoileanna ina bhfuil na módhanna seo in úsáid iontu&mdash;ceann amháin anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath&mdash;agus mhothaigh mé go gcuireann na páistí óga an-shuim sa Ghaeilge, an-shuim ins na módhanna nua so agus gur bhain siad an-thaithneamh astu.  Bhí sin soiléir agus de réir a chéile beidh tionchar aige ar na tuismitheóirí.  Tá a fhios agam go raibh deacrachtaí ann ar feadh blianta cionns go raibh tuismitheóirí á rá nár theastaigh an Ghaeilge óna páistí nó nár mhaith leis na páistí an Ghaeilge.  Ar an ábhar sin bhí an cuma air go raibh na tuismitheoirí i gcoinne na Gaeilge ach sílim féin de réir mar a bhíonn na modhanna nua á gcur i bhfeidhm go dtiocfaidh athrú an-mhór ar an scéal sin agus má éiríonn linn na tuismitheoirí a thabhairt linn níl dabht ar bith im intinn ná go n-éireoidh linn an Ghaeilge a athbheochaint.  Is é ceann de na rudaí is tábhachtaí i leith athbheochaint na Gaeilge dea-thoil na dtuismitheoirí a fháil.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na meán-scoileanna is eol do Theachtaí go bhfuil an bhéim faoi láthair ar labhairt na Gaeilge. Sílim gur fiú an t-athrú seo.  Bhí barraíocht bhéime ar feadh blianta fada ar scríobhadh na Gaeilge ní amháin ins na meánscoileanna ach ins na bunscoileanna chomh maith.  Ní ar na scoileanna a bhí an locht ach ar an bpolasaí a bhí ag an Roinn Oideachais ach de réir a chéile tá an bhéim á chur níos láidre ar labhairt na Gaeilge ins na meánscoileanna agus ins na bunscoileanna chomh maith agus níl an oiread céanna béime ar ghramadach.  Tá an rud seo tábhachtach fosta.  Má bhíonn ar na daoine óga a bheith cúramach i gcónaí faoin ghramadach níl seans ar bith ann go labharfaidh siad Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liomsa na blianta fada ó shin nuair a tháinig cigire isteach sa scoil chugamsa&mdash;fear a raibh an-dhúil sa Ghaeilge aige.  Ceacht gramadaí a bhí ar siúl ach dúirt sé liom gan barraíocht shuime a chur sa ghramadach ach a chur ar na páistí an teanga a labhairt.  Ba chuma leis fá dtaobh den <Col N="1867" /> ábhar nó faoin ngramadach.  Caithfidh mé a admháil nár thuig mé ag an am caidé a bhí i gceist aige mar ag an am sin bhí an bhéim ar fad ar ghramadach agus ar scríobhneóireacht agus mar sin de.  Acht ina dhiaidh sin fuair mé amach go díreach cad a bhí i gceist aige.  Ba ghnáthach liom féin ina dhiaidh sin a rá leis na páistí ag tús rang Gaeilge gur chuma liom faoi na dearmhaid a rinne siad, gur chuma liom fá rud ar bith ach amháin go labharfadh siad agus nuair a fuair siad amach go dtiocfadh leo dul ar aghaidh ar an dóigh sin is iontach an t-athrú a tháinig orthu agus do labhair na páistí gan deacracht ar bith Níl mé ag rá go raibh an Ghaeilge go híontach i gcónaí acu ach níl dabht ar bith ann ná gur labhair siad í.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin, tá cuid mhaith á déanamh leis an nGaeilge a athbheochant tríd páistí óga a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht achan bliain.  Is é mo bharúil féin go bhfuil seo ar cheann de na rudaí is tábhachtaí i leith athbheochant na Gaeilge.  Ní amháin go gcloiseann siad an Ghaeilge ansin agus go n-éiríonn siad cleachtach leis an nGaeilge bheith á labhairt ach is ceist shíceolaíocht í fosta.  Cloiseann daoine óga ó achann cuid den tír muintir na háite ag dul i mbun a gcuid oibre agus an Ghaeilge á labhairt acu agus cíonn siad freisin den chéad uair fosta nach teanga scoile atá i gceist ach teanga bheo.</P>
    <P>Ní aontoinn leis an Teachta Mac-Giolla Phádraig nach bhfuil ag éirí linn. Tá ag éirí linn an Ghaeilge a theagasc ach níl ag éirí go fóill linn an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt go forleathan.  Ach mar a dubhairt mé ó shin, tá misneach agam agus dóchas ionam go mbainfimíd amach an cuspóir atá romhainn.  Ag an am gceánna caithfimíd a admháil nach bhfuil an iarracht is cóir dúinn a dhéanamh á dhéanamh againn chun ár muintear a spreagadh chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Dá bhrí sin, caithfimíd scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an obair go léir chun a fháil amach na slíte is fearr chun dul ar aghaidh leis an gcuspóir tábhachtach seo a bhaint amach.  Gan amhras, tá dul ar aghaidh déanta againn ach is féidir linn dul ar aghaidh níos fearr fós a dhéanamh agus ní <Col N="1868" /> foláir dúinn an cheist a scrúdú ó thaobh na Gaeilge a bheith mar ghnáth-theanga urlabhartha ag muintir na tíre seo.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat my thanks to the Deputies who spoke in this debate, the tone of which was high.  Perhaps here and there we had some political overtones or some emotionalism but, nevertheless, the trend and tone of the debate were good and that is how I feel they should be.  Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Desmond contributed largely to this.  Of course, that does not mean that I agree with everything they said.  The trend was set in the early stages of the debate and that, to a very large extent, was followed through to the end of the debate.  I repeat that this is as it should be because everybody now accepts that education is an exceptionally important matter and that our common aim should be to endeavour to improve the educational system for our children.  This can be done, I think, only with the co-operation of Members from all sides of the House.  As I say, I feel I got that co-operation in this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald made a point that my opening speech did not contain a statement on the philosophy underlying what we are seeking to do over the whole educational field.  This does not present me with any difficulty as it consists largely of repeating what I have already stated on a number of occasions.  Our basic aim is to provide for every child an education that will enable him to develop his potential to the fullest possible extent.  This will involve, in the primary stages, introducing a child-centred curriculum which will respond to the aptitudes and abilities of every child and will enable him to make progress at the rate of which he himself is capable. In the case of the slower learner and the handicapped, this involves making special provision for them within our national school system.  After this, an endeavour will be made&mdash;an endeavour is, in fact, being made&mdash;so that in every area there will be comprehensive provision for post-primary education to cater for all the ranges of abilities and natural bents of the pupils in the area.  I think it will be <Col N="1869" /> accepted that we are gradually achieving this while recognizing that this will evolve in quite a number of ways.  I want to stress that point just in case it might be suggested that there is only one way in which comprehensive education could be made available in any particular centre.</P>
    <P>A high priority here is the removal of the present imbalance between the academic type of education, on the one hand, and education with a practical and technical orientation, on the other.  This has been touched on by all parties throughout this debate.  I noticed it in practically every speech. At third level, we are ensuring that the students with the necessary degree of ability will have an opportunity to advance to the top of the educational tree.  At this level, of course, we must think not alone of the universities but of the other third level colleges such as the technological colleges, colleges of education and the regional technical colleges.  Within reason, we must try to achieve, as I mentioned in my opening statement, a satisfactory relation between the numbers and the types of graduates emerging from our universities and the manpower requirements of the nation.</P>
    <P>While appreciation was expressed on all sides of the House of progress in the educational field in Ireland in recent years, some criticism was expressed that our awakening to the needs of our people in this respect was rather delayed.</P>

      <P>I did not realise that the Minister had finished his statement on aims.  Would he consider, in view of the complexity applying to these aims, presenting a White Paper setting them out in full and indicating in detail how they would be applied?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what I had been speaking about, I think we <Col N="1870" /> should try to put this matter into proper perspective.  At this point in time, when there is an upsurge of feeling for education in this country, we might find it difficult to realise that only in quite recent times has world-wide recognition been given to the place of education in the social field.  Rising standards of living have brought opportunities for advancement within the scope of all. This should be appreciated when we are concerning ourselves with developments in this country.  Other countries very much wealthier than ours were very little in advance of what we have done here.  I appreciate, of course, that a number of people in the past recognised the potentialities of education and endeavoured to have their views accepted.  I think we will all agree that, in a sense, these were voices crying in the wilderness at that time although quite possibly, though unheeded in their own time, they have succeeded in making us more fully aware of the advantages to be derived from education.</P>
      <P>With the advantage of hindsight, it is very easy to ponder on the achievements that might have been possible here had we the foresight to make a greater amount of money available for education in our Budgets each year.  As I say, in a sense, this is hindsight.  We must also bear in mind that, during that period, very many people were fully engaged in trying to eke out a meagre living&mdash;and that applied to countries other than this country: it applied even to countries of Western Europe and America which are now very highly developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that when Deputy Dr. FitzGerald was speaking he mentioned the Minister for Education some years ago who believed his only function was to see that &ldquo;the water passed through the pipes,&rdquo; as he said.  That might not be so much a criticism of the Minister as a criticism of his times.  Today times have changed and education is now within the reach of all.  It has come to be regarded as the cornerstone of all development.  People now appreciate education and appreciate also that it is essential for their young people if they are to be fully developed. <Col N="1871" /> People are showing a concern for education.  It is now possible for us because of this concern to make money available for education for very large numbers.  This upsurge in the development of Irish education is heartening and is to be welcomed.  It poses many and considerable problems. If there is co-operation in endeavouring to overcome these problems, they can be overcome.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to speak of the developments in Irish education today and to take issue with Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien in relation to his strictures last night on our Irish educational system.  The Deputy appeared to me to lecture us from Olympian heights about the ineffectiveness of Irish education while at the same time, like the old proverb, to feel that &ldquo;Faraway cows have long horns.&rdquo; The Deputy could see the excellence of the educational system in other countries. The Irish educational system has developed in this country and is tailored to suit Irish needs.  It has been rapidly developed particularly in recent years.  It is meant to suit the needs of the people of this country. I am not suggesting that our educational system cannot be improved on. I was surprised to find Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien lauding the French system and some particular parts of it. I should have imagined he would have been inclined to eschew certain aspects of that education, particularly the elitist aspects of it.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the free education system, saying that the system is not free.  I do not know why they found it necessary to make this particular statement.  In so far as our primary and post-primary children are concerned, and in relation to a certain percentage of our university students, education is free.  Nobody ever pretended that education was free in the sense that people have not got to pay for it.  They have to pay for it, and nobody knows that better than we do. The very fact that people have to pay for it more or less underlines the difference between promise and performance. It is relatively easy to promise <Col N="1872" /> free education.  Everyone would be pleased with the promise.  The difficulty arises when it comes to the stage where we must bring in taxation to pay for it.  Courage is needed then.  It is a tribute to this Government that, when they believed it was essential that our young people should have not only free post-primary education but also free transport, we took our courage in our hands and informed the people of what we proposed to do.  We put on taxes to ensure it would be possible for us to do this.</P>
    <P>I feel that the introduction of the new curriculum in the primary schools is one of the most important events to take place in Irish educational history for a long time.  This new curriculum is child centred rather than curriculum centred.  Attention is focussed on the child and his needs rather than on the subject matter.  The curriculum content is arranged to suit the age and interests and the endowments of a child rather than as something that is in accordance with the logical order of particular disciplines.  The teacher is more concerned with developing the young mind than he is with filling it. This is a very important step in Irish primary education.  All Deputies agree on this.  The curriculum is flexible so that individual differences in children can be met.  We are all aware that children of the same age can vary widely in their interests, their abilities, their background, their level of attainment and their aspirations.  It is essential to have a flexible curriculum to deal with the different abilities of the child.  The curriculum content must be influenced very largely by the environment of the child.  We all agree that the child is the offspring of his environment.  His tastes, attitudes and knowledge are to a great extent the products of his social and physical environment.  It is on this foundation that his further development must lie. The curriculum, because of what I have already mentioned, lays stress on the importance of learning rather than of teaching.  As we are all very well aware, particularly those of us who are teachers, learning is an active and not a passive process.  The child is the most active agent in his own education. <Col N="1873" /> Various methods are used in the new curriculum.  There is the discovery method.  It is recognised that the child drawing on his own personal experience learns very well.  Not only that but, because of the fact that he finds that he can learn, he tends to become very much more interested in what he is doing and has a much greater incentive to further effort.</P>
    <P>As I said at the INTO congress this curriculum will be introduced gradually and teachers will not be asked to do more than they are able to do. They will not be asked to implement the new curriculum as a whole but they will begin where they themselves are most confident that they can be successful.  This is important because if by starting at this stage they find they can successfully cope with the problems they face in relation to the new curriculum they will be much better prepared to deal with the problems of the curriculum in other fields. Considerable preliminary work has been done in the introduction of the Nua-Chúrsa Gaeilge.  As I said on a previous occasion, the Nua-Chúrsa is now being extended to all classes of primary schools.  Considerable improvements have taken place in the teaching of English, especially in developing reading and the extension of functional and recreational reading and the use of the school library is also improving the situation as regards teaching of English.  The preliminary work done here is of very considerable importance in itself but it is also fundamental to the development of other aspects of the curriculum.</P>
    <P>The publishers have been most cooperative in providing helpful textbooks which will be available for use in the schools in the coming school year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should let the House know what progress we have made to date in relation to the new curriculum. In regard to the teachers' handbook, notes for teachers on all aspects of the curriculum are being provided and I hope they will be available to the teachers next September.  As I have said on a number of occasions, we have organised several in-service <Col N="1874" /> training courses and I think I mentioned in my original statement that the principals of large schools, about 600 of them, were on courses in July, 1969, and that we hope this year to double that number.  Weekend courses will also be held dealing with various aspects of the curriculum and many others are planned for centres throughout the country.  Some 1,000 teachers attended music courses last year and approximately 800 will attend courses on physical education in the coming months.  We shall also have courses on mathematics and environmental studies and arts and crafts.  Some of these are being given in the training colleges.</P>
    <P>The INTO have also organised a number of very successful courses.  In the past three years about 300 unqualified teachers have completed courses of training and are now qualified to take up appointment in any primary school.  About 200 curriculum centres have been set up and teachers from neighbouring schools will be afforded an opportunity of seeing how the new curriculum has been implemented.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am going into too much detail but it may be useful for Deputies to have this information in the Dáil debates.</P>
    <P>Arising from the introduction of the new curriculum I think I might discuss the amalgamation of schools because there is a tie-up between the two for the very obvious reason that in order to put this curriculum properly into operation a certain size of school is essential.  In regard to amalgamation, the underlying policy is educational.  A teacher in a one-teacher school, responsible for six or seven standards, cannot give his undivided attention to each separate standard and cater for the wide range of aptitudes and mental ability of the children.  This should be obvious to everybody.  A new child-centred curriculum is now being introduced into primary schools and this involves a very wide range of activities for each group and for each attainment level.  Smaller schools could not possibly be expected to cater adequately for this new curriculum.  Very much broadened courses are being provided in post-primary schools but the benefit <Col N="1875" /> of them cannot be fully reaped by pupils who have had a narrow or restricted primary education.  This is an important aspect of the matter. Teachers who are specially gifted are given a much wider scope to do their work and exercise their talents and make their services available in bigger schools to a greater number of pupils.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan during the debate mentioned that the school he attended was a two-teacher school which had an excellent principal teacher and he felt he had got a first-class education from this teacher.  No doubt that is true but we should also consider that if the scope of the talents of this excellent teacher was broadened then his talents would be made available to many more children.  Again, as regards amalgamation of schools, the modern transport facilities which we are making available bring schools within reach of all the children within the school area.  Instead of having to walk long journeys, as they previously had to do in many cases, in inclement weather, they are now taken by bus to school.  They are warm when they reach school and in the afternoon they are taken home again.  The benefits of this system should be recognised.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara spoke at some length about this and expressed appreciation of the facilities.  This is something we should all take cognisance of and I would ask the parents specially to take cognisance of it.</P>
    <P>Since the policy of the amalgamation of schools has come into operation we have amalgamated about 740 schools and I can say that, in general, the managers, the teachers and the parents in practically every case were fully satisfied with the manner in which the amalgamation took place.  It has been our experience that the parents in the areas in which amalgamation took place were fully aware of the value and the improvement which stemmed from the extra facilities made available to their children in the new schools.  In some instances there was initial opposition to amalgamation but after the children had spent some time in the new schools not only did the opposition die but letters were <Col N="1876" /> sent to the Department thanking us for what had been done.  Some people were big enough to state that they had made a mistake in the early stages. I might also add that at the present time applications are being made by parents and managers in certain areas asking that schools might be amalgamated in those areas so as to provide the children with better educational facilities.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by two Deputies to the Montpelier case.  I have already praised the approach of Deputy FitzGerald in relation to his speech on the Estimate and I hope that he will take kindly to a suggestion from me that he should try to avoid involving himself too emotionally in some educational problems because it tends to impair his judgment and to make him that little bit arrogant.  When dealing with this case Deputy FitzGerald said on a number of occasions that the Minister has made a mistake and should rectify his mistake.  He appeared to conclude that because he said this a number of times the Minister had made a mistake.  The Minister does not accept that he made a mistake.  The Minister believes that when he came to his decision he made the decision much more objectively and much less emotionally than did Deputy FitzGerald because at the time of the Minister's decision there was not such an emotional atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go deeply into this matter but I would like to recap briefly on the situation.  When I went into the Department of Education I found that a decision had been made in relation to the closing of the school in Montpelier.  I studied the file very carefully. I noted the number of children attending the school and I asked that a survey be carried out so as to ascertain how many children were likely to come to the school and whether it was likely to become a three-teacher school and retain its position as a three-teacher school.</P>
    <P>From this survey it was evident that the school would not maintain the number for a three-teacher school and, if my memory serves me right, the number in that school within a very short number of years would be down <Col N="1877" /> to 56.  I have considerable experience of the manner in which the numbers on the rolls fluctuate in rural schools. It is a common feature to find the numbers increasing from 50 to 80, at which stage all the children in the area who are due to attend that particular school are attending, but from then it must of necessity fall again.</P>
    <P>When I found that the number of children at Montpelier would not sustain a three-teacher school I considered the whole area in order to reach a decision as to how we could best assist the education and development of all the children in that area.  I saw that the Bridgetown school was a good building.  It was a two-teacher school and I realised that if the children who were then attending Montpelier but who were in the Bridgetown parish went to the Bridgetown school it could then become a three-teacher school and not only would we be giving the benefit of the education available in a three-teacher school to the children from Montpelier but we would also give it to the children in Bridgetown.  I had an equal responsibility to provide the best possible education for the children of Bridgetown as for the children of Montpelier and I realise also that in transferring the children from Montpelier, who were in the parish of Castleconnel, to Castleconnel they would have the benefit of six teachers.</P>
    <P>To my mind this was the solution in that particular case.  I was creating better education facilities in both areas. I am aware that there was a considerable amount of opposition and that Deputies involved themselves in the matter.  I am not saying they did it for any wrong purposes but they did become involved and the impression was <Col N="1878" /> created that if the children were kept from school for long enough the Minister would give in.  Of course, there could be no question of giving in.  I did not want any victory because victory was not involved except in so far as to ensure that the children were getting the best possible education.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I maintained my decision and, at this stage, I would again appeal to those parents who have not yet sent their children to either one or other of the two appropriate schools to do so now in the interest of the children.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect in relation to this matter which was raised by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and on which I should like to comment.  The Deputy stated that he gave me a list of the names of pupils who would attend this particular school and he said that he was not satisfied with my reply.  In the reply I stated that a number of the children whose names were forwarded to me were children who had been taken into the area but who would not be remaining in the area.  I shall not go into the details of that now.  I stated also in the reply that others were children of parents who did not normally send their children to Montpelier.  Deputy FitzGerald said he could not understand this particular aspect.  In relation to the first part, obviously if children were taken into a school area at any stage only temporarily, there would be no difficulty in increasing the numbers on the rolls. In relation to the parents who did not normally send their children to this school, this is a very important factor.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23rd April, 1970.</P>

      <P>I have no direct functions in regard to the remuneration and conditions of service of porters in the employment of local health authorities.  As a general rule, the conditions of employment for porters and other servant grades correspond to the conditions obtaining locally for similar employment.  The machinery of the Labour Court is available for the resolution of any disputes.</P>
