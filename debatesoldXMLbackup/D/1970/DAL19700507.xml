      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave you notice that I proposed to move the Adjournment of the Dáil in order to have consideration given to a motion of urgent national importance: that of the lack of confidence of this House in the Taoiseach and his Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has considered the Deputy's motion but cannot accept it.  In the short time available before midnight, in view of the business ordered, it is not possible for the Dáil to fit in this motion.  The Dáil could not appoint a time after midnight according to the Standing Orders and therefore the Deputy can <Col N="636" /> only raise the matter at the next sitting of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a submission? I submit to the House that it is much more important to discuss now confidence, or lack of confidence, in the Government rather than to discuss a motion which merely calls for the approval of the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to be a Minister. It would have been much more appropriate, rather than to have this discussion on the appointment of a Minister, if the Taoiseach had come in with a similar sort of motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would not be possible.  I have outlined the reasons I cannot accept the motion.  Standing Orders do not permit it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go gcomhaontóidh Dáil Éireann leis an Taoiseach d'ainmniú an Teachta Deasún Ó Máille chun a cheaptha ag an Uachtarán chun bheith ina chomhalta den Rialtas.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Desmond J. O'Malley for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>May I add for the information of the Dáil that, subject to the motion being approved by the House, I propose on his appointment to assign the Department of Justice to Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>I should like to state for the information of the Dáil that, having requested the resignation as a member of the Government of Deputy Neil T. Blaney, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and Deputy Charles J. Haughey, Minister for Finance, as neither would comply with my request, accordingly on my advice the President has today terminated their appointments as members of the Government with effect from the 7th May, 1970. On my advice also, the President has today accepted the resignation of Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin, Minister for Local Government and for Social Welfare, as a member of the Government with effect from the same date.</P>
      <P>I want to take advantage of this occasion to make a statement on the termination of appointment of the three former members of the Government to which I have just referred.  As might be expected, there has been much comment through the news media and otherwise on these terminations of appointment.  In at least one case, if not more, there appeared to be an implication that the Minister whose resignation I accepted on Monday last, Micheál Ó Moráin, was involved in some way in the matter with which I now propose to deal.  I want to assure the House that that appointment was terminated on health grounds as I have already stated publicly.  The Minister was not involved in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> On Monday, 20th April and Tuesday, 21st April, the security forces of the country at my disposal brought me information about an alleged attempt to unlawfully import arms from the continent. <i>Prima facie</i>, these reports involved two members of the Government. I decided to interview the two members of the Government&mdash;Deputy Blaney, then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and Deputy Haughey, then Minister for Finance.  I decided to do this on the following day, Wednesday 22nd April, which was the day of the Budget.  In the meantime I ensured that adequate steps were taken to prevent any unauthorised importation of arms. On 22nd April, the day I decided to interview the former Ministers, I received news of the accident to Deputy Haughey and, as a result, I was unable to interview him.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember I informed the House on that day that as a result of that accident Deputy Haughey became concussed and was under medical care in hospital.  I contacted his doctor on a number of occasions seeking his permission to interview Deputy Haughey.  He told me he was not in a fit condition for interview if the matter I proposed to discuss with him was serious.  I told the doctor it was a serious matter and he repeated his opinion that he felt he was not in a position to discuss, certainly at any length, a matter of serious import.  However, I ultimately got the doctor's permission and I decided to interview Deputy Haughey in hospital on Wednesday, 29th April.  Having made that decision and before I went to the hospital, I then summoned Deputy Blaney to my room and interviewed him, upon which I went to the hospital and interviewed Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>I told them both I had information which purported to connect them with an alleged attempt to unlawfully import arms, on the basis of which information I felt it was my duty to request their resignations as members of the Government.  Each of them denied he instigated in any way the attempted importation of arms.  They asked me for time to consider their position.  I agreed to do so.  In the meantime I authorised the continuation <Col N="643" /> of investigations and I made personal investigations myself, following which I decided to approach the two Ministers again and to repeat my request that they tender to me their resignations as members of the Government. I did so on the basis that I was convinced that not even the slightest suspicion should attach to any member of the Government in a matter of this nature.  Having told the Ministers that I wished to have their resignations forthwith, each of them told me he would not give me his resignation until this morning.</P>
    <P>I may say that on the question of suspicion Deputy Cosgrave came to me yesterday evening to say he had some information from an anonymous source connecting the two Ministers concerned with this alleged attempt at unlawful importation.  Shortly after requesting the resignation of these two Ministers I received the resignation tendered by the Minister for Local Government and Social Welfare, Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin.  Not having received the resignations of the other two Ministers, I then informed the President that under the appropriate Article of the Constitution I was requesting him to terminate their appointments as Ministers and advising him to accept the resignation of Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin who had tendered it.  As I have already informed the House, he did so.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that this was the only attempted importation of arms of which I had evidence and with which the two Ministers named were associated.  I also want to assure the House that these arms have not been imported, have not been landed in this country, and that the precautions I have taken will ensure they will not be landed.</P>

      <P>Last night at approximately 8 p.m.  I considered it my duty in the national interest to inform the Taoiseach of information I had received and which indicates a situation of such gravity for the nation that it is without parallel in this country since the foundation of the State.  By approximately 10 p.m. two Ministers had been dismissed and a third had resigned.  I <Col N="644" /> received information that an attempt had been made involving a number of members of the Government illegally to import a large consignment of arms from the continent for use by an illegal organisation.  Arrangements were made under the pretext that this consignment was coming as an official supply of arms to the Army, and that involved making arrangements with the Department of Finance for allowing this consignment through the customs without check at Dublin Airport.  My information was that the arrangements involved an Army officer.  The affair came to the notice of the Garda authorities and the Garda officer in charge, a senior Garda officer, informed the Commissioner who sought a directive from the Department of Justice in view of a suggestion from an official in the Department of Finance that the Minister for Finance had authorised the passage through the customs of this illegal consignment.</P>
      <P>When advice was sought by the Garda no directive was given and when it appeared to the Garda that the situation was not being handled with proper seriousness, a further request for a directive from the Minister for Justice was made.  At this stage the matter was notified to the Taoiseach and eventually, after a lot of dithering, the authority from the Department of Finance was dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that because of the linking up of certain Ministers, an Army officer, the brothers of two Ministers, one the brother of the former Minister for Finance and the other the brother of the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and some of their friends, with these highly dangerous and illegal activities, the question of dismissing the Ministers from the Government arose.  No action, however, was taken until the resignation of the Minister for Justice on Monday last.  Yesterday when I received a copy of a document on official Garda notepaper which supported the information already at my disposal and which also included some additional names, I decided to put the facts in my possession before the Taoiseach. This particular document says: &ldquo;A plot to bring in arms from the continent <Col N="645" /> worth £80,000 under the guise of the Department of Defence has been discovered.  Those involved are a Captain Kelly, the former Minister for Finance, the former Minister for Agriculture and two associates of the Ministers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will now be aware from the statement the Taoiseach has made and from the brief recital of the information I have given that this is a situation without parallel in this country, that not merely involved here is the security of this State but that those who were drawing public money to serve the nation were, in fact, attempting to undermine it, and that there was a failure to deal with this situation by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Yesterday at Question Time I said, &ldquo;Are there going to be other ministerial resignations?&rdquo; and the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;I do not know what the Deputy is referring to&rdquo; and I, as reported in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> said, &ldquo;Is it only the tip of the iceberg?&rdquo;.  It was a modest statement.</P>
      <P>The situation that has now developed is such that the very security of this State is being threatened.  The lives of the people not only in the greatest part of Ireland for which freedom was won at such great price have been put in peril.  But, even worse than that, the people, particularly the minority about whom we are so concerned in the Six Counties, have their lives and their welfare put in jeopardy.  That is a situation without parallel in the history of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a considerable time there has been speculation, there have been suggestions, there have been comments from this side of the House that the activities of certain Ministers were such that they were not fit to remain Members of the Government.  All <Col N="646" /> during that time the comments that were made by the Taoiseach and by other Ministers were that these were personal attacks on them.  I now ask this House and the country to decide who was right and who expressed the real facts of the situation.  There was a suggestion made that we were engaged in personal attacks.  Not alone, as is now obvious and as it has turned out, were the Ministers concerned unfit to be Ministers but they were engaging in activity undermining the national security and recklessly endangering the lives of our people in the north while continuing to take the people's money. The people of this country can now, tonight, and not for the first time in our history, be greatful to this party for the selfless dedication to the service of the nation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it has discharged without regard to personal interest or party consideration.  The position that has now arisen is that this country is in danger of drifting into anarchy.  The confidence that has been reposed in this party and the fact that people who were concerned at the trend of events confided this information in me, and in my colleagues through me, indicate that a situation had developed that not merely were those who were paid to serve the people betraying that trust but they were involved in betraying the nation and betraying the welfare of our people.</P>
      <P>I want to find out from the Taoiseach tonight&mdash;and this House and the country are entitled to find out&mdash;what action it is proposed to take against the persons concerned.  There is a person who was an Army officer; there are the Ministers or ex-Ministers who have been named: there are the other persons the details of which are available to the Government and to the security service of the Garda and the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House must be concerned at a situation in which arms were being imported for use by an illegal organisation. It is not necessary to remind the House at this stage that very recently a <Col N="647" /> garda in the gallant discharge of his duty, serving the public, was murdered; that there have been a series of armed robberies; that, in fact, for some months practically no bank has been safe.  This situation is so serious and so grave that it is obvious that this Government, or what is left of them, are not fit to govern.</P>
    <P>So far as this situation is concerned, there are these criminal activities but, worse than that, the gravity of the national situation is now emphasised by the fact that the Taoiseach and the Ministers who are left are prepared to cling to power with the support of people whom the Taoiseach considers unfit to hold ministerial office.  This is a situation that those whom we commemorated at Arbour Hill today could never have visualised would have happened. I believe the Minister for Labour in a comment today said he went there to pray.  We went to pray for them.  I am sure that if those who fought and died&mdash;and I am privileged to speak from a family tradition that as far back as '98 gave lives in defence of the rights of the Irish people to govern themselves.  This party asserted and defended and vindicated the people's rights to ensure that this sovereign authority and it alone would act and work and discharge its responsibility for the people.  We are prepared to resume that historic assignment and there is an inescapable obligation on the Taoiseach and his colleagues to resign and to give this country an opportunity of electing a Government of integrity, of honesty, of patriotism, in whom the people and the world can have confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What frightens me in this debate is the approach of the Taoiseach to what I and the people regard as a grave crisis.  I was appalled when it was announced that the instrument for discussion on this grave crisis was to be a motion from the Taoiseach for the appointment of a Minister.  What appalled me even more was the introductory speech the Taoiseach made in moving this motion in which he recited what he had done in regard to the three or four Ministers concerned in the last two weeks and particularly in the last <Col N="648" /> few days.  I describe it as a grave crisis. It cannot be disguised.  It is a crisis that is not confined to this House or to any political party in it.  It is a crisis that is not confined to the 26 Counties.  It is a crisis that cannot be disguised in its application to the Six Counties, in particular, as well as to the 26 Counties.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, incumbent on us all to speak with great care so that none of us may, by speech or interjection, contribute to the worsening of a situation which could do damage to our democratic institutions, a situation which can be likened to that which obtained prior to the disastrous civil war of many years ago, a civil war the futility of which people of all political persuasions have long since come to recognise.  I do not think the Taoiseach can say that he was not warned.  For months we have called for the removal of Government Members who seemed to condone violence.  I remember this particularly in a debate we had on 22nd and 23rd October last when we warned the Taoiseach about the inflammatory speeches being made by the now Deputy Blaney.  We remember, too, the retort on that occasion from the Taoiseach, a retort tantamount to condoning what Deputy Blaney said or, at least, alleging that these were his personal opinions, at the same time accepting him as a member of the Government, a Government who were supposed to have collective responsibility for policy in all directions and particularly for policy in respect of the Six Counties of Ulster.</P>
      <P>By way of consolation to the Taoiseach, may I say that we support, even at this late stage, his action in dismissing from his Government certain Ministers who have been dabbling with violence and playing with fire but, to that extent, and to that extent only, we support the Taoiseach's action in the present crisis.  Whatever may be the political consequences in this crisis we believe a rational and responsible policy should resolutely exclude from the national consensus those who encourage and condone violence and especially those who engage in surreptitious collusion with violence practised by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last 18 months Fianna Fáil <Col N="649" /> have spoken with two voices on this matter of national unity.  We had the Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil Party spokesman, condemning violence, and we supported that and urged the doctrine that unity can only be reached by agreement between the two communities in this island of Ireland; and we had the other voice through the now Deputy Blaney, and others, who hinted that the use of force is legitimate and practicable.  We were led to believe that there are many supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, though perhaps not vocal, who subscribed to that sort of policy.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is and the shame is that these two voices have been used, one by the Taoiseach and one by others, including Deputy Blaney, for party expediency&mdash;a policy, or should one say &ldquo;policies&rdquo;, if one could try to weld them together&mdash;a policy which has been one of disaster and has brought this island to the verge of civil war.  But, even as the policy of a policy of expediency, the Blaney/ Lynch Fianna Fáil Party have now come to the end of the road.</P>
    <P>This is the day of reckoning.  As far as the nation is concerned Fianna Fáil stand before us now as a bankrupt party&mdash;a party that have no policy they can or ever will apply to the Six Counties of Ulster.  They are a party who deceived those who followed them. They pretended they had a long-term policy for the reunification of the country.  But they had none.  They avoided public discussion on what policy might be and we well remember the efforts that were made to avoid discussion right through the whole of last summer, particularly during the month of August, and we well remember the efforts we had to make in order to induce the Taoiseach to have some sort of debate on the Six County situation in this House.  His retort on all occasions was that he did not think it was opportune, that he believed that something might be said within this Parliament that would worsen the situation that obtained in Belfast and Derry in August of last year.  The plain fact was, of course, that he was not afraid of any members of my party, because we had behaved responsibly <Col N="650" /> over those awful three months; he was afraid of the members of his own party and it was significant on that particular occasion that we did not hear a Boland, or a Haughey, or a Blaney make any utterance at all in a debate which we regarded, and which should have been regarded, as one of the most serious and most important this Dáil had for a long, long time.</P>
    <P>The reason is now clear.  Fianna Fáil had no policy.  They were then, as they are now, split on this particular issue. I am not interested in any damage that may be done to the Fianna Fáil Party. We are not concerned about that. What is important, and what we are concerned about, is the damage that has been done to the country by the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly in the last two weeks.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether or not I have this accurately, but it is again a demonstration of the casual approach of the Taoiseach to this grave crisis that we have on our hands: I am told that the gist of the statement made as a result of the special meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party held at Leinster House was that the party &ldquo;endorsed a motion to the effect that the party approved such nominations as the Taoiseach may make to replace the Members of the Government whose appointment had been terminated&rdquo;. Each of the three ex-Ministers, Deputy Blaney, Deputy Haughey and Deputy Boland, and the ex-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government expressed unreservedly his loyalty to Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach.  What they should be doing is expressing their loyalty to Government policy, if there is any Government policy.  What they should be doing is expressing their loyalty to the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems abundantly clear to me that, whoever drafted that resolution, and if it was considered in any serious way, the main purpose of the meeting today was to close the ranks and to express loyalty to the Fianna Fáil Party merely for the purpose of keeping them together.  These have been demoted, so to speak.  I do not know <Col N="651" /> what the vote was within the party. As I said this morning, that is their own business, but I am informed that on this particular Motion the voting was 65 to ten.</P>

No matter what the decision was, or what the voting was, the important fact is that these three ex-Ministers are now Members of this House, purporting to support the Taoiseach's expressed policy in Killarney and elsewhere in regard to his approach to the situation in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>What is also disturbing is that these are three Ministers who were in charge of vital Departments.  They have deceived the Taoiseach, the Government and the country.  What are we to think of their administration of their Departments over 13 years?  If they deceived the Taoiseach and the Government could they not deceive the farmers, the people who are looking for houses?  Deceit would be all over them if they behaved like that and were deceitful as far as their own Taoiseach was concerned.</P>

      <P>It was said at the beginning that what makes this crisis grave is <Col N="652" /> the reports that Government Ministers and Departments have turned a blind eye on arms smuggling.  This could be the very event that could turn the north and leave us with a situation that would be far worse than that which we had in August, 1969.  I am not, nor should I be, concerned about the damage to the Fianna Fáil Party: what I am concerned about is the damage that these three gentlemen and the Taoiseach and the Government Party have done to the nation.  If this should happen, if we are to have a greater crisis in Derry and Belfast and other places this year, Deputy Blaney and his friends must bear the grave responsibility but the Taoiseach must take a greater onus so far as the responsibility is concerned.</P>
      <P>We have no confidence in Deputy Blaney, Deputy Boland or in Deputy Haughey.  We have none in the Taoiseach. These were his principal aides. These were the people on whom he depended, his senior Ministers, and they have let him down.  He reposed his confidence in them.  These were the men who were supposed to advise him.  They deceived him.  I do not know whether or not the Taoiseach was aware of this situation but there are rumours&mdash; merely rumours, I say&mdash;that arms have been brought in.  The Taoiseach made the point as if to suggest that the only consignment of arms that it was attempted to bring into this country was stopped some place or other.  I think he should have further conversations with some of his dismissed colleagues to see what the actual facts of the case are.</P>

This policy has now crashed to the ground. <Col N="653" /> It is a policy, so far as the unification of the country is concerned, of duplicity and irresponsibility.  It may have won its short-term awards but now the day of reckoning has come.</P>
      <P>We tabled a motion of no confidence in the Government.  It appears to me the Taoiseach is not prepared to risk &mdash;perhaps not a vote in this House, because he has his party lined up&mdash; but he shies away from the risk of a vote on a no-confidence discussion in this House because he knows in his heart and soul that even though he might get, so far as a vote is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I merely mentioned the fact that we had tabled a motion of no confidence.  The point I want to make is this: this has been a serious matter.  It must have been so for the Taoiseach.  He sacked two Ministers, one resigned and a Parliamentary Secretary resigned.  Governments in Europe and all over the world have resigned for far less.  Why not this Government?  It is not sufficient to win confidence in the party rooms; the mandate to govern must come from the people, not from the 76 or 77 members of the Fianna Fáil Party in a situation like this.</P>
      <P>The confidence that the Taoiseach and his party enjoyed since the last election has disappeared in the last 24 hours.  They may hang on to power by the vote of those who are in the party and those who are expelled but we believe that they have no moral authority to govern and the only alternative, no matter what the result is, is within the next 24 hours for the Taoiseach to go to the country again and see whether or not he has the people's confidence.</P>

If it is a crisis, it is a crisis of conscience for every member of the Fianna Fáil party.  Let them examine their consciences &mdash;that party over there who permitted this situation to arise by indolence, by neglect, by arrogance, by failing to have regard to the proprieties and to their sense of responsibility to the people.  They allowed their party to be taken over by ambitious men &ldquo;on the make&rdquo;.  This is bad for Ireland.

      <P>These are serious matters and serious issues.  This debate arises on a motion to appoint a new Minister for Justice.  I should like through the Chair to ask Deputies to have regard to what has been happening to the silent services of our State in the past 12 or 18 months or two years, to ask what has been happening to our Army that, despite provocation and temptation over many years, has always remained loyally to serve those who were the Government elected by this House.  What is to be thought of our Army when it was made a front and a dupe for the illegal importation of arms?  I saw that the Chief of Staff attended a meeting of the Government to make a protest on behalf of the Army in relation to certain matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate tonight is on the motion to appoint Deputy Desmond O'Malley as Minister for Justice&mdash;that is the immediate motion before the House. He will come to hold high office.  He will, perhaps, remember that one of <Col N="658" /> his predecessors died in the discharge of that office.  He will perhaps remember that associated with that office used to go a sense of dedication to the Irish people, irrespective of what was involved.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that that sense of dedication was not present and, with the tolerance of the Taoiseach, was not there during the last two or three years.  We had the deplorable spectacle of the Minister for Justice continuing to practise as a solicitor; we had a situation in which the discharge of that high office was for a professional man merely a nixer, something he did when he had time to spare.</P>
    <P>Let the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party know that outside this House in every part of Ireland there is a sense of concern tonight, and it will continue during the coming weeks; a sense of concern that a party elected with an overall majority less than 12 months ago should have so disgraced themselves that their own leader could not subscribe sincerely and honourably to what was stated to be a policy statement on behalf of the Government; a sense of concern that at night time behind closed doors little men with big cheque books were getting together to whisper and to conspire.</P>
    <P>For what purpose?  It was to get into this country, in operation, another force, another army.  There is a sense of concern that trusted leaders and trusted Ministers should so seek to betray their own leader that they would act in that way without regard to the harm they would do, without displaying any sense of responsibility.  The Fianna Fáil Party should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.</P>

      <P>I have just returned from a short visit to Northern Ireland, a visit of information, trying to find out what was happening, and I came back with a most earnest sense <Col N="659" /> of impending national tragedy on this island, already, before those gentlemen committed what they have committed, already a polarisation, the growing strength of the Paisley movement of Protestant fanaticism at one end of the island and at the other an irresponsible party and the IRA, all building up to next July and August, towards a festival of destruction, a festival which will spread out, if it is allowed to do so&mdash;I hope it will not be allowed but it will be no thanks to those gentlemen if it is not&mdash;to all parts of the island.</P>
      <P>This is the fire those people are playing with.  I do not think honestly that they understand.  I do not think the Taoiseach understands.  I do not think the gentlemen he depends on know anything more about it than that which they read about when they were 12 years of age.  This is a party of ignorance and fanaticism and this has led to this folly which has fallen on their heads and, unfortunately, on the heads of all the people.</P>
      <P>Those gentlemen are still there&mdash;the gentlemen who on the Taoiseach's own showing are nothing short of State criminals.  By their votes and the votes of their friends, the Taoiseach holds on to that office.  In these conditions we from here have to try to carry on the talk, the dialogue with the people, in that knowledge.</P>
      <P>Have we any conception of the impact these revelations will have? Already there was a situation of grave distrust, of grave doubt, and now the people have heard that the Taoiseach, who at Tralee last year made a very sensible statement, expelled from his Government people who were playing with violence, only when those people were exposed by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave.  They would not have been exposed had not Deputy Cosgrave done it.</P>

I know that among them there is a sense of duty, a <Col N="660" /> feeling of duty towards the people.  I am not saying they are violently different from anybody else: they have a sense of decency, a sense of responsibility among them.  That being so, they should not hold to office in these circumstances, by those tainted votes, by the tainted votes of people who on their showing are criminals of the State and who have been so exposed by the Taoiseach himself.</P>

What are we to think of that cold irresponsibility, that propensity towards destruction and crime? What are we to think of that which had that at its core?  The Taoiseach had to be told of it by somebody else. Will you in the Name of God, go in peace?</P>

      <P>What is involved in this situation is not the passing fortunes of any political party: it is whether the principles of good Government, of justice and fair play are to govern our future conduct of Irish affairs.  The safety and security of all the Irish people must be the first and overwhelming concern of any Irish Government. When a Government, or any members of it, presume to promote the cause of any section of the people above the others, then such a Government have forfeited their right to command the respect of all the people.  Our people are contained not merely within the borders of the 26 counties over which the writ of this Parliament for the time being may run but within the shores of our island.  We have an obligation towards those of our sons and daughters who have been forced by circumstances to seek a living in lands beyond the seas.  In the light of that, there is no justification for the supreme, criminal folly of the Taoiseach in suffering as members of his Government people whom he had every reason to suspect did not share the obligations <Col N="661" /> which most Irish people consider must be the overwhelming concern of any Government.</P>
      <P>One of the real tragedies of this situation is that the movement to secure civil rights for a large section of our people in that portion of our national territory which is still not within the writ of this Parliament has received a mortal blow.  The people who deserve our sympathy tonight are not the members of the Fianna Fáil Party or of the Government&mdash;although in the resolution which emanated from their party meeting today that was clearly and primarily their only concern&mdash;but the unfortunate, wretched families in the North of Ireland who have in the past suffered appalling housing conditions, poverty and malnutrition through unemployment and who have been deprived of fair voting rights and political power because they were in that region in the minority.  Those people had every reason to hope that through their efforts and the reasonableness of the conduct of those of us who had achieved our freedom, which had its beneficial effect in Westminster and throughout the world, the days of their great agony might soon come to an end.  What do they see now?  They observe tonight that, as a result of the selfish criminal stupidity of Ministers paid by Irish people to serve them, the enemies of the Irish people, the enemies of the unfortunate people in the North of Ireland, can now walk the streets claiming they were justified in all that they said when they argued that the campaign for civil rights, for human rights and for fundamental rights in that sad region was, in fact, an effort to undermine the authority of that State and was a deliberate effort by the Government and by the people to run into the ground the people who had the fortune of having the political majority in that truncated province for the past 50 years.  The real tragedy is that these people now where they had every reason to hope are tonight in darkest despair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last autumn, we in the Fine Gael Party tabled a motion which we asked the Taoiseach quite reasonably to take. I believe it is pertinent to remind the House of that motion and of our efforts <Col N="662" /> to have it discussed and voted upon. The motion read:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann formally rejects the use of force as an instrument to secure the unity of Ireland, welcomes the steps so far taken and promised to eliminate discrimination in Northern Ireland and looks forward to the establishment of full fundamental rights and freedom for everyone irrespective of religion or political opinion.</P>
    <P>That motion stands undiscussed to this day on the Order Paper of the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, and his Government refused to allow Dáil Éireann to declare itself as formally rejecting the use of force as an instrument to secure the unity of Ireland.  They refused to allow Dáil Éireann to welcome the steps so far taken and promised to eliminate discrimination in Northern Ireland. They refused to allow Dáil Éireann to express the hope that the establishment of full fundamental rights and freedom for everyone irrespective of religion or political opinion would soon operate in Northern Ireland.  In the light of the disclosures of these unhappy days it seems to me that the Taoiseach feared that if the motion were put the cat would have been let out of the bag and these disclosures which have shaken the nation to its roots and postponed for decades to come the unity of this country would have been made last October.  But like Mr. Micawber he was waiting for something to turn up and praying that the day of reckoning would never come.  Instead of reducing the evil consequences of what he knew or suspected was afoot he made the situation a great deal worse.  We were taunted for years past when we complained of low standards in high places and when we quoted the Minister for Industry and Commerce as expressing his concern about low standards in high places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and when we expressed our convictions and conveyed such information as we had, the Taoiseach invariably stood up and called on us to remain silent or produce the <Col N="663" /> proof.  Last night the proof was produced by Deputy Liam Cosgrave, leader of the Opposition.  It was only when the Taoiseach knew that proof was available to us that he accepted the inevitable realising that the game was up.  When the Taoiseach received the evidence, as he said, on 21st April did he inquire then how long the evidence had been in the possession of the Minister for Justice? Our information is that the evidence was available to the Minister for Justice for days before that, having being conveyed to him by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána but the file was suppressed and not brought by the Minister for Justice to the notice of the Taoiseach.  While the Taoiseach may be anxious to spare the Minister for Justice or may be anxious to reduce the involvement of a number of the members of the Government, the fact remains that the Minister for Justice was in possession of the information before the Taoiseach and the information was not conveyed by him to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach told us earlier this evening that he was stopped from going to the Minister for Finance to discuss the matter because of an unfortunate accident to the Minister for Finance.  He was not prevented by any illness or accident in the case of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Taoiseach did not, on his own statement tonight, interview the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries until he got clearance from the doctor of the Minister for Finance that it was safe to see him. Deputy Blaney had an extra week with which to play with fire or cover up his tracks if he got any indication that the Taoiseach was on his trail as inevitably he must then have suspected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people wondered why the Budget of this year was so lacking in an understanding of the financial and economic requirements of this country.  It is quite clear now that the answer was that the Minister for Finance did not have his mind on the job.  A man who was prepared to stake the very security of this country, the very existence of this State, to achieve his own peculiar ends is a <Col N="664" /> man who would not be in the least bit worried about the economic or financial ruin of this country.  It does cause some surprise to many people who accepted that Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland and possibly Deputy Moran might be involved in activities of this kind, that Deputy Charles Haughey should also be involved. Many of us were not surprised.  One can respect somebody who holds views and expresses them courageously but can one at all respect the double-talker, the smooth operator?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The involvement of Deputy Haughey, who has seldom declared any passionate concern for the people of Northern Ireland, can perhaps be understood as an interest on his part to use the arms that were to be imported not merely in Northern Ireland but in the South of Ireland as <Col N="665" /> well, because he was prepared to use an organisation which is recognised by the law and the majority of our people as an organisation concerned to undermine the very existence of this State. Yet that organisation was chosen and the directors of that organisation were personally paid by the men in question to bring into this State arms for what were clearly subversive purposes.</P>
      <P>But that is not all.  We have seen, as Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned, that the former Minister for Justice encouraged people in the commission of illegalities with an assurance that, if they did so, he would cover up for them.  In addition, there have been a number of cases brought to the notice of the Taoiseach and this House in which the Attorney General deliberately withdrew charges which were already before the courts.  There had been complaints by district justices that, where criminal charges against a person were withdrawn, no explanation was given to the courts.  Yet we now have a situation in which that Attorney General is presumably supposed to investigate the possible criminality of members of the Government.</P>
      <P>We have had evidence in this House that the former Deputy Martin Corry, a senior member of the Fianna Fáil Party, was involved in activities of bribery as a result of which it appears he was not, for the first time in his long career, a candidate for Fianna Fáil in the last general election.  What has since happened?  He has been honoured for his conduct by being appointed a director of a State company. When that matter was questioned here, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, said there was no better man for the position.</P>
      <P>We have had the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Charles Haughey, moving an amendment in this House to the taxation laws of this country and, within a short period, himself personally benefiting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were found unfit to be members of the Cabinet&mdash;including those who refused to resign and who threw back the Taoiseach's request&mdash; are prepared to give him their unqualified support.  The nation, in days to come, will look carefully to ascertain whether the price for their votes to maintain Fianna Fáil in office was not a guarantee of immunity to prosecution. If they had not given their support, the Government would have gone out of power and a new Government would have been in office in this country which would have prosecuted them for their criminal acts against the Irish nation.  Their only guarantee of immunity, of protection, was to give continuing support to the Government that was prepared to cover up for them.</P>
      <P>This amounts, then, to the tragic situation that we have not seen the end of low standards in high places but we have now sunk to a new &ldquo;low&rdquo; because it is quite clear that the Taoiseach for political reasons cannot afford to have these people prosecuted. The day they are prosecuted and charged means that the day comes near when they risk being convicted, imprisoned and disqualified from membership of this House&mdash;with inevitable by-elections which the Government will lose and and which will bring the Government toppling down and the Fianna Fáil Party to inevitable destruction once and for all.</P>
      <P>Here, we have this appalling, sickening, disgusting and frightening situation. All this has been done in a situation in which the unarmed law enforcement officers of this country, the Garda Síochána, have been obstructed and frustrated in the discharge of their duties for several years past.  The rate of resignation from the Garda Síochána has never been so high.</P>

      <P>A situation has been developing for several years past also in which the national Army has been allowed to run down.  Now we have the ironic situation in which the man mainly responsible&mdash;the Minister for Finance who withheld money from the Army&mdash;can now join in a sordid pact to pay £80,000 for the importation of arms from Vienna.  Last week, I had occasion to bring to the notice of the Dáil the activities of two gentlemen who purport to be members of a foreign trade mission.  It is significant that members of the Government endeavoured to prevent publication of the reports.  Perhaps it is not without some significance that Czechoslovakia is not far removed from Vienna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A week ago-48 hours ago&mdash;people would not have believed what has been disclosed tonight.  A great deal more has yet to be disclosed before the full truth of this sordid situation can come to light.  Internationally the reputation of this country stood exceedingly high in recent times, primarily due to the fact that in a situation in which it was expected we would make inflammatory, provocative and anti-British speeches we, the elected representatives of the free Irish people, maintained a responsible attitude and indicated that our primary concern was for the welfare of people.  We indicated that issues of national pride were of less consequence. As a result, the United Nations, the Council of Europe and every other body or organisation to which we sent delegates, respected our position.  The British people, who for years had an entirely wrong understanding of the northern situation, realised that there was an artificial majority in a section of this land who were quite improperly <Col N="668" /> using the powers of government available to them.  The British people realised that these people were acting in such a way without justification and because we acted reasonably and properly, the world accepted our good faith and accepted that we were not in any way wishful of forcing any section of the Irish people into a political situation to which they could not voluntarily and gladly subscribe.</P>
    <P>All that image is utterly and irrevocably destroyed today because of the unforgivable and unreasonable behaviour of at least four members of the Government who are already known.  One wonders just how many more are involved.  One name that has not been mentioned tonight but which was on the Garda Síochána notepaper is the name of Deputy Gibbons, the Minister for Defence.  One may ask why, when it was known and officially recognised that one Army officer was involved in this sordid affair, he was not dismissed but, instead, he was permitted to resign so that having committed this criminal folly against the nation, he could retire with a gratuity and a pension.  One wonders just how much more there is to be revealed and one prays that the day is not far distant when the term of office of this Government, who are prepared to sacrifice all principles to remain in office, will come to an end because they are clearly divided.  The Taoiseach and any people he may appoint can never rule this country with the authority of the people because the people would never have given their support to the conduct that has been revealed to us tonight.</P>

      <P>There has always been the impression that Fianna Fáil stood for certain principles.  They called themselves &ldquo;the National Party.&rdquo;  They claimed an intimate knowledge of the national question.  In fact, they claimed ownership of the national conscience in relation to re-unification.  At election time they berated their enemies for their anti-national position and they delved back into civil war history to prove who was patriotic and who was not. They were the custodians of patriotic and republican feeling.  That same party are now exposed and we had the Taoiseach coming in here with a shamefaced, snivelling submission that he had these people in his Cabinet.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien who has already spoken in this debate is a man who was maligned by that same Republican party not long ago at election time.  This weekend he returned from a visit to the northern part of the country and in his sober prediction of events there, he warned of the impending danger this summer.  He pointed to an alarming situation which could only lead to an armed conflict.  This Government who, last August, took on the task of educating the people on this side of the Border on the realities and complexities of the situation in the north, have evidently given up the task at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Tralee the Taoiseach stated how we must follow the path of peace if we wished to reconcile differences between <Col N="670" /> Catholic and Protestant in the northern part of our country.  Without going into the details of this latest event, since he made that speech the Taoiseach has had ample evidence, from their public utterances, of who in his Cabinet did not share his views.  The story now revealed reads like a thriller magazine. Without any nod from the Special Branch or without any notification from Deputy Cosgrave, the Taoiseach had ample evidence a few months ago in various speeches of the members of his Cabinet who did not agree with his policy on the north.  These same people held their posts until they were discovered in their own dangerous and anti-national practices by Deputy Cosgrave within the past two days.</P>
    <P>This Government and this Taoiseach assumed the duty of leading public opinion on this side of the Border&mdash; public opinion that had been misled in the past in regard to this problem of the north.  The same Fianna Fáil Party have shared in further misleading the people on this side of the Border were misleading people in suggesting there was a simple solution to that problem.  One could say, in fairness to them, that Sinn Féin traditionally misunderstood the situation in that part of our country, that the founding fathers of Republicanism, the early revolutionaries in the early part of this century, did not fully understand the differences which existed between Catholic and Protestant and which ante-date the institution of partition.</P>
    <P>This Government and this Taoiseach officially took on the arduous task of educating public opinion on this side of the Border to the view that the path of peace must be pursued if true reconciliation was to be achieved between Catholic and Protestant.  We now find that almost a quarter of the Cabinet were involved in a policy totally opposed and at variance with that stated policy of the Taoiseach. How can this party claim here tonight that it is a national party?  How can this party claim that it is or was honest in attempting to lead the Irish people to ultimate unity?  They cannot claim that.  They are exposed as people who <Col N="671" /> would not scruple to have recourse to any formulae to hold on to office, to hold on to their majority.</P>
    <P>We had the extraordinarily pathetic patch-up this afternoon.  In fact, it was reminiscent of many Unionist Party meetings, when they came out to say that all was unity within the ranks.  How many sad meetings of Unionists have there been after which their Whip or their leader for the time being said: &ldquo;All within the Unionist Party is well&rdquo;?  Fianna Fáil in many ways remind me tonight of the Unionist Party in their manner of facing this crisis of unity within their ranks.</P>
    <P>What is the stock of this Government in London tonight?  In fact, what is the stock of this Government in Belfast tonight?  Some members of this Government have been publicly amused by the strain on the Stormont administration in recent months.  I wonder are there smiles on the faces of certain well-known Unionists tonight?</P>
    <P>There is a serious situation facing all of us, we think, later this year.  There are people on this side of the Border and on the other side who believe that a policy of force can yet settle this whole situation.  All of us, before this year is out, may be engulfed in the results of such folly.  This Government, this democratically elected Government, are themselves guilty; they themselves will have participated in the preparation for that whirlwind by the events that have been unfolded this day.</P>
    <P>I hope that on Friday we will uncover the background of this plot, that we will discover who were the other people who aided and abetted this attempt by the Cabinet Ministers named, because not one Member sitting on those benches can be free of the proven guilt of these Ministers.  These Ministers did not act in isolation. These Ministers had support from within that party; and there are many members of that party tonight who spoke in different accents, who gave different advice, in the earlier months of this year and last year.  These men tonight have slid out from behind their former friends.  It is our advice to the Taoiseach tonight that he cannot <Col N="672" /> confine the problem and the division in Fianna Fáil to four Cabinet Ministers; it is all around him.</P>
    <P>This can, without exaggeration, be described as a national crisis.  The clock has been put back in bringing to the people of this part of our country an understanding of the real problems facing us in that area if we are serious. The only way in which unity can be achieved is by reconciliation between Catholic and Protestant.  Fianna Fáil tonight fulfil all the expectations Mr. Paisley could have of this part of the country.  They have put back the ultimate unity of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In the national crisis facing the Government and all of us today I am proud to say I am a member of a party that has always put country before party.  I am proud to say that the leader of our party rendered a public service last night by going at 8 o'clock to the Taoiseach and prodding the Taoiseach into doing his duty. What else could we expect from the leader of our party, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, the son of W.T. Cosgrave, who helped to build up this country over 50 years ago when other people were trying to destroy it?  Fifty years later on 5th May, 1970, we have our present leader, the son of that great man, again playing a noble part by going to the Taoiseach and making him do his duty.  By so doing he saved our country from perhaps another civil war, because if those people had been allowed to continue it would certainly end in civil war and the slaughter of our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is collective responsibility in the present Fianna Fáil Government&mdash; and we have heard much of collective responsibility over the years&mdash;then the present Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, stands condemned along with Deputy Blaney, Deputy Haughey and Deputy Moran, because if he was informed or if he knew, as leader of the party, as he should have known, what was going on for the last year&mdash;and, God knows, he got warnings enough in this House&mdash;then he should have taken action and should have dismissed those people from his Cabinet not today, not yesterday, but many years ago. <Col N="673" /> We are inclined to ask what has been done to stop the drift to anarchy that has existed in this country for the past few years.  He is guilty, I claim, of culpable negligence.  He was warned on numerous occasions by the leader of our party and by many other people on this side of the House; yet he took no action until last night when he was prodded into it by the leader of our party.</P>
    <P>After a meeting of this discredited party, at which the Taoiseach informed them that he had information that members of the Cabinet were engaged in gun-running, we are now told that they have papered up all the cracks and that they are coming before us a united party.  They come before this country a discredited party, a party that should resign and face the wrath of the electorate.  They are not prepared to do that because there is too much at stake and because they want to stay close to the loot for as long as they possibly can.  The message that went out to the Fianna Fáil meeting this evening was: &ldquo;Boys, don't rock the boat.  If any of you rock the boat you will expose us all and we will all sink together.  Don't do that.  Too much will be exposed.&rdquo;  It would have been exposed but instead of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because they are greedy for power, because they want to hold on to power, they unite to save themselves and to save their own skins.  The people of Ireland deserve better today than that type of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated on many occasions in this House that there is a drift towards anarchy in this country.  We have one law for the rich, for the spectacular, for the racketeer and for the Tacateer.  We have far too much interference with the Garda in the execution of their duty.  They have been frustrated and stopped from doing their duty on many occasions.  We have interference by politicians with the judiciary in the execution of their duty. While those questions were raised on numerous occasions in this House the <Col N="674" /> Taoiseach stood idly by and he either pretended that he did not know what was going on or he knew and did not care or was not prepared to take any action.  He, no more than the others, did not want to rock the boat.  There has been a breakdown in law and order.  The Garda have been frustrated in trying to carry out their duty and indeed cases, as other people here can tell, have been withdrawn by direction of the Attorney General and different Ministers for Justice.  For far too long we have had what Deputy Colley spoke about and warned about three or four years ago when speaking in Galway &mdash;&ldquo;low standards in high places&rdquo;. It seems the Taoiseach was prepared to allow it to continue until he was prodded by Deputy Cosgrave, the leader of the Opposition, into taking action.  I want to say that members of this party have a right to speak about public order.  Deputy Tom O'Higgins stated that one Member gave his life when nobly and fearlessly performing his duty as Minister for Justice.  Indeed, a number of our Deputies were murdered for their forthright speeches.  We founded the institutions of this State of which we are all so justly proud.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána have been much maligned.  They were hindered and prevented from doing their duty in apprehending the bank robbers when they could have.  They knew where they were and they appealed to the Government to implement section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act but they refused to do that.  How could you expect of Cabinet to allow the Garda Síochána to do their duty when at the same time members of that particular Cabinet were importing from Vienna five to six tons of small arms, revolvers and ammunition?  You could not expect that Government to help the Garda.  They hindered the Garda in the execution of their duty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave on the 14th January this year dealt with this matter very comprehensively but even after that the Taoiseach took no action despite the fact that he knew the drift to anarchy was there.  If the Government had the ability, or even the will, <Col N="675" /> fearlessly to discharge the duty and the responsibility entrusted to them by the people, why did the Taoiseach not go on television and denounce those cowardly murderers?  Although they may be dressed in green they are nothing else but murderers.  Why did he not go on television and denounce them?  Why did he not denounce all those bank robbers and appeal for the co-operation of the people?  Why did he not denounce them as he denounced the farmers in 1967?  He could not denounce them because his own Cabinet was divided and in his own Cabinet he had Ministers who were breaking the law and were trying illegally to import arms.</P>
    <P>I want to put certain questions to the Taoiseach.  If he believes in law and order and if he wanted to stop the drift towards anarchy why were men shown on television illegally carrying arms and firing live ammunition in Mullingar on a particular date?  With all the responsibility I can command I want to put this question to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy called me an arch-anarchist the other day. Look behind you and you will see where the arch-anarchists are.  They are not on this side of the House.  They are on your side and you condoned them and hid them as long as you could.  I want to ask the Taoiseach is it true that those people were armed, that they fired live ammunition and on the next day the Garda authorities in Mullingar sent the file to the Minister for Justice and said: &ldquo;We know the men, we are prepared to arrest them, we are prepared to act.  Give us the word to go ahead&rdquo;.  Is it not true that file has been ignored, that there has been no reply?  Is that law and order?  Is that not a drift towards anarchy?  What have you done to prevent it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to ask the Taoiseach if it is not true that members of the Garda Síochána were fired on by people who had participated in a bank raid, that when they were brought before the court the Attorney General was not ready to go ahead with the case and that they had got a garda to go sick <Col N="676" /> and produced a doctor's certificate knowing that the particular judge would not accept a doctor's certificate, that he would want a doctor there prepared to swear the man was ill?  When the judge refused to accept the doctor's certificate is it not true that the State then withdrew the case, that those men walked out scot free and now some of them are being sought for the murder of Garda Fallon?  Is that not a drift towards anarchy?  Was that helping the gardaí of our country, unarmed men, men we are proud of, who had arrested those thugs and taken them to the court only to find that through neglect, or just because some of those thugs had been dressed in green, parading as Republicans, the Government were not prepared to take action against them? Is that not a drift towards anarchy which the Taoiseach has condoned over the past few months?</P>
    <P>Is it not true that today agitators are challenging people's personal and property rights, that they strut the streets daily with increasing insolence and there is nothing done about it?  There is no effort made to enforce law and order.  Surely if there is law and order people's personal property, whether we agree or disagree that they should have it, should be protected by the elected Government of this State?  Does the Taoiseach believe it should be protected, and if he so believes why did he or his Minister for Justice not take action and why has not one single person been arrested for any of those episodes?  There have been at least 15, 20 or 30 of those cases over the last few months.  Ancient monuments are blown up and all that happens is that the taxpayers pay for the damage.  Is it not true that the illegal organisations issue impudent statements which are duly published?  We ask people from abroad to invest their money here but when they do we refuse to protect them from vicious arson and other crimes which are all too common in our country today.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is supposed to hold collective responsibility and is in charge of the Government.  Is it not true that six men were arrested in Donegal, in a house in the heart of the country, and in that house there were hundredweights <Col N="677" /> of explosives which would blow up half of Donegal, stenguns, brenguns, revolvers, bombs, timebombs and ammunition of different descriptions? The Taoiseach can smile.  He has stood by idly and smiled at all those things which have been happening over the last year but as Taoiseach he should be serious.  If he is elected to the important post of Taoiseach he should govern and see there is law and order in the country.  I want to ask him is it not true that when those people were brought to court the prosecutions were not pressed by direction of the Attorney General.  They were allowed out under the Probation of Offenders Act.  Is it not true that at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis numerous speakers complimented Deputy Blaney, the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, for ensuring that none of those gallant Republicans was sent to jail and that he saved them?  This happened and it was reported in the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>As a party we are proud of our achievements.  We established the basic institutions of this State, with a trowel in one hand and a gun in the other. We do not want to see that happening again because we all admit that the divisions created by the Civil War are only now dying out.  If those men in Fianna Fáil got their way and if Deputy Cosgrave had not taken action last night they would still be members of the Cabinet.  Let us not forget that, on the day before yesterday, the Fianna Fáil Whips and the Taoiseach wanted the motion to appoint Deputy O'Malley as Minister for Justice to be taken yesterday.  If we had agreed to take the motion the Deputy would have been appointed and nothing else would have happened.  However, Deputy Cosgrave, with the information he had, refused to agree but waited to see if the Taoiseach would take action.  When he saw the Taoiseach was not man enough to take action he saw it was necessary to prod him into doing something.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins and other speakers who have said that people who draw the State's money and who, instead of working for it, try to introduce civil war into this country, should be behind lock and <Col N="678" /> key.  It is the first principle of a civilised society that its guns are under the lock and key of the lawfully elected authority of the State.  We are the elected representatives of the people and through us, in this Parliament alone, should basic national decisions be made.  Had the Taoiseach done his duty in the last year this crisis would not now exist.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken on the drift towards anarchy and I have questioned the Taoiseach as to his and the Government's part in allowing this accelerating drift towards chaos to continue. We have seen men who do not belong to the Defence Forces wearing uniforms and carrying arms and they are allowed to remain free.  They even appeared on our television screens. This open contempt for the law produced, until last night, only a frightened silence.  I should like to know why statements of illegal organisations were permitted to be published. We have been told we have only one Army and we should have only one Army in this State.  There have been many cases of arson in the last year or so and I do not think one person has been arrested for those crimes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is guilty of dereliction of duty.  He informed us today that on Monday, 20th April, he knew of the crimes being prepetrated by his own Ministers.  He told us that he asked them to resign on Wednesday, 29th April, and that they asked for time.  I should like to know if any other criminal would be given time? Surely the Taoiseach knows that when Deputy Blaney made his famous Letterkenny speech and other speeches they were certainly at variance with the policy of the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>We have had the sorry spectacle of the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on television. When the Taoiseach said that he had reprimanded the Minister&mdash; and he stated it here in the Dáil also &mdash;the Minister turned to him and said &ldquo;I do not think you reprimanded me, Jack; you just said something to me passing by in the corridor&rdquo;.  If that is the way this State has been run up to the present it is no wonder that this <Col N="679" /> country is faced with the present crisis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney has made many declarations of revolt.  I should like to refer specifically to an interview given by Deputy Blaney, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 27th April, in which he acclaimed the view expressed by somebody speaking in Derry that, if the use of arms was justified in maintaining partition, then the people of the Six Counties could claim the right to undo it by like means.  The person in Derry to whom Deputy Blaney referred was a Mr. Seán Ó Cionnaith of Sinn Féin who made that speech on Easter Sunday in Dungiven at a Republican commemoration.  That speech was headlined in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 30th March as a battle-cry by Sinn Féin, which in fact it was. We had Deputy Blaney agreeing with this statement, and yet the Taoiseach did not take any action against him.</P>
    <P>The leader of our party and many other Deputies have spoken about the drift towards anarchy.  I should like to quote from a speech I made on 10th April, which was quoted in all the papers on 11th April:</P>
    <P>When a senior Minister of State is seen to incite armed action in Northern Ireland then inevitably he is encouraging young men south of the Border to take the law into their own hands.  If certain people are to act on Mr. Blaney's utterances, as they surely will act, it follows logically that they must furnish themselves with arms and money. The consequences may well be more bank robberies, bloodshed and loss of life in the Republic as well as in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>  I continued:</P>
    <P>One wonders whether Mr. Blaney realises the tragedies he may beget by his irresponsible statements.</P>
    <P>I also stated:</P>
    <P>This is the time for plain speaking and it is my duty to say that Mr. Blaney's latest declaration should coerce any Taoiseach, however gentle or quiet he may be by nature, to remove him from the Cabinet. Even if action now results in a public split in the Fianna Fáil Party, there <Col N="680" /> are members of that Party who would wish to put country before Fianna Fáil and the Government is assured of the full support of Fine Gael for policies of law enforcement and the policy of uniting Ireland by peaceful means only.  The country can pay and is paying too high a price for Mr. Lynch's policy of peace in Fianna Fáil....  Where there is revolt and patent division in the highest council of the State it cannot be long until there is anarchy in the streets and outrages such as last Friday's murder in Dublin of a gallant servant of the people will surely follow.  In those circumstances who is exploiting his trust&mdash;the Taoiseach or I?</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach was doing his duty, then he should have taken action not last night, when he was prodded into it by Deputy Cosgrave, but at least a year ago or, perhaps, a little more.</P>
      <P>I oppose the nomination of Deputy Desmond O'Malley as Minister for Justice.  The person nominated should be one of the best in the Government because he is being asked to take charge of a very important Ministry. This newcomer to public affairs is being given one of the most difficult tasks that could be imposed upon any Minister. Any man appointed to this post should be above reproach.  We have had some unhappy experiences of occupants of this post in the past but, perhaps, the less said about that the better.  I may speak about it on some other occasion.  I claim this man is not fit to occupy this Ministry.  I have a letter here which was sent to the Taoiseach by a Fianna Fáil man:</P>

      <P>All the Taoiseach can say is &ldquo;Ssh&rdquo; and you cannot even hear him.  He is not prepared to take any other action because he must keep the Deputy in the party.  He cannot <Col N="682" /> afford to rock the boat because the Deputy would expose too much and so would others in the party.  The letter continues:</P>
      <P>The guards were then called.  A garda arrived and was told by O'Malley that if he reported the case he (O'Malley) would see that he (the guard) would be relieved of his duty and stripped of his uniform.</P>
      <P>That is happening not just now but for the last 15 or 20 years, as long as Fianna Fáil have been in power, and the Taoiseach and the present Ministers close their eyes to it.  The letter goes on:</P>
      <P>This unfortunate incident is the topic of conversation at the moment in Limerick and it must surely have its repercussions on our Party image.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I share no sense of pride or pleasure in making any contribution to this debate this evening. It is no particular pleasure to me, as it seems to be to some Deputies, to see the leader of any national political party in this country, more particularly <Col N="686" /> of a political party which objectively it must be said has made a long and an honourable contribution to the evolution of this State, in the dock.  It is no particular pleasure to me to see the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, in the dock at the bar of this House this evening.  Therefore, I make one plea at the end of this debate, that is, that public comment on this quite reprehensible episode should be objective and that there should not be any outbreak of emotion or hysteria arising from this incident.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable, disastrous to our parliamentary institutions, that there should have occurred an unforgivable breach of personal confidence towards the Taoiseach by his own closest parliamentary colleagues.  I personally &mdash;and I am sure this sentiment is shared by many members of the House&mdash;would offer to him, not in any gratuitous or snide way, the sympathy and understanding of the vast majority of the Irish people for the fact that he should have been let down so badly by fellow Irishmen in a quite disgraceful manner, which has caused considerable shock and national shame.</P>
      <P>It is important that he should try to make amends.  We have to examine the amends which the Taoiseach has made to the Irish people north and south, to the people of this island as a whole, to the people of this nation. He has made amends in so far as he has removed from office Ministers of State, his closest colleagues, who in the heat of political battle have been so very close to him as we have witnessed over the past decade.  We must support him in that removal, painful and embarrassing and profoundly disturbing as its consequences will be to the Irish people north and south.  He is deserving of our support and our commendation in that small measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally important that in our analysis of the situation there should not arise any further cause of disenchantment such as has existed in many sectors of the community, with parliamentary democracy, and disillusionment with all political parties. Therefore there should be further decisive action on the part of the <Col N="687" /> Taoiseach to ensure that the position is not eroded further and that the 144 Members of this House, acting with collective responsibility, would not fall into general disrepute.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, therefore, is faced with a painful series of alternatives. I, personally, do not think that it is a satisfactory solution that Deputy Haughey, Deputy Blaney, Deputy Boland, should go to the back benches of Fianna Fáil.  I consider it unhygienic and not in the best interests of Fianna Fáil that that should happen, if I may say so genuinely and sincerely.  I consider that it would be undesirable for the development of parliamentary democracy that the Fianna Fáil Party should be made hostages to fortune by the decision of three or four backbenchers who are now taking out massive insurance policies in the expectation that&mdash;as we pray will not happen&mdash;there should be further escalation of difficulties in Northern Ireland. This has always been the attitude of Deputy Blaney, a general overtone, and it has always been, inherently, the attitude of Deputy Boland, to say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;We told you that it was going to happen and we were right&rdquo;.  Now they have gone to the back benches with inherently the same attitudes of introverted and perverted patriotism, if I may use such strong terms.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, essential, as we do not, frankly, have confidence in his administration at this point of time, for the Taoiseach, if he wishes to purge the collective guilt of his Government, the collective irresponsibility, to consider whether he would be wise to remove them from the Parliamentary Party of Fianna Fáil and to have by-elections and, if their constituencies deem them to have acted honourably and if the national executive of Fianna Fáil deem them to be worthy of nomination for their respective constituencies, let the people judge.  This, at least, could be a mark of honour on the part of Deputies Blaney, Boland and Haughey that they would resign their seats and let us see what the Irish people think and let them make <Col N="688" /> their collective expression of the repugnance which most certainly the Taoiseach has conveyed and which most certainly the leaders of the Opposition parties have expressed in no uncertain manner.</P>
    <P>It is a salutary and a bitter lesson for the Irish people from the point of view of the development of collective parliamentary responsibility.  It is the function of the Dáil to frame policy. It is the function of the Dáil to carry out policy, irrespective of whether or not we like the particular policy in our individual capacities as Members of Dáil Éireann.  That is our function as elected public representatives.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of note that the three or four front bench members of the Fianna Fáil Party, now relegated to the back benches, contravened Article 28 of the Constitution which clearly lays it down that it is the sole function of Dáil Éireann to determine whether or not armed force will be used.  They have repudiated the Constitution and, having done so, in any self-respecting parliamentary democracy, these men would go and, if they refuse to go, then there is an obligation on the leader of the Government to go to the country, making sure that these men will not in future ever again participate in Irish parliamentary life.</P>
    <P>I frankly get no pleasure whatsoever in this particular denunciation of Deputy Haughey, or Deputy Boland, or Deputy Blaney.  It must go on the records of this House that we have lost in Deputy Haughey, much as we may disagree with his budgetary strategy, a man of talent, expertise and charm, a man who is a profound loss to Irish parliamentary life.  He committed a disgraceful and unforgivable error of judgment, as he said himself at the party meeting, of an emotional nature. He committed a grave breach of confidence but it must go on the record that he is a profound loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest I be permitted to conclude my comments.  I find it very difficult to conjure up any sympathy for Deputy Boland.  I do not believe the man has been well judging him in the light of his political attitudes over the past four or five years.  He has been much too emotional and unobjective to hold Cabinet rank. Frankly, I think the Taoiseach should have severed his involvement with him several years ago.  His attitude became particularly noticeable during the PR campaign.  Charity forbids me to comment further.</P>
      <P>With regard to the nomination of Deputy O'Malley, I certainly subscribe to some of the strictures voiced by Deputy L'Estrange.  I do not go along with his Governor Reagan slick analysis of Irish political anarchy, but I feel his remarks in regard to Deputy O'Malley may prove true.</P>
      <P>There was a serious error of judgment on the part of the Taoiseach in allowing Deputy Moran to hold office as Minister for Justice for the past 12 months and, had we a different Minister for Justice, it might well be that we would not have tonight the predicament in which the Taoiseach finds himself, having literally to scout around the security apparatus of the State to find out what his colleagues were up to.  I have the highest respect and regard for the Minister for Defence, Deputy Gibbons, and in matters of national security there is now and there will be in the future an obligation on the Minister for Defence, so far as national security permits, to keep the House fully informed of all aspects of his particular responsibility.</P>
      <P>It is only right that we should place on record the loyal support of our Army, of our police force and of our public servants generally.  While certain individuals may not measure up, it must be placed on record that the vast majority have never failed in loyalty and service to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the time has now come when the Taoiseach might crack the whip.  I am a little disturbed at the thought of the new Minister for <Col N="690" /> Justice, with the support of erstwhile Cabinet colleagues, introducing a Criminal Justice Bill.  I do not propose to deal in detail with that particular aspect.  I suggest there should be a close examination of activities about which we warned the Taoiseach in October last.  At column 1551 of volume 241 of the Official Report I said:</P>
    <P>... I would suggest that the Government might investigate some reports that money has been passed in certain quarters....</P>
    <P>I also said that some Cabinet Ministers were fostering movements in certain parts of Northern Ireland.  The activities of Deputy Blaney were no secret to those of us who are members of this House.  The attitude of Deputy Boland did not call for very much analysis.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach still has a great deal of explaining to do.  He has a great deal of educating to do in his own party.  We are all anti-Partition.  We are all hoping and working for the ultimate reunification of the country.  The Taoiseach was led a merry dance by members of his own Cabinet and by a great many of the delegates at his own Ard-Fheis. I did not particularly notice any great rallying of Fianna Fáil to Deputy Lynch on that particular occasion. Indeed, the silence of certain people was particularly noticeable.  It was obvious they were waiting to see which way the ball would hop.  The ball has hopped and the internal dilemma of the Fianna Fáil Party is not resolved by merely shuffling a number of Ministers to the back benches.  A great deal more remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Last October, too, when the Taoiseach repeated his rejection of the use of force, I said I would like to have confirmation of that policy from those associated with him in the Cabinet.  I said that assurance was overdue. Deputy Blaney came into this House and looked at us with an enigmatic smile and said nothing.  I gave Deputy Haughey credit for greater political percipience, but he, too, did not go on record.  Deputy Boland went red with temper and left the House; he did not go on record.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to see political <Col N="691" /> history written in the context of &ldquo;Captain Terence Lynch&rdquo;.  It would be a tragedy for the Irish people if we should have a development in the Republic of the Parliamentary disarray and shuffling that went on in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Fianna Fáil Government can survive with the blackmail which will go on over the next six months or year, or three or four years, in Dáil Éireann, with men of the calibre of Deputy Boland, Deputy Haughey, Deputy Blaney and other Members, a number of whom I met in this House this evening, who frankly support them, and they know it, and who will cause further trouble and difficulties for the Fianna Fáil Party in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It may be an excruciating exercise for the Irish people to have to face a general election in that setting.  It would be no pleasure to have to go through the shades of republican ideology at the church gates in such a campaign. The Taoiseach should seriously consider the motion of no confidence which is placed before him and which deserves the total attention of the members of the Cabinet now supporting him.  This should be done objectively. If it is done and if the Taoiseach accepts there has been a failure in confidence, failure in anticipation and in total frankness with the House on this occasion on the part of the Cabinet and on his own part, it is, I think, only the Irish people who can judge that at the polls.  I strongly commend this course of action to the Taoiseach. I have no desire to spend 1970, 1971, 1972 and the early part of 1973 wondering what new permutation of party political activities Deputy Boland, Deputy Haughey or Deputy Blaney may be thinking up for the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Haughey left the Department of Finance this morning he told his staff: &ldquo;I will be back.&rdquo;  This is a measure of the disunity within the party which certainly does not give hope for effective political administration in the years ahead.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that the insurance policy which Deputy Boland with his simultaneous resignation took out should be cashed in this House tonight.  Otherwise <Col N="692" /> the British Government will seek explanations. I do not particularly care what the British Government may think but I am conscious that the Minister for External Affairs will have to give explanations in certain quarters, to the British Government and what is left of the Northern Ireland Government, the members of Stormont, in that some members of the Northern Ireland Government have been involved in this arms proposition with members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  I suggest that the people of these areas cannot any longer repose confidence in the collective opinion of this State and therefore the only logical solution is to have a general election.  The Taoiseach should face that situation.</P>
    <P>It may seem repetitive but I would urge the Taoiseach to reconsider his nomination for the Department of Justice. I do not think we need a stronger man.  I do not particularly want men of the strength, character and attitude and political dogmatism of Deputy Ó Moráin.  Age, in that respect, does not give one any particular lack of this and I think that I have detected this already in some of the overtones and attitudes of Deputy O'Malley, much as I detest having to give prejudgments on prospective Ministers.</P>
    <P>I make these comments because I feel deeply on the subject.  My father was a founder member of Fianna Fáil and he left the Fianna Fáil Party in the thirties.  He was there long before Deputy Leneghan was heard of.  It would not be my desire as a Member of the House to see any political party destroyed.  When I had a political choice to make I did not join Fianna Fáil because I had become disillusioned with some of the manifestations of political autocracy, totality and domination I had seen in that party.  One is given many opportunities to feather one's nest if one wants to be involved with the Fianna Fáil Party.  I say in sincerity and congratulation that Deputy Cosgrave, my political colleague in my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, has done a service to the House and the Irish people tonight.  Therefore, I think there is an obligation on the Taoiseach to reciprocate the trust of the Irish people.  We in the Labour Party, in <Col N="693" /> tabling this motion, are acting in a responsible manner and we are suggesting that the Taoiseach should go to the country.  Distasteful and counterproductive in many ways as a general election may be, such a course of action is desirable on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I make these observations on these matters because I feel it is time that Fianna Fáil implemented&mdash;to put it bluntly&mdash;the policies enunciated only a few years ago by Eamon de Valera on 8th March, 1957, as quoted in the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera said: &ldquo;We think force is not the real solution.  We do not want to coerce anybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the same press conference, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i>, on 9th March, 1957.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera said that real unity could not be achieved by the use of force.</P>
    <P>I had thought that Deputy Boland and, above all, Deputy Haughey with his association with the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, who acted in such a perceptive way in many respects on the question of national unity, would have learned their lessons and would not act in an adolescent, politically disastrous manner and in a manner which, as far as we are concerned, means that they will go down in Irish history as a crowd of political musketeers with no ammunition left to them.</P>
    <P>These are the views of the Labour Party.  The Fianna Fáil Party at this point of time have a greater duty to the Irish nation than just staying in office hoping the clouds will pass in a year or two and that Deputy Blaney, Deputy Boland and Deputy Haughey and any other incipient political blackmailers in that party&mdash;and they are there and we know them; they will be named in due course&mdash;will be rehabilitated. I dislike the language of the overkill almost as much as I dislike some of the overkill overtones of Deputy L'Estrange in some of his comments but it is time that the Taoiseach showed the steel and the fibre which he has claimed he possesses and that there was a quick kill within his <Col N="694" /> own party of this type of political anarchy.  It is high time for this act of political hygiene.  I think it would do the Irish people, in many respects, a great deal of good and be good also for Parliamentary democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context I want to quote certain words.  We had a debate here last October about the North of Ireland.  I want to quote the words of Deputy Andrews in that debate.  He said:</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that the Taoiseach, our political leader, the political leader, by the way of all political parties, the political leader of this Dáil, the political leader of this Republic has been universally applauded for the decent and responsible manner in which he handled the whole tragic situation which exists in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>To the extent that the Taoiseach is my Taoiseach, as he is the Taoiseach of everyone in this Republic, it is not just Fianna Fáil who must be ashamed.  I feel that the vast majority of Irish people at the moment are deeply and personally ashamed because when somebody stands up here in the dignity of his office and tells us something, tells it explicitly, I do not say that we are bound to believe it, but the whole influence of the office and the tradition of the respect due to another Deputy or a Minister or our Parliamentary institution all tend to compel us to take the word of that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not for me to say specifically that X is a liar or Y is a liar.  I am at the stage&mdash;and many people are at <Col N="696" /> the stage at the moment&mdash;of saying that perhaps they are liars or perhaps they are just stupid.  We have no way of knowing that they are telling us the truth any more.  It is jargon to say that credibility has disappeared, that there is a credibility gap, but we have no way of knowing, when we are told something with all the dignity of ministerial office, whether it is true and we say to ourselves: &ldquo;Well, perhaps.&rdquo; Perhaps the fullness of time will reveal something else.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Taoiseach that the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Ó Moráin, had no connection with these events that his retirement was due to considerations of health.  I can only say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;.  That will be revealed in the fullness of time.  I am not at the stage&mdash;and I say this with great regret; I know I speak for probably a majority of the people when I say it&mdash;when I will necessarily believe it any more. We have been told an extraordinary collection of things in the past two or three weeks from official organs of the State.  We were told there were no shots fired outside Leinster House.  I can only say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;.  We were told&mdash; and I have to say this is not in any way a reflection on the person as a person and if he was unfortunate he has all our sympathy&mdash;that Deputy Haughey fell off his horse.  I can only say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;.  We are told that whoever murdered a member of the Garda recently cannot be apprehended by the best efforts of our Garda authorities. Perhaps.  We have got to the stage where possibly there are other explanations and where possibly, in fact, all these seemingly scattered events fit together into what is a conspiracy that undermines the very basis of democracy.</P>
    <P>That is why at this moment the crisis is as serious as previous speakers have said it is.  That is why it is the most serious crisis in the life of this State since it was established.  We are asked to admire the sense of party solidarity and the sense of political professionalism which can paper over the cracks that have appeared in the Fianna Fáil Party in the past 48 hours or, in fact, that appeared a bit earlier. This is not peculiar to any political <Col N="697" /> party in this House and it is not peculiar to this time.  The papering over of cracks at the expense of principle, quite apart from the way it degrades the party who do it, and quite apart from the way it therefore necessarily degrades the whole nation, is something that inevitably comes unstuck very quickly.</P>
    <P>There was a time, we are told, when Romans who lost their honour went out and killed themselves, but the striking thing today is that nobody of the 74 or 75, not one, has the honour to sacrifice his own political career. That is the extraordinary situation we have.  It is an instance of the sort of unity that can be based on total abandonment to self-interest and, therefore, it is the sort of unity which in its ultimate is totally at variance with the needs of this nation.  If they were worthy to represent the nation they would tell the truth about their disarray and they might then emerge with great difficulty but with some honour and with a future.  As they stand now, they have neither.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to say a word about what the Taoiseach did when he became aware of the activities of two or three, or perhaps more, persons. We are not quite clear yet exactly how he became aware of these activities. The fullness of time may produce the timetable, but a great deal can be obliterated by the workings of an entire State machine.  However, we may become aware of the steps by which the Taoiseach became aware of these events; and we may have a feeling about the order of the extraordinary timetable the Taoiseach gave today, starting on 20th April, before the Budget.  We will discover, perhaps, how these events came to his notice.</P>
    <P>However, after more than three weeks the Taoiseach has now acted and we will be discussing the reasons for his action in a minute.  In the meantime, let us look at what he has done. He has taken away ministerial office from two persons who refused to accept his request to surrender them.  But he has not taken away the whip or tried to do so.  They are still members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party <Col N="698" /> and they are still members&mdash;and I have heard of no call for their removal&mdash; of the Fianna Fáil Party as distinct from the Parliamentary Party.  There has been no mention of intention to have them removed from membership of this House which they have dishonoured.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what it boils down to is that through their alleged activities&mdash; let us try to be judicial about them&mdash; they contravened a number of laws, yet the Taoiseach's reaction has been merely to say: &ldquo;You cannot go on being Ministers&rdquo;.  He has not said to them: &ldquo;If the allegations are true and they are of such a profoundly serious nature, you neither can go on being members of this party or of this House; if the allegations are true you have placed yourselves outside the realms of what is acceptable in Irish public life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then, we have to ask why did the Taoiseach take only the steps he has taken?  The answer is perfectly simple &mdash;to retain power.  It does not matter about the seriousness of the actions; it does not matter about the betrayal of the Taoiseach by them; it does not matter about deceiving the national Parliament: the reason for this reaction of the Taoiseach is that if he did not have these Deputies he could not hang on to the levers of power which apparently have, for their own sake, become so desirable.  It does not matter how the levers of power can be made to serve other people.  All that matters is how they can be made to serve themselves and the pleasure the command of these levers can give to them.</P>
    <P>It is possible to believe that the Taoiseach did not know of those activities before 20th April.  We on this side of the House are reluctant to read into the record rumours which we cannot substantiate and, of course, we do not have the mechanism of the public service to investigate them.  However, it is common knowledge that rumours of this sort, some of them more circumstantial than others, have had fairly wide circulation since last August.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach assures us that this was the only case of smuggling of arms. However, there are many fairly circumstantial rumours.  Were I in a position to be able to control the activities of <Col N="699" /> the police force and the security section of the Army, I could have uncovered a lot a long time ago, were it my intention to do so.  But the Taoiseach says with the authority of his office, speaking to this House, that that was the only event.  I am bound to say I am not convinced.  We recall the Taoiseach, speaking earlier on, in the first stormy debates that followed the choosing by him of his Cabinet after the present Dáil assembled, enunciating the principle of responsibility inside the Cabinet&mdash;the responsibility of all the Ministers for all the decisions, and specifically his responsibility as Taoiseach for what his Government did.</P>
    <P>Therefore, let us put it to three members of his party.  First of all, there is the Minister for Local Government. Then there is the Minister for Justice&mdash;a very sensitive post in this respect.  Deputy Haughey and Deputy Blaney are people not just intimately associated with the Government at the very highest level.  They are intimately associated with the party structure. They are the machine men of the party, much more so than even the Taoiseach himself.  The degree of duplicity, of willingness to deceive one's colleagues and those who share the great responsibility and honour of being a Minister, surely puts into question not alone the actions of these people themselves but the honour and truth with which the whole of our local government apparatus has been administered.  It puts into question the credibility and honour of the whole party structure, in which these people have been the most powerful figures. What we are uncovering and discussing now is not just a rot of a few people inside the Cabinet, but the rot of a whole party, both of a Government and of a party structure.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to look ahead&mdash; with not much time to think about it &mdash;to the future.  We are expected to believe that there was a unanimous vote.  When it was suggested that there were ten contrary votes earlier today, the laughter was loud and long and seemingly convincing.  Perhaps it is true there was unanimity.  We must ask how long this unanimity is going to last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the credibility of the Government in the future.  Two enormously serious things face us in the near future.  From these benches we criticised the Budget.  We criticised it as being irresponsible.  I, for one, and others, pondered on the motivation.  We said there were things in it obviously not based on economic considerations and that we did not understand it.  It was not capable of being read in the context of what we knew at that time.  We said that the Minister for Finance must be in possession of information which was not in the possession of other Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It now begins to make sense sooner than we thought.  The irresponsibility we correctly criticised will not go away.  The dangers of the Budget will not go away.  In the very short period since its introduction the economic position, particularly in the United States, has been deteriorating dramatically. We now have a Government which in large areas of the whole nation has practically zero credibility. That Government are faced with a very serious economic prospect.  Perhaps in July or August the opening of negotiations with the EEC will start.  This will be done, firstly, by a Government, <Col N="701" /> of practically zero credibility and, secondly, by a Government about which everybody will ask the question: &ldquo;When will the knives be drawn again to carve one another up?  When will a general election be sprung upon us? How can you validly govern and take honourable long-term decisions in the light of the nation's interests if you are locked together by a spurious unity in which nobody believes?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must deal with Northern Ireland. All the evidence is that this summer is going to be a time of very great danger.  What do we say now to honourable young people in the north of Ireland who are frustrated with the rate of progress?  We are discredited in our dealings with all sections of the people of the Six Counties.  One of the conditions of progress is that our word should be credible to the middle community there, to people who for historical reasons distrusted us and doubted us.  It is profoundly important that the middle community should have some hope of survival and not be ground away by extremists on either side.  It is profoundly important that the sentiments uttered from this Parliament&mdash;greatly to its honour&mdash; last October should be credible.  How credible are they now?  They are now a hypocrisy and a reproach to us. This is our contribution.  We have had a wrecking of community relations, a wrecking of the long-term prospects of building unity with honour.  The net result of all these actions, in regard to the north, in regard to the Budget, in regard to the EEC and in regard to the international financial institutions with which we have to deal is that we are regarded as a joke. These are all serious problems.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend time trying to put a finger on where this rot all started, because it is a political question and not a question of the personal morality of the people involved.  Fundamentally it is based, in my conviction, on political mistakes.  I said last October, in the debate about Northern Ireland, that from the point of view of the Government the situation was practically impossible because it was not within the power, even of the most adept contortionist, to face <Col N="702" /> in two directions at the same time. Hypocrisy and loss of honour result from facing in two directions at the same time.  I expressed myself then in harsher words than I would now use although the situation then was important, but it was less of a national crisis than the one we now face.</P>
    <P>We must choose our words gently now so that we do not use forms of description which are in themselves offensive and which would make it impossible for our adversaries to listen to the point of view we are trying to express.  We have moved away from the ideology which motivated Fianna Fáil when it started and was the reason why so many people in Ireland gave their political allegiance and votes to that party.  We have moved away because a section of that party has now grown up, a section which was deeply involved with foreign industry but which was facing in two directions. The political contortions to which I referred were to bring out the fact that one cannot simultaneously be genuinely concerned with national unity, national independence and the solving of problems of the long-term evolution of the two parts of the country while one is compromised by the biggest economic enterprises of the western world, which are quite indifferent and inimical to our national identity.</P>

      <P>Let me turn to the motion.  In a slightly contemptuous way we are asked to debate on the motion that Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Desmond O'Malley to be a member of the Government.  I would oppose it, in addition to the reason given by Deputy L'Estrange concerning a rather distressing and sordid little episode, for the <Col N="703" /> reason which is to me the most serious of all.  Since the spurious unity of today nobody in the Fianna Fáil Party has the moral stature to be a Minister for Justice and therefore whoever is chosen from the ranks of that tarnished party at this moment will be unfit to fill that office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I rise to conclude this debate on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and to oppose the motion that Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Desmond J. O'Malley for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.  I oppose the nomination of Deputy O'Malley as I would oppose the nomination of any Deputy or any panel of Deputies put before this House by the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch.  I say, with full consideration, that Deputy Lynch is not a suitable person to continue as Taoiseach of this Government.  The record of Deputy Lynch, the Taoiseach, since he became Taoiseach proves he is a weak man; proves he is a man who has been less than honest with this House and less than honest with the people of this country.  I say that the Taoiseach has been less than honest with this House and with the people of the country in the past 12 months because, while he has been professing that there can be no question of force as a method of solving our outstanding national problems, he has been covering up, within his Cabinet, members of his Government who he knew, or should have known, did not subscribe to that policy.</P>
      <P>Several times within the past 12 months we had the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, proclaiming publicly that he believed in force as a short-term or, at any rate, as a long-term method of ending Partition.  We had the Taoiseach going to Tralee and elsewhere forced to repudiate that; and, the next day, again, we had the same Minister coming out and making another speech elsewhere confirming what he previously had said, and the Taoiseach forced into the humiliating position of having to go elsewhere, of having to make another speech denying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> Why did the Taoiseach not remove this man from his Cabinet long ago? I ask this House and I ask the people of the country if it is unreasonable to assume that, if the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, was speaking thus in public he must have been speaking in much clearer terms to the Taoiseach in private.  He must have left no doubt, when speaking within the confines of the Cabinet Chamber and the Fianna Fáil Party rooms, where he stood as regards force and what he believed in as regards force.  Yet, not until he was exposed by the leader of this Party was he removed from office by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say this in any way as a <i>cliché</i> but I want to say that the Taoiseach, over the past couple of years, has tolerated&mdash;and, by tolerating, has encouraged and permitted&mdash; low standards and very improper standards in high places and within the Cabinet.  I want to make reference to a number of cases.  I make reference to these cases for the purpose of showing how standards were set and how standards were tolerated.  We had the question of the sale by the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, on the eve of the last general election, of a farm which he purchased for a small amount of money but sold, with planning permission, for a fabulous amount of money, without the payment of tax.  It may have been a borderline case but the Taoiseach rushed to the defence of the Minister and pointed out that there was nothing wrong or nothing illegal in it.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): When I drew the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that this self-confessed, corrupt person, this taker of bribes had been appointed by his Minister for Finance as a director of a State company, the Taoiseach's reply was: &ldquo;No better man&rdquo;.  What does the Taoiseach expect if he tolerates that sort of thing?  Is it any wonder that the Taoiseach is what he is?  Is it any wonder that he finds himself in this House tonight in such a humiliating position?</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with a very delicate situation.  Within this House in recent months we have heard the Taoiseach's director of organisation, the former Minister for Local Government, advocate sectarianism when he referred to Deputy Billy Fox, a young member of the minority, as a B-Special.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): We know now from the Taoiseach's own words that as far back as the 20th or the 21st of April he discovered that members of his cabinet, two senior Ministers, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, were engaged in criminal activities while still members of his Cabinet.  I wish to repeat in clear terms the question put by the last speaker, Deputy Keating.  Who told the Taoiseach of this illegal activity?  Was it <Col N="708" /> his Minister for Justice or was it somebody in the Department of Justice? However, the Taoiseach did nothing about this until Deputy Cosgrave went to him last night and told him what he knew.  He let the Taoiseach know that there were criminals within the Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Deputy Cosgrave put the Taoiseach on notice that within his Cabinet there were people whom the Taoiseach admitted today were suspected of being engaged in subversive activities against the State, men for whose resignations the Taoiseach saw fit to call two hours after Deputy Cosgrave had indicated his knowledge to the Taoiseach.  When they did not give in, the Taoiseach saw fit to invoke the powers of the Constitution to remove them from his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I do not think there can be any doubt that the events of the past few days prove clearly that, were it not for the fact that these men were exposed and were it not that the Taoiseach realised that Deputy Cosgrave knew as much as he and even more, these men would still be members of the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that a vacancy occurred within the Cabinet with the resignation of the Minister for Justice. Members of this House cannot be blamed for doubting the reasons which caused the Minister for Justice to resign but on his resignation one would have thought that the Taoiseach would have considered it a suitable occasion for him to take one bite of the cherry and clear up the whole mess. Instead we find the Taoiseach making four attempts to get through the motion with which we are now dealing <Col N="709" /> in the hope that it would be received and accepted without question, without vote and without debate and, at the same time, without any reference to the activities of the delinquent Minister within the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>If the Leader of this Party had fallen for the wily moves of the Taoiseach yesterday and had allowed this motion to go through by default and if Deputy Cosgrave had not brought it to the Taoiseach's notice that he knew all about the situation in the Cabinet, we would not have had the compulsory resignations or the expulsions from the Cabinet; we would have had the Taoiseach still holding the umbrella of respectability over these fifth columnists within his party.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I do not think I will be accused of exaggeration if I say that the situation disclosed to the country by the Taoiseach at 2.30 this morning is the gravest situation that has ever faced any Government or any political party in this country since the foundation of the State.  Late into the night and into the early morning the Taoiseach was deciding how he would deal with it.  We know as a fact that members of the Fianna Fáil Party, some of them I understand junior Ministers, did not know the full facts until this morning.  We had the Taoiseach coming into this House and reasonably asking for four hours for the Fianna Fáil Party to discuss this matter.  He said his party was meeting at 6 p.m. and that he would not be ready to face the House until 10 p.m.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach had any self-respect he would not come into this House tonight and put forward this motion while retaining within his party men whom he thought fit to expel from his Cabinet, men who according to himself have been engaged in activities subversive to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset, in respect of comment that has been made about the subject matter of the motion we are discussing, that I had no intention of escaping, nor could I possibly expect to escape, any discussion on the results of the action I took last night.  However, the fact was that within the Rules of Order of the House, the House having agreed to a postponement of the commencement of the sitting from this morning, <Col N="713" /> the only vehicle by which I could have got a discussion of this nature before the House was the motion that had already been tabled in respect of the nomination of Deputy Des O'Malley as a member of the Government.  I told the leaders of both parties that this was the motion I was bringing before the House and that I would make a statement which would give them ample scope to discuss the subject matter that we have been discussing over the last four hours.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I want to submit I had no desire to avoid or no expectation of avoiding a debate on this subject matter. There is no point in Deputies opposite trying to suggest, as Deputy Fitzpatrick did at the opening of his speech, that I was trying to slide away from a discussion on this matter.  There was no such intention and I knew well it could not be avoided in any event. I knew well when I took a decision last night in respect of the position of two members of the Government, that in the debate that was bound to ensue the type of vilification we have heard so much of from the opposite side this evening would be indulged in.</P>

      <P>I knew that the same type of denigration of other members of the Government, of members of the party and of myself would be undertaken with gusto, as has been done by several speakers from the opposite benches.  I want to say that I set no limit on this debate and any suggestion to that effect, as the Deputies who made it know, is absolutely groundless.  If there was to be a debate tomorrow I interposed the condition that I wanted to move the names of the other members of the Government to fill the vacancies which were created since last night. That again indicated that I had no fear of any debate or any comments which could come from the benches opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first came into politics I did so because I believed, and still believe, in the Republican principles of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe in the <Col N="714" /> Republican ideals and in the fundamental aims of that party.  I did so too because I believe the economic policies which had been advanced by Fianna Fáil in the years before I entered the party and that have been pursued by Fianna Fáil since I entered it were the policies best conducive to the wellbeing and progress of this country.  I knew the policy of Fianna Fáil in relation to Partition&mdash;as initiated by the founder of Fianna Fáil and its first President, as carried out by his successor, who happened to be my immediate predecessor&mdash;was one of seeking the re-unification of the country by peaceful means.  I am not going to repeat here tonight the statements that have been made by my two predecessors nor statements I have made myself in this connection especially since the events of last August.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the actions that were taken then by our Government, by me, were in the best interests of the re-unification of this country.  They were in the best interests of ensuring that the kind of unfortunate bloodshed we witnessed would be limited to the greatest possible extent.  I was accused of sabre rattling in having sent certain units of the Army for ambulance purposes near to the Border.  I will admit readily there was another reason why I did so.  It was not so much to look towards the Border as to look south, because there were decent people in this part of the country who felt incensed at what was happening in Derry and what ultimately happened in Belfast.  It was important that we had then at strategic points along the Border Army units and Garda units, not just to help refugees, to help people who were injured in the troubles in the north, but to ensure that we knew what was happening from the south. That was one of the reasons that action was taken.  I believe that action prevented a great degree of bloodshed. which might otherwise have occurred.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in respect of allegations made here and suggestions made here that what might happen in the summer months to come would be due in some way to action taken by members of the Government down here, that everybody knows that members <Col N="715" /> of my Government or members of my party were in no way responsible for the events leading up to the 12th August in Derry and the events which followed.  On the contrary, the then Minister for External Affairs did his very best to ensure that such events would not happen and the present Minister for External Affairs repeatedly warned that certain eventualities might follow that ill-fated parade in Derry on the 12th August. We were assured the situation was in hand, but events proved to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Every step we took then and before then was destined to ensure, to the fullest possible extent that we could ensure it, that there would be no riots or no bloodshed in the Six Counties and everything we have done since then is a continuation of that policy&mdash; an attempt to ensure that the reunification of our country will be achieved by the only means by which we know it can be achieved, that is, by the elimination of hatred and bigotry and the encouragement of understanding and goodwill between the people not only in the six counties of northern Ireland as between themselves and as between their different communities, but between the people in that part of the country and the people in the south.  Everything we have done, and everything we have been trying to do, is designed towards that end.</P>
    <P>I re-affirmed, as has been admitted here, in my Tralee speech, the policy of successive Fianna Fáil Governments and the policies of Fianna Fáil as a political party in relation to the reunification of the country.  I repeated it on a number of occasions subsequently and more recently at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.  I spelled out clearly then, and I got unanimous acclaim for the policy I had adumbrated, the policy I emphasised and repeated on that occasion as the policy of all members of our party and of all members of our Government.  I said before on more than one occasion that feelings in relation to the division of our country can assume a varied degree of intensity and expressions of those feelings can likewise assume a variety of <Col N="716" /> ways and a variety of intensities but whatever the intensity, whatever the manner of expression, it remains the policy of our party to seek the reunification of Ireland by peaceful means, to encourage the goodwill and understanding to which I have referred and to banish hatred and bigotry.</P>
    <P>This country can attribute the growth which has been achieved so far and the comparative economic prosperity we have enjoyed to these policies, including the economic policies of Fianna Fáil.  I want to assure the House that I want to protect that economic growth and progress.  I do not want it jeopardised and I shall do everything in my power to ensure that violence on this or on the other side of the Border will not jeopardise it.</P>

Anything I must do to discourage misunderstanding will also be done.  That is the reason I took the action I did take last night because I believed I had what did not amount to legal proof&mdash;and I have some knowledge about what amounts to legal proof&mdash;of the alleged involvement of two Members of the Government in attempted&mdash;and I repeat attempted&mdash; arms importation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anyone think that was an easy decision for me to make?  I want to say in the context of the suggestion that I acted only because Deputy Cosgrave came to me, that I had taken action, I had conducted the interview with the former Minister for Finance at the first available time that was open to me according to the advice of an eminent medical practitioner in this country. Perhaps Deputy Keating would address his &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; to this eminent man. I visited the Minister in hospital and frankly I was worried after the first four minutes of the interview lest I do <Col N="717" /> this man, who had suffered a fractured skull, permanent damage.  I cut the interview short&mdash;much shorter than I would otherwise have done&mdash;as the doctor in any event had informed me that I could not get concentration for more than a few minutes.  Having interviewed a man who was suffering from a fractured skull, does anyone suggest that I should there and then have taken action against him?  I gave him some further days, as I thought I was bound to do having regard to his condition, to consider the situation and I also gave some further days to the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I want the House to remember that each of these men was a man of outstanding ability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Ó Moráin, is still in Mount Carmel Hospital and my information from an eminent doctor is that it will be some months before the treatment he must undergo will be completed.  I wish to state that Deputy Ó Moráin's condition is not unassociated with the shock he suffered as a result of the killing of Garda Fallon.  I wish to repudiate emphatically that any attempt was made by this Government, by any member of it or by any person associated with it to ease up in any way on the hunt for the perpetrators of this foul deed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there will be no let up.  A suggestion has been made that people whose names have been connected with this murder left a court without being re-arrested&mdash;the court before which they were charged in connection with shootings and in connection with a raid on either a bank or a post office, I forget which. The fact was that not until that very morning did the prosecuting counsel know that an essential witness could not be present.  He was given a medical certificate which the judge there and then decided not to accept and intimated <Col N="719" /> that unless a doctor was produced forthwith he would dismiss the charges.  The only alternative open to the prosecuting counsel if these men were not to get away scotfree was to enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> so that they could be rearraigned and made amenable for their crimes.  Unfortunately, without anticipating the situation that developed, these men, because of the absence of a warrant which was not immediately available, were able to leave the court and were not found subsequently.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about another allegation, although I always blame myself for following any of Deputy L'Estrange's allegations.  I shall only say in relation to the allegations that the person who wrote that letter which he read out was an alleged Seamus Breen with the alleged address of 70 O'Connell Street.</P>

      <P>Investigations were made into the existence of Seamus Breen, and he was found not to exist, and 70 O'Connell Street, Limerick, has been a disused store and not occupied for the last 20 years.  Is it any wonder that Deputy L'Estrange can produce here a copy of the original letter and a copy of my reply?  I wonder how he got it.  These are matters that I think it is wrong for me to go into at this stage on a subject matter as serious as we are discussing.  However, let me say I did not run away from the problem that faced me in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Allegations have been made about criminals.  Some people withdrew them; others got away with them.  Perhaps they were not challenged by the Chair or the Chair did not hear them.  However, when it comes to legal proof, it is not a matter for me as to what charges may be made or what action may be taken.  What I was concerned with was my constitutional right as Taoiseach to take action in circumstances in which I felt it was justified.  I took these actions in circumstances where I felt, as I said at the outset, even the slightest suspicion might attach to a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances irrespective of whether or not there is evidence in relation to these matters that would justify prosecution or amount to a <i>prima facie</i> case in a court of law, the material was such that I considered justified my taking the action I took in my capacity as Taoiseach.  My party endorsed unanimously my right to do that today, and I say unanimously because the members affected also endorsed that right.</P>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister for Local Government to resign.  He tendered his own resignation, and I deprecate the attempts that have been made to involve him in this incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I did not run away from this problem.  I faced up to it as any Fianna Fáil Taoiseach would have <Col N="721" /> done.  I am satisfied that, because of the suspicion which was aroused in my mind by reason of the statements and the reports that I read and the investigations I have made, I was justified in taking that action.  I would not have done so otherwise.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil will continue to give good government and honest government to the people of this country.  We were elected to do so last June.  We have the capacity to continue to do so and when, next Friday, I produce the names to replace the members of the Government who have now left office, if I be in order in doing so, as I hope I will be, I know this country will again have a Government on whom they can rely, and, no matter how much the Deputies opposite try to vilify or denigrate me or my colleagues, they can have a Taoiseach and a Government in whom they can impose their implicit trust.</P>
