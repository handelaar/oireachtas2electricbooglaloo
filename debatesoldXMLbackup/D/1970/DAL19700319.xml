    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Social Welfare.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I was coming to the point that the lack of concern for those among us who have been deprived or who no longer can contribute to our general welfare is shown in our treatment of these people. We owe them as much as we can do for them if only for the rather selfish motive that, some day, we may find ourselves in the same position.  It is essential that we strive to the utmost to lighten the burden of widows, orphans and old age pensioners who are deprived of their health and strength and who can no longer fend for themselves.</P>
      <P>We learn that there are 112,000 non-contributory old age pensioners in our community.  A medical card should automatically be issued to them.  I understand this was promised some time ago.  It appears that there will be no trouble about issuing a medical card to a non-contributory old age pensioner, on application.  The snag is that they have to go through the whole machinery of having to apply for it and of submitting to a means test. There should be some liaison in this matter between the Departments of Social Welfare and Health so that this card will automatically be issued.</P>
      <P>Teachtaí Dála and public representatives are often accused of getting fat on the misery of others by making representations on behalf of people and pretending they are getting some benefit for them for the sake of getting their support later on in elections.  I suppose there is a slight element of truth in that but it is not the whole truth.  I do not think any Teachta Dála or public representative would have the gall to say to any person, in effect: &ldquo;You could not get this but for my intervention&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> Very often, people do not know whom to approach when they have a problem.  The man they vote for is the only man they can go to and say, in effect: &ldquo;I did something for you and now I shall be glad if you would do something for me&rdquo;.  It is rare that a public representative will try to pretend that it was through his intervention that some favour was received for a person.  In point of fact, it should not be necessary for people to have to approach public representatives to find out their entitlements.  There should be sufficient social workers in our community for this purpose, particularly in built-up areas in cities.  In rural districts, there is more intercommunication between households and one can approach the teacher, the curate, the neighbours or whoever is around. In vast anonymous housing estates put up by corporations, people live their own lives and it sometimes happens that they do not know their neighbours living next door.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there has been a move for the provision of social workers but there are not enough of them yet to enable them to become intimately acquainted with the problems of the people in the area in which they serve.  Although this matter is more pertinent to the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, a case in point is evictions from corporation houses which could be avoided if there were social workers in the employment of the Department of Local Government.  I have always felt it is appalling that, if an man does not pay the rent, his wife and children are thrown out on the street for his sins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  All of these miseries in big corporation estates could be avoided if there were social workers.  Furthermore, when people leave small one-roomed flats and move into local authority houses the social worker should be there to call on the wife and to explain to her whatever she should know about the payment of the rent, and so on, and to instruct <Col N="676" /> her in the various problems she may be confronted with.</P>
      <P>The amount of money necessary to subsidise the workshop for the blind is frightening.  I cannot understand it.  I am sure the voluntary bodies looking after this are doing their best but the fact that the subsidy amounts to £700 a year for the 60 people employed there makes one wonder, as Deputy Browne said last night, if this job is producing what the public want, or if a hard look should not be taken at it to see if it could be organised in another way, or if the people working there could be trained to do some other work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister, like myself, has in his hand a little red book, a respectable red book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had it a minute ago but I will not quarrel on a point of time.  This little book should be in the possession of every insured person.  I do not know how it can be got out to them but everybody who claims to be in any way associated with the social welfare services or who is interested at all in the rights of the people in this respect should have this little book in his or her possession.  It is issued every year, it is called &ldquo;SW4&rdquo;, and this year it happens to be red. It is an excellent document and it has improved in successive years, additional information being included in it. If it were distributed more widely the people Deputy P. Barry suggested should be appointed to tell people their rights would hardly be necessary because this gives a fairly good amount of detail on these matters.</P>
      <P>Let me say something which may not be popular.  It seems that knocking social welfare officials is a popular pastime in this country and in this House.  I must say, however, that except on a few rare occasions I have met with nothing but courtesy from social welfare officials, particularly those at head office level.  They seem to be prepared to go out of their way in an effort to see that applicants get what they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> Unfortunately, however, from time to time, because of peculiar regulations, they are precluded from giving benefits to which people are entitled. Sometimes it may be that because of the way in which a regulation is read there are delays in the inclusion of people for participation in benefits to which they are entitled.  A lot of ground is often covered, particularly in the case of those who have been employed in Britain, because of transfer of stamps or the exchange of information about stamps.  Because of this we sometimes find unfortunate people left in a pretty bad position due to delays in getting benefits to which they are entitled and which are paid ultimately.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would endeavour to get a little more co-operation in this matter from the British authorities. I am told they are reasonably co-operative but it appears to me and to many people that delays are much too great.  The Minister might look for more co-operation from the British.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of points I wish to put to the Minister and perhaps he might comment on them.  First of all, I have on numerous occasions expressed the view here that I cannot see any good reason why a man or woman who has been drawing benefit and who after a period on unemployment assistance, if he or she has fewer than 156 stamps, is disqualified from benefit and why such a person should be left destitute, particularly if he or she seeks disability benefits.  Why can we not have disability assistance, involving a lesser amount, which could be paid to people who do not qualify for disability benefits?  Many people have to apply for home assistance and have to suffer the delays that occur while awaiting payment.  Will the Minister have a look at this before he brings in the Budget proposals this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister does not.  Civil servants make them up for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister for Finance makes them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="678" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not understand what I mean I am afraid I would be ruled out of order if I tried to teach him his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not bring in Budget proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is supposed to make proposals as regards social welfare.  If he does not, it is no wonder that our social welfare services are at their present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not do it here.  I do not bring Budget proposals before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister brings them before the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be courteous enough to listen to what I am saying?  Will be bring this proposal before the Minister for Finance?  The Minister might agree it would be a proper thing to do.  For a start, he might make a tour through his Department so that the courtesy of some of the officials there might rub off on him. Another point I should like to mention is that when somebody is excluded from drawing disability or unemployment benefit and finds he is not being deprived correctly, the appeal procedure takes too long.  If the idea is to try to force people who may be swinging the lead to go back to work it is a success.  However, there may be a sick man who has been certified as being ill by a doctor but who is declared &ldquo;not unfit&rdquo; by Departmental officials.  This man may be honestly unfit for work but it takes a terribly long time to investigate it.  This usually results in a sick man having to resume work and I have seen one or two cases where an unfit man died because he had to resume work.  It was said that a man was sick but was not suffering from what the doctor said.  In fact the person was suffering from an advanced case of lung cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the sort of thing that should not be allowed to happen.  This is a question of people trying to be really honest, taking their job seriously and deciding that a person in not unfit <Col N="679" /> for work.  A second doctor might decide differently and an applicant for disability benefit should be given the chance to go to another doctor.</P>
    <P>In the case of unemployment benefit, the appeal court, as it might be called, cannot visit areas and this means putting on the long finger applications which should be dealt with reasonably quickly.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I would like the Minister to consider is the question of the man who has been working for many years and who, during that time, has had weekly deductions made for insurance but who, when he becomes entitled to some benefit, either sickness benefit or unemployment, finds that his employer has not stamped his card. This practice has become very common. Many employers either fail to stamp cards or else they only put on portion of the required number of stamps.  The latter is a particularly mean trick.  I knew one man who knew so little that he put on only 24 stamps each year whereas if he had had enough intelligence to put on 26 he could possibly have got away with it. Of course, the result of that was that when the employee became ill he found he was not entitled to benefit.  I know the right is there to sue an employer who is guilty of such practice but it is very little use to a man who is working and receiving only a bare subsistence wage to know that if he becomes ill he will not get benefit because the Department of Social Welfare will tell him that his card is not in order and that even if he succeeds in having the card put in order, a penalty of six weeks will be imposed which will deprive him from drawing any benefit during that period.  By that time the man will probably be back at work.</P>
    <P>The same arrangement should be made as applies in cases of occupational injuries.  If a man is injured and finds that his card has not been stamped I see no reason why he should not be given benefit and let the State recover from the employer any loss that has been incurred.  Another aspect of this matter is that for some extraordinary reason large firms have been <Col N="680" /> known to fail in their duty to stamp insurance cards for a period of years. I can understand the odd man who employs one or two people getting away with that but I cannot understand how a firm employing 40, 50 or 100 men could succeed in getting by unnoticed.  I would suggest to the Minister that not alone should there be a charge brought against those people for failing to stamp the cards but they should also be charged with fraud if they deducted the money for the stamps from the employee while failing to stamp his card.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the person who should deal with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but for some reason a number of people seem to have been getting away with this practice.  It is particularly noticeable when a firm goes bankrupt.  There was a question asked here a week ago about who had the first claim on the estate as far as workmen's compensation was concerned.  If a firm goes bankrupt there is not a hope in the world of collecting arrears of stamps or of recovering the loss of insurance benefit to workers.  While some of us are a little critical about the activities of some of the inspectors employed by the Department, the Minister might usefully employ a few more of these men to insure against this practice.  They should investigate, in particular, cases where firms who have been stamping cards for a number of years suddenly stop doing so while, at the same time, continuing in business. I know of a number of firms who did this and by so doing a great deal of hardship was caused to unfortunate men and women because they were unable to obtain the benefits to which they were entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister is the disallowance of unemployment benefit to a man who has a small holding, not in the underdeveloped areas, let me hasten to add.  Such a man may be stamping a card but when he is laid off it is adjudged by somebody in the Minister's Department that he has an income of more than 10s per day from his holding and, consequently, cannot receive any benefit.  I had the experience a couple of years <Col N="681" /> ago of knowing a man who had a wife and nine children and who would not have been working for hire if he could have lived off his holding.  When that man was laid off he was assumed to have had more than 10s a day with the result that he was disqualified from drawing unemployment benefit although while he was working he had to stamp his cards.  This is most unfair. Eventually, however, the peculiar position arose that the man was adjudged to be entitled to benefit.  Incidentally, the Minister might take a little time off to explain to some of the experts, who from time to time are heard on the radio talking about social welfare matters, the difference between what they call the &ldquo;dole&rdquo; and unemployment benefit.  Unemployment benefit is benefit paid as a result of cards having been stamped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not expect me to explain anything to anybody on television.  They do not wish to learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what is the Minister's association with the people on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand them anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they do not know the difference between the dole and unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nothing unusual for those on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister has more time to watch television than I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, thank God, I have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very annoying to somebody who has been stamping cards all his life and who finds it necessary at some stage to draw unemployment benefit to be described as drawing the dole.  I do not consider that there is anything wrong if a man finds himself in such poor circumstances that it is necessary for him to draw unemployment assistance but the experts, at least, should learn the difference between unemployment benefit <Col N="682" /> and unemployment assistance or the dole, as it is called.  Perhaps the Minister might consider the question of those with smallholdings who are disqualified from drawing unemployment benefit in view of the case which I have mentioned concerning the man who had a wife and nine children to support.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made here to the workshop for the blind.  The reason why there is such a loss is very clear. The people employed there are being paid a wage which their representatives asked for.  They are being paid a living wage but if support for the workshop is not sufficient, naturally there is a loss.  Incidentally, while all of us have been complaining about what would be the results of the ESB clerks strike, I have discovered that the people who run the workshop for the blind have been billed by the ESB for a huge amount with the instruction to pay it forthwith or their current will be cut off.  Apparently if one is blind, nobody gives a damn because it seems rather extraordinary that while we talk so much about helping the blind, a threat was made by a semi-State body to cut off their electric current.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister may say that he cannot listen to comments on pending legislation but the Parliamentary Secretary has recently been talking about retirement pensions at 65.  If it is in order, the Minister might explain what exactly is meant by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would anticipate the debate on the Bill when it comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that the Minister might be able to release a little information which, apparently, the Parliamentary Secretary has got because otherwise he would not be talking about it.  I am not suspicious because it was mentioned in Galway and not in Dublin.  If it had something to offer for workers in general I imagine it would be mentioned here or in some of the bigger centres of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Mentioning something <Col N="683" /> and forgetting about it until it becomes politic to mention it again is not of very much use.  I should like to know whether this is just something that has been dangled about without any details being given, or is there, in fact, a proposal?  If there is a proposal we should be told about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not go into detail or, if he did, the people who were listening to him and reporting him did not seem to get the point he was making because they did not publish it.  I am very interested in it and I would be glad to hear if there is any further information about it.</P>
      <P>I believe it is possible to reduce the retiral age to 65 years without legislation. Would the Minister say if it is proposed to reduce the retiral age of people drawing old age pensions to 65 in the case of men and 60 in the case of women?  It would cost very little to do this.  Most people retire when they draw the old age pension.  Everyone does not, but most people do.  It is adjudged that a person who reaches 65 years is old and, if that is so, it might be possible to give the old age pension instead of unemployment or disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number on the unemployment register is very high.  Do not tell me it was 80,000 or 90,000 in 1956 because I will have to repeat that in the early thirties, after Fianna Fáil had taken over for a few years, it was 132,000. That does not get us anywhere.  I should like to know if the Minister has any concrete plans to deal with the problem of chronic unemployment.  I notice that some Ministers are going abroad and asking skilled people to come home and telling them there is plenty of work for them.  Perhaps that is so, but is there any hope of training those who are already here?  I think the Minister will agree that there is no point in bringing other people home to work here if, in fact, we have a number of people who are becoming unemployable. If they do not get a job for a <Col N="684" /> period of years they become unemployable. The sad fact is that when an industry closes down now usually the older people cannot find employment again and this is something which will have to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of redundancy would be a matter for another Minister, the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would.  I suppose the question of unemployment would be a matter for the Minister for Labour but the question of the labour exchange and the number of people signing on at the exchange is a matter for this Minister.  For that reason I think a reference to this problem might not be completely out of order.  However, I bow to your ruling.</P>
      <P>There is something else which I wonder if the Minister would consider in conjunction with the Minister for Labour and a number of other Ministers, and it is very difficult to understand. People employed on public works are laid off at a certain stage of the year not because the job is finished but because it is said that there is no further money available in that financial year.  These people have to sign on for unemployment benefit. Would the Minister not agree that in the case of a married man with a family, who is getting, perhaps, £7 or £8 in unemployment benefit, it would be much better for him and for the State if more money could be found to give him, perhaps, less than double that, but for which he would be prepared to work a full week?  I know it is considered proper that there should be watertight compartments in State Departments but I honestly feel &mdash;and I have mentioned this on a number of occasions&mdash;that something has got to be done to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the unemployed single person.  We have been in the habit of treating an unmarried person as not having any dependants, but all of us know all the people throughout the State who are, to their credit looking after a mother who has not yet reached 70 years of age and, therefore, does not qualify for <Col N="685" /> a pension, or a father who may have to stop working for one reason or another and may be drawing a small amount of disability benefit or may not be drawing benefit at all, or an invalid brother or sister.  We have these people all over the country and they are all treated as single persons without dependants.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to treat them that way for income tax purposes but, for unemployment or sickness benefit purposes, surely it is nothing less than ridiculous that a man or woman in that category who has been working for £14 or £15 a week and keeping a home for a dependant relative should find that he or she is down to slightly over £3 a week on becoming unemployed or ill.  It has been stated recently that unemployment benefit will have to be jacked up considerably but we should not have to wait until some group of experts have a look at this problem.  Everybody who knows anything about social welfare must be aware that that is so.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that there are so many other Estimates which have to be cleared today I will not detain the House any longer on this Estimate. There are quite a number of matters I should like to mention but I will conclude by saying that there are very many people who are working for their living and who have come to the conclusion that they are not getting value for the amount of money which they have to pay for an insurance stamp. It was all right some years ago when their share of the stamp was less than 2s.  The employed person is now paying 12s 10d and the employer is paying 15s 5d.  That is 28s 3d per week out of his wages.  Surely that means that he is entitled to something better than he is getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>Those of us whose job it is to negotiate wages for workers find it extremely difficult to persuade workers that an increase of £1 a week is of any use to them if the State takes 7s in income tax, social welfare has increased by 1s 9d from the first week in January, and the local authority take another 2s or 3s.  What the unfortunate man gets out of his £1 is hardly worth <Col N="686" /> bringing home.  He will not get much for it anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House long on this Estimate but there is a subject which is relevant to this Estimate in which I have been interested for many years.  All my experience since I first became a Deputy justifies my approach to it and my opinion on it.  Before I come to it I want to make a few general remarks. The attention of the House has been drawn by a number of speakers to the fact that in that Maoist State of Western Germany unemployment benefits are double what they are in this country.  They are about two-thirds of a man's wages, whereas in this country they are about one-third roughly.  As I say, that occurs in that Maoist State of Western Germany.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister made such a song and dance about the £700 a year each that the people who work in the blind workshop are costing the State.  What about the £3,000 odd that the men working in the Cork dockyard are costing the State this year&mdash;£3,000 each this year in subsidy for shipping?  What about that?  Why was not that highlighted by the Government?  Tell us about that.  I could give many other examples.  I do not understand why the Minister highlighted this figure of£700.  It is high, but I cannot understand why it should be highlighted in the Minister's statement.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Tully that the age limit for old age pensions should be reduced.  Some years ago I learned something that I did not know.  We learn many things by experience.  A young doctor, a friend of mine who was an intern in St. Vincent's Hospital, told me specifically that working men were brought into St. Vincent's Hospital worn out at the age of 55 years. We all know what &ldquo;worn out&rdquo; means. It means that they are unfit for subsequent work.  Therefore, I do not think that fixing the age for old age pensions at 65 is unduly generous.  I agree with Deputy Tully that most people would retire at that age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal subject I want to talk about in detail is children's allowances. <Col N="687" /> This Government have no interest whatever in family allowances.  They were only increased last year because a general election was looming up.  For years these allowances remained static. In our children's allowance system there is one stupid rule regarding the allowance for the first child.  I do not know who the sociological idiot was, whether it was the Minister or a civil servant, who was responsible for putting in the first child at 10s a month.  This costs £1.8 million a year, nearly £2 million.</P>

      <P>All right.  I shall talk about the facts.  The facts are that for the first child there is 10s a month, for the second child 25s a month, and for subsequent children, since the election, there is £2 a month.  These amounts are all expressed per month in order to make them look some size and they were originally paid at the beginning of a month, when there were a number of by-elections looming up in 1952, in order to buy the votes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not worry.  In the last 30 years we have had a miserable system.  In the booklet that was distributed recently to every <Col N="688" /> Deputy <i>The Common Market and the Common Man,</i> it is stated that our rates for children's allowances are half what they are in England and that in England they are half what they are in France and Italy.  Before the war, even at the end of the famous economic dispute with Britain, our incomes per head of the population were much higher than in France and infinitely higher than they were in Italy.  These facts about the rates being half here what they are in Britain and half in Britain what they are in France and Italy are expressed in currency.  Possibly the money buys more in France and Italy than it would here.</P>
      <P>The obvious method of dealing with this matter is simply to transfer the money.  Where is the real poverty? Since I became a Deputy I have found it in Crumlin and in the place the Minister pretends he knows all about, Mount Pleasant Buildings.  It is in the big families, not among the people with one child.  An old lady will keep a cat and an old man will keep a dog, and yet people who get married are paid to have one child.  I regard this as one of the lowest things that has happened in this country, to pay people to have one child.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak for only about five minutes as the ground has been thoroughly covered.  Broadly speaking we are all agreed we have not done enough to fulfil our alleged intentions under the 1916 Proclamation, the democratic programme and the social aims in the Constitution.  It can be argued we have done as much as is possible within the confines of the present financial system.  This is an argument which I for one would not accept, and it has been adequately demonstrated on this side of the House that the argument is false.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one or two suggestions to the Minister within the confines of the present system.  I think it is correct to say we do not live in a community with shattering, widespread poverty and misery, but we do live in a community with very considerable pockets of misery which go undiscovered. I think Deputy Barry made this point very well last night.  There are particularly the aged, people who live on fixed incomes and suffer from increases in the cost of living, people who live on flat rate pensions.  These people often eke out a miserable, lonely existence in their last years and unless they are rescued by the work of voluntary bodies they get no relief at all.  Good as the work of those voluntary bodies is, I agree with Deputy Barry it should not be left to them to carry the onus of seeking out the misery of these unfortunate and lonely, aged and underprivileged people.  We should be thinking of these pockets, these minority sections of the community who suffer in this way, particularly in discussing social welfare here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare, in common with the Department of Health, should look seriously into the growing incidence of nervous, psychiatric disorders, with the consequent misery they cause.  As an urban Deputy in Dublin I find this problem to be a shatteringly growing one.  It is a very novel one and one which neither our <Col N="690" /> health nor social welfare services are geared traditionally to deal with.  They are not equipped with the people or the know-how.  The Department of Health are not as yet equipped with the psychiatric and epidemiological knowledge to deal with this.  I know something is being done about it and I am very glad it is being done by the Medico-Social Research Board.  Here I am more concerned with the consequences of this growing illness upon the wives who are left to struggle on and raise children when their husbands are suffering from nervous and psychiatric disorders.</P>
    <P>I want to give a specific instance of a case which came my way not long ago in Ballymun of a woman with two children living in a flat there whose husband went down with just such a psychiatric disorder.  This woman's total income was home assistance of £5 10s a week.  She had two children; her rent was, under the famous B-scale differential rents, £2 0s 10d.  Therefore, she had to raise two children on £3 9s 2d a week.  Obviously something is wrong there and this sort of thing should be looked into very seriously.  It is, as I say, a growing, serious problem is that the husband, overworked, worried, burdened with debt and very often in an uncongenial and frustrating environment, simply opts out and leaves the wife to sustain the family on assistance.</P>
    <P>The point has been made over and over again&mdash;perhaps it would require legislation and therefore it is not in order here&mdash;that in this country, rather unusually, I think, in modern Western European countries, all our social welfare services are still based on what used to be known as the plimsoll line concept of early British Beveridge-style Fabianism, by which flat rate pensions are paid, flat rate social welfare allowances are paid and these have to be raised by Governmental action from time to time.  Budgetary steps have to be taken which make the raising of old age pensions, for example, a political football to be kicked backwards and forwards in this House.  This is unfortunate and unnecessary, and it has frequently been suggested that instead of making all these things the subject <Col N="691" /> of periodic review, bickering, assessment and political point-making, such pensions might be tied to the cost of living, the consumer price index or something like that.  This is a suggestion which the House should consider seriously.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to make is in reference to a matter on which other Deputies have spoken and I shall not, therefore, delay the House for very long on this subject.  However, I must stress that in common with the growth in psychiatric disorders and with the domestic problems they cause, we are faced with the shattering problem in the growth of the problem of deserted wives.  Last November when I addressed a question to the Minister and asked him if he was in a position to state the number of deserted wives in Dublin city and county he replied: &ldquo;I have not got this information.  I can, however, inform the Deputy that, according to the Dublin Health Authority, home assistance at a recent date was being paid to 191 women whose husbands were stated to have deserted them.&rdquo; Everybody knows that this figure of 191 bears absolutely no relation to the situation that exists and I suggest to the Minister that if he has not got the information he should take steps to find it out.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make is in regard to children's allowances, to which Deputy O'Donovan referred.  My suggestion may not be in order because it might require legislation so I shall not labour the point.  I came across a typical case recently of a widower who made considerable sacrifices to put his children through secondary school up to the intermediate education level.  This man's youngest child will be 16 years on the 1st April.  She will sit for her intermediate certificate in June and afterwards leave school to get a job.  The man asked me if it would be possible to have the children's allowance paid after she reached the age of 16 years while she was still not in gainful employment. Of course, the answer was that this was not possible.  In view of the very laudable attempts being made by the Department of Education to encourage <Col N="692" /> parents to keep their children in secondary education for as long as possible it might be no harm if the Department of Social Welfare would look again at the question of children's allowances and the possibility of continuing payment up to the point where the child became employed.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the £25 allowance for fees is not really adequate to compensate ordinary workingclass people for the sacrifices they make in keeping children at school.  Therefore, if we want to encourage people to continue their children in secondary education to the greatest degree possible it is appropriate that not merely the Department of Education should be involved in this but the Department of Social Welfare should also think of the financial loss to those parents who keep their children at school.  In view of the case I mentioned perhaps the Minister might make a suggestion to the Minister for Finance regarding extension of reliefs of this kind to people who keep their children in school beyond the age of 16 years.  The number of such families who make these sacrifices is increasing all the time.</P>

      <P>I shall commence by replying to the last contribution made by Deputy Belton.  As the Deputy knows, a certain amount of business has to be dealt with before the Easter recess. It has been customary for the Dáil to adjourn its activities for the Easter period&mdash;in fact, it has been customary not to have any political activity during the Easter recess but, for some reason best known to themselves, Fine Gael have decided to engage in quite an amount of political activity in this period.  I can assure Deputy Belton, now that we have taken the decision to double the amount of political activity engaged in by Fine Gael <Col N="693" /> during the Easter period, that they will get more than they bargained for and will have the same result in the two by-elections as they had in Dublin south west.</P>
      <P>There is this necessity to get a certain amount of business done in this House before the Easter recess but both of the Opposition parties decided to try to frustrate this.

      <P>He scared all his own Deputies out of the House.  He could not even get someone to come in and second it.  It is some years now since I have had to reply to a debate on the Department of Social Welfare.  I think 1965 was the last time I had to reply to a debate on the Estimate for the Department and I really think I could give the same reply today as I gave in 1965 because the contributions from the Opposition followed the very same pattern.  In a way I am glad to see there has been no change on the part of the Opposition parties to social welfare; as, in 1965 and the years before that, there is no limit to their generosity. The sky is the limit with regard to social welfare as far as the Opposition parties are concerned.  That was always the position in my experience. However, the attitude is entirely different when it comes to the point of providing the money; the attitude is completely different at Budget time. Then the complaint is about the crushing burden of taxation on the taxpayer. But these two things, the Budget and the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare are, despite what Deputy Dr. O'Donovan may think, very closely linked; one is dependent on the other. The Budget is to a large extent the taking of the necessary steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I must admit that, although it is unreal, I welcome this generosity on the part of the Opposition parties.  On the last occasion, in <Col N="697" /> 1965, when I was dealing with the Estimate for the Department every Opposition Deputy who spoke advocated substantial expansions and innovations. That was the approach, as I remember it.  It is still the approach and I have no doubt that, when the Budget comes, the approach to the Budget by the Opposition will also be the same as it always was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will agree with practically everything Opposition Deputies said and all the dissension is being artificially created by Deputies like Deputy Belton.  Nobody, certainly no one on this side of the House at any rate, could or would disagree with any of the suggested improvements put forward. These are all desirable.  It can be taken, therefore, that we are all unanimous in regard to the objectives. The trouble is the Government have to consider these desirable things in the context of the national income and in the context of the problem of getting possession of an increasing proportion of the national income, which means, of course, of the earnings of the people.  This is a problem because the taxation code is not, unfortunately, so skilfully designed as always to produce in revenue the same proportion of a changing national income.  The Government have, therefore, to devise methods of either getting the same proportion of the national income or, if possible, an increasing proportion of it for all these social and other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the fundamental difference in approach between the Government and the Opposition.  I certainly cannot argue, do not intend to argue and do not feel like arguing against any of the suggestions for improvements that were made and I do not think anyone can complain in regard to this matter of getting hold of the money from the pockets of the people for social improvements of any lack of ingenuity or assiduity on the part of the Minister for Finance at Budget time or on my part, indeed, in relation to social insurance contributions.  We impose quite heavy taxation in this regard and <Col N="698" /> Deputies opposite are never slow to tell us that we are doing so.  I think we succeed quite skilfully in getting hold of quite a considerable proportion of the national income for these purposes. As I said, there is never any complaint about our ingenuity in doing this at Budget time.  The recent by-election was, in fact, fought by the Opposition on lurid forecasts of the new methods they told the people would be adopted by the Government to get more of their money in the next Budget.  So great was their success in Dublin south-west, basing the campaign on forecasts of the coming Budget, that they insisted on breaking with tradition and having by-elections conducted throughout Holy Week and Easter Week in order that they could fight these also on the basis of these lurid forecasts of what would be in the coming Budget rather than on the factual results of the financial proposals introduced by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to admit that I could not, because I am an honest man, discuss social welfare except in the context of the Budget.  When I come to the Budget I have to contrast the attitude of the Opposition Deputies who insist in dealing with these things in watertight compartments.  I must point out that the attitude at Budget time is different.  That is shown by the fact that they are already complaining about what they hope will be in the Budget.  Their success in Dublin South West was so great that they insist on having the other by-elections also before the Budget.  I want to make the Opposition a present of the information that so far as the Budget is concerned I, as Minister for Social Welfare, will be a pressure-force operating on the Minister for Finance trying to get him to take for the purposes of my Department as much as is feasible of the increased income that the people in general will have.  The Opposition can make what they like of that.  I will tell the people at chapel gates in Longford-Westmeath and Kildare that I will try to make sure that the Minister for Finance will make arrangements to extract more money from their pockets so that I can distribute it to the different classes of people dependent on the schemes administered by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no point in trying to extract from the people more than can be effectively taken.  By this I mean we must take what can be taken to an extent which will not result in its being negatived by inflation.  It is a very delicate operation to take the maximum amount feasible in that way.  I find it frustrating to see advances in social welfare payments being <Col N="700" /> swallowed up by inflation which is partly induced by the level of taxation levied at Budget time.  The idea is to try to strike a balance.  The Minister for Social Welfare, who is actually faced with this problem, finds that the cost of improvements is a problem that cannot be ignored.  Deputy Dr. Browne and others can brush aside the problems of finance.  The Government cannot do this.  It is not possible to do everything which is desirable at any particular time.  Contrary to what Deputies opposite have claimed, production and the <i>per capita</i> income in the country are limiting factors.  I would prefer if this were not so.  As Minister for Social Welfare, I cannot fool myself by pretending this is not so.  Deputies in Opposition can pretend such things, but the Minister for Social Welfare cannot pretend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that the only thing wrong with this Estimate was that it was too small.  I agree with that. I would like the Estimate to be considerably larger.  Deputy Ryan made the point that there was a readiness on behalf of the people to accept more taxation by the State for this purpose. I hope the Deputy will say that when the Budget comes in.  It is something of a fallacy that people are prepared to accept increases in taxation for this purpose.  I agree that people in general do not complain very much about extra taxation imposed for this purpose, but they do not agree to give more money for this purpose because extra taxation levied in order to finance social improvements always forms a component of the next wage claim. The extra taxation is usually taken back on the double or on the treble. Often, the result of this is that the value of what is given is reduced.  We have the frustrating experience of finding that the buoyancy on which we should be able to depend for social welfare improvements is, in fact, foreclosed on in advance by other sectors of the community.  Every country in the world finds that it is not feasible to take an excessive amount of the people's earnings in taxation.  People are not prepared to suffer any slight reduction in their own standard of living in order to improve the standard <Col N="701" /> of living of the social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Facts do not seem to concern the Opposition Deputies.  Deputy Ryan says we are not even maintaining the standard of living of social welfare recipients.  I do not know how the Deputy can say that.  The facts are demonstrably to the contrary.  I must quote figures to show how wrong is this statement of Deputy Ryan.  I propose to show the improvement which has been effected in the various social welfare schemes since 1957 during the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The cost of living figure at mid-May 1957 was 110.5.  The latest figure available is for mid-November 1969, 175.1, an increase of 58.4 per cent.  During that time there have been increases in every one of the social welfare schemes which have far outpaced the increase in the cost of living.  The non-contributory old age pension was 24s in 1957; it is now 75s, an increase of 51s and a percentage increase of 212.5 as against an increase in the cost of living of 58.4 per cent.  Deputy Ryan had the nerve to say that we had not even maintained the standard of social welfare assistance.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are now allowances for children; there is free electricity and free travel.  Some Opposition Deputies mentioned unemployment assistance on this occasion although when in office this was a service that might never have existed because it was never increased by them.  Largely, because of that it is still the lowest of all our social welfare services.  Unemployment assistance for the single person in the urban area has gone up in that period from 18s in 1957 to 61s 6d, an increase of 43s 6d and a percentage increase of 241.7.  In a rural area the increase has been from 12s to 55s 6d, again an increase of 43s 6d and a percentage increase of 362.5 per cent.  For a recipient with an adult dependant, generally speaking, that is with a wife, the increase has been from 28s in an urban area to 117s 6d, an increase of 89s 6d or 319.6 per cent.  In a rural area the increase is from 20s to 109s 6d, again an increase of 89s 6d or 447.5 per <Col N="702" /> cent.  For a married man with a wife and four children the increase is from 38s in an urban area to 157s 6d or from 28s in a rural area to 149s 6d, a percentage increase in the urban area of 314.5 and in the rural area of 433.9.</P>
    <P>The non-contributory widow's pension has increased from 22s 6d to 73s 6d, an increase of 51s or 226.7 per cent.  In the case of a non-contributory widow with four children the increase is from 36s to 113s 6d, an increase of 77s 6d or 215.3 per cent.  This occurred in a period when the cost of living figure increased by 58.4 per cent so that social assistance payments in general have outpaced the cost of living since 1957 by something approaching four to one.</P>

      <P>I intend to give the whole picture.  I have dealt only with social assistance payments and, to complete the picture, I want to go on to social insurance payments.  Again, in the case of unemployment and disability benefits, for a cost of living increase of 58.4 per cent in the case of a single man the increase is from 30s to 75s, or 150 per cent.  In the case of a married man the increase is from 45s to 137s 6d or 205.5 per cent.  In the <Col N="703" /> case of a married man with four children the increase is from 61s to 189s 6d, or 210.7 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not all at once.  I shall tell the Deputy and that is the difference between this Government and the Opposition: not only did we pass the legislation giving these increases but we arranged for them to be financed also.  In regard to social insurance we arranged for them to be financed in three different ways, by contributions from the employer, from the employee and the taxpayer, all exacted compulsorily by the State.  In regard to contributory widow's pensions&mdash;I suppose I need not go back over it all so that Deputies will not lose the trend&mdash;these have increased from 30s to 75s, or 150 per cent and in the case of a widow with four children from 46s to 129s 6d, 181.5 per cent.  Contributory old age pensions were introduced for the first time in 1961 and so far as the Opposition are concerned they might never have existed.  These pensions have also more than kept pace with the cost of living, so that social insurance benefits during the time of this Government have outpaced the cost of living by about three to one on average.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never an occasion when all the social welfare <Col N="704" /> schemes were dealt with in the same year except by Fianna Fáil and we deal with them practically every year. The Opposition, because of their superficial approach to the whole matter, know that non-contributory old-age pensions have an emotional connotation in the public mind and they gave 2s 6d in two single years, one in each of their three-year periods, to that service but they ignored most of the other social welfare schemes practically entirely and gave nothing, for instance, for unemployment assistance which is still suffering because of their neglect and schemes such as the children's allowances scheme might never have existed so far as they were concerned. These were never dealt with by any Government except Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The other point made by Deputy Ryan was that the percentage of State expenditure devoted to social welfare was falling.  This apparently, is an indictment of the Government put forward as an indication that the Government are neglecting social welfare.  The percentage of the State expenditure is falling but the percentage of the national income devoted to social welfare is increasing.  There are more social insurance services now and I see nothing wrong with that.  Talking about the percentage of State expenditure devoted to State expenditure is meaningless.</P>

      <P>As I have been pointing out to the Deputies, the significant figure in regard to the effort being made by the community for social <Col N="705" /> welfare is the gross expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of national income&mdash;not as a percentage of State expenditure, which is absolutely meaningless.  Deputies opposite do not quote this relevant figure.  The fact of the matter is that the gross expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of national income in 1956-57 was 6.4 per cent; in 1969-70, the current year, it is estimated to be approximately 8.4 per cent.  That in itself is a significant improvement. However, when we take this in conjunction with the fact that the national income itself has increased so much and that the number of people, for instance, in receipt of unemployment benefit is so much less than it was under the Opposition, then we can see that this is an even greater improvement than would appear because, of course, the percentage of national income spent on social welfare in 1956-57 was inflated by the highest ever figure of unemployment here, combined with the lowest national income.</P>

      <P>Nothing would suit me better than to go back to that but I think it would only be co-operating with Opposition Deputies to delay the proceedings of the House and I do not intend to do that.  However, the percentage of the national income spent on social welfare in 1956-57 was inflated by these two facts&mdash;that highest ever number of unemployed and an exceptionally low national income because of the collapse of the economy. Therefore, with higher outgoings than normal and a lower national income than normal, naturally the percentage on social welfare was abnormally high at 6.4 per cent.</P>

What exactly is the argument that the expenditure on social welfare should all be from the Central Exchequer, that is, the taxpayer? All the money comes from the one source, from the people.  It is all exacted compulsorily by the State; some by general taxation, some by contributions by employers and employees.  To a certain extent this is merely a question of mechanics, of devising ways and means of transferring money from the pockets of the people who initially acquire it to the State for social welfare purposes. There is also in it the principle of establishing schemes under which a right to benefit will be acquired on an insurance or contributory basis.  I should like those Opposition Deputies who insist on disregarding anything except Exchequer expenditure on social welfare to tell us their objection to this principle of social insurance.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be eminently just and highly desirable to have a contributory scheme which can be administered without a means test on the basis of a right acquired through the payment of contributions.  I think it is very appropriate that employers should be required to contribute to such a scheme.  It is entirely justifiable to raise amounts specifically from employers, as such, rather than that the whole amount should, as Deputy O'Donovan and other Deputies advocate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully will give <Col N="707" /> the Deputy the figures.  They are a fact. The contributions have increased substantially in proportion to the increase in benefit rates.  The figures are there. We pay for anything we give.  That is how we continue.  That is why we are here now for 13 years and why any Government with which the Deputy was associated never lasted more than three years.  It is because we raise the money to finance any services we bring in.  We raise part of it by way of contributions from employers and employees and part of it by way of general taxation.  The proportion of social insurance paid out of general taxation or, as Deputies would try to say, out of the Central Exchequer, trying to hide the fact that it comes from the taxpayer, is much higher here than in many other countries Deputies opposite can mention.</P>
      <P>I think it is appropriate to finance these schemes in this way.  It is obvious that those Deputies who insist that it is only the percentage of State expenditure that is the criterion, are, in fact, claiming that these schemes should be financed by general taxation only. Social insurance is really a form of selective taxation and all expenditure on social welfare services is, in fact, expenditure by the State from money collected from the community as a whole.  The real criterion of the concern shown by a Government for social welfare is the percentage of the national income which the Government acquire and utilise for this purpose. As I have shown, this percentage has been increasing.</P>

      <P>Now that Deputy O'Donovan has gone I do not think there is any more I need to say.  I intended to deal at some length with Deputy Noel Browne's contribution but I dealt sufficiently with his contributions in 1965, 1964 and 1963 and his contribution this year is the same.  I do not think I need to bother.</P>
      <P>There were a number of other points made and I should normally deal with them but Deputies opposite do not seem to want them dealt with.  I can only say that any constructive suggestions made by the Opposition will be considered.  Once again I wish to reassure the Opposition Deputies that I agree with all the improvements they have advocated and that they will find that, as the years pass by and as they, or some of them, continue to sit on those benches, these improvements will be made gradually by Fianna Fáil. They will be made gradually because Fianna Fáil will refrain from trying to go faster than the state of the economy will justify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will continue to strike as close <Col N="709" /> a balance as we can between the level of the economy and the earnings of the community at every Budget time; my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will continue to try to extract the maximum possible amount which it is feasible to extract from the earnings of the community, and he will hand it over to me to distribute in the form of social welfare benefits and to my other colleagues in the Government for better health services, improved education facilities and so on.  Over the years Deputies opposite will in that way see implemented the majority of the things they have advocated.</P>
    <P>I agree it is time to depart from the system of flat rate benefits and it has been announced, of course, that the Government intend to introduce a scheme of pay related benefits and, for the benefit of the lately departed Deputy O'Donovan, I can say also pay related contributions.  There is no difficulty in charting the road ahead but the difference between the approach of the Government and of the Opposition is that we have to find the money for these things as well as thinking of what should be done.  In our experience, and we have had 30 years of it in Government, we have not found any other way of getting money for these things except from the earnings of the community.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this &ldquo;Token&rdquo; Estimate is to give the House an opportunity of discussing the main Estimate for Defence for 1969-70 which was passed without debate last November. That Estimate provided for the expenditure of £12,852,000.  Recently a Supplementary Estimate for £1,644,000 <Col N="712" /> was passed.  The discussion on the Supplementary Estimate ranged fairly widely, so I do not propose to take up the time of the House by going over ground that has already been covered.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate was based on an average permanent Defence Force strength of 1,154 officers, 73 cadets and 7,100 NCOs and privates for the year. In the early part of the year it became clear that the figure for men could not be realised without the aid of an intensive recruiting drive.  The drive started in September and I am happy to say that it has been very successful. Between the 1st September and the 14th of this month, 1,456 men applied to join and 970 were accepted.  The other ranks strength at the end of February was 7,364.</P>
    <P>Recruiting goes on all the year round and I would ask Deputies to do all they can to encourage young men to offer their services.  I think they would find a few years in the Army a rewarding experience in every way.  Of course, if they wished, they could make it their career.  There are also opportunities of appointment to commissioned rank.  An age concession is given to serving personnel who wish to compete in the annual cadetship competition and a proportion of the vacancies is specially reserved for them.</P>
    <P>I might mention also that 31 non-commissioned officers are currently undergoing a potential officers' course of about one year's duration to prepare them for appointment to commissioned rank.  Last year, too, a scheme was introduced under which men of the permanent Defence Force were given an opportunity of attending courses of one year's duration at vocational schools with a view to obtaining the day group certificate.  The purpose is to raise the educational standard of the men.  This would benefit not alone the Army but would be an asset to the men themselves when they return to civilian life.  A total of 159 men commenced classes in September and further courses will be arranged in future years.  Attendance is on a voluntary basis and the cost is being borne on the Vote for Defence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> A number of Army personnel aged between 44 and 52 years mainly from the 1st (Irish Speaking) Battalion are attending courses of training in such skills as turning, grinding, milling and welding, at the Galway Industrial Training Centre which is under the control of AnCO.  This is a pilot scheme the purpose of which is to assist in the resettlement of the men in civilian occupations and to provide operatives for industry.</P>
    <P>The apprentice schemes at Naas and Baldonnel continue to be operated. Steps are being taken in consultation with AnCO to ensure that high standards of training will be maintained and that the technicians turned out by the Army apprentice schools will be second to none.</P>
    <P>A significant step was taken during the year regarding the training of cadets.  Following consideration of the recommendation of the Commission on Higher Education that the training of military cadets should be associated with university studies, I decided in August last that appropriately qualified members of the cadet class appointed in 1968 should be given the opportunity of pursuing university studies at University College, Galway. A total of 14 cadets commenced courses in Arts, Commerce, Science or Engineering in October last.  Subject to their passing the normal military tests, these will be appointed to commissioned rank next autumn and thereafter may continue their university studies and obtain a degree.</P>
    <P>It is intended that appropriately qualified members of the cadet class appointed in 1969 will be given the opportunity to commence similar studies in October of this year.  From this year onwards it is proposed that the educational qualifications for cadets will be the matriculation standard of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The question of new vessels for the Naval Service has been very much in the news.  The types of vessels to be acquired must be chosen with great care and judgment as they will involve an outlay of some few million pounds. It is necessary to bear in mind that the Naval Service is not merely a <Col N="714" /> fishery protection service; it must also be trained and equipped for naval tasks.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government have authorised the acquisition of two vessels, one to be a naval ship which would have a fishery protection potential and the other to be primarily a fishery protection vessel suited to conditions off our coasts.  Priority has been given to the naval ship because of its potential for both fishery protection and naval training but difficulty has been experienced in locating a type of vessel, already proven in service, which would conform to the rather special specifications demanded by conditions off our coasts.  Investigations regarding both types of vessels are being pushed ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the fishery protection vessel, we have narrowed down our search to a particular type and Irish Shipping Limited have been appointed to act as the Department's consultants. Already the company have issued an inquiry to a large number of shipbuilders as to whether they would be interested in tendering for the construction of a fishery protection vessel, an outline specification of which was supplied.  The outcome of these inquiries is expected very soon.  Thereafter the aim will be to invite tenders at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The possibility of using small fast patrol boats has been considered. These might have a limited use in local areas in favourable weather conditions but would not provide an adequate fishery protection service under the conditions experienced off our coasts.  Adequate protection requires the use of larger vessels of the type we are seeking.</P>
    <P>In the past two years £47,000 has been spent on the purchase of horses for the Equitation School.  In the 1969 season, all-Army teams competed at Ludwigsburg, Wiesbaden, Vienna, Ostend, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Brussels and Geneva; and Army riders and horses participated in the Irish teams at the London and Dublin shows.  Placing included five firsts, six seconds and 13 thirds.  I hope that this marks the beginning of a new and successful phase in the school's history.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Six officer cadets from the Republic of Zambia who were undergoing training in the Military College were joined, in February, 1969, by six Zambia Army officers for an infantry course of five months duration.  These officers and cadets successfully completed their training last summer and returned to Zambia.  A second class of seven Zambian cadets commenced training at the Military College last October.  The costs of running these courses are met by the Government of Zambia.</P>
    <P>Helicopters were provided on 41 occasions in response to requests from local authorities for use in an ambulance role in 1969, while on 22 occasions the helicopter services were called on for search and rescue missions.</P>
    <P>Six new married quarters have been completed in Limerick.  They were built by Army engineer personnel using the most modern building techniques. The improvement of barrack accommodation generally is given a high priority and in recent years considerable progress has been made.</P>
    <P>A start has been made in issuing modern combat dress to our troops. This dress, which is already on issue to Irish troops serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus, is an integrated multi-purpose uniform capable of being adjusted to all climatic conditions. It has now been adopted by practically all modern armies.  The ordinary uniforms will continue to be issued for duties which do not necessitate the wearing of combat dress.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence did not come within the ambit of the recent Supplementary Estimate and I take this opportunity of making a brief reference to that organisation.  The training activities of the Civil Defence organisation were maintained at a satisfactory level during the year.  Progress continues to be made in the establishment of control centres from which civil defence operations would be directed and co-ordinated in a national emergency. Generally, there is a growing capability in this area of national defence. Our thanks are due to the members of the organisation for their voluntary <Col N="716" /> unpaid service, and I recall particularly the assistance that they and members of other voluntary organisations rendered in connection with the reception of refugees last year.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Supplementary Estimate, the role of the Defence Forces and their position in our community life were mentioned. Stated simply, the primary role of the Defence Forces is to defend the State against external aggression.  As a corollary their main business in peacetime is to prepare themselves to fulfil that role.  Apart from this, their most important peacetime role is, perhaps, that of aiding the civil power.  In practice, this means assisting the Garda Síochána and at present involves giving assistance at the request of the Garda in the protection of installations of national importance.  This role could also take the form of assisting the Garda Síochána, at their request, in the maintenance or restoration of the public peace.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that the Defence Forces should be more closely integrated in our society.  I do not think that there is a real problem here.  The personnel of the forces are drawn from and are representative of all sections of our community and they do not become isolated from the community on becoming members of the forces. Many of the peace-time activities of the forces at the official level impinge directly on the community and at the unofficial level, too, I think it is the experience of Deputies that Army personnel are always willing to lend their support and assistance to a wide variety of social activities.  All in all, the Defence Forces make a considerable contribution to the common good and any assignment which is given to them is carried out competently and efficiently.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the discussion on the Supplementary Estimate ranged fairly widely.  The debate now starting gives the House a fuller opportunity of discussing this very important service.  If there are any matters of interest to Deputies that I have not touched on, I shall be happy to do so in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, <Col N="717" /> we had a discussion recently on the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Defence and, on that occasion, quite an amount of ground was covered particularly in relation to pay and conditions in the Army.  In his reply the Minister referred to a remark of mine, and he referred to it again in his contribution today.  I expressed the view that it would be desirable to have a closer integration of the Army into the whole fabric of our society.  It is obvious from what the Minister said in replying to the debate on the Supplementary Estimate, and again today, that he misunderstood the significance of that remark, or what I intended it to mean.  That was obvious, too, from what Deputy Healy had to say on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I certainly welcomed what the Minister said when he deprecated an incident that took place somewhere down the country when people from the naval force were refused admission to some function.  He was right to deprecate that.  That is something we have got from the past but it is rapidly disappearing. Deputy Healy said that in Cork at least the Army gave an immense amount of assistance and leadership in the running of a variety of social events.  I know that is quite true and I know it is true not only in Cork but in the Curragh and in other centres as well.  I know the Army have always given this type of leadership and co-operation in social events of one sort or another.</P>
      <P>I was referring to something more than that.  We must try to involve the Army in the social and economic development of the country.  I had in mind a much wider role for the Army. Everything is not as right with the Army as the Minister feels it is.  The impression one gets listening to Deputies speaking in the House is that there is nothing wrong and that the Army just sails along in the same old way as always.  My honest view is that there is no policy on Defence in this country, that there is considerable political apathy on this question and that, outside the Army itself, there is very little thought or knowledge about it. That is all wrong.  There should be considerable concern about the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> It is quite true to say that, as a result of this political apathy, as a result of the absence of a mission, the Army is struggling along in a straitjacket of Civil Service restrictions.  No proper thought is given to peace-time development of the Army beyond mere maintenance in existence.  To maintain itself in existence seems to have been the main purpose of the Army.</P>
    <P>We all acknowledge very freely the wonderful work being done by our peace-keeping forces overseas.  They are doing magnificent work and were it not for that work I think morale would have dropped to a very low ebb in the Army.  When there is this obvious lack of interest or lack of a mission, it leads to disinterest, to a lowering of personal and professional standards.  The sooner something is done about this and someone produces a peace-time Defence policy, the better for the Army as a whole.</P>
    <P>This is not in any way meant to be a criticism of the people in the Army. We have wonderful and excellent people in the Army.  This would happen in any organisation.  In the absence of a clearcut mission any organisation becomes an end in itself.  This is what is happening in the Army.  There is a wonderful opportunity here for a young Minister to stand back and take a look at the situation.  Is the Army contributing what it should contribute for the £12 million or £14 million being spent on it annually?  I think it is not.  The position would be improved enormously if another look were taken at this whole aspect of the work of the Army.</P>
    <P>The British Government have got out a pamphlet on the peace-time functions of the Army, on the contribution the Army can make to the civil life of the country.  There is a similar opportunity here but it is not being fully utilised.  There are a number of matters in which the Army could be involved to the betterment of the Army.  So far we have neglected to do this.  There are several matters in which it would certainly be worthwhile to involve the Army.  There is coastal protection and there is the building of recreational and community centres.</P>
    <P>There is a great need throughout the <Col N="719" /> country for the development of youth clubs and recreational facilities.  I know the Army is particularly good at this type of work.  I see no reason why there could not be temporary secondments from the Army for this type of development.  It is extremely important that our young people should have these facilities as soon as possible.  This type of work would be ideal training&mdash; military training, if you like&mdash;for the Army, because it would be akin to the type of work they will be called upon to do later on.  This is one job the Army could and should be involved in.</P>
    <P>It could be involved in the provision of community halls and meeting rooms, the construction and improvement of sports grounds, the provision of instructors&mdash;gymnasium instructors and various other instructors in this field.  I could go on giving a long list of projects in which the Army could be involved but I will just refer to this booklet &ldquo;Military Aid to the Civil Community in the United Kingdom&rdquo;. Just a few of the things they propose is the restoration of disused and derelict canals.  There is a wonderful job the Army could be doing here in the development and cleaning up of canals as recreational waterways for our people; there is the improvement of landscapes, nature conservation, coastal protection, restoration of derelict industrial sites.  The Army would be doing very useful work in dealing with derelict sites and removing a great number of eyesores.  It also refers to the restoration of footpaths and stiles but I think we are looking after them reasonably in Local Government.  Then there is the erection of shelters and rescue spots on hills and mountains, route mapping and the adaptation of disused railway installations.</P>
    <P>That is just a rough indication of what could be done.  We would have to look at our own situation here.  In more remote parts of the country development is urgently needed and this type of work would improve the efficiency of the Army for their own job later. Certainly their involvement should be confined to work which would be of assistance and would be suitable training for a soldier in any case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> The Minister referred again to fishery protection about which I have been listening to comments since I came into the House.  We have extended our territorial waters, we have an increasingly valuable fishing industry, and, I think the Minister will admit, we have next to no protection. There are three ships that are obviously long past their useful life. There has been continual agitation in this House over the past ten years to do something about them.  Fairly considerable sums have been spent on these boats trying to keep them seaworthy and, indeed, failing, and if the three are not laid up now, a short time ago they were.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation, and it is more serious still when we see the Minister is not yet able to tell us when even one boat or ship will be purchased for fishery protection.  This is deplorable.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say the position is still under examination and that there appears to have been some progress made in investigating the type of ship that would be most suitable for this work.  The fact that it involves the expenditure of money is something that cannot be shirked any longer.  There is too much at risk and I, in common with many other people, believe that there is considerable poaching of Irish waters by outside fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his statement to the equitation school and to the fact £47,000 had been spent on the purchase of horses for the equitation school in the past two years.  This is something to be welcomed.  For far too long we have been working on a shoestring.  We were trying to buy horses at prices at which it would be quite impossible to get a decent horse. Now obviously we are paying good prices.  No rider no matter how good he is can get results with a bad horse and, as the Minister has said, recent performances give hope of a bright future in the equitation school.</P>
    <P>This is extremely important for the bloodstock industry.  It is the best advertisement we have.  Not only should everything possible be done to get the best horses in the equitation school <Col N="721" /> but also to get the best riders into it. Special inducements should be held out to young people who show themselves at an early age to be skilled horsemen and who have been associated with horses all their lives.  One should not expect a green cadet who has had no previous experience of horses to make a first-class horseman.  I am sure there are exceptions to this rule, but we should look for the man who already has part of the necessary skill before he goes into the Army; then more than half the battle is won.</P>
    <P>I hope the people who are buying the horses are really good judges.  It does not necessarily follow that because somebody was in touch with horses all his life, that because he was a good rider himself, he would be a good judge of a horse, a jumper or a potential performer.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister tell the House the recent recruiting drive was very satisfactory.  I just wonder why it was particularly satisfactory. Is it because pay and conditions have been somewhat improved in recent times?  Is it because there are new opportunities opening up for the Army, the prospect of service overseas? I think all these things have their effect.</P>
    <P>One of the things that pleased me most about the Minister's statement was the opportunity that is now being given to young people in the Army to attend vocational schools to improve their educational standards.  I have always felt there was a limited amount of excellent work being done in Naas and Baldonnel in turning out technicians and that this should be expanded considerably.  The Army could be and should be one large vocational school.  People should be learning new skills all the time.  This is part of the mission of the Army, not waiting for something to happen.  Waiting for something to happen has a very demoralising effect, and not nearly enough of our Army personnel are getting this opportunity of training both as technicians and technologists and for other walks of life.  If they learn these skills early on, when they leave the Army they will make a useful contribution to civilian life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> I was glad to see, too, that a limited number of cadets are getting an opportunity of taking out degrees at the university.  This is something which has been lacking for too long in the Army.  All these things contribute to make life in the Army much more attractive.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion recently that there should be a short service scheme in the Army and I agree completely with this proposal.  All our young people would benefit as they would get a bit of discipline and toughening-up. The sooner young people realise that there is something worthwhile for them in the Army the better it will be for the country.  The wider participation in the social and economic development of the country that is possible in the Army should be an inducement to young people to join.  As we make more opportunities available for vocational training and further education there will be no trouble with regard to recruitment.  At the moment people have very little information, and consequently very little interest, about what is happening in the Army and this is to be deplored.  When all these developments get going there should be an annual report that could be circulated and read by all the people in the country and measures such as this would help to eliminate the apathy that has existed up to now. During the years the Army has carried on in a routine fashion; we have had discussions here about uniforms, pay and conditions but it has generated very little interest throughout the country.</P>
    <P>On the subject of accommodation, the Minister said that there is some work in progress to improve living conditions in barracks.  An immense amount of work must be done in this sphere.  In many cases the outside appearance of the barracks is most unattractive and unappealing and this should be remedied.  During the year I asked a question about the number of properties held by the Department of Defence and I discovered that it was simply enormous.  Surely it would be far better to have a much smaller number of premises, more suitable and modernised and sell what we do not <Col N="723" /> need.  I know quite a number of these properties are FCA huts and halls and that they have to be retained but we could reduce the number of Army establishments probably by 50 per cent and have sufficient left.  We should concentrate on ensuring that the remaining 50 per cent are modernised and up-to-date.  All of these factors would combine to make life in the Army not merely just bearable but attractive.  I was glad to hear that NCOs are now having an opportunity of getting a commission in the Army. Schemes such as this keep people at all levels in the Army on their toes, anxious and willing to co-operate.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to Civil Defence and the Minister congratulated the people who give up their time to go into defence and do a useful job. Civil Defence is quite useless unless we develop the observer corps and have a first-class early-warning system through an observer corps.  The corps was set up a few years ago and has more or less stood still since then.  I should like to hear from the Minister what importance he attaches to the observer corps relative to its importance to the civil defence organisation. There would not be any great difficulty in getting Civil Defence operational if we had this early-warning system and an efficient observer corps.  There is no doubt that whenever there is a crisis in the country the people rise to the occasion.  We have in existence quite a number of organisations who would co-operate with Civil Defence should an emergency arise.  I consider the observer corps and early-warning system more important and deserving of higher priority than Civil Defence itself.</P>
    <P>Last year I was a member of the platform party at the GPO during the St. Patrick's Day parade and I was very surprised and disappointed.  There was a small unit of the FCA participating and one can only say that they were very droopy-looking and their appearance was not a credit to the Irish Army.  The purpose of having a parade is to show something at its best and this is particularly so at the St. Patrick's Day parade.  I cannot say what was the purpose of having the small unit of <Col N="724" /> FCA participating but it did not give a good impression of the Irish Army. St. Patrick's Day is an important day, not only in this country but in many places throughout the world, and it would add an immense amount to that parade if even a small well turned-out unit of the Army participated but if we cannot be proud of the appearance of our Army in a parade I do not think they should participate at all.  For far too long we have had a bad impression of the Army but I am glad to say that this is disappearing.  If the various suggestions I have made were implemented I do not think there would be any difficulty with regard to recruitment.</P>
    <P>We referred recently to disturbances in the north of Ireland.  While I certainly hope that there will not be a recurrence, a situation exists there whereby such disturbances could arise again.  The people in the Army did an excellent job during the last crisis in the various refugee camps and at the depots set up at the Border.  We should be prepared for emergencies of this kind in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not referred to the position of our Army if we join the EEC.  We are now actively negotiating and hope to become members of the Community in a couple of years time. Will such membership carry with it a defence commitment and what further calls will it make on the Army?  I was disappointed that the Minister did not include these matters in his statement to the House although I know he explained his statement was necessarily short because he did not think it necessary to go into matters more deeply having covered the ground so recently in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is duplication in this debate the blame for it must, I think, fall on the Government.  I cannot understand why the Supplementary Estimate introduced a few weeks ago and the other Supplementary Estimates were not taken in conjunction with the main Estimates. In Social Welfare, which is not an easy Estimate to deal with, it was found possible to deal with both the Supplementary Estimate and the main Estimate <Col N="725" /> together.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why this could not have been dealt with in the same way.  There may be some good reason why it was not but I cannot see what that reason was.</P>
      <P>I shall try to avoid duplication, but it will not be easy because the Minister mentioned a number of matters which were not mentioned before.  He referred, for instance, to the recruiting campaign.  I do not know whether or not the campaign is a success.  The Minister gave the number of other ranks strength at 7,364 at the end of February of this year.  He also gave the number who were accepted: 974 out of 1,456 who applied.  Would the Minister be able to tell us how many have left the Army?  What is the annual wastage? I notice that the Minister says the original Estimate was based on an average permanent Defence Force strength of 1,154 officers, 73 cadets and 7,100 NCOs and privates.  We assume they are above strength but the Minister has not told us what the strength of the officers is now.  Perhaps he would tell us when he is replying how many officers we have.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything wonderful in the arrangement by which a certain number of men are selected to undergo a potential officers' course; 31 out of 7,364 appears to be a pretty small percentage. I agree with Deputy Clinton&mdash; perhaps not for quite the same reason &mdash;about the lack of incentive.  Looking around this House I see quite a number of ex-Army personnel.  Most of us served during the emergency.  There was then a certain incentive.  We were training for something.  Towards the end of the emergency things began to get a bit sloppy and I am told that the situation now has deteriorated very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Clinton said, the incentive to train for something does not appear to be there.  That does not mean that the type of people in the Army are not as good as, or better than, they were during the emergency. Having 7,000 8,000 or 9,000 young men scattered in a few barracks throughout the country, reporting for duty in the morning and with very little to do during the day, is not, in <Col N="726" /> my opinion, the way in which an Army should be trained.  I do not want the Minister to get the impression I am blaming him for this.  This is a sort of tradition handed down.  A small number of new weapons is available and the Minister says they have got the new automatic rifle now.  That is a big improvement on what they had.  There should be a considerable sharpening up of weapon drill.</P>
    <P>As far as the general appearance of soldiers is concerned, I notice, and I am sure everyone else does too, that while soldiers take a certain part in public life they usually do so in civilian dress.  We do not see many soldiers in uniform.  Here in this city one would get the impression that there is not a soldier anywhere near it.  This is due to one of two things: the walking out dress is not up to the standard soldiers would like it to be when they are in public or, as happens in every other country in peace time, the soldier is not given the place in society to which he is entitled.  Like other countries we tend to look down our noses on men in uniform during peace time.  If there is a war the soldier becomes a hero overnight.  I think the big trouble is that the Irish people are not giving to the soldier the due to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>The Army itself must carry a certain amount of responsibility for this.  There should be more public parades, more Army bands and more soldiers competing in different types of sport.  It should be generally accepted that the Army does exist.  Until the recent recruiting campaign started&mdash;most of the advertising seems to be the rangers on television&mdash;not very much use appears to have been made of the Permanent Defence Force to encourage people to join the Army.  The soldiers should be dressed as well as possible, drilled, trained to march properly and they should be marched through our cities and towns in order to attract recruits.  That was done during the emergency and no march ever took place that did not result in a considerable number of new recruits.  I am not talking about the dogs that followed the soldiers into the barracks; that was just one of those things.  The pay at that time was ridiculously low.  It could <Col N="727" /> not be called pay at all.  On the last occasion on which we debated the Defence Estimate the Minister said he considered the pay they are getting now quite reasonable and he thought it was unfair to say that £8 a week would not encourage young men to join the Army, remembering that they got a uniform and food as well.</P>
    <P>I understand the food has improved but not to the extent to which it could improve.  In the battalion to which I belonged they used to say that if the cook were hanged for being a cook he would be hanged in the wrong; there are still some of these cooks in the Army.  If a cook goes sick he is replaced by some fellow who says he knows something about cooking; what he really means is that he will be in a position to eat more food than is ordinarily given to him and he wants to get in on the ground floor.  The cooking is not what it should be and the result is that good food is spoiled.  Only the very best cooks should be allowed to touch food.  The Army should be able to train cooks.  Trained cooks would easily find employment outside when they leave the Army.  The diningrooms could be cleaner.  I will leave it at that.  Most of the men come from good homes and they are used to having food served attractively and, if they are are not, they should get used to it during their time in the Army.  They should have the very best of cooking and eating facilities.  It is not right that they should be expected, just because they are soldiers, to eat off a bare or an enamel-topped table.  There is no reason at all why tablecloths and the ordinary effects in common use should not be made available.  An adequate supply of food should be available to the young men in the Army.</P>
    <P>The Army have a problem.  Very often they find that a man who may not be much use and who has been in the Army for a long time&mdash;he may have 21 years service, be married with a big family&mdash;decides to leave the Army after 21, 22 or perhaps 29 years service.  His decision is received with acclamation.  Others who would be worth more than what they are paid <Col N="728" /> by the Army authorities might decide to leave the Army for family reasons.  I know of a case of a man who decided to leave.  He made his application.  It was processed, but before he actually left he found that the problem he had to deal with had disappeared.  This man asked for permission to continue on in the Army.  The Army, noting that he was costing a lot and that a young recruit would cost less, said he must go.  This man would have been an acquisition to the Army for another year or two.</P>
    <P>I understand there will be an adjustment in pay for the Army this year in keeping with all the other public services.  If we do not keep the pay in line with what can be obtained outside, the Army personnel will be dissatisfied. The question of pension does not seem to have altered.  I mentioned previously the case of a man with 21 years service who got one shilling per year afterwards.  I meant that if a man serves an extra year with the Army he gets one shilling per week for each year he serves over 21 years. The Minister may have misunderstood me on that occasion.  I thought everybody knew exactly what I was talking about.  It was ridiculous to suggest that a man with 21 years service who decides to stay on for a period of years after that will be given only one shilling per week per year for such service. This should have been reviewed.  The present Minister for Defence is a man who, from his own knowledge, will agree this should be done.</P>
    <P>Something should be done about gratuities.  The married officer gets a gratuity and pension.  The single officer and the unfortunate NCO get no grant no matter how long they have served. The NCO gets six months predischarge leave.  During this leave, the State retains his insurance cards.  An ex-Army man could not sign on as unemployed, nor could he take up a job without his insurance cards.  This was put right.  Heretofore, a man was allowed to have his six months predischarge leave only on condition that he did not work.  If he worked, he lost it.  The situation has now been altered for the better.  But the man still does not get any gratuity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> There has been mention of the 31 non-commissioned officers currently undergoing an officers' course.  How were these men selected?  I know many soldiers.  Many of them were anxious to be taken on this course.  They were interviewed.  They told me the interview did not consist of anything important. They were well educated, intelligent men with experience in the Army.  These men were not selected. I do not know on what basis the selection was made.  Was it decided that only 31 men could be accommodated? We could all understand that accommodation might have limited the course to 31 men, leaving out many who might be equally useful.  In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is intended that appropriately qualified members of the cadet class appointed in 1969 will be given the opportunity to commence similar studies in October of this year.  From this year onwards it is proposed that the educational qualifications for cadets will be the matriculation standard of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Will this apply to future serving NCOs who will be interviewed for the purpose of promotions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is.  We are creating something new.  This sort of thing slips through without much notice.  Are the NCOs expected to have this qualification in future?  It is an excellent thing that adult education is being provided for certain soldiers. They ought to avail of it.  The question of teaching soldiers a trade or, if possible, a profession while they are in the Army for 21 years is a matter of great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school which trains the personnel at the Curragh is doing a good job.  It does not cover the main bulk of serving soldiers who do not appear to be given any opportunity of learning a trade, craft or profession while in the Army.  Many of them might not welcome using their spare time for educational purposes during their first year, but after that they would more than <Col N="730" /> welcome something which would train them and make them better equipped for civilian life when they return to it. I have met people who have left the Army after 35 years.  On returning to civilian life they found they were regarded as middle-aged men whom nobody really wanted.  The skills they had acquired in the Army were of no use to them.  Some of them did unskilled labouring work for which they were quite unsuited.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton has been talking about getting soldiers to do reconstruction and demolition work.  The curse of the Army is the fatigue system and the habit of putting overalls on the soldiers in a spare hour and making them do unskilled labour.  If you want to prevent recruiting all that is necessary is to show on the next issue of posters or Ranger advertisements the fact that, in addition to jumping over tanks and so on, soldiers are expected to put on fatigues and dig ditches and holes.  That will finish it for good.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in what will happen if we go into the EEC.  I hope we shall never go in and I made this clear before.  Let us have no doubt about it: the present Taoiseach definitely said two years ago in an interview in Paris that we were prepared to accept all defence commitments.  If that has been changed the Minister should let us know because there will be defence commitments.  One of the things I have against the EEC is that it is building up a power bloc and I think it wrong to hand over our economy, including autonomy in regard to our defence forces, to a power bloc.</P>
    <P>At present the Minister says the Army has two jobs, to protect us from outside aggression, which is not very likely at present unless we consider the &ldquo;headers&rdquo; in the Six Counties, and internal defence.  I believe the main function of the Army is, and has been for many years internal defence; it is necessary to maintain an army for internal defence because a country without an army to defend its government means a very weak government unable to defend itself against those who feel they can, by brute force, take over the country.  While we may consider it unthinkable that this could <Col N="731" /> happen here we all know of two or three groups in the country at present, admittedly small, who have the avowed intention of overthrowing the Government. The only way to ensure this will not happen is to have an adequate defence against them.  We must also protect such establishments as the ESB and it is right that the Army should be used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister did not refer at all to the FCA.  Have they ceased to exist so far as the Department is concerned?  Are they no longer regarded as part of the Defence Forces?  If so, they should be so informed. Deputy Clinton was pretty harsh about the appearance of the FCA going down O'Connell Street. Having had the not very pleasant experience of marching down O'Connell Street on a wet, cold day, I wonder what Deputy Clinton would feel like if he was in that position, particularly if, as most of those concerned probably had to do, he had already done a good day's work.  They were not regular Army personnel and, perhaps, it was a mistake not to have regular Army personnel marching.  I would not be too anxious to condemn the appearance of the FCA because we are not doing much to help them.  The time is long past when we should have ensured that the FCA were provided with the best modern equipment and decent uniforms and that their training facilities were better than they are now.  I feel strongly about the situation of the FCA because I know that for the purpose of giving the impression that we have a pretty strong FCA force, summer camps are held and people who do not appear for training from one end of the year to the other come to these camps and have what they regard as a fortnight's holiday.  You also have the dedicated FCA man who attends for every night's training all the year round and considers himself an adjunct of the Army and, in fact, a soldier even though working as a civilian and he is treated exactly the same as the fellow who just arrives for the fortnight's training and then disappears.</P>
    <P>I would screen out those who are <Col N="732" /> not prepared to pull their weight and insist that only those interested in being members of the FCA be considered for training or equipment or uniform and I would pay those who remain much better than they are being paid at present.  There is a complete waste of money in regard to the FCA at present and it is a bad joke to allow people who call themselves members of the FCA but only turn up once a year for training to have the same treatment as those who are real members of the force.  They are paid by the State, not very much, I admit, and are also paid from their jobs because they are training.  These people could not be relied on in an emergency.  I appeal to the Minister to have something done about this and improve the position of those who are genuinely interested and get rid of those who are not interested and are very little use and would certinly be useless if the question of defence ever arose.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that six new married quarters have been completed in Limerick.  I assume if other married quarters were created we would hear about it.  does the Minister not agree that this is a puny effort when he says that out of a £14 million Estimate six new married quarters have been provided? So far as I know, local authorities generally have been very decent&mdash;I do not suggest they should be otherwise&mdash;about providing houses for soldiers in Dublin and throughout the country.  The Army must face the problem themselves and provide more married quarters for their own personnel. I understand there is still a great deal of overholding and this problem should be resolved.  It is a big question.  Surely the Department of Defence could deal with the local authority in the area concerned and ensure that when a man in married quarters is leaving the Army he will be given accommodation for himself and his family.  There was a period when a soldier leaving the Army got preference for a job: there are not many of them and is it too much to ask that they should now be given preference for a house?  Since this would mean that a house would be available for another soldier I think it would commend itself to everybody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" />&ldquo;Improvement of barrack accommodation generally is given a high priority and in recent years considerable progress has been made.&rdquo; I think this has been said every year and I do not accept that it is the true position. Some slight improvement has been made in barrack accommodation but I think anybody who has gone to the trouble of going through even the most modern barracks will agree that they are still the most uncomfortable quarters to be found in the country.  The particular bee I have in my bonnet is Gormanston Camp which was erected before the first world war.  This consists of a number of wooden huts and the Minister says that comfortable accommodation is being made available for soldiers.  When the refugees were there I know a certain amount of repair work was done and that wooden partitions were erected across floors to give the impression to people there that they were in some sort of room rather than in a hut.  I wonder will the partitions be taken down when the refugees leave or will the soldiers be allowed the luxury of having a hut divided into two or three parts?</P>
    <P>A man who joins the Army, whether for nine or 21 years, should be entitled to decent living accommodation and some effort should be made to modernise this accommodation.  A minor point is the question of wash houses, as they were called, and WCs located several hundred yards away from the sleeping accommodation. This has not been changed.  It was not even possible to do it for the refugees. With an Estimate of £14 million, it should be possible to put a little of it on one side to try to modernise the accommodation for these people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the position as regards the issue of combat dress to troops.  They used to call it a ground sheet long ago.  The multi-purpose uniform we were issued with was used as a mattress, on occasions. I should like to see one of these multi-purpose uniforms which are supposed to be suitable for places like Cyprus and places like Ireland.  If we set out to supply troops in Ireland with a battledress that would suit them in Irish conditions I think we would be <Col N="734" /> going in the right direction.  I am afraid there might be a certain amount of EEC thinking at the back of this multi-purpose uniform mentioned by the Minister.  However, I may be wrong, as I have not had an opportunity of looking at this battledress.  We are told it has been adopted by practically all modern armies.  Have we made any attempt to modernise what is worn other than the parade dress or this multi-purpose battledress?  What comes in between?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still some of it in the stores.  They are being issued as battledress to the unfortunates in the present modern Army to which the Minister is referring.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to Civil Defence.  At local level, it should have been given more opportunity to participate in the recent relief of refugees from the north.  The Civil Defence people in Meath feel they were not well treated in connection with that incident.  Somebody was drafted down from Dublin.  We know the Dublin people know everything and how to do everything and, therefore, when something like this comes along, they take over.  If there had been a few bullets about, we are not so sure that the rush down there would have been so great.</P>
      <P>How many civilians are employed in the running of the Defence Forces? This is one case where possibly the members of the Defence Forces could fill in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A proportion of 1,500 to 9,000.  My final point concerns the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen. A number of people mentioned Army participation in civilian life.  We feel they could take a much bigger part.  ONE covers all ex-servicemen and women since the initiation of the State.  They are making a big effort to assist discharged soldiers who need assistance and they try to keep them together socially.  In my opinion, they are not getting the co-operation from the State to which they are entitled. <Col N="735" /> They are the one really non-political organisation in this country&mdash;not that I have anything against politicians or politics.  The fact that Deputy Dowling and myself, and this type of person are in the same organisation, working together on the same committee, is proof enough that there is nothing political about it.  Would it be possible for the State to put soldiers about to be discharged in contact with the secretary of ONE?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, would it not be possible to give a small State subvention to the organisation to give it a proper footing in this State?  They do a lot of work.  I believe they do it all on voluntary subscriptions, money which it is pretty difficult to get.  An organisation such as that, dependent on getting money from people most of whom have not enough for themselves, has not much chance of getting off the ground.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider a subvention to ONE.  Like many organisations, they are doing an excellent job and are entitled to more encouragement than they are getting.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the members of the Defence Forces who have distinguished themselves in the peace-keeping operations in the Congo and in Cyprus.  We should go much further than the two previous speakers, who have not had experience of peace-keeping operations.  A reassessment of the Army in relation to its retention and its future use is long overdue.  A reassessment of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Services should be undertaken in order to establish, once and for all, the role of the armed services.</P>
      <P>There are many personnel serving in the Defence Forces who are unfit for active military service.  This situation should be examined to find out how it has developed and how it can be corrected.  A soldier should at all times be efficient to participate fully in any action he might be called upon to engage in.  Such is not the case at present.  We should aim to eliminate this situation by a reassessment of the position in relation to the soldier and to the officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> I am aware that extensions are necessary at the moment for a variety of reasons, some of them mentioned by Deputy Tully and Deputy Clinton.  In some cases personnel look for and are granted extensions purely because they are not equipped to enter civilian life. This is a matter that must get prime consideration.  We must ensure that in the future extensions are not granted which will delay promotions.  Promotions and promotion opportunities are an effective factor in having a contented service.  It is quite true that some extensions will have to be given to those who did not get some type of training prior to their discharge into civilian life.  We should have a new look at the service in relation to its efficiency to do the job it may be called upon to do in the future.  The needs and requirements of present-day armies are well known.  With all the information we have about peacetime soldiering and emergency conditions, about the Congo and Cyprus, and even civil war conditions, we can build a sound and effective defence force and project an excellent image.  We must project a better image in the future. The image which is presented at the moment is a result of the confused situation and the piecemeal development over a period because of non-attention to having discharged personnel equipped to meet the future.</P>
    <P>We must also have a reassessment of the military installations and military barracks, and we must dispose of those that are surplus or redundant for one reason or another.  In many of the barracks one of the problems is heating. This is a cause of discontent. There are turf fires which heat only a small portion of the rooms and, at this stage, we must have properly heated and properly constructed barrack rooms with cubicles where possible. This reassessment of the barracks is long overdue.  It has been mentioned on numerous Estimates that we should examine this situation and dispose of what we do not require.  There are many that come to my mind that could be disposed of.</P>
    <P>I want to make an appeal now on behalf of a section that is very often forgotten, that is, the wives of the <Col N="737" /> soldiers who are living in married quarters. I will take the married quarters in the Curragh as being the centre on which the Army revolves.  The wives of many serving soldiers are living in the married quarters there.  There are some good married quarters around O'Higgins Road and, at the other end, around McDonagh, there are the old married quarters.  The wives of the soldiers now have to endure long months of separation due to service abroad and in the outposts on the Border and elsewhere.  They are living in conditions which should be and must be brought up to date.</P>
    <P>The erection of more married quarters is necessary and desirable.  We are handling the situation in the wrong way.  It is not very impressive to read that six houses have been built as married quarters in Limerick.  That is not enough.  We have a responsibility to house the soldiers, just as the local authorities have a responsibility to house personnel in their areas.  The necessary money to build accommodation and to bring existing accommodation up to reasonable standards should come from the Capital Budget and not from the Defence Forces Estimate.  If we accepted that we were housing families, whether they be serving personnel or civilians, and that the money should come from that pool rather than from the Defence Force Estimate, the necessary money could be made available for the provision of married quarters.  There must be new thinking on the question of married quarters.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Army corps of engineers, of which I was a member, have constructed the married quarters in Limerick and barracks in Clonmel and various other places.  They have done excellent jobs in the past.  I am glad to see that the personnel in the Army corps of engineers are being utilised and I trust that the Minister will see that their energies and skills will be utilised to the benefit of the Army in the future.  I would ask the Minister to consider an allocation from the Capital Budget for the housing of Army personnel whether they be soldiers or civilians.  I hope he will have an early look at the situation in the Curragh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <P>What about Portobello?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Portobello in a few minutes.  I slept in the married quarters in the Curragh during the emergency period and I know exactly the type of accommodation that is provided.  I slept both in the new married quarters and the married quarters in McDonagh Barracks.  I never occupied the married quarters in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  The wives of serving soldiers who have to endure long separations should at least have the comforts that are provided by the local authorities.  They are far below that standard and something must be done about it.</P>
      <P>It is time that the married quarters in Cathal Brugha Barracks were demolished.  I can see no reason why people should have to live in captivity, so to speak, in a barracks.  A soldier and his family should be outside the walls of a barracks.  The day when it was necessary to have families maintained behind barrack walls has gone. Married quarters should be built away from Cathal Brugha Barracks and then the integration which has been spoken about can be fully effective.  Some portion of an allocation from the Capital Budget should be devoted to the housing of serving personnel who are deserving of the consideration mentioned by Deputy Tully and Deputy Clinton.  I would ask the Minister again to ensure that the Curragh, which is the pivot upon which the Army revolves to a large degree, will get every consideration to ensure that the quarters there are brought up to a high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the soldier himself, the gratuity which has been mentioned must come at some stage.  We should also have a look at the predischarge leave and see can we develop a more effective type of contribution for the retiring soldier.  It has very many defects as we all know.  A man who retires from the Army cannot take employment in the Government service and avail of predischarge leave.  On the other hand he can take up employment in other commercial concerns in the city or country and retain his predischarge leave.  When predischarge leave <Col N="739" /> was first introduced we were told it was a question of equipping a man for civilian life, of the resettlement of personnel. If that is so, I can see no reason why a person should be debarred from employment in the Government service because he has retired from the Army.</P>
    <P>There are other defects in the predischarge leave.  Perhaps a more suitable term than &ldquo;predischarge&rdquo; leave would enable a person to resettle himself and his family during this period. If a job for which a person is suitable becomes available in the Government service, he cannot accept it if he is living in married quarters.  The number of jobs becoming available in Government service, in the Corps of Engineers, the Board of Works or other such services are very few and it is wrong that if a job for which the man is suitable becomes available he should be unable to accept it because he cannot procure outside accommodation at a given moment.</P>
    <P>There is a way around this predischarge leave question.  Could a person not opt to return to service during this period?  There is no reason why such personnel could not have the same opportunity within 30 days or 90 days of their discharge from service.  The Minister should have another look at this question of predischarge leave.</P>
    <P>I am also in favour of a uniform allowance and good conduct pay.  If a person gets a uniform allowance he will keep his clothes in the best possible condition in order to obtain the allowance. On the other hand, if he knows he will be issued with equipment at particular periods he will not be so concerned about the state of the equipment. Again, it makes little difference whether a soldier's conduct is good or bad.  An allowance for good conduct would be an incentive for a person to be a better soldier and would ensure that his conduct was of the highest possible order.</P>
    <P>The soldier is faced with quite a number of problems prior to his discharge and immediately afterwards, and more consideration should be given to predischarge training.  The AnCO centres in Waterford, Limerick and Galway are making an important contribution and the new one in Ballyfermot <Col N="740" /> will play an important part in due course.  The limitation of skills among Army personnel has come about because of the type of employment to which they were assigned during their Army service.  Many people have been retired from the Army and have ended up as petrol pump attendants. This disgraceful situation should be rectified.  There should be an advisory service so that in, say, the last ten years of their service in the Defence Forces, personnel would gradually be equipped to take their place in civilian life.  They should receive advice in relation to their future requirements by way of housing accommodation, the availability of grants and other services that would be at their disposal.  In this way the people now retiring would have a home and greater opportunities than the people who went before them. The AnCO centres must be further developed.  There should be some allocation of space in each of these centres for Army personnel who have given so much to the country over the years.  The Minister is aware of the situation and I hope he will take the necessary steps to ensure that career guidance and the necessary training will be made available.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to officers who believe that officer assessment at an early stage is both necessary and desirable.  If this were done they would know what their prospects were.  If an officer felt that promotional opportunities would not be available to him, then he could make arrangements to readjust himself to civilian life at an age when it would be possible for him to do so.  At the moment there is not this kind of assessment.  Superior officers in the Army know that certain people are not suitable for high office.  They are diverted into dead-end jobs when they have ability that could be utilised more effectively in civilian life.  They should have the alternative of accepting what might be called a dead-end job or of leaving the Army at an early age when they would be capable of readjusting to civilian life.  This matter should get consideration in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I consider the present recruiting campaign an appalling mistake.  There <Col N="741" /> was no imagination displayed; it came at a period prior to Christmas, when it is extremely difficult to entice anyone away from home, and after that it was discontinued.  The campaign should spell out clearly what life in the Army has to offer.  The question of nationalistic outlook is not referred to in the advertisements; it might attract people who have this outlook.  Instead, we have only the cold fact that a recruit gets so much money per week.  If the campaign were presented in a more attractive form and if the opportunities available were fully explained, I am sure we would have a greater response.</P>
    <P>If we let the young people of the country know the opportunities in the Army for vocational training, university study and so on, we will attract a very desirable type of person.  As Deputy Tully has mentioned, the Army is now merely regarded as a fatigue unit.  Deputy Clinton has said that soldiers should be put to cleaning the canals, digging ditches, clearing derelict sites and so on.  This is the easiest way to kill a recruiting campaign and to dishearten those who might otherwise hope to make a career in the Army.  It is not the work of a soldier to do this kind of work and we can certainly find more worthwhile work for him to do.</P>
    <P>I visited the apprenticeship school at Naas recently and I should like to congratulate the people who are working there in very difficult conditions. The personnel are doing a magnificent job and the conditions are utterly appalling.  Because of some silly notion of a local manager they are unable to construct new accommodation and I can certainly say that I should not like to send my children to live in the accommodation at present available. The training facilities, the instructors and the opportunities are excellent but many of the people at the apprenticeship school are living in huts that were obsolete even in the emergency period. We must be realistic and ensure that red tape is not allowed to impede the provision of facilities and accommodation. We cannot stand for this kind of nonsense from local authorities in regard to accommodation.  I know Deputy Tom Nolan has been examining this problem for the last few <Col N="742" /> months and I think he has all the information available.  Where we have an apprenticeship school dealing with young men, offering the facilities that are available, we should have the necessary accommodation.  Some of the accommodation is good but there are also the obsolete huts at Naas.  This situation needs to be remedied.  Money was made available for this development and there is no reason why red tape should impede the development of facilities and accommodation.</P>
    <P>Many of the machines I have seen there need replacing and I would ask the Minister to ensure that this is carried out immediately.  We cannot effectively train young people with machinery that is defective and out-of-date. When we have a service such as this apprenticeship school, which is doing wonderful work, it should have the best available machinery.  The young people should have the best possible tools and equipment.  They should be able to operate under conditions which will bring out the best in them. I know the difficulty of working with defective machines.  I know the effect that can have on an apprentice.  I understand they are seeking new lathes. If I were in charge I would seek far more than they are seeking.  I know there is a problem with regard to finance.  Piecemeal provision, a bit this year and a bit next year, is very undesirable.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at this very effective unit. Those in charge are doing a wonderful job.  The instructors are of the highest calibre.  New machinery and better accommodation must be provided to ensure that the apprentices get the best possible training during their limited period in Naas.  A continuation of training in the AnCO centres or with some of the semi-State bodies when they come out of Naas would give them a new approach.  Any limitation results in a limited outlook.  Continuation of training would enable the apprentices to learn new techniques and equip them to meet the requirements of the labour market when they leave the service.  They must have some knowledge of what lies ahead, what they must achieve and what further training is necessary.  They can utilise <Col N="743" /> the various facilities in the vocational schools and under the schemes outlined by the Minister.  I would urge the Minister to expand this development to other centres.  At the moment there is just the one school in Naas.  I doubt if it is enough.  A similar school in the south would be very useful.  It could well induce more young people into apprenticeship schools.</P>
    <P>The naval service is an important service, but it is one that is often forgotten. It is the only service in which the men are on active duty the whole time in contradistinction to the Air Corps or the Army.  I am glad that new ships will be purchased.</P>

Those in the naval service operate under conditions which bring out the best in them and they have measured up admirably. I have been on board one of the naval&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to those who have done such an excellent job <Col N="744" /> with the material available and under such difficult conditions.  I hope the Minister will expedite the purchase of ships to ensure that young men who want to join the naval service can do so in the knowledge that their conditions will compare favourably with conditions elsewhere.  No words of mine could do justice to those manning our naval service.</P>
    <P>The food issued to the Army was mentioned.  I have visited some of the cookhouses recently and the quality of the food and the standard of the cooking are much higher now than they were years ago.  Flexibility is permitted. Exchange deals can be operated. That is very desirable because those operating the service are in the best position to know the kind of food that is most acceptable.  The food is no longer taken from a list as it was in the past.  The Army personnel must have variety in their food.  The day has come when an exchange deal can be made at no extra cost to the service.</P>
    <P>This exchange situation is one that should be developed.  I am told that in many cases items of equipment which they do not want are issued to personnel. Items of equipment which are necessary cannot be obtained.  If it is indicated that someone wishes to obtain one item in lieu of another, he is told that the unwanted item will be taken away but no other item is issued to him.  There should be more flexibility in relation to the issue of equipment.  I am told that the attitude of the people in charge of the service is inflexible.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Tully I wish to speak about the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen.  This is an effective organisation which assists many ex-servicemen. This organisation should get a contribution from the State.  In relation to the resettling of personnel I have said that once they are outside the barrack gate they are forgotten. The ONE have done great work in the past to assist such men.  Those within the service soon forget the ex-servicemen. I had personal experience of this. I received less consideration than others who were on a par with me in other armies got.  The ONE should get some contribution from the State to ensure the continuation of their valuable work.  Effective training <Col N="745" /> should be given to people leaving the Army to prepare them for work outside. We should have advisory and guidance services to ensure that ex-Army personnel are channelled into employment.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine the question of the reserve training grant which is out of date and which needs to be increased.  Unless something is done the reserve will diminish. The comments of some district justices who indicate that a person who has committed a crime should seek admittance to the Army are deplorable.  The Minister has pointed out that this is not the type of person needed in the Army.  The Army want the best personnel. We must develop an image of the Army to ensure that people will be attracted to it.  People of the type commented on by the district justices are not accepted in the Army.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully pointed out that we seldom see a soldier in uniform in Dublin.  This may be because the type of equipment the soldier carries is not suitable.  He may feel he would be doing an injustice to the service if he paraded through the city with it.  There may be some other reasons.  Dancehalls in the city and elsewhere often refuse to admit personnel in uniform.  Something must be done about this.  Young men who have given their service voluntarily are entitled to every consideration. Some promoters of football matches and some cinema managements allow personnel in uniform on their premises at reduced prices.  The Minister should ensure that better facilities are provided in order that recruits may be attracted to the service. Much money has been spent on a recruiting campaign.  We should have a more realistic recruiting campaign.  The question of careers is a vital one.  The Army should have the necessary facilities for career guidance.  The Minister might consider the new FCA officers and the possibility of young men joining the FCA to obtain a place on the Army jumping team.  Many of these young men are skilled horsemen.  They have not had the recognition they deserve.</P>

      <P>I understand that the introduction of the new time-off arrangements for district medical officers, to which I have already given general approval to health authorities, is to be considered by the Donegal County Council in respect of district medical officers in its area at a meeting next week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the overcrowding position in Our Lady's Hospital, Cork. The general problem of overcrowding and the use of existing beds is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the health authority.  I understand that a special committee of the authority is at present dealing with the matter and its report is being awaited.</P>
      <P>A number of steps have been taken in recent years to improve the position in Cork.  A new admission and active treatment unit was provided in 1962. Two additional posts of medical superintendent were established in 1966 and in 1967 new psychiatric units were opened at Skibbereen and at Sarsfieldscourt. St. Brigid's unit was reconstructed in 1968.  A number of improvements to St. Patrick's and St. Ita's have already been carried out and others are in hand and a major scheme of improvements for St. Kevin's unit is at the final planning stage.  The post of professor of psychiatry has been created and was recently advertised.</P>
      <P>The steps enumerated are designed not only to improve amenities in the hospital, but to permit the provision of more active treatment, so that the numbers requiring long-term care will be considerably reduced.</P>

      <P>As information concerning the occupancy of the three hospitals is not available in the form requested, I have given the actual number of beds occupied on the 30th September in each of the three years 1960, 1965 and 1969.  It is proposed in the immediate future to use part of James Connolly Memorial Hospital as a general hospital which will initially have 120 beds and to use the balance of the hospital for the accommodation of tuberculosis and geriatric patients.  It is intended that, at a later stage, the general hospital will be developed further to meet the needs of an expanding population.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the services provided at Merlin Park Hospital will be integrated with those at the Regional General Hospital in Galway to form a major hospital complex providing specialist services for the western region and general medical and surgical services for an appropriate catchment area.  It is proposed that St. Stephen's Hospital, Sarsfieldscourt, will be used mainly for the treatment of psychiatric patients.</P>

This does not mean, however, that homes in which satisfactory standards of accommodation and facilities for the proper care of patients have been provided in recent years need to be abandoned.

Planning with this end in view has already commenced and it is expected that work on ten such homes will be commenced this year.

      <P>Since health authorities are under an obligation to provide shelter and maintenance for those who are unable to provide it for themselves out of their own resources, it may occur from time to time that married couples and their children avail themselves temporarily of accommodation in county homes.

The report of the recent inter-departmental committee states that on 31st March, 1950, the number of persons in county homes over age 65 was 4,766. On 31st December, 1960, the number accommodated was 7,430.  The most recent available figures are in respect of 31st March, 1969, when the number of aged county home patients was 8,104.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29, 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The organisation recently set up to investigate all aspects of our water resources including water pollution, take the form of a new division within An Foras Forbartha.  As I informed the Dáil when introducing my Department's Estimates, this division is now operative and will, in due course, be concerned to identify areas where serious water pollution is occurring, or where there is a danger that it might occur to any significant extent. The division is at present engaged in examining the information already available from a number of sources in regard to the problem.  The results of these investigations will enable a decision to be taken as to the lines on which further researches should proceed. It can be assumed that such researches will include on-the-ground surveys of suspect locations, including such locations in the Dublin area.  It will then be possible for the appropriate authorities to initiate necessary remedial measures.  The new division will not concern itself with air pollution.</P>
      <P>My functions in relation to water and air pollution stem from my responsibility in regard to environmental planning and from my overall responsibility for the sanitary services programmes of local authorities.  The statutory powers of control available are contained in the Alkali etc.  Works Regulation Act, 1906; the Rivers Pollution Prevention Acts, 1876 and 1893; the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1964 and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is nearly as bad as Deputy FitzGerald in interpreting figures.  The fact is that all expenditure on social welfare is by the State and all the money to finance it is compulsorily collected by the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of it is collected by way of selective taxation on employers and workers and some from the general taxpayer.  The percentage of the national income that the Government acquire and distribute in the form of social welfare and other benefits has increased from 6.4 of the national income to 8.4.  This is despite the fact that the figure was inflated in 1956-57, despite the lower level of unemployment now and the correspondingly higher level of the national income. This is all due to Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it does. For a number of years the approved strength of the Garda Síochána has been more or less static at 6,560.  The Deputy will appreciate that we have progressed a lot from the horse and buggy days in the matter of communications, cars and so on.  Having regard to the re-arrangement of the force now proceeding, the present strength, combined with the new equipment, should be quite sufficient to deal with our problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far from accepting that the Government <Col N="775" /> have been in any way slow in dealing with the recommendations of the Conroy Report, I feel strongly that the exceptional speed with which a number of the main recommendations have been approved leaves no grounds whatsoever for complaint.</P>
    <P>As announced already, the Government have approved acceptance of the following main recommendations&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Salary increases with effect from 1st June, 1969 of £2 a week, with a further £1 a week after 15 years service, for gardaí, and £4 a week for sergeants, the cost of which in the financial year ending at the end of this month is £620,000 and in a full year, £800,000 which, with pensionability of 25 per cent, comes to £1,000,000 a year;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Rent allowances of £2 and £1 a week to married and single members, respectively, who are not living in official accommodation, the cost of which is £570,000 a year;</P>
    <P>(iii)  Night duty allowances of an additional one-seventh of basic pay for night work, the cost of which is roughly £200,000 a year.</P>
    <P>A married garda with 15 years service who is on night duty is gaining a total of £8 15s 4d per week from the items already approved by the Government, that is pay increase, £3; new rent allowance, £2; night duty allowance, £3 15s 4d; and his new pay and emoluments come to £32 2s 8d a week. A sergeant in similar circumstances gains £10 5s 3d a week, and his new pay and emoluments come to £36 1s 9d a week after three years service in the rank.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of a reduction in hours the Conroy Commission specifically recognised that difficulty would be experienced in putting into immediate effect some of the recommendations. They said&mdash;and I quote from paragraph 1258:</P>
    <P>Some of our recommendations can be implemented immediately; others by their nature will take some time.</P>
    <P>Before the question of radically reducing the working hours from 48 to 42 can be brought about, there must, to my mind, first be an examination <Col N="776" /> of the structure of the force, of various duties that can be cut down or cut out, the better utilisation of manpower by the closing and reducing of stations with increased mobility and the use of modern equipment and radio units. In fact, this examination is already being carried out by a Garda research and planning unit which has been set up by the commissioner.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the consultative council were informed at a meeting held on last Monday, 16th March, that the Minister for Finance and myself were agreed, in principle, to the reduction from 48 to 42 hours but having regard to the complexities of the problem involved we felt that the reduction should be phased as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  A reduction from 48 hours to 46 hours as from 1st April, 1970;</P>
    <P>(b)  A reduction from 46 hours to 44 hours as from 1st October, 1970; and</P>
    <P>(c)  A reduction from 44 hours to 42 hours with effect from 1st April, 1971.</P>
    <P>Further, the consultative council has been told that if the activities of the research and planning unit make it acceptable to the commissioner to introduce the phased reduction in hours at dates earlier than those indicated, there will be no objection on my part to his proceeding accordingly.</P>
    <P>That is the present position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister has answered many questions he has not been asked but I would ask him if any arrangements have been made to consider the questions of overtime and night duty allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have listened to my reply.  I have said that propositions for the granting of overtime, which have been accepted in principle by me, have been made to the Representative Body who operate as a trade union on behalf of the Garda.  These propositions are under consideration by them at the moment and it is a question of putting them into effect.  If the commissioner can work things out so that it is possible <Col N="777" /> to implement the recommendations at a date earlier than that suggested I shall be quite agreeable to that.  I do not think anything could be fairer than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are doing an excellent job.  I realise the Minister has met a large number of the recommendations in the Conroy Report but the Garda Representative Body issued a statement on the 12th instant that if the recommendation in regard to a basic working week, with compensation for overtime, is not met they will hold a ballot to decide what further action they will take.  I cannot say what that may lead to but it would be wise to try to head off this situation, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultative council has been in session and these matters have been discussed.  This effort has been made to implement the overtime recommendation as soon as that can be done.  The principle of overtime has been accepted by the Government. I do not want to dwell on this but, in addition to the figures I have already given, this will cost under £1 million a year.  I mention that to show what is involved.  I think those who have been handling the situation so competently should be left to do the job.  I believe they will work this out quite satisfactorily.  They are meeting again next Friday to discuss the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Government's propositions has any specific date been set for the implementation of the recommendations with regard to overtime and allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>May I repeat for the Deputy what I said in my reply to the original question?  I want to put on the record that this proposition has actually been put to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Containing a date for implementation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  They have been told the Government have accepted in principle the proposition of <Col N="778" /> overtime.  They have been told that from the practical point of view and on the best advice available we feel it will take some time to phase the job. It is a big job.  One cannot move 6,000 men around like pawns on a chessboard. If the commissioner can come up with an earlier date I shall not say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I do not see how I can be more reasonable than that on this issue.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this was a suggestion made at the end of the Conroy Report.  It was not a specific recommendation. The Conroy Commission also recommended the setting up of a planning and development unit.  This is in process of being set up and what the Deputy has in mind would be best handled by this unit, whose job it will be to examine all the matters mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

I saw a specimen of the cheque and it sets out in the minutest details what the deductions are for.</P>

I have an open mind and I will wait to see whether, as a result of the Deputy's question, objections in writing may be received.  If there are no objections I shall treat the application as I treat every application. The objection appears to be to something he wrote in one of his books.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the question relates to second-hand lorries in a completely knocked down condition.  Such vehicles may be imported for subsequent re-assembly without the necessity of obtaining an authorisation from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and also at a rate of customs duty lower than applies to a complete vehicle.  Because of this, and to avoid the possibility of irregular use of the customs clearance, it has been decided that the customs clearance certificate should not be issued until the vehicle is re-assembled.  In any event, the certificate is not required by the owner until the vehicle is assembled and ready to be registered as a road vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will clarify the position of those assessed for income tax under PAYE following the introduction of the decimal system in 1970-71: and whether tax free allowances <Col N="783" /> will be reduced in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the decimal system will not affect the tax position of those within the scope of PAYE other than that the tax deductions will be made in pounds and new pence instead of in pounds, shillings and pence as at present.  The current rate of income tax is 7s in the £ which would represent 35 new pence in the £ under the decimal system.</P>
      <P>Tax is at present deducted under PAYE at the rate of 5s 3d in the £. This, of course, is not a statutory rate but is adopted so as to provide for the granting of earned income relief (of one-fourth) in respect of the taxable income.</P>
      <P>The exact equivalent of 5s 3d in decimal currency would be 26¼ new pence and, as Deputies are aware, the lowest denomination coin will be one new half-penny.  However, the rate is used for calculation purposes only and ready reckoners, expressed in decimal currency, have been prepared for use by employers in deducting tax.  Tax will be deducted in sums of pounds and new pence.  Calculation of the cumulative tax to date will be to the nearest five new pence below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax-free allowances will not be <Col N="784" /> reduced on the introduction of the decimal system.  At present, the weekly tax-free allowances are shown to the nearest 1s above in the case of computer-produced PAYE documents and to the nearest 5s above in respect of manually produced documents.  Both of these amounts convert exactly into decimal currency, that is, to the nearest five pence and 25 new pence respectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will make a statement concerning the recent regulations made by him under the Land Act, 1965 permitting non-nationals to purchase land within the boundaries of 58 towns; and if, in particular, he will state the reasons for such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, initiated a system of absolute control by the Land Commission over the purchase of rural land by non-qualified persons&mdash;principally non-nationals.  It was never intended that this control should apply to urban land and, in fact, right from the outset, lands situated in a county borough, borough, urban district or town were specifically exempted by sub-section (1) section 45.</P>
      <P>At the time of the passing of the Act the exemption of towns had to be confined to municipal towns because the boundaries of non-municipal towns had not then been defined.  To avoid confusion amongst conveyancers it was necessary to have a clear idea of what was meant by &ldquo;town&rdquo; and to be able to say that a particular piece of land was urban or rural by reference to a map.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the expressed intention, when the Land Bill was under discussion, was that, as and when non-municipal towns achieved full status or were precisely delimited, the propriety of their exclusion from the operation of the section would be considered. As matters stood, Land Commission consent was necessary in relation to the sale of shops, public houses, dancehalls and the like in towns such as Roscrea, Clondalkin, Kildare, Ballybunion, Carrick-on-Shannon, and many <Col N="796" /> others.  These transactions are of no significance in the context of the control system for rural land established by the Act.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of these non-municipal towns have now been defined by their respective planning authorities and the recent regulations were made by me simply to equate, in terms of exemption, the 58 non-municipal towns with the municipal towns.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was always intended that they should be excluded and in fact during the debate my predecessor gave an undertaking that when the limits of the towns were defined by the respective planning authorities they would be excluded from the operation of the section.  This is of no significance so far as the protection of rural land is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will consider having a public telephone kiosk provided at Rooska, <Col N="809" /> Bantry, County Cork, to facilitate residents of the area.</P>

      <P>Provision of kiosks in areas such as Rooska where there is no post office is not envisaged under the extended kiosk programme for rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rooska is on the shores of Bantry Bay and is very isolated.  The farmers and others in the area have great difficulty in getting in touch quickly with their doctor or priest or veterinary surgeon or anybody whom they wish to contact in a hurry.  Would the Minister look into the matter again, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the easiest thing in the world to agree to look into something again.  In fairness, I must say I could not offer any great prospect of the provision of a kiosk there, while I might very easily agree to look into the matter.  The same problem exists in many places.  With many other more needy areas to be catered for, the expected usage of a kiosk at Rooska would not at present justify its provision there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will sanction the erection of a telephone kiosk at Meelin village, Newmarket, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The extended kiosk programme for rural areas provides for replacement of call office telephones in local post offices by street kiosks in areas where the call office telephone is used to a fair extent.  Meelin village is not likely to be included in the programme as the call office telephone is little used.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of considering amendments.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 10 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will remember that on the Committee Stage I promised to consider a suggestion put forward by some Deputies, including Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Pattison, that we should go a little bit farther than the present Bill and permit the operation of slot machines which deliver prizes out of the front direct to the winning operator.  I asked for time to have this matter considered and, in particular, to consult the Garda Síochána.  This has since been done.</P>
      <P>By providing for the deletion of section 10 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, the amendment seeks, in effect, to remove the absolute prohibition at present imposed on the operation of slot machines which, when successfully operated, deliver money prizes out of the front or at the back. I said on the last occasion, and I repeat now, that the more I look into it the more I am satisfied that the cleanest legal job to do here to meet the wishes of the House would be to repeal section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> Other suggestions were made as to different forms of amendment to the section to achieve the same effect. Having given the matter further consideration. I am reinforced in my original view that the most effective and best way of dealing with this matter is the complete repeal of section 10.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the amendment would not mean that anybody would be free to install these machines in his premises for operation by members of the public.  The use of the machines would continue to be subject to the general restrictions on gaming continued in the 1956 Act.  The effect of these restrictions is that, subject to certain exceptions, gaming may be carried out in an area only where the local authority formally have passed a resolution adopting the relevant provisions of the 1956 Act and then only in amusement halls and funfairs licensed for the purpose on the authority of the district court.  The exceptions to that rule are circuses, travelling shows and carnivals and other like events but, in these circumstances, gaming is permitted only for limited periods&mdash; not more than ten days at a time in any one place in the case of circuses and travelling shows and not more than a month in the case of carnivals, and so forth.  Promoters of carnivals must derive no personal gain from these operations.  In all cases, certain conditions must be observed, the main ones being that the maximum stake is sixpence, the maximum prize money 10s and that no person under 16 years of age shall be allowed to play.</P>
    <P>If the amendments I have tabled&mdash; the one I have moved and the consequential amendments&mdash;are acceptable to the House it will mean that the complaints voiced here will disappear, that is, the machines can pay out direct subject to the limits as to the stakes and the prize money which are already in the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order No. 96 (3), I have to report specially to the Dáil that the Committee have amended the Title of the Bill to read as follows: &ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to repeal section 10 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Bill reported with amendments and received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Having accepted these amendments, it is my duty to do some thinking aloud for the benefit of some of those concerned with this business in this city.  I have received some complaints about some premises that are allowed to be used or are alleged to be allowed to be used for undesirable purposes and that, in some instances, people under age are allowed to take part in gaming in some of these premises.  If there is any substance in these complaints, they will be fully investigated by me and my Department and the law will be enforced rigidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may express a personal view, as I have done already in this House, in principle I think these amusement halls are very desirable in seaside places, but I have certain reservations about their being allowed in the centre <Col N="813" /> of a city like this.  In fact, I think the authors of the 1956 Act had that in mind when it was passed and did not contemplate that in relation to some of those areas, the Act would be adopted by the local authority.</P>
    <P>At all events, since they are there, I want to give fair notice that if those who enjoy licences under the law as it stands do not do their duty and rigidly enforce proper control of these premises, they can expect opposition from the Garda to the renewal of their licences and, indeed, they can expect prosecution for there will be full enforcement of the law as laid down by the Oireachtas in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the Probation Act?  The reason I ask that is&mdash;I agree with the Minister that it is very wrong for a person under age to be there&mdash;that there are occasions when it is very hard to know a person's age.  Under the licensing law on the first occasion you get the benefit of the Probation Act and the second time the licence is withdrawn.  A youth could come in and you could take him to be 26 years when, in fact, he was 15 years, and you could take a person of 15 years to be 12 years.  It is very hard to know what age they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some difficulties as the Deputy says but I mentioned undesirable people frequenting some of these places as well as people under age.  I am now giving due notice that they can expect the full rigours of the law if they do not appreciate the privileges under the licensing system under the law, and they can expect their licences to be strenuously opposed if there is any ground for complaints of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the Minister's statement and accepting the comments he has made in good faith, I suggest that it might be helpful to us if the Minister would be more explicit about what he means by &ldquo;undesirable purposes&rdquo;.  Is this a question of persons under age being in such premises?  Is it a question of <Col N="814" /> drug trafficking?  Is it a question of prostitution?  Could the Minister be more helpful about the allegations made that some premises in the major urban areas have been used for such purposes?  I do not want to badger the Minister unduly but it might be more helpful if he were more specific.</P>

I also understand since I came into the House that the Minister has stated it is his intention to see to it that the Act, as now amended, will be strictly enforced and abuses eliminated.  I am sure the House thoroughly agrees with that and I am sure, indeed, that all legitimate operators of these machines will also welcome that assurance from the Minister.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Defence).</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary role of a defence force is to defend the State against external aggression.  If this is the case our Defence Forces are <i>de facto</i> unable to present an adequate defence against any reasonable form of aggression which could possibly occur here.  We should also consider that the primary role of the Defence Forces is to protect the State against internal aggression.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us the size of our Defence Forces.  They are well below the required level for efficiency. If we look at the number of men in the Army and go through a few administrative percentages we see how totally inadequate the Minister's Department are at present.  We have a little over 7,000 men in the armed forces and, if this is broken down at the rate of eight men to one, which was the rate in the second world war in Europe &mdash;there were eight men in some form of supply or administrative service for every one man available at the front line&mdash;or if we bring it to the level in Vietnam where the rate is approaching 20 men behind the scenes for one man in combat, we find that we are very close to having between 700 and 1,000 men who could possibly be put into the front line to defend the State against external aggression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> What would happen if we were to have internal aggression here, if we were to have a guerilla force in this country?  We would then have to consider the proportion necessary to combat an aggressive guerilla force.  This gives us a ratio of 20 troops in the field to one in hiding.  It means that 100 or fewer guerillas or subversive armed civilians could completely engage our total armed forces.  This is a terrible situation which we have allowed the Army to get into.  The Army which started off in this State with Michael Collins as its Commander-in-Chief has gradually gone downhill under inadequate and irresponsible administration.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk of sending Army men out to do civilian courses.  How about sending some of the civilian administrators into the Army courses to get greater co-operation and understanding between the 1,000 odd civilians who administer the Minister's Department and the administrators of the Army?</P>
    <P>There are three sections in our armed forces under the Minister's control; the Army itself, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The Naval Service have three corvettes, one of which is functioning&mdash;the <i>Maeve</i>, which carries a crew of 60 men and five officers.  The <i>Maeve</i> has adequate sleeping accommodation for only 62, so three of those men have to sleep in hammocks.</P>
    <P>One ship is totally inadequate for the Naval Service.  At the present time the Ulster Volunteer Force have more control over Irish naval waters than have the Irish Naval Service.  We have 29 aircraft in the Army Air Corps and three functioning fighting aircraft, and yet we have nothing at all at sea.  At the height of the herring season our fishing trawlers are molested by foreign fishing trawlers; they lose their gear which is cut when a fishing trawler comes close to the stern.  No effort is made to protect these men.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough that craft from abroad can break our laws by coming inside the 12-mile fishing limit, but when they go further and damage the fishing equipment of some of our men, it is a terrible situation that we have no comeback or no deterrent to keep <Col N="817" /> these people out.  There have been something like two convictions in the past year against foreign trawlers coming in here.  One of our fishing vessels strayed a little inside the 12-mile limit of the Isle of Man and was caught immediately, lost everything and had to pay a handsome fine.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister said in answer to a question here a short time ago, the manpower of the Naval Service, other ranks, has dropped by between 12 and 15 per cent in the past 12 months, notwithstanding a rise of close on 300 men in the Defence Forces as a whole.  There has been an increase of 264 men in the Defence Forces over the past 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a net decrease in the Naval Service of about 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am working on percentages of other ranks.  The number of other ranks has decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Slightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Other ranks have decreased. If the force was at 173, or 180 as the Minister stated earlier on in the year, taking a drop of 20 to 25 in other ranks, that represents a 12 per cent decrease in the total number of other ranks in the Irish Naval Service. This is the source of my figures: the answer to my question of 12th November, 1969, and page 2 of the Minister's brief.  There is a decline in the naval personnel while there is an increase in the Army as a whole of 264 men.  Incidentally I want to compliment the Minister on his recruiting drive.  Any recruiting drive which increases the number of men in any armed force is successful and must be looked upon as being so.  Every army in Europe has experienced a certain amount of difficulty in recruiting people.  Perhaps it is not as successful as it appears.  However, we can learn from it.  We shall not know for another year the number of those who <Col N="818" /> were accepted and who will still be in the armed forces, but we can be hopeful that there will be a further expansion in the armed forces.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Naval Service there have been many plans over the past number of years to replace ailing ships, some of them already dead, with modern vessels.  £2 million is being made available to buy these ships and investigations are continuing.  All I can say after almost nine months in this House is that if investigations are to continue at the rate they are proceeding we shall have nothing for the next five to ten years.  If investigations are intensive at the moment they are certainly most unfruitful as regards giving out tenders.  Therefore we still have a long time to wait before there is a vessel on the sea.  We must look closer to home to get something to satisfy immediately the need for protection for our fishery vessels and waters.</P>
      <P>It is high time that the arts and crafts and educational facilities which are available to the Army were extended to the Naval Service and extended in the most practical way possible. There should be some form of co-ordination between the Naval Service and Bord Iascaigh Mhara whereby skippers of fishing trawlers and the fishing fleet would be educated and trained for the fishing industry, and so that many of them would be financially assisted to purchase a suitable fishing craft.  If the Minister works in coordination with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and sends his cadets, seamen and other ranks to the training schools, as is being done with the apprentices attending the school in Naas and as is being done with the cadets in Galway University, he will find the number of ratings in the Naval Service will go up and not into decline as they have been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a great deal more coastline here than we have air, but we have 29 aircraft in the Army Air Corps and not one boat at sea.  Something radical must be done to protect our coastline adequately if for no other reason than to prevent the influx of modern arms to subversive elements in the 32-Counties, which might result in an army of only 100 to 200 men being <Col N="819" /> too much for our armed forces to cope with.  This country has had many scares in the past.  In the not too recent past it has had scares about foreign elements coming in here to effect a <i>coup.</i> How serious these were I do not know, but I heard of them and they worried a lot of people.  In 1966, during the jubilee anniversary of 1916, I remember the people were afraid to walk the streets in the months before the celebrations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspected the Deputy had a vivid imagination and now he has confirmed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the fear that was caused in 1966 and it will not take much to endanger the stability of this country.  It would not be impossible for the Minister to investigate the possibility of purchasing high-powered trawlers, to arm them with two 4&rdquo; guns and to man them with members of the Irish Naval Service.  By working with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara these trawlers could be used later on but if they were available now to travel with our fishing fleets they would give them the necessary protection, and in certain cases, they could arrest intruders. They would be an adequate deterrent and would not be a waste of money and, at the same time, the seamen aboard, working in conjunction with the teachers in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, could learn about the fishing industry which could become very important to us if we enter the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the facilities available we reached the lowest ebb when we put the <i>Cú Feasa</i> to sea with one naval officer on board.  In Iceland five years ago trawlermen armed themselves to protect themsleves against aggressors. In the ever-increasing competition in these waters our fishermen are not being given the protection that they deserve.  If the Minister would consider a short service scheme I believe this would bring its rewards in an increase in the number of men who would be available for the naval services. When we get these naval protection vessels they could work in conjunction with the Army Air Corps. <Col N="820" /> We have 29 aircraft and they can control the coast reasonably well during good weather.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the question of accommodation which is available for these men, the Minister confirmed in answer to the question I put to him that there was inadequate accommodation on the <i>Maeve</i> and that men had to sleep in hammocks.  Of the crew of 65, which includes officers, 62 were sleeping in bunks and three in hammocks.  We know about all the other problems of the <i>Maeve</i> and I will not go into them in detail now but for our navy personnel, who comprised 387 men on the 6th November, 1969, we have accommodation for six officers and 16 other ranks.  This is totally inadequate. When the Minister for Finance was speaking here yesterday he stated that the National Building Agency had been instructed to provide houses in certain areas for members of the Garda Síochána.  This is a way by which the Minister could get accommodation for members of the naval service.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has ever visited the headquarters of the Irish Naval Services at Haulbowline?  As far as I can remember he had not up to some time ago.</P>
    <P>The matter of our troops serving overseas is raised in the Minister's statement.  We should make sure before we send troops abroad that in the event of the fatality of any soldier adequate steps will be taken to ensure that his family are looked after for the rest of their lives.  One of my first duties when I came to this city was to visit the wife of one of our soldiers who had been killed at Niemba and it was a dreadful thing to see her being evicted from her home.  I do not think we make sufficient financial, housing and welfare provision for the dependants of our troops who serve abroad.  In the case of our troops serving in Cyprus where quarters are available, the Minister should send out some of the families of troops who are serving tours of six months or longer.  This is the procedure in some other Armies and in our case we should certainly consider uniting some of the families where it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> I asked the Minister earlier this year what was the wastage in the FCA. They get some very good men and yet at the end of the 12-month period only one-third of those who joined previously are still serving.  Naturally many who are students from UCD and other colleges move on further afield and others drop out for other reasons, but to have a 60 per cent drop-out rate leaves much to be desired and is a reflection on the efficiency of the FCA and the equipment given to them.  At a time when arms are freely available I do not see why the Minister cannot buy adequate equipment for the FCA. During the recent trouble in the north we had men being sent to Kippure with a handful of ammunition, with no food or drink provided for them.  They were dependent on the generosity of the members of the TV staff who were at the station.  The members of the Force deserve better treatment than this.</P>
    <P>In regard to the introduction of a new uniform, of which the Minister has spoken, this is a good thing and is not before its time.  Our arms and equipment are manufactured abroad.  In this instance I should like the Minister to reassure us that these new uniforms will be manufactured here.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to investigate the situation with regard to overseas pay and allowances.  The overseas allowance has not been increased since 1961.  Massive inflation has taken place and these allowances should now be increased <i>pro rata</i> with the increase in the cost of living.  To pay our troops serving abroad an allowance fixed in 1961 is not fair.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that six new married quarters have been completed in Limerick.  It would appear to me to be totally inadequate from the point of view of accommodation.  I trust it is the start of something better and bigger.  I shall say no more.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that adequate fishery protection requires the use of larger vessels.  I should like the Minister to circulate to the House the report and advice he got on this particular matter.  I fail to see how two craft can give adequate fishery protection around our extensive coastline.  What is holding up the provision of these vessels?  How far has the Minister gone?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> We have witnessed the decline of the Army Equitation School over a long number of years.  We have seen the introduction of civilian show jumpers for the first time ever.  That never happened when this party were in control.  It is heartbreaking to see the decline of the Army jumping team, the decline that has occurred under successive Fianna Fáil Governments. The Army jumping team played an important part in projecting our image abroad as an agricultural country, as a country with great military traditions, and above all, as a country with an important horse breeding industry.  We have the talent.  We have the facilities. All that is required is the encouragement to enable our jumping team to achieve once more the top bracket in international show jumping.  There are great men in the Army Equitation School.  If the Minister gives them their head I am sure they will prove themselves once more the premier team in Europe, if not in the world.</P>
    <P>There is talk of purchasing another helicopter.  I do not think the present helicopter service is used enough.  One of the reasons for this may be the threat of a large bill.  I know one doctor in Kerry who saved a person's life by calling in a helicopter; he was sent a bill for £170.  I know local authorities pay but initially there may have been a certain amount of confusion. I should like to see helicopters used more.  There is an increase in road accidents and helicopters could provide a very useful service in these accidents.  I should like to see the service extended.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to a somewhat emotional matter.  The Minister should consider opening St. Bricin's Hospital to members of the Old IRA.  Many of these are in county homes or homes for old people.  I do not think it would be asking too much of the Minister to accommodate these in St. Bricin's so that they could spend their remaining years in relative comfort.  There has been discussion recently about the overcrowding in some of the institutions. St. Ita's was in the news lately. I am sure that some of the people in these institutions are members of the Old IRA.  It would be a shocking thing <Col N="823" /> to allow them to die in places like these.  The Minister should open St. Bricin's Hospital to these men.</P>
    <P>We must press forward with extending and increasing the Army.  I disagree with Deputy Dowling about recruiting. It is very difficult today to get young people to join anything in which there is somewhat stringent discipline.  Deputy Dowling misquoted Deputy Clinton. Deputy Clinton referred to the Engineering Corps of the Army and to the practical way in which that Corps could be used in times of emergency. They could be used to erect Bailey bridges and so on.  There is no question of their doing menial work.</P>
    <P>One of the things which have grievously disappointed me about the Minister is his adamant refusal to cater in the slightest degree for young people who have been brought before the courts.  I have addressed questions to the Minister for Transport and Power and to other Ministers on this particular matter and I have found that there is no exclusion of anybody because of a criminal record.  No one wants to see the Army filled with ex-convicts. No one wants to go back to the days when a man was hit over the head and dragooned into the Army. A certain percentage of those who appear before the courts could, with advantage both to themselves and to the country, be taken into the Army. They would benefit from Army discipline. I am disappointed at the Minister's absolute refusal to help in the rehabilitation of these people.  They could be recruited for a task force and given a chance to prove their worth. They do not have to be kept permanently in the Army.  They could be given hospitality and the facilities for mixing around.  One would not expect them to be armed.  The menial jobs could be allocated to these people. The Minister referred to educational schemes for troops.  The gaps left by the troops attending these courses could be filled in a practical way by some unfortunate people who have been before the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister must bear in mind that many members of the forces are brought before military courts.  These <Col N="824" /> people are kept in the Army.  Because of the discipline enforced they often turn out to be the finest men we have. I am flabbergasted at the Minister's refusal to participate in such a scheme. We know that many of these people who have been convicted are medically or psychologically unfit.  The Minister would have only a small problem if he would take a small percentage of those who are medically fit and use them in the forces&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are many jobs which could be done around the camp and barracks by these people.  I am sure the Minister will see the wisdom of this suggestion.</P>
      <P>We have seen an improvement in the distribution of equipment and of the FN rifle, the Gustav and the new light machine gun which has recently been distributed.  I should like to see the armed forces completely re-equipped on modern lines.  A soldier with a new uniform and no gun is ineffective.  We must have light, mobile weapons.  We must be a quick-striking force if we are ever to be effective.</P>
      <P>Consideration should be given now to the establishment of a female corps in the armed services on a parallel with the Ban-Gharda.  In Civil Defence women work side by side with the men.  Recruiting difficulties in the Army could be overcome by the establishment of a female corps who could take over certain secretarial duties, thus releasing able-bodied soldiers who resent being tied to the desk.  Many men have complained of sitting behind desks when they could be actively employed.  Most other armies have introduced such an innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> The Army is very much lacking so far as sporting activity is concerned. The force are sensitive about this. They have the cream of the youth in the Army and yet in sporting activities they do not seem to come out on top.  They have many recreational facilities.  They have free time. They are all healthy.  They do not dominate the sporting arena of Ireland as they should.  In boxing, athletics, swimming and gymnastics, as well as equestrian events, they should really excel.  We have seen the adverse effect on other armies of a minor role to sport.  Once the role of sport in the Army is depressed, the standards seem to drop.  I should like to see greater emphasis on sport.  There is no encouragement from the top.  Many in the Army would be willing and keen to participate in these sports.  All the sports I have mentioned are international. We compete in them on an international level.  It is important that the image we project of our Army should be an active one.  The Army have every facility to promote these sports.  Boxing is an art in which the Army should dominate.  They should also excel in swimming, athletics and gymnastics.  The Army are fully equipped to participate in sporting events but they are not making use of the facilities.  There is no participation in international army competitions. The incentives for participation are not there.</P>
    <P>We have depleted our defensive potential by sending our battalions to Cyprus.  We are not in danger of being invaded but if the primary function of the Army is to defend the State against external aggression, why do we send one-half of our armoured cars abroad and leave our country relatively unprotected? When we speak of Civil Defence we speak of a force which is completely uneducated in the methods of modern warfare.  Our Civil Defence have no knowledge of nuclear warfare, gas warfare or germ warfare.</P>

      <P>We have no equipment to deal with these things.  We are still getting rid of our 303's.  Our Civil Defence force know nothing about <Col N="826" /> these methods of warfare which would, in all probability, be used if these islands were to be attacked.  Civil defence at present might possibly be defined as consisting of well-organised first-aid stations.</P>
      <P>The medical services available for members of the Defence Forces could be improved.  You have a family living for 10s a week in Army quarters and you can have the same family on the same income living for £5 12s a week in some of the new flat units.  Their dependants are not covered for medical treatment and they can encounter great expense.  Where the Minister is underpaying the officers in his Army, where he is making a deduction for health services in the pretence that the officer has a completely free health service for himself, he should provide this health service for the full family and not for the male only, or, as in certain cases in the Curragh, provide only in special cases for domiciliary visits by Army medical officers.  This should be routine.  The medical services of the Army are excellently organised and are in a position where they can be expanded to cover entire families.  They would be giving great service in this way and the men are entitled to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the integration of military hospitals on a par with what has happened in the United States where some of the best hospitals are military hospitals that have been opened to the public.  The doctors in the military hospitals have benefited from the wide range of cases they come across among the public at large as distinct from the narrow male element of fit, young, healthy men prevalent in the Army.  We could do this here with St. Bricin's Hospital. We could bring it up on a par with any of the other Dublin teaching hospitals quite easily and it would be to the benefit of everybody.  The Minister should consider this: it is an easy step to take and would be most effective.</P>

    <P>I should like to see the incorporation of airport facilities in the Curragh, whether they are helicopter pads or something else.  I should like to see Casement Airport investigated from <Col N="827" /> the point of view of the possibility of opening it to certain civilian uses. There are many complications in regard to this and I do not wish to give any opinion on the matter as I am not qualified to do so but I should like to see the possibilities investigated.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see that Deputy Dr. de Valera, a former major in the Army, is going to contribute to the debate.  Perhaps the previous speaker induced him to do so.  I shall not take long.  Long-distance running may be good for soldiers but I do not know that long-distance speaking is good for Deputies.  There is a matter I wish to discuss.  I see Deputy Dowling, who repeated some things three times today, is present and this applies to him, perhaps, in particular.  I am contributing to this debate because of something that the Minister for Finance said to me yesterday.  It concerns an aspect of the Minister's Department in which I am interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It arose out of Civil Service remuneration.  It is a matter in which I was interested many years ago. The Army is now the same size as it was in 1939-40.  By coincidence, it is exactly the same size in &ldquo;other ranks&rdquo;, 7,300 men.  The number of civil servants in the Department of Defence in 1939 was as follows: a total of 320 civil servants of whom 140 were in the finance branch.  Civilian employees attached to the Army numbered 672.  Since I left the Civil Service a civil servant told me: &ldquo;Any civil servant can defend any given position for any period of time.&rdquo; The remark was most appropriate in talking about defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an application of Parkinson's Law.  At the moment the number is 540 civil servants, properly so-called, with 240 in the finance branch.  In language that I used on another occasion: &ldquo;What the hell are <Col N="828" /> they doing?&rdquo; I shall explain why they are there.  The number of Army personnel went up to 40,000 men while Deputy Dr. de Valera was there, if I may call him Dr. de Valera.  He is not as talkative as certain other doctors but I think it is fair, since there has been so much comment on this side of the House, that I should refer to him as Dr. de Valera, a university doctor like the rest of us, not a medical doctor. As the Minister said in reply to Deputy Tully there are 1,500 civilian employees now attached to the Army.  This increases the gross national product undoubtedly but I shall not talk about that, but about a very different thing. In 1950, 20 years ago, the O and M section of the Department of Finance inspected the finance branch of the Department of Defence.  They had serious reason for doing so because it had not been reduced at all compared with the period when they were paying 40,000 men and I suspect it is still the same.  They reported, and it was agreed by the secretary of the Department of Defence that the report was correct, that the staff should be reduced by a certain number.  Unfortunately, the Army finance officer who was a university doctor also&mdash;he was a former clergyman and an extremely truculent individual&mdash;was on leave when all this was arranged.  He was on a tour of the Far East or somewhere.</P>

      <P>If proper use of staff comes from the grace of God there certainly could be no grace of God in the Department of Defence. When he came back he kicked up a row and said he was not going to stand for it and the secretary of the Department of Defence, the late General McMahon, who was a very decent man, gave way and so did the O and M section of the Department of Finance.  They all fell back before this tyro or tyrant&mdash;call him what you like &mdash;and ever since we have had this fabulous number of people in the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great deal from the Government and from all sorts of <Col N="829" /> people about new methods.  Every time I say anything about the Civil Service I am told: &ldquo;All that has been changed since you left: you are out of date.&rdquo; I am not out of date on a simple issue like this.  I was informed that the Public Accounts Committee this morning were told that civil servants are in very short supply.  Many years ago I made a suggestion about this matter in the other House.  I said&mdash;and this refers to a suggestion made to Deputy Dowling this morning&mdash;why not, in preparing Army officers to go into civilian life, use them to staff the Army pay section, to a considerable extent? Why not staff the civil side of the Department of Defence with them particularly if civil servants are in short supply?</P>
    <P>My guess is that there are about 140 people in the finance branch of the Department of Defence.  They certainly cannot have any modern methods.  Not alone can they not have computers but they cannot have ordinary tabulating machines if they use this number of men to pay the number of soldiers that are there now.  This is really my point. I do not mind admitting that I was never in the Army.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that the Army had to pay a good deal for horses for the Equitation School in the last year or two because there were at one stage two civilian advisers who were economically-minded and would buy young horses at £200 to £300 each.  I do not know much about horses but I do know that the best way is to buy a horse that has a fairish record.  I agree with this aspect of the matter.</P>

I promised the Minister that I would not be long and <Col N="830" /> I shall not be.  I do suggest to the Minister&mdash;he has got all kinds of suggestions&mdash;that he should have a look at this matter and, since civil servants are in short supply, some of his men in the finance branch of the Department of Defence might be useful to the Revenue Commissioners who were up before the Public Accounts Committee this morning and who cannot get men for Taxes at all.

I do think the civilian side of the Department of Defence&mdash;I am talking primarily about the Civil Service strength&mdash;is excessive having regard to the size of the Army.  There is a fairly large cadre of Army officers compared with other ranks.  That is quite understandable.  There could be restaffing of the Civil Service side quite easily from other Departments in the event of anything happening.  That is my only contribution.  I can promise the Minister that I am doubtful if I will ever contribute again to a debate on the Department of Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his promotion <Col N="831" /> to the Ministry of Defence.  From what I know of him and the experience I have had in the few months since I became a Member of the Dáil I am sure that he will be one of the more efficient and progressive Ministers for Defence that we have had so far.</P>
      <P>I was slightly amused by Deputy Dr. Byrne's remarks on the training of the civil defence organisation.  Does he want us to drop atom bombs at every station in order that these people may have training?  Is it necessary to have actual fall-out so that they can be trained properly?  Excellent training is being provided at the moment and in my view it is sufficient.</P>
      <P>The first army that I should like to speak about is the army that has been in retirement since 1923, the members of the Old IRA.  These people are not being treated as well as we could afford to treat them.  The pension they are receiving is a starvation allowance. It should be increased.  There are very few of these people left.  There were very few to start with.  As years go by the numbers diminish.  The pensions could be increased seeing that the budgetary provision for Old IRA pensions must have dropped considerably in the last couple of years. An increase in pension would be a small tribute which we could pay them.  Were it not for these people we would not be in our own House today.</P>
      <P>The interrogation to which these people are subjected when they apply for a special allowance or pension increase is something that is obnoxious to the type of people who founded the State.  In the case of the special allowance of £170 or £189 a year, they would really want to be destitute to qualify.  Most of those in receipt of the special allowance are destitute.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the introduction last year of the provision for funeral costs of £25 maximum in respect of members of the Old IRA.  At today's cost this is not sufficient and would not represent one-quarter of the cost of decent burial. I should like to see a big improvement in that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration should be given in the case of applicants for special allowance <Col N="832" /> who are under 70 years of age. There are very few in the 68 to 69 age group who took an active part in the War of Independence and they should be looked after and at least allowed to apply for special allowances and receive reasonable and favourable consideration. On reaching the age of 70 years, where the person is in receipt of an old age pension, he must hand in his special identity card in exchange for the pension book.  I should like the Minister to look into this matter with a view to allowing members of the Old IRA to retain the special identity card of which they are so rightly proud.  This is a special concession which could be granted to these few people.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider the position of the wives of Old IRA men.  We often hear about the great women behind the men.  Some small concession should be given to these tremendous women who went through hard times and suffered on occasions far more than the Volunteers.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the total Army Vote.  It would seem that there are 1,154 officers, 73 cadets and 7,100 NCOs and men.  This seems reasonable but in view of the installations which have to be guarded and the recent trouble, is it sufficient?  There has been a tremendous recruiting drive. Contrary to Deputy Dowling's remarks about lack of imagination, I think that for the first time a Civil Service Department used imagination in its advertising and projected the manly image that we want in order to attract young men into the Army.  Some years ago a sum of £5 was given to an NCO or to any man who brought in a recruit to the Army.  This has been stopped although it did encourage people to get recruits.  I believe in conscription. Every man should serve at least a two-year period in our Army if it were only to keep our students with their hair short and to put a slight curb on their manners.</P>
    <P>I was shocked that the Minister did not think it worth his while to mention the FCA, a force with 20,000 members.  These men give of their free time and energy in the service of their country and regard themselves as <Col N="833" /> soldiers.  They give up one night a week and one weekend in every three or four to train as second-line reserve.  No wonder the membership is so low. There is a tremendous strain on the FCA by reason of lack of suitable weapons and a complete lack of suitable clothing.  It is not what fits but what is the nearest fit when one joins the FCA.  Deputy Clinton remarked on their sloppy appearance at the St. Patrick's Day parade but the fault lies not with the men but with their uniform.  These men are expected to carry out battle manoeuvres, to march and attend dress parades in one uniform which they must wear for five years.  A man could not possibly be expected to turn out the following morning like a new pin if on the previous day he had to creep through grass and ditches, and so on, in his one and only uniform.  It is a tiny way of curbing the cost of the Department but it has a tremendously disadvantageous effect on the morale of the people concerned.  These men are guarding our installations at weekends and they do so with a glad heart.  They are the one force who have never received sufficient tribute or compliments in the whole course of their history.</P>
    <P>Many remarks are made outside this House about the type of people in the FCA.  The force could be brought to a better standard if it were given better equipment.  They are still shooting with 303 rifles.  The Army got FN rifles only when they went to the Congo and when the Department realised that the 303 rifle was at least 20 years out of date.  If we had used up-to-date weapons at the time of the Niemba ambush we might not have suffered such a great tragedy.  By reducing their annual training by a week and by completely scrimping on the FCA, the Department have played no small part in neglecting to raise the morale of the members of that force.</P>
    <P>Neither officers nor men training the FCA get sufficient moneys for their services.  I know some men in the 13th Battalion who have given of their free time to help anyone interested enough to study.  Last year the Minister adopted a training scheme for Army <Col N="834" /> privates, such as that provided in vocational education.  This is badly needed.  There should be a careers officer to help men leaving the Army to find suitable careers in civilian life. I agree in principle but not in detail with Deputy Clinton's remarks about putting the Army to more use.  Each corps in the Army could be used when needed for civil purposes.  I would not agree that they should dig ditches or drain canals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>There should be a unit in each area to assist in searches for people who are drowned or children who are lost, and so on.  A special unit trained in search methods should be available to assist the civil power. This would also help to keep the men alert.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Tully's remarks about outside aggression.  The whole reason for having our Army is that we must be prepared for outside aggression.  Essentially, it is to aid the civil power.  I urge the Minister to help in every way with walkie-talkie systems, and so on, where necessary.  The Engineering Corps could be sent out to help in any local disaster.</P>
      <P>I was glad to note that some non-commissioned officers are undergoing a course to prepare them for appointment to commissioned rank.  This is true democracy such as we would expect to find in this country.  However, this course must be better advertised within the Army itself.  If this is not done then it is no wonder that we have &ldquo;cribbing&rdquo; at this stage.  With regard to service abroad, it is ridiculous that a limit of 45 years of age is imposed on a private and a non-commissioned officer for such service.  It is not right to impose this stringent age limit.  Apart from the experience to be gained by service abroad there is the financial aspect to be considered.  Service abroad is a financial asset to these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the pilot scheme operated in Galway extended to all military barracks.  When a person first enters the Army he could be trained <Col N="835" /> for a specific job.  He could do that job in the Army and continue in it when he leaves the Army.  This is where a public relations or personnel officer would come in.  He could interview each recruit, ask him about his background and his interests.  As far as I know at the moment for whatever tour you are about to do you can put down three spheres of the Army you would like to join.  If No. 1 is not available you get No. 2 or No. 3.  Each man should be selected on the basis of his own ability and initiative, his background and the type of county he comes from.  If this were done there would be a foundation for him to work on when he leaves the Army.  He might be a driver or an engineer in the engineering corps or the signal corps and he should be given a certificate when he is leaving.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dowling that the predischarge leave should be abolished and replaced by a gratuity. As the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is standing in for the Minister, I might say that if an Army man applies to the Post Office he will not be taken on until his time in the Army is up.  This is very unfair.  It means he cannot avail of any reasonably secure job.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see that the Minister has made provision for cadets to attend the university at the expense of the Army.  I would like to see some safeguards included.  They should have to spend at least ten to 12 or 14 years in the Army.  This would ensure that the Army would recoup the money spent on them through the service they would give.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take a serious look at the FCA.  Their halls all over the countryside are being sold at the moment because of a lack of personnel in the FCA.  The reason for this is the apathy on the part of the Department in regard to members of the FCA.</P>
    <P>While there has been a tremendous improvement in the dress of the soldiers in the past couple of years, it still is not good enough that the officers have one cloth and the men another.  I <Col N="836" /> feel very strongly that there should be one cloth for all.  Indeed, something like this was emphasised to our own Army when our officers went to the Congo.  Some of them sat down and expected to be served at table.  In Elizabethville and other places, when the American officers came in, our officers had to get up and serve themselves, as is the case in any man's army.  This type of thing has existed in the Irish Army and will continue to exist while there is a slight difference &mdash;no matter how small it may be or appear to be&mdash;between them.  As I say, the uniforms of the men have improved but there must be a further improvement in the texture and in their walking out uniform.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for being so co-operative during the past six or seven months.  I wish him every success.  I am sure he will keep his military contacts open and his ears to the ground to ensure that we have better and more efficient standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often the discussion on the Vote for the Department of Defence is overshadowed by the discussions on other Departments.  This is not in keeping with the importance of the Department of Defence, and the different forces within that Department, to the State and the people.  As a people we are entirely too complacent. We accept it as normal that the security of our State should be preserved by our Defence Forces, and by the Garda to a certain extent.  Down through the years we have accepted that and many of us have criticised the voluntary services given in the FCA by those men who are now involved in the security of our State. Since integration the FCA are part of every command and every bridge and every battalion.  Our regular Army is composed of regular and FCA units.  I was very impressed by Deputy Davern's speech in which he fully recognised the importance of the FCA as a force within the State.  Unless we have more speeches like that with more understanding, we can never hope that the Government will have a full understanding of what has to be faced by the people in that voluntary force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> It was recognised by the Army that the FCA had reached a stage of efficiency which would entitle them to become part of our regular Army.  They are, of course, in the Second Line Reserve but when they go on training they train with the same weapons as the regular Army.  They undergo the same training in every respect.  It is not true to say that our weapons are obsolete. There may be some for training purposes and perhaps outside the House some information might be restricted. The standard of training achieved by the FCA must be accepted by all as worthy of great respect.  At no stage in our history had we a voluntary force so well equipped and trained.  In fact, in every town and county over which we have control, there is a well trained force.  That should be recognised and accepted by all.</P>
    <P>Attached to the FCA we have a regular training cadre at company and battalion level.  They do not confine their activities entirely to Army training. They become involved socially and integrate with the community in which they are billeted.  They have sponsored all our best sports: football, cross-country running, basketball and everything that youth should be involved in. I consider that they are the élite of the Army.  Those men who are assigned as training staff are eminently suited to that purpose.  Every consideration should be given to them.</P>
    <P>When they go into the different areas no arrangement is made to provide suitable accommodation for their wives and families.  There should be some liaison and some understanding with the Department of Local Government. There is a limited number in each company area or in each battalion headquarters.  It would be easy to satisfy their housing requirements and they should not have to compete with the ordinary citizen in the urban or rural areas.  Their names should not have to be taken out of the hat nor should the medical officer have to decide who is the most deserving. They should get priority for housing if they are to have security in the area in which they work.  I should like the Minister to consult with the Minister for Local Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> Much has been said about conditions in our Naval Service and it is obvious that rapid improvement must be made. Undoubtedly the Minister depends for finance on the Minister for Finance. He has effected quite a number of improvements since he was appointed Minister for Defence and I know quite a few in the Army who recognise the benefit these have proved to them.  There are, however, some matters to which I would like the Minister to attend.  There is the question of the pensions of NCOs and privates.  I shall not go into this in detail but will privately give the Minister some statistics in this regard.  Some recommendations have been made which I hope he will accept as they are long overdue.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Davern pointed out, there are approximately 20,000 FCA members, and if we are to retain their services and continue the normal intake of young men in the future we must treat them as they deserve to be treated.  They are dedicated young men, despite what many might think about their appearance.  Whether a man wears long hair and an ill-fitting uniform or is spruce and tidy he can be a very good marksman, a courageous soldier and give good service to his country.</P>
    <P>The uniform has never been attractive and this matter seems to have been forgotten.  Deputy Davern made the point that the uniform which the men wear must suffice for training courses as well as for ceremonial parades.  Judging by the daily papers we must expect that the demands on the FCA for ceremonial purposes will increase.  Therefore I would recommend the Minister to make an additional issue once in every three or four years to ensure a respectable uniform for such ceremonial occasions.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure also that when the FCA go on training to summer camp the tents and bedding are of the proper quality and afford adequate protection.  I have seen deficiencies in this regard and that is why I refer to this now.  All these things have an influence on the length of service given by volunteers.  It also <Col N="839" /> affects the intentions to join of potential members.</P>
    <P>It is very important that men should be given a proper course in training on an approved range.  It is entirely unnecessary to take men very long distances for this purpose.  In one county there is a variety of ranges, but I know places where men have to travel 100 miles.  A person who is in normal employment and has to travel such a distance to train, having being up at 4, 5 or 6 in the morning to be on the range at 8 o'clock, is not fit for work the next day.  In County Clare a range has been approved but the small expenditure involved has not been sanctioned.  This has been on the files for many long years.  I know the Minister has an interest in seeing that ranges are properly equipped, and I hope he will have another look at this and provide facilities where they are needed.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the standard of all the ranks in our Army is high.  The courtesy shown by our soldiers is something we should be very pleased about.  They are very acceptable in everyday life when their period of service expires.  Every Deputy who has spoken has stressed the necessity to make proper provision for the resettlement of these men.  One Deputy said that when they get their discharge they have to fend for themselves and that there is very little recognition by the ordinary employer of these men. It would be well to realise that we owe a lot to these men whether they be volunteers or men in regular service. They deserve more serious consideration when they look for employment in civilian life.</P>
    <P>Those who are in civilian life, like the FCA, should certainly get more consideration.  I would like that NCOs and officers in the FCA be considered for promotion to commissioned rank.  I know of several FCA personnel who have university degrees, they have been interviewed for their commissions, have been found suitable and have given good service.  Regular quartermasters who have given years of service in the NCO rank have been put forward for training.  The NCO <Col N="840" /> in the FCA is a man of high calibre and by doing something like this we would ensure a continuation of the interlocking of the voluntary with the regular force.  We must accept that the voluntary force will be a permanent feature in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards Civil Defence some doubt was expressed about the efficiency and usefulness of the organisation, but I personally have no such doubt.  I have knowledge of their work and training. Their services are certainly of benefit even if we never have to contend with any serious war situation here.  Civil Defence workers must be trained to deal with such matters as nuclear warfare and fall-out.  We must accept that should an atomic bomb be dropped on England, even by accident, depending on the prevailing wind there might be an emergency in this country in a matter of a few hours.  It would be suicidal for us to ignore the fact that we need some organisation which would be in a position to deal with an emergency.</P>
    <P>I remember many years ago, when, because of a world crisis, there was a remote danger of having casualties a crash programme was introduced throughout the country.  Many people other than those involved in the Defence Forces did not know of this, but in our large centres of population at that time there was a crash programme to evacuate the population and to take casualties to different hospitals. It would be well for people to know that in this State there is an organisation that looks ahead and considers the security of the people.</P>
    <P>I should like to see Civil Defence continued because there is nothing lost by educating people on how to give assistance.  Organisations such as the FCA and Civil Defence are dependent on dedicated people who have an interest in a particular service.  The FCA got a gratuity in the fifties and surely the Minister will agree they are now entitled to an increase, considering they are always available in the event of an emergency?  I would ask the Minister to consider granting some increase in that gratuity to bring it into line with present day standards.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the rapidly <Col N="841" /> diminishing numbers of Old IRA men, men who have been an inspiration to our young men.  It is time that the means test, which prevents some of those veterans from qualifying for an allowance, was abolished.  This is not just a case of abolishing an ordinary means test but it concerns men who deserve very special consideration from the Government.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the failure of our rescue services.  The helicopter service has proved most efficient and there seems to be something to the suggestion that a helicopter be located in the Shannon area.  While we all agree that the cost of this service must be considered, the saving of life should always have priority over financial considerations.</P>
    <P>In regard to the contribution made by our Army to the United Nations, we can be very proud that, at all levels, our leadership and ability has been recognised by that organisation; I mention our present Chief of Staff, our Observer Corps in the Lebanon, in the Gaza Strip and in many other places where it is necessary to maintain peace.  Perhaps the allowances given to those men are small in comparison with that given to soldiers from other countries and I consider they could be increased.  We can be proud of their service abroad and this increase, if granted, would be no more than they deserve.</P>
    <P>Our medical services in the Army are reasonably good but for families of men who are billeted with FCA units in the training cadres attached to different companies, the necessary facilities are not available.  Considering the few that are abroad I see no reason at all why they and their families should not have medical cards.  They are in a special category and they deserve special treatment.  I know this is not a matter for the Minister but he could come to some understanding with his colleague, the Minister for Health, and the respective local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the naval service, the emphasis should be on recruitment along the west coast.  The young men in those areas should be encouraged <Col N="842" /> to go to sea and eventually they could man our fishing fleet instead of allowing foreign trawlers to poach all along our shores.  With the inadequate fleet we have at the moment we cannot do very much about fishery protection.</P>
    <P>It is important that people should fully recognise and appreciate the purpose of our Army.  There were times in the recent past when we wondered if we might not become belligerent.  Our wish is to live in peace and the assurance we have had should have a good effect on Army morale.  Our Army has never been reluctant to serve but it is important that we should know exactly where we are going.  We are assured now that there is no intention we should become aggressors.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about dining halls, billets and so forth.  Any dining hall I have seen has been clean, tidy and properly equipped.  I have seen quite a number.  I am sure the Minister has visited them all.  The dining halls are adorned with flags brought back by our soldiers who have served abroad.  There has been, too, an improvement in billets.  They are now properly heated.  The improvement is gradual but I suppose the pace is governed by financial restrictions. Generally speaking, there has been an improvement in the living quarters for the single men.  The married men are not so well off.  Something must be done to solve their problems.  Our soldiers should get preferential treatment where housing is concerned.  The houses built in Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick are very good but we need more of them.  If we need the men we will have to ensure that they have satisfactory living accommodation. That is just as important as proper equipment.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Minister for the courtesy he has shown me since I was elected to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be fair to the House to go into matters of detail at this stage.  The Minister got plenty of good advice during the course of the debate so far. There is one point I should, however, like to emphasise.  The Defence Forces are there for a definite purpose, just <Col N="843" /> as the Garda are there for a definite purpose.  In these modern times it takes personnel with particular skills to fulfil that purpose.  If we are going to keep a defence force or a police force it is vitally essential that the personnel involved will reach the proper pitch of efficiency and that morale will be commensurate with the particular task.</P>
      <P>We have an Army.  Have we, I wonder, arranged that the pay and remuneration of that Army keep pace with what is happening elsewhere? There have been big changes in this regard in other branches of the State service and outside it.  I should like to take this opportunity, and this is one reason why I am intervening in this debate, of emphasising once more that the personnel of the Army whether officers, NCOs or men and the personnel of the Garda Síochána, plus certain personnel in the Post Office, are as important as any other personnel in the State service.  In the last analysis they are more important and more vitally necessary to the State than is the mere administrator and I can find no logical reason why the terms of service of soldiers, of gardaí and of some other employees of the State, should not be absolutely on a par with the conditions that obtain for the administrative arm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us will, I think, subscribe to the view that the State, being the biggest industry in the country, should remunerate its personnel on a proper basis.  None of us will argue against the maintenance of all branches of the State service at the highest possible level and I doubt if anybody will complain if rates of remuneration are fixed in accordance with the conditions of the time.  The time has passed for discriminating between the merely administrative branch, the civil branch, as against other branches.  Recent events all over the world are demonstrating that the last defence and the last sanction is in a certain place.  If precautions are not taken and if adequate arrangements are not made all the administrative arrangements, the organisation and all the law count for nothing.  The ultimate security and <Col N="844" /> well-being of a democracy depends, in the last analysis, on sanctions.</P>
    <P>In a democratic country the security depends on the police force and on the Army, quite apart from other considerations of defence.  Speaking on Estimates for the Department of Justice I have tried to emphasise the importance of this point for the gardaí. On this occasion I wish to make the point on behalf of the officers, NCOs and men of the Army.  We should recollect that in the case of these services, no less than in the case of any other branch of service, young men enter these professions.  They are highly skilled professions nowadays.  While I am emphasising the skill of the gardaí and the soldiers I am not underestimating the skill of the administrative side. All are necessary.  I do not want to be taken as running down one side in any way.  I want to bring the other side up to par.  The whole democratic structure of the State in its normal function&mdash; and I am not thinking of revolutions &mdash;depends on the instinctive discipline of the people co-operating with the rule of law administered by the administration.  The role of the two forces I have mentioned is a vital and fundamental one.  I am not going to offer the Minister advice in regard to the Army.  I have not the information to do so.  Now is the time to look at the Army before actual problems arise. Before the last war we were fortunate because there was a very definite period of preparation for war, from 1937 to 1939.  While war was actually in progress there was a vital six months when time was available to remedy defects. One cannot always guarantee that time will be available.  I am sure from the experience we had within the past year that the Minister will understand what I am trying to say in this regard.  The way to be ready is to have a self-respecting and competent organisation to deal with emergencies.  There is nothing more demoralising to an army than to have great plans on paper and not to be able to measure up to a real situation when it arises.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be useful to go any further into detail.  Now is the time, and not later, when a deterioration of morale might force the position, <Col N="845" /> to look at the professional soldiers' situation, no matter what the rank, and to see that neither the privates, the NCOs nor the officers are losing out in an economic situation where money values are deteriorating very rapidly.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a brief comment in regard to the FCA.  At present there are young men in that force actually in their spare time, discharging useful duties doing guard duty on certain installations.  It is an interesting comment on our defence system that it is necessary to call on this element of the force for such duty.  They are not being called merely to give them training. They are called because they are needed.  My information may not be true and, if not, I am open to correction, but if it is true the inference to be drawn is so obvious that I need not pursue it further.  It points to the desirability of looking into the question of our strength.  We have had a recruiting campaign under some pressure.  Why did it have to wait to have that happen?  One of the fortunate things which kept up the morale of the Army was the service abroad. I was sorry to hear Deputy Dr. Byrne commenting adversely on this.  Service abroad was of great benefit to Army morale.  It gave the personnel some sense of purpose.  Perhaps insufficient attention was given to maintaining the position which should be maintained. It is important that the serving personnel have adequate remuneration and terms of service completely comparable with other branches of service. If that is achieved other problems can be more easily handled.  I hope it will not be necessary on some other occasion to review the history of the Defence Estimate in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl ach cúpla focal le rá agam ar an Meastacháin seo. Certain remarks have been made about the Minister's failure to pay tribute to the FCA.  The Minister may be keeping the good wine to the last. He has the final say.  In the coming year we shall be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the greatest and proudest moment in our history, the taking over by the Irish Army from <Col N="846" /> the British of barracks throughout the country.  I hope the Minister will not behave like some Ministers in the past who had an inbred hatred of celebrating anything done by an army led by the greatest man this country ever produced, Michael Collins.  We have a new Minister and from what I know of him he has not in his blood the hatred some of those in the past had.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that when the Army was founded its first duty was to defend the infant State.  The infant has grown a beard since but I fear the defence of the State from within may soon be the responsibility of the Minister judging by the rumblings one hears.  I hope I am wrong and that another shot will not be fired in anger by our Army. Some of the chickens previous Ministers caused to be hatched have come home to roost.</P>
      <P>I am glad there is an upward trend in recruiting but people will not lightly enter on an Army career and want to know that when they leave the Army they will not be thrown on the scrap-heap as has been the case in the past. I am glad also that the Army is training men to fit them for life outside the Army and that the necessary skills are being acquired in our own city of Galway through AnCO.  I am also glad that members of the cadet school are attending our university.  We had a lot of talk two or three years ago about the cadet school going completely to Galway.  I think no place in Ireland could offer better facilities and I cannot see why one section of the cadet school goes to the university in Galway and the other section is elsewhere. There will be much shuffling from one place to the other if that situation continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone thinking of an Army career would like to see better housing provision for Army personnel.  I should like the Minister to inspect the conditions the Army have to accept at Renmore military barracks.  There had to be a question asked in the House before they could get an electric plug in some of the rooms there and this took years to achieve.  Do we care about heating in these establishments?  It is time the Minister provided a few more plugs if <Col N="847" /> he wants to encourage people to take up an army career.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, by means of question and answer, we on this side of the House called for the establishment of a helicopter service in the Army.  We were told there was no need.  After a long time the Minister eventually gave way.  I wonder how he feels today?  All sides of the House should be proud of our helicopter rescue service.  I have seen it in action off the west coast of Ireland and I have seen the part it has played in helping people cut off by storms and unable to get to hospital from the Aran Islands and other islands off the coast.  I have seen lives saved by it and there was no talk about it since.  It is being done every other day. Perhaps prior to this people were allowed to die and were forgotten.</P>
    <P>It is now time to consider basing a helicopter on the west coast.  The objection that it could not be serviced is becoming stale.  I do not see why a helicopter cannot be serviced in the west where it is needed far more than in the east.  Only small space is required for landing or take-off; you can put it down in the backyard of your house.  The question of servicing a helicopter in the west should be considered because it is generally in an emergency that a helicopter is called on and the time it takes to come from Baldonnel could be the difference between life and death.  Perhaps we must continue putting down questions in order to have a helicopter based in the west as we had to do to get the service in the first place.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the pilots.  I saw the stormy conditions under which they flew to the Aran Islands and the nursing and medical personnel who accompanied them thought they were wonderful.  In the past day or so heroic rescue work was done against the side of a cliff.  It requires great nerve and training for a man to do what was done in that case and tribute should be paid here to a service so splendidly given.</P>
    <P>As regards our naval service it seems as if we were fidding while Rome was burning.  The Minister said that he had handed over to Irish <Col N="848" /> Shipping the task of securing fishery protection vessels and that already the company had issued an inquiry&mdash;mark you&mdash;to a large number of shipbuilders as to whether they would be interested in tendering for the construction of such vessels.  That is great news for the foreign trawlers around our coasts where they are reaping our harvest.  It is time something positive was done. Why not arm one of the ordinary fishing trawlers?  It may be argued that these would not be fast enough but surely if they fire a shot across the bows of the foreign trawler that will slow it down very quickly.  Why not use our helicopters?  We must safeguard the greatest harvest we have which requires no sowing, only reaping. It is a greater crime in this country to snatch a salmon than for a foreign trawler to come in on our west coast.  Boldly, these foreign trawlers appear daily off our coasts and to have it said here that we are now seeking tenders will only convey to these foreign fishermen that they will have a great time for the next few years.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the boxing teams we had in the Army in the past. These are the things which capture the imagination of young men and would encourage them to join the Army. They are great gimmicks, if I may use that expression, in encouraging recruiting. A great part was played in the past by Army boxers.  This activity could be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Army equitation school.  Army jumping teams are again raising our flag in foreign arenas but the amount of money provided will not help to keep the flag flying.  If the name of the country is to be kept to the fore by the Army jumping team they must be given the necessary money.  The publicity gained by the success of the Army jumping team contributes to tourism.  Bord Fáilte are also playing an important part in the economy.  We have an Army jumping team that can keep the name of this country before the world.  It would be wrong that there should be cheeseparing in regard to their activities.</P>
    <P>Tribute must be paid to the FCA for the part they have played in keeping <Col N="849" /> some of the wild boys from other parts of the country in their place. They have done their work quietly. The general public does not realise that the FCA devoted weekends and holiday periods to the task of guarding installations.  I know that the Minister did not mean to forget them in his opening statement.  He has an opportunity, when replying, of referring to them.</P>
    <P>In the matter of Army recruiting the FCA can play a useful part.  They can help to discipline the youth.  Never was there greater need for discipline amongst youth.</P>
    <P>I was sorry that the Army did not take part in the celebrations in Galway which this year were not held on St. Patrick's Day, for many reasons. Therefore, there cannot be the excuse that the Army were engaged in other parades.  Participation by the Army in such celebrations is a means of getting youth interested in the Army and could help the recruiting drive.  Possibly there will be another opportunity on Easter Sunday.  The Army should have participated in the parade in Galway.</P>
    <P>There should be church parades by the Army.  The people have no opportunity of seeing the Army on parade. They may see members of the FCA gathering outside the church on a Sunday prior to a day's training in the country.  The public should be given an opportunity of seeing the Army. Public parades by the Army would capture the imagination of youth and would be a means of getting recruits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My main reason for speaking on the Estimate is to pay a special tribute to the FCA and the work they have been doing, more particularly in the recent past.  The FCA is really a voluntary branch of the regular Army, although they do get a stipend from time to time.  The FCA could be described as a citizen army. It is composed of young and not so young people who give their time, mainly on a voluntary basis.  In the recent past, particularly at weekends, they have been protecting public property.  In the atmosphere which currently prevails they have been protecting <Col N="850" /> power stations and other installations in the interests of the nation. No tribute is high enough to pay to the FCA and its members.</P>
      <P>The FCA has worked very well with the regular Army.  The regular Army is in the front line; the FCA is more or less the second line of defence.  The regular Army is a full-time army.  I describe the FCA as an extension of the historic citizen army which served this country so well in the dark and troublesome days of the history of our nation.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of my friends have the honour of serving in the FCA. They have a number of criticisms. One of the main criticisms is in regard to the uniform they are asked to wear. There is an expression used in relation to the material used in the uniform&mdash; bull's wool.  I do not wish to be facetious in using that expression but I think it is a correct term to use in this connection.  Deputy Taylor might be able to help me here as a man who obviously knows his subject in the context of the Army.  Many of the men that I am speaking about have complained rather bitterly about the type of uniform provided.  I quite appreciate the economic circumstances affecting the current batch of military cloth made available to the FCA but when that batch has run out I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of providing cloth of a higher standard.  The FCA are worthy of a better dress.  Proper dress gives a person a psychological advantage.  Visitors to the country do not know whether the men they see in FCA uniform are members of the regular Army or not. They see them as soldiers of the nation, which they are.  It is very important to project the right image.  It is very important that we should have a properly dressed force, both in regard to the regular Army and the FCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy Taylor on his very fair-minded speech.  However, I think Deputy Cosgrave, leader of the main Opposition, has an obligation to denounce some of the views expressed by Deputy Hugh Byrne in relation to the Irish Army.  We had a long dissertation from the Mayor of Galway, <Col N="851" /> Deputy Coogan, about the relationships of Fine Gael with the Army and what Fine Gael have done and suggested in relation to the Army.  I would suggest that Deputy Coogan should contact the leader of the main Opposition and ask him to denounce some of the remarks passed by Deputy Hugh Byrne in regard to the Army which, in my view, were disgraceful.  Deputy Dr. Byrne suggested that our Army should become some sort of foreign legion but I should like to remind him that we have no deserts in this country.  The suggestion was that the Army should be used as a place to rehabilitate criminals.  I agree that we have an obligation to rehabilitate people who have fallen by the wayside but I do not think the Army is the place to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Byrne also made a number of snide remarks&mdash;I am aware that such a word is not normal parliamentary language but I trust the Chair will bear with me&mdash;about Irish personnel serving abroad during the Congo crisis. I did not hear the whole of Deputy Dr. Byrne's denunciatory speech but from what I did hear he certainly denounced our Army in no uncertain terms.  We should not make denigratory remarks about our Army, we should be injecting a spirit of self-confidence and a feeling of serving the country and serving it well.  I believe the leader of the main Opposition has an obligation to come out in public and deny many of the remarks passed here by &ldquo;Beau Geste&rdquo; Byrne.  I hope the Minister will deal with Deputy Dr. Byrne's comments in his reply.</P>
    <P>We recently learned that the fishing fleet at Dún Laoghaire earned over £100,000 this year.  This information was published by Bord Iascaigh Mhara in an excellent little booklet issued last week.  Coming from a fishing constituency on the east coast, I think a proper fishery protection service is essential.  The Minister has dealt quite fully with the part the navy plays in relation to fishery protection but I have always felt that we should get our navy into its proper context.  We should decide whether we want it as a navy <i>qua</i> navy or whether we want it as a navy <i>qua</i> fishery protection service.  I <Col N="852" /> believe we should have a separate and comprehensive fishery protection service. It is only when we see the figures published by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that we realise what can be done and we find out how important it is to have an adequate fishery protection service. When one considers the number of fishery protection vessels available one realises that we do not have a proper fishery protection service at this point in time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly indicated his awareness of the lack of a fishery protection service and he has said that he is taking steps to remedy the situation. Apparently, he has examined the possibility of having small but fast patrol boats for fishery protection.  I wonder if the Minister has considered the possibility of converting trawlers to protect other trawlers.  I appreciate that the weather conditions around our coasts can be bad and we must ensure that every vessel obtained for fishery protection will safeguard both the lives of the crew and the vessel itself&mdash;the lives of the crew being of paramount importance.  There is no point in buying just one or two protection vessels; we need four or five vessels for the east coast, two or three for the south coast and four or five for the west coast if we are to have a comprehensive protection service.  The three-mile limit has been extended to 12 miles in terms of national territory and these figures show the type of area we are discussing in the context of a proper fishery protection service.</P>
    <P>No mention has been made of the six officer cadets from the Republic of Zambia who are being trained at the Military College at The Curragh.  They have come here to be trained by our Army.  I hope the Minister will encourage this type of activity.  It is good to know that the Army offers this service to officer corps of other countries.  I should like to see more of this type of service in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Byrne said that our Civil Defence are not adequately trained about what to do if a H-bomb is dropped.  Again without meaning to sound facetious I know what to do when a H-bomb or an A-bomb comes &mdash;just say my Act of Contrition in the <Col N="853" /> normal way.  That would be the answer to that because I do not think there is really much defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to conclude by congratulating the Minister on his appointment. He is easy to deal with and I wish him continued success.  I should also like to congratulate him on the fashion in which he dealt with the crisis which existed between the Republic of Ireland and the Six Counties. He did an excellent job there.  The Irish Army are to be congratulated on that also and those people who answered the call of duty at that time of crisis in the history of our nation. We must be grateful to those people who came from office jobs and elsewhere to serve in this great Army of ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently we had a rather extensive Estimate on Defence which covered practically everything but the naval service.  I propose to devote my remarks largely to the naval service.  After many years of trying to stimulate Ministers for Defence to do something about unsatisfactory fishery protection, the naval service and the vessels on which our personnel were asked to serve, what has happened is that the three corvettes which were sometimes in commission and sometimes out of commission over the years appear to have collapsed in the last three or four months.  Two of them have apparently gone into dock beyond redemption and the other one, fighting to keep afloat with turbines turning and engines working, has gone in for an extensive refit.  We are in the unhappy situation today that we have a 12-mile fishery limit with absolutely nothing to protect it except the possibility of a helicopter flying over and nothing that foreign ships are invading our territory and reporting back.  The difficulty is that they have nobody to report back to now because there is no ship that can go out and chase marauding trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not lay the blame at the Minister's door because he has inherited the problem.  These corvettes are outdated. No nation in the world, even emergent nations, utilise this type of <Col N="856" /> ship for fishery protection or indeed for anything.  They are suitable only for slow convoy work and as most modern ships which are carrying merchandise, even tramp steamers, can exceed the limit which a corvette can do all out, they are pretty useless even for that.  So I say <i>Ave atque vale</i> to our corvettes.  They have gone, I understand, never to return.</P>
    <P>That places an obligation on the Minister and indeed gives him an opportunity for him to do something. The Minister will probably be advised by his officials to get some type of vessel suitable for fishery protection. That is all right as far as it goes.  It is a very good idea.  No navy can exist unless its personnel are trained in all the modern contrivances of warfare. For that purpose we will require at least one ship which is capable of being used in modern warfare conditions even if only on a small and light scale.  It is absolutely essential that we should have one frigate.  A frigate is the ideal small ship to deal with up-to-date naval circumstances. I would suggest to the Minister that we would need at least two frigates because anybody who knows anything about naval warfare, dockyards, construction and so on, must realise that ships must go into dock from time to time for extensive refit.  I have a feeling from the Minister's speech that he is groping in the dark.  I do not blame him for that. The Minister represents an inland constituency. I represent a maritime constituency and I have served afloat as a naval officer so perhaps I have some knowledge of what I am talking about. The Minister will be told to get one ship for the training of personnel and the other vessels capable of doing between 20 and 30 knots, able to overtake and arrest marauding trawlers which abound around our coast.  Let the Minister learn the importance of purchasing something of value to us.  I suggest the purchase of two frigates.  I do not know what their cost would be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what advice the Minister has had on this.  However, I think we could take a risk and go for something a little smaller.  There is another vessel, a fast mover, the name of which escapes me. It is capable of 20 knots.  I forget where I saw it but I think it was in Africa, in a harbour, moving at great speed.  We need a ship capable of harbour defence as well as fishery protection. The description of the ship may not be a frigate.</P>
      <P>My main point is that we must have some vessel capable of training naval personnel.  The extraordinary system obtains here in which the Army control the navy.  That is not a good thing. Senior Army officers, probably, advise the Minister.  In that way the Minister is getting second-hand advice.  He should take first-hand advice because it would be valueless for us, shall we say, to get one ship for the purpose of training and smaller ships for the purpose of fishery protection.  Some years ago when I strenuously advised the Minister's predecessor to buy one, I understand a ship for the protection of fisheries was bought by the Royal Malaysian Navy.  In fact, they bought two of them, of a tug class, ships capable of going out in rough weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said very humbly that he is in an inshore constituency and I can assure him that we get the worst seas in the world, even including Cape Horn, on the west coast of Ireland and if we have fishery protection ships they must be capable of going to sea in all weathers.  I stress this because I feel sure the Minister will be advised to get craft known as CMBs, coastal motor boats, which have great speed but which are not capable of withstanding heavy seas.  The craft could put to sea after marauding trawlers but after a certain distance it would have to heave to because it would be incapable <Col N="858" /> of battling heavy seas; it would break up in heavy seas.</P>
    <P>The Minister is starting with a clean sheet and he has a golden opportunity. We are entirely surrounded by water and when we enter the Common Market it is obvious that there will be an era of defence against aggressors, possibly not in the immediate future, and that Ireland will have to make its honourable contribution.  Making our contribution with corvettes, we could cause more than loud laughter in the major naval ports of each country.  Now that we have the opportunity, let us hasten to prepare to make a proper contribution.</P>
    <P>Apart from training naval personnel, we must also be in a position to defend our harbours.  A major defence alliance to which we might be asked to contribute&mdash;it may be against the Maoists, and that is most likely because I think Europe east and west will come together eventually&mdash;might ask us are we in a position to defend our harbours. To do it we would need more than fishery trawlers.  I am trying to convey to the Minister in my simple way what I think he should do in regard to naval defence and, may I say with humility, if I can advise him or help him to evaluate the advice he receives from people most of whom I suspect to be landlubbers, I will be very happy to do so.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the sea, I wish to point out that the charts that are functioning today under the Minister's aegis are admiralty charts of more than 50 to 100 years ago.  The Department of Defence are not responsible for the harbours but they are for hydrographic surveys.  In 1968, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Hilliard, through his senior naval officer, indicated that hydrographic charts were the responsibility of the Department of Defence but they had no funds available and were hoping that in the ensuing year they would have such funds.</P>
    <P>It is 50 years since there has been a survey of the sandbanks which are a considerable distance off the coast.  As the Minister may know, we have pretty strong tides off the coast of Ireland, particularly off the east coast and if he wants any confirmation of that he will <Col N="859" /> get it from the fact that when the midget submarine recently came over with the intention of finding the position of the Aer Lingus plane that crashed off the Tuskar Rock, the tides were so rough and the sand eruptions so strong that there was no possibility whatever of their doing the work.</P>
    <P>If the Minister ever comes to my part of the country I will be glad to show him what I mean.  Coming up along the coasts of Wexford and Wicklow and into Dublin he will find there are sandbanks situated three or four miles off the coast which are subject to very high tides.  The drift is north to south and the sand banks are continually changing.</P>
    <P>When I speak about playing our part in the wider European context, whether it is defence or otherwise, everybody will jump on me and say I am trying to rush Ireland into a defence pact.  All I am doing is trying to assert what we should be doing for ourselves. There have been shifts in the sandbanks recently.  Now we have vessels, including ferries, using the channel and 40 or 50 years ago when the sandbanks were surveyed it was done with lead because there were no electronic devices or depth sounders.</P>
    <P>However, they were made and charted but, of course, they have changed since then so that at present we are relying for navigation entirely on the admiralty charts.  The admiralty are not sending their survey ships into our territorial waters.  Therefore, these charts are out of date by fifty or 100 years.  I am putting these points to the Minister as one who claims to have been a sailor.  We are dependent entirely on the Army for anything to do with navigation or with hydrographic surveys but, with the deepest respect, may I say that the Army know nothing of this science nor should they be expected to know anything about it.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the fact that off the west and south coasts there are extensive rocky promontories.  When the survey was made 50 years ago these promontories <Col N="860" /> were not charted.  The survey system used at that time was lead-sounding. This entailed swinging a lead and dropping it down but it was quite possible that, travelling at a fairly low speed, it would not be possible to get an indication of a piece of rock.  I hope that the Minister will bear these few points in mind.</P>
    <P>When I spoke here a week or two ago on the Supplementary Estimate I was ruled out of order, a situation in which I never wish to find myself. However, on that occasion I referred to Army recruiting and I suggested that the Minister should use a different approach to recruiting.  When replying, the Minister was good enough to say that perhaps I would elaborate when the main Estimate came before the House.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that we should keep a strong Army, or at least a strong nucleus, particularly in the uncertain and unhappy conditions in which we live.  It is a well-known fact that when a country goes to war she does not rely so much on her actual army as it exists but on the potential to increase that army.  One Deputy, speaking here this evening, said he was an advocate of conscription.  Personally, I do not advocate conscription because I believe that the individual should be as free as is possible.  At the same time, we are all Irish and, regardless of party affiliations, we owe an obligation to the State to ensure that our shores will be adequately protected, or, speaking militarily, that our territories will be protected.</P>
    <P>Our FCA is a valuable contribution to our reserve forces.  They constitute what is the reserve force in other countries.  I think Britain would call them their territorial division.  To get back to this question of conscription, most European countries have conscription in some form or other, but, as I say, I do not favour conscription in any way.  I do not consider it to be suitable to the Irish temperament. When the British Government were in control here an attempt was made to have conscription but the Irish Parliamentary Party fought that to the last, so it did not come about.  While it is not suitable to the Irish temperament, <Col N="861" /> our people are prepared to accept discipline.</P>
    <P>In most countries there is what is known as a short-service commission. In the democratic age in which we live I would like to see that short-service commission scheme extended to the rank and file.  I would also like to see a recruitment system whereby people would be encouraged to join the Army for a suitable period.  I would advocate a short term service of three or five years with the option to extend it to ten years or, if necessary, an option to continue for the full pension period.  In any case, it should be made worthwhile for those who leave civilian life to go into the Army.  The Minister would probably have to consult with his Ministerial colleagues who would assist him in this field.  In any event, I would suggest that generous gratuities should also be given.</P>
    <P>I note with pleasure that the Minister, in his speech, refers to educational facilities and says that those who joined the Army would be given the opportunity to study in the evenings at a vocational school where they could learn a trade.  The majority of people who enlist in the Army in the lower ranks, privates and so on, come from a section of society who have not had an opportunity of bettering themselves in the labour market.</P>
    <P>It would be of great benefit to these people if the Minister could introduce a scheme whereby he would invite people to join the Army for, say, three or five years, at the same time giving them an opportunity to study.  In that way they would no longer be hewers of wood and drawers of water and they would have an assurance that when they left the Army they would be employable in civilian life.  We are short of trained industrial personnel in this country.  If the Minister introduces a scheme on those lines I have no doubt but that he will get the number of recruits he requires&mdash;and if he should get more than that what harm will it do?  One Deputy said this evening that if some people joined the Army only to have their hair cut and to keep themselves washed, it would do them all the good in the world.</P>
    <P>Discipline is good for all of us; the <Col N="862" /> more disciplined people we have in our society, the better will be that society. It should not be very difficult to work out a scheme on those lines&mdash;a scheme that would probably encourage to join the Army many people who, otherwise, would not have thought of joining. When people leave the Army we should endeavour to ensure that there is a place for them in civilian life.  One of the great problems in regard to these people is the problem of housing.  When they leave the Army they should be housed.</P>
    <P>Obviously they could not be housed in Army houses because they would no longer be serving soldiers or sailors, and so on.  The Minister should make some arrangement with the Minister for Local Government, or whoever it may be, so that when they go back to civilian life not only will they have a job but they will also have housing accommodation.  I venture to say that the Minister would get all the serving personnel he wants.  Quite a lot of people joining the Army with the intention of serving for a short period would probably extend their service and, in many cases, continue right through to the pension period which, I gather, is the difficulty facing the Army at the moment.</P>
    <P>It would not be right for me to sit down without mentioning the value of the FCA.  I do not think this force has been fairly treated.  At one time, they were doing a certain amount of training per year but, on the basis of national economy, that was reduced.  There should be no question of national economy where a man is prepared to serve his country.  A lot of these FCA people serve at considerable inconvenience to themselves.  It is true that they go up only for the annual training. We had an instance of their value recently when there was disruption in this country due to the political situation north of the Border, a matter not relevant now.  A lot of FCA people were called up and served at considerable inconvenience to themselves in an effort to help to settle the unhappy situation existing north of the Border. Greater attention should be paid to the young people who join that force. Greater encouragement to join would <Col N="863" /> be given to them by the Minister for Defence if they knew they would be backed to the hilt in whatever service they would have to give for whatever period it would be necessary for them to give up their work in civilian life.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister is thinking that this is a beautiful dream because he would have to get the requisite funds from the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Defence occupies an important Ministry.  Defence and discipline count in every country.  We live in a queer age.  We live in an age when people howling and screaming on the streets seem to get what they want even if the majority of the people are not in agreement with them.  Anyone who has served in a disciplined force will remain disciplined for the rest of his life.  I commend that thought to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Some aspects of the Department of Defence have adequately been dealt with during the afternoon&mdash;the Army, the FCA and the Old IRA.  I would endorse what Deputy Davern and others said about the Old IRA: no stone should be left unturned where this gallant band of men are concerned to whom we owe everything.  I am quite sure the Minister will promote their cause at all times.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the Equitation School.  The Minister mentioned that a sum of £47,000 was spent in the past two years on the purchase of horses for this school.  This is a very tiny sum when we consider the prices horses are making on the open market.  This is particularly so when we are dealing with what may be described as the shop window for many of our horse-breeders. Those in question here are the farmers who breed the hunter type of horse and show jumpers, which concern the Army.  The breeders of thoroughbred horses need no advertisement. Today, our national hunt horses were first and second in the blue riband for 'chasing.  The people all over the western and southern counties who breed hunters are very much dependent on show-jumping and on the name we make for ourselves abroad at horse shows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Looking back to the pre-war days of Captain Corry and Commandant Ahearne, who established our Irish horses as being the greatest jumpers in the world, and comparing that situation with the present position, we must ask ourselves some searching questions. In the immediate years after the intervention of the war, we again did pretty well even up to about 1954.  The late Captain Tubridy, a county man of my own, brought many honours to the nation through his horsemanship.</P>
    <P>For eight or nine years immediately after the war we were in the forefront and then, from the mid-1950s onwards, we began to fade into oblivion.  Around that time, show-jumping became more fashionable.  More people were prepared to buy horses for their sons or daughters or to back people able to ride these horses.  Our Department of Defence refused to see the writing on the wall and we were left with second-or third-rate jumpers.  From 1955 to the present day, only one animal has brought any fame to this country&mdash;&ldquo;Loch an Easpaig&rdquo;, which unfortunately has died.  At the moment the Army are bereft of first-class jumpers. Down the years, there were opportunities for the Army to purchase animals such as &ldquo;Goodbye&rdquo; and so on.  Many of them found their way to Italy and other countries.  The d'Inzeo brothers from Italy and English jumping teams have been coming to the show grounds at Ballsbridge and sweeping the decks there with horses born and reared in Ireland, horses which passed through the hands of Irish trainers and were then sold for substantial prices.</P>
    <P>It would be far better if the Minister allowed a sum of at least £100,000 to the Army Equitation School for the purchase of maybe five or six horses of five, six or seven years of age which show the requisite promise and which are to be found in our show rings&mdash; horses whose owners cannot afford to go abroad because the prize money is too small.  With half-a-dozen top-class jumpers, the Minister would have the nucleus of a jumping team that would last many years.  Unlike thoroughbreds, show jumpers can go on to 16 or 17 years.  &ldquo;Dundrum&rdquo; is around 15 years <Col N="865" /> of age and &ldquo;Foxhunter&rdquo; and many other show jumpers went on until nearly 20 years of age.  We should provide a sufficient sum of money to purchase six or more animals of the right type for our purpose rather than allow them to be sold to other countries and to bring fame to those other countries when they are brought back to jump here, year after year, and to hammer us.  Some years ago, we won the Aga Khan Trophy with a combined civilian and Army team.  I think only one Army horse was fit to take its place on that team&mdash;&ldquo;Loch an Easpaig&rdquo;&mdash;which has now passed on.</P>
    <P>It would indeed gladden the hearts of most Irishmen to see a properly equipped Army team going abroad and winning as a team on the Continent and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Not only would that bring fame to the Irish team and the nation but it could also bring riches to the small farmers in the west of Ireland who breed these horses.  They are the life blood of show jumping.  Small farmers are the people who breed The Strollers and the Mr. Softees and the other famous horses.  This is one section of our economy which gets little or no subsidy. The only subsidy involved, which I am sure is a very small sum, is the subsidy once a year from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries towards nominations.  These people would know that there would be a better market for their horses if they were jumping for Ireland because many of the horses which went abroad in the past were deemed to belong to other nations.  I remember seeing in one of the Irish daily papers, after Mr. Softee first won the championship of Europe, &ldquo;the English-bred Mr. Softee&rdquo;.  They got away with it for a year or so but in time it was proved that Mr. Softee was bred near a little village called Mullagh in County Clare by two old bachelors who kept one mare and a few cows.  In time it was pointed out to these newspapers that Mr. Softee was Irish-bred.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take a long hard look at the Equitation School.  It has been there for a number of years.  People are continually criticising <Col N="866" /> the Army jumping team, whether the Minister knows it or not.  I hear it every year at the time of the Horse Show.  People ask what has happened to our Army jumping team.  There is only one reason why the Army jumping team are in the state they are in today and that is lack of money.  They were not given the money to buy the horses which could jump properly. They had to go around giving a few thousand pounds or perhaps £1,500 for green horses that knew nothing about jumping.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that the Equitation School can go into the right market where the Italians and the English go in this country, to the people who have horses of five and six years of age which have shown their ability in provincial shows and even in some of the minor competitions in Ballsbridge.  They should be able to pay even five figures if necessary.  They will then get the article of which we can all be proud.  I want to make this special plea on behalf of the Army jumping team and, more important, on behalf of the small farmers who breed this type of horse, the show jumper and the hunter.  These are the less well off people in the &ldquo;horsey&rdquo; world.  The Vincent O'Briens and the Raymond Guests race for thousands of pounds.  They do all right and so do most people with any luck in racing.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to statements made about civil defence. Deputy Dr. Byrne stated that the civil defence people knew virtually nothing about their business and that they were not trained adequately.  This is not true.  I am a former member of the civil defence organisation.  I was an assistant warden.  I attended lectures for 13 weeks on end and we received a very adequate course of lectures.  We might not be able to protect ourselves against an atom bomb or a hydrogen bomb but at least we were taught how to protect ourselves from fall-out and to teach other people to protect themselves. The civil defence programme is very worthwhile.  Anyone who knows anything about it, or who has taken any interest in it, realises that a lot of excellent work was done by the people who look after civil defence.  There are people in Ireland today who could protect themselves from fall-out who <Col N="867" /> did not even know what it was a few years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose my connection with the Defence Forces began when I was at the age of 18 months and my father became Minister for Defence.  It ended a quarter of a century ago when I felt that with the end of the war in Europe I could safely resign from the LDF without endangering the security of the country Therefore, I cannot speak from anything like the fund of experience from which some members of the House are able to speak on many aspects of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I should like to consider briefly the question of defence policy.  One of the problems in this debate is that, because of the many functions of the Defence Forces, the many functions which many members of this House see them as fulfilling, some of them actual functions and some of them hypothetical functions, the debate tends to be somewhat dispersed, and the amount of discussion about the role of the Defence Forces is perhaps less than the problem deserves.  We heard from the last speaker some useful and relevant remarks on the subject of show jumping.  Others have spoken with equal relevance on the subject of fishery protection.  Others visualise the principal role of the Defence Forces as keeping the hair of young people short, a view expressed on both sides of the House in a bi-partisan manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Behind these different activities, actual or hypothetical, there must lie some purpose, some primary purpose or purposes, for which our Defence Forces exist.  I wonder where one can in fact find these.  From my limited reading of military affairs I have the impression that the way an army works, or any defence force works, is that they are alloted a task to fulfil. They then assess in a professional manner their requirements in order to fulfil this task, their requirements in terms of men and in terms of material. They tell their political masters what these requirements are.  Their political masters then decide whether they will provide the resources to fulfil the task <Col N="868" /> they had set or whether, in the light of the resources required and the extent of those resources, they will revise the targets and change the purpose of the defence forces in question. Out of this process emerges eventually or should emerge an army or a navy or an air force as the case may be which is designed and equipped to fulfil the function which it is intended by the political decision-makers in the country concerned to fulfil.</P>
    <P>I am not clear as to what, in fact, are the purposes of our Defence Forces. It is quite clear that they came into existence originally to secure our independence. It is quite clear why they had to remain in existence on a rather large scale for a year or two afterwards. That is not a matter I wish to go into here.  It has not been clear, however, as the years passed precisely what functions they were intended to fulfil.  It is clear that they have more than one function.  I wonder have these functions been defined.  Where can one find what these functions are, and to what extent have the tasks of the Defence Forces been posed to them by the political authorities?  To what extent have the Defence Forces assessed their requirements of men and materials to fulfil these functions and to what extent does there exist here a defence policy consisting of a statement of aim, a statement of the means required, and a policy decision to provide those means?</P>
    <P>Among the functions which defence forces could have and which would seem to me to be relevant and possible functions of our Defence Forces&mdash;and I am not aware that they are anywhere defined&mdash;are the following.  First of all they provide a cadre of experienced professional people who would, because of their training, be able in an emergency to be expanded rapidly, bringing in reservists on the one hand and recruits on the other, and training them rapidly to the point where they could fulfil the relevant and adequate defence functions.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that our Defence Forces in the 1930s were maintained in such a manner as to fulfil this function. We all know how remarkably that was done and how the very small <Col N="869" /> Army of the 1930s&mdash;I forget the exact number in it; it was somewhat larger than it is now but by any standards it was small&mdash;was expanded very rapidly, very efficiently, and very effectively, in a short space of time, to become an Army of 50,000 men with three divisions and other units, an Army capable, even with its limited armaments, of defending this country against certain kinds of attack.  Of course, compared with the great forces that existed in the world at that time, it was not adequate to withstand a major attack by any major power.</P>
    <P>It was adequate to make any power think twice about invading this country because an invasion would take time to succeed.  It would require forces to be diverted from other jobs that had to be done and this meant that our security was maintained in a way that might not otherwise have been possible. It is at least arguable that had we not had our Defence Forces at that time, our Army of 50,000 men and our Local Defence Force of 200,000 men, at some point or another one of the belligerents might have been tempted to intervene here for their own purposes, feeling they could do so with impunity, but the existence of these forces made it difficult.</P>
    <P>It is possible that at some point, for example, the British and American forces in Northern Ireland might have been tempted to intervene because of their belief that the existence of a neutral country was dangerous to their security.  However, at no time were there sufficient forces in Northern Ireland to carry this out on a successful basis with the forces available there because of the existence of our Defence Forces.  To have intervened in that way would have required considerable strengthening of the American and British forces in Northern Ireland, a strengthening which would have diverted men at a critical moment, which would have delayed the opening of the Second Front.  The existence of three ill-equipped but well-trained and determined divisions here could well, in those circumstances, have saved us from an invasion at that time, which, quite apart from the immediate impact, would have set back relations between <Col N="870" /> ourselves and Britain and America by a generation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the idea of defence forces as a cadre of experienced, trained men to be expanded rapidly in time of emergency is one which at least at that time was relevant.  It is probably still relevant, although it is difficult to be dogmatic about what kind of defence forces are relevant against the possibilities of nuclear war.</P>
    <P>Another function of defence forces is clearly that of internal security.  In a country like ours, which has had the tradition right from the very depths of the period of the Civil War of an unarmed police force not involved in the maintenance of internal security where this involves the use of arms, the Defence Forces have a special role to play.  There are other countries which have well-armed police forces which are capable of dealing with most internal emergencies which would threaten the security of the state internally. This is not our tradition.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, within the police force a body of men, the Special Branch, who have an intelligence function in regard to internal subversion. If attacked, arms could be issued to them and during the war they did have to defend themselves against attack and some of them were killed. However, their main function is one of intelligence and normal police work and arms are used or issued only in very special circumstances for very temporary purposes.</P>
    <P>This division of functions here is, I think, the right division of functions. The function of intelligence <i>vis-à-vis</i> internal subversion is the function of the police, because the less an army is involved in that to the degree that it might be unnecessary the better.  The function of dealing with internal subversion, if it requires the use of arms, is a function of the Army and not the police.  Most other countries have some other variant but I think we have the right combination here, with our Army as a force on which to fall back in the event of internal subversion requiring armed defence, if that is the right solution.  Our Army performs a useful potential function in that way, not that it has ever had to be used for that purpose, or that it is ever likely to be used <Col N="871" /> the Government&mdash;we do not know for that purpose but its existence makes it improbable that the kind of contingency could arise which it would then have to deal with.  That is an important function for which we require a defence force of a certain kind, of a certain strength and with certain limited armament.</P>
    <P>Another function which is relevant in modern conditions is to be able to provide units for United Nations peace-keeping forces, a function particularly appropriate to a country which, while it has its views in relation to various international disputes and is not necessarily neutral in every case, is, nevertheless, not a member of any military bloc and whose forces, therefore, are acceptable in places like the Middle East, Cyprus and the Congo.  It is right that we should have defence forces of a character and scale and with the kind of training which enables them to carry out this function.  In this way we do our duty to the world, making the limited kind of contribution we can in this regard.  At the same time it has the advantage of offering to our armed forces opportunities to try out the skills they have learned under conditions different from those at home.</P>
    <P>In the years ahead our Defence Forces may have a further function.  If we become members of the European Economic Community and if&mdash;this is a different &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;the European Economic Community develops a political and defence policy, we could be called upon at some stage to play some part in defending that community against external aggression.  We should be giving some thought to the extent to which our Defence Forces as they exist at present are capable of transformation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question arises as to whether our Defence Forces are of such a character that they could be evolved into forces which could play a part in a defence community in tion to contingency planning an imme-Europe. <Col N="872" /> This is not, perhaps, in reladiate issue but presumably this is something which should be considered.</P>
      <P>Another question arises, and I phrase this differently from the way I phrased what I have said hitherto.  The things I have spoken about hitherto are things which seem to me to be appropriate aims and objectives for our Defence Forces.  What I speak about now does not seem to be such an objective.  There is a question which has been raised by some voices from the Government benches as to whether our Defence Forces should be used not for purposes of defence but for other purposes across the Border.  This question has raised itself in two ways. One issue upon which we have had, perhaps, a measure of clarification, if not complete clarification, has been that of using them at some point to end Partition; that is, by an act of aggression the Six Counties would be seized and held by a new form of conquest by our armed forces.  That is a question upon which there seems to have been, rather reluctantly from some Ministers, clarification, suggesting that this is not, in fact, an objective of Government policy or the policy of particular Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second issue as to whether in the event of a situation arising similar to that in Northern Ireland last August our Defence Forces should be used to intervene in order to protect part of the population in Northern Ireland.  This is a separate issue on which we have had a clear statement from a Government Minister&mdash;which has never been withdrawn but which has been frequently repeated despite the apparently contrary view of the head of the Government&mdash;that our Defence Forces should, in certain circumstances, be used in this way.  This is a matter on which we need clarification.  I can think of no better person than the Minister for Defence of whom to ask a question of this kind&mdash;whether this is an object of contingency planning, whether he shares the view of another member of the Government that this is a proper function of the Defence Forces and whether he views the force as being required for that purpose?  This is certainly the policy of some members of <Col N="873" /> how many because on that issue we have had different views from different people but, as a number appear neutral on this matter, we do not know the weight of opinion in the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to raise the question here as to whether the Minister visualises our Army having this function of intervention.  If he does, he should state the circumstances; are we confined to intervening as part of a UN force, at the instance of the British authorities or on our own independent initiative?  We should be told the opinion of both factions in the Government on this matter.  I do not think this is a proper function for our Defence Forces, to intervene outside the boundaries of the State as constituted, save as part of a UN force or with the consent of the particular country concerned.  This is true of Northern Ireland as it is true elsewhere but the matter should be clarified.</P>
    <P>Given however that our Defence Forces have the functions I first specified, and leaving out this matter which I have just mentioned as one I would hope the Government and the Minister would deem inappropriate, are our Defence Forces as at present constituted appropriate for these aims? Assuming that the Defence Forces have the function of providing a cadre to be expanded in time of emergency or war, even if they have an internal security function, given that they have a function to serve as peace-keeping forces in the UN and that they may develop in some way to play their part in a European community, are our forces appropriate?</P>
    <P>Am I correct in assuming that these are the objectives of our Defence Forces and, if not, will the Minister please state what are the objectives?  If these are the objectives can the Minister say whether the Defence Forces, as at present equipped and manned, are able to secure these objectives and if not, what conclusions have the Government drawn?  A debate on this subject should deal with these fundamentals as well as with the accidentals like show jumping and fishery protection and the accidentals of the long-haired students which were raised on both sides of the House.  From what little knowledge I <Col N="874" /> have it is clear to me that our forces lack either the strength or the arms to fulfil adequately some of these functions but if we are not clear of what the Army's own view is in regard to their resources it makes the debate difficult. In opening the debate the Minister should have spoken in broad terms about our defence policy rather than leave it to be raised during the debate.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points I wish to make.  First, regarding the question of fishery protection, I am not entirely convinced that this is a function of the Defence Forces.  Given that the resources of the Defence Forces are extraordinarily limited, there is a conflict between the interests of the Defence Forces <i>qua</i> Defence Forces as regards the type of naval equipment they require and the interests of fishery protection.  Deputy Esmonde made this point in his speech.  If the Defence Forces are to provide even a nucleus of an ultimate naval defence force with trained people they must have vessels of a genuine naval character on which to train.  In his intervention the Minister suggested that the type of vessel mentioned would cost £6 million.  This may explain why we have not got such a vessel.  Given that the cost of the smaller units required for this kind of training function is so great and that the resources allocated to our Defence Forces are so small, it is inevitable that, given the choice between adequate fishery protection and fulfilling their basic function of providing training for a cadre of naval officers, the Defence Forces should tend to favour vessels of a kind which are costly to the point where we cannot have many of them and whose design may not be related to the needs of fishery protection.</P>
    <P>From what I have heard recently it appears some thought is being given to buying one vessel for the naval service which might provide adequate means of training people.  However, one, two, or three such vessels are totally inadequate for fishery protection work.  In dealing with this question of protection the Government acts as if we did not live on an island with an extensive coastline.  It is impossible for a small number of vessels to protect our coastline and this fact is well <Col N="875" /> known to the fishermen of other countries and with the extension of our fishing limits the area is even greater.</P>
    <P>The needs of fishery protection would best be met by having a number of vessels located around the coast. They need not be very fast because the vessels they would be chasing would not be very fast; they need not be powerfully armed because one machine gun would deter most fishermen from trying to get away and they need not be very big because a vessel large enough to carry a man and a machine gun is all that is needed.  This is what we need for fishery protection work but what we need for naval training is quite different.  For this purpose we would need perhaps a frigate or a corvette. I am not an expert on this matter so I do not know how many would be required.</P>
    <P>These two functions are totally distinct and it is understandable, if regrettable, that our Defence Forces, forced to choose between those two functions, should choose what they consider most important in fulfilling their primary purpose.  It is because the Government have allocated the function of fishery protection to the Defence Forces and have not provided them with adequate resources that we are now faced with inadequacies in our fishery protection work.  The opinion, of experts in the industry is that we should have vessels situated at perhaps five points around our coast.  These vessels might not be much more than fishing vessels themselves&mdash;perhaps with slightly faster engines&mdash;with a crew of half-a-dozen, including local people who would know the area and who would be readily available.  This might best be done perhaps under the auspices of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara with a few naval officers lent by the Defence Forces.  Perhaps it could be done by the Defence Forces but past experience has shown us that this need has not been met.  My experience of administration suggests that where one has administrative structures in which there are pressures against meeting a need because of another need appearing more relevant, it is best to transfer a particular function to another administrative <Col N="876" /> area rather than to wait hopefully year after year and decade after decade for the function to be performed within the administrative area in which it is mislocated.  The Minister should reconsider the position.  Perhaps it is not the function of the Minister to consider whether or not this is something that should be carried out in his Department, but the Government should consider it and I sincerely hope they will.</P>
    <P>Within the Department itself there are problems of administration which have been highlighted by the Devlin Report.  Some of the comments are very striking.  One of the things that struck me in particular is the reference in paragraph 23.1.4 to a council of defence &ldquo;to aid and counsel the Minister on all matters in relation to the business of the Department of Defence on which the Minister may consult the Council&rdquo;.  That council consists of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the secretary of the department, the chief of staff, the adjutant-general and the quartermaster-general. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Department is also the Secretary of the Council of Defence.  We understand that meetings, in fact, occur only infrequently.</P>
    <P>One notes in regard to this particular body that three of the five people are, in fact, members of the Defence Forces, one is a politician and one is a civil servant.  Now the report says that commission understands that meetings, in fact, occur only infrequently. I wonder why they occur infrequently. Is it, perhaps, that the Department of Defence does not like the idea of the Minister being advised by a body on which three of the people concerned are professional military people, putting him in the position in which the advice offered to him is no longer offered to him through the Department of Defence?  If that is not the reason, could we be told the reason why this body does, in fact, meet only infrequently? Surely it is the kind of body we ought to have.  It could fulfil a useful function.  It was established under the Act of 1954 and we would <Col N="877" /> like to know why, in fact, it is not operating.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations are quite simple and to the point.  The council of defence should meet regularly.  It should be the means whereby the members of the council have both the collective duty of advising the Minister on matters relevant to the Department of Defence and the individual responsibility of carrying out the resulting decisions within their own spheres.  That makes very clear how our defence affairs should be run and how, indeed, they are run in other countries where they are not quite so much in the grip of the civilian side as is our Department of Defence.  I recognise that, if one did some historical research, one might find the reason for this type of civilian control and why the Minister is not advised by such a body, even if it is there to advise him.  We might find that the reason why we have this tradition of keeping the Army at arm's length and channelling advice through civilian advisers may well lie in our own history and I may well be told by the Minister that this originated at the time when my father was Minister for Defence and when he had the task of bringing the Army fully under control so that, when the time came for a democratic change of government, the people whom we had defeated a few years earlier would not attempt to intervene in this democratic process. There may also have been a problem of extravagance, and so on, in the ordering of supplies carried over from the Civil War period.  I recognise that. It may be that this goes back to the `Twenties and the early' Thirties, but the time has now come to have a more modern and normal system of administration and I should like the Minister's views on this recommendation of the Devlin Report.</P>
    <P>The other striking feature is the duplication of functions between the military and the civilian side of the Defence Forces.  In paragraph 23.3.1 the report says:</P>
    <P>The administrative procedures of the Department of Defence are based on a rigorous interpretation of the requirements of civilian control, <Col N="878" /> and of financial supervision by the civil side of the Department. This has resulted in a dual structure, consisting of a Secretariat and a General Headquarters, in which there is extensive duplication of function.</P>
    <P>The duplication of function is perhaps most extensive in the areas of procurement, contract administration, and stores accounting and auditing.</P>
    <P>Efficiency would be enhanced if this dual structure were eliminated, while adequate provisions were made to provide for supervision of financial estimates and expenditures.  The recommendations in the next section of this chapter provide for a merging of the military and civilian functions in a new executive unit for supply.</P>
    <P>These are rather strong statements about duplication of function and the Minister should, I think, tell us what his views are on this.  Here we have had an investigation carried out by an expert group, with the help of consultants from abroad, consultants whose employment caused some controversy, some of it unnecessary, I think, and we have had this report based on these domestic and external studies and those responsible for the report have found this serious defect in the Department, this extensive duplication of function which is having a bad effect on efficiency.  The report states that efficiency would be enhanced if the dual structure were eliminated and the proposal is that these functions should be merged.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not hide, as other Ministers have attempted to do, behind the statement that the report is being considered by the Government and is, therefore, <i>sub judice.</i> We have had this experience in a number of cases.  I do not think this position should be sustained.  I can quite understand that the Government are making up their minds on the crucial basic positions, the establishment of a public service department and the creation of a branch in each Department with responsibility for policy, separated to some degree from the executive units. This is a basic issue.  There are also <Col N="879" /> basic issues of recruitment policy and the Government are quite properly making up their minds on this and, perhaps, in the Budget Statement they will give us some indications of Government policy.  I do not expect the Minister to anticipate but, in cases where criticisms are made of a Department and its methods of operation, the Minister has an obligation to answer criticisms made here and to indicate whether he is looking into them, with a view to effecting changes, or whether he is entirely satisfied with the present position.  I hope the Minister will say something about that when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters in relation to which I should like to support the advice expressed by both sides of the House.  One relates to pensions for the widows of Old IRA.  The absence of these seems to me to be a particularly unfortunate omission from our system of pensions and I urge that something be done about it.  Of its nature it could not be very costly at this stage.  Secondly, I support what has been said about arrangements to resettle members of the Defence Forces on retirement.  Our provisions are at the moment inadequate.  We are not as well organised as they are in other countries.  The members of our Defence Forces are owed the same debt of gratitude for their services as are the members of defence forces in other countries and we have the same obligation as other countries to look after our Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister will tackle this problem immediately in conjunction with the Department of Labour.  Now that we have a Department of Labour actively involved in this question of resettlement and retraining it should be easy to tackle this matter and I hope that this time next year we will hear of genuine progress made in this particular direction.</P>

      <P>Since I come from Kildare it is only right that I should contribute to this debate.  Last week I had a little run in with Deputy O'Higgins and he said it was essential that I should stand up here and speak <Col N="880" /> so that he would know me.  I have often looked across at the sweet smile of Deputy O'Higgins and there may be another reason why I am not so well known to him.</P>
      <P>We should not skimp on the Estimate for the Department of Defence.  I agree with the Minister that the object of the Department of Defence is to defend the State against aggression.  It is also essential from the point of view of internal security and in case of emergency.  The Defence Forces are doing magnificent work at the moment guarding installations throughout the country.  This is the kind of work that is not really appreciated unless something happens which makes the headlines.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with just a few items.  One is the recruiting drive.  Up to now recruiting in our Army has been of the &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; variety.  We have made sudden bursts to recruit Army personnel.  On other occasions there has been a falling-off and word has got around that recruits are not required. This may have been due to the fact that we allow only a limited number of recruits into our Army.  We should allow a more ample tolerance and not limit the number to 7,000.  We should go to 7,500 and there would be a free movement of recruits at all times into the Army.  Our recruits are often drawn from villages where local lads join the Army and are followed by others who see them at home on leave.  If the word goes round that recruits are not being accepted, the natural flow into the Army stops. If recruits were allowed in at all times there would be no need for a crash recruiting drive at any time.</P>
      <P>The time has come when married men should be allowed to join the Army.  A single man can join and can be married within a month.  Life in the Army can present a good opportunity for a man.  I know several married men who would like to join the Army.</P>
      <P>The Minister has admitted that he is an &ldquo;inshore&rdquo; Deputy.  I am also an inshore Deputy.  I do not propose to deal with the navy or the corvettes.  I do not know much about such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nice to know that officers can <Col N="881" /> be recruited from the non-commissioned ranks.  Some years ago this was so, and some of our best officers came up through the ranks.  The fact that officers are being recruited from the non-commissioned ranks is a great morale boost to the people involved. They realise that the Army is not a dead-end and that they need not stop at the rank of sergeant or sergeant major.  Through my association with the vocational education committee in Kildare I am aware of the opportunities for advancement in education which are available to Army personnel now.  The personnel availing of these opportunities will benefit considerably. This education should be available at other levels.  Many people could avail of education from primary level upwards. A person might have left primary school and joined the Army at an early age.  At a more mature age he might realise that the loss in his education could be made up if he got an opportunity.  I hope the Minister will make provision for such a person, with the aid of the local vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>We have a defence committee in our party.  I am a member of this committee and we visited the Army apprentice school at Naas.  We saw there the work which was being carried out and the fine tradesmen and craftsmen produced there.  We saw also that a new block is badly needed there to house soldiers.  This accommodation has been promised at Naas and I hope it will be forthcoming soon.  The attitude of the Labour Party to this defence committee is one of making our Defence Forces the object of a sneer and a jibe. Deputy Coogan asked the Minister, when he made known the members of that committee, why we did not join the Army.  Deputy Dowling and Deputy Nolan were in the Army during the emergency.  I, in my own way, did my stint with the FCA.  Our reserve force deserve every support.  They would benefit from a tighter organisation to ensure continuous training culminating in a fortnight in camp every year.  Great benefit would accrue to those who would undergo this training.  Discipline would be improved also.</P>
    <P>I feel there could be a tie-up between <Col N="882" /> the school of equitation and the proposed new Bord na gCapall.  If the Minister is looking for an ideal site and the Minister responsible for Bord na gCapall wonders where he might site that board he should not pass the artillery barracks at Kildare.  There are fine facilities there for housing personnel and the Curragh would provide an unrivalled training ground for the horses.  The Minister is right in not stinting the money on something which is providing us with world-wide publicity. The proximity of Kildare to the national stud and the headquarters of the racing industry would be a help also.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to building houses.  Some of our married quarters need modernisation.  Soldiers leaving the Army find it difficult to get houses. The local authorities help these men. There are overholders on the Curragh. If some NBA scheme were introduced whereby serving soldiers could purchase houses it would be a tremendous help to them.  There should be no great problem in acquiring sites at the Curragh.  A soldier leaving after 21 years' service could then have a house of his own.  While men are overholders they are not allowed to get a Government job when they leave the Army and their pensions are held over also.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence force are doing a very good job.  They receive tremendous help from the Army personnel. With the aid of the Army they are doing a good job within the limits within which they must work.  The Minister referred to the Army being integrated into the community in which they live and becoming part of the social life.  Around the Curragh, Kildare and Newbridge I can assure the Minister that the Army personnel are part and parcel of the life of the ordinary people.  It is accepted there that when any event is being organised, and the Army have anything to do with it, they do a very good job.</P>
    <P>We should do everything we can to boost the morale of the Army.  The visits of the Army to the Congo and to Cyprus contributed greatly to morale. We should do our best to keep up the numbers in the Army.  An army without men is a very soul-destroying <Col N="883" /> thing.  We should allow married men to join.  We should not limit recruiting. If we do this we will have no difficulty with our numbers.  We should equip our Army to the limit of our resources. We should show our Defence Forces that we are proud of them and that we are prepared to provide ample money for them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his new Ministry.  I feel he is doing a good job.  The Army personnel in Kildare would agree that the Minister is a soldier's man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Power, I am an &ldquo;inshore&rdquo; man.  I am not going to speak about our Defence Forces. Most people today have spoken about the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army, Deputy Clinton referred to the FCA saying that in the recent St. Patrick's Day parade they were a sloppy lot.  I am glad the Deputy was taken to task on that by Deputy Tully. It is unfair for a parliamentarian to refer to the FCA in such a way.  We must remember that the FCA are volunteer soldiers.  They are men who give their time after their day's work to a certain amount of training.  They often forfeit their holidays to go to the various camps and train as soldiers. I often admire the men of the FCA for the excellent manner in which they turn out on parade despite the small amount of training they get.  In my own town last Sunday I was very proud to see the local battalion in the parade. They were a fine lot, quite in keeping with Army tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of free education we now have many young boys aged 15 or 16 who would be available for three months in the summer for Army services.  If the conditions of the FCA were extended so that those young boys could go to a military camp, get three month's military training and be paid at the rate of ordinary private soldiers, not alone would it keep them off the streets but it would be excellent training for them.  As the Minister himself said, Army training, discipline and the comradeship that goes with it would be excellent for those young boys.  Not only could they <Col N="884" /> attend in their fifth year, the year before they do their Leaving Certificate examination but possibly subsequently, when they have completed the examination and before they go to the university, they could do a further period of training if they so wished.  You could form an excellent second-line reserve from those young men.</P>
    <P>I am aware, and so are many Deputies, that when June comes and the examinations are over or, in fifth year when boys are waiting to go to technical colleges or waiting to continue their studies for Leaving Certificate, they are looking for jobs; and what better way could you have of training them than to extend the FCA conditions of service and get the boys into some of our military camps and train them?  I am very keen on this aspect of the FCA and it is one of the reasons why I am speaking tonight. This is something that could form the nucleus of an excellent reserve.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have had representations from members of the First-Line Reserve in regard to the reserve grant.  I do not know when the grant was introduced but it has not been increased since before the emergency. Probably Deputy Dowling will agree with me in that.  Costs, wages, dividends and profits have gone up in these years but the retainer for officers, NCOs and men has not been increased. It should be increased and, possibly, before a man is placed on the First-Line Reserve we should be more selective in choosing officers, NCOs and men to make sure they will be good reservists.  It is true that a number of people go on the reserve and that is the end of it.  They may come up for training once or twice but they usually go away.  Some excellent officers have left the Army&mdash;I knew them myself&mdash; who would not remain on the reserve because of the small retainer.  Very often, I am sorry to say, it is those who are not of great service to the Army who remain.  It is time we examined this problem of the reserve grant to see if it can be increased.</P>
    <P>We have had complaints about Army barracks all over the country and living conditions for our soldiers. We have a number of military barracks <Col N="885" /> in this city which were built by an occupying power, possibly as a means of defence against the natives, as they called them then.  I see no reason why we could not sell at least five or six of those barracks and build one good barracks with the money so obtained. I appreciate that it is easy to suggest that we can throw another few million into building barracks.  The Minister has a big problem, and so have the Government, in providing capital for building barracks, providing naval vessels and supplying aircraft for the Air Corps and so on, but this is one way in which we could get extra capital to plough back into the Army in the form of better barracks and better living conditions for our soldiers.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned private soldiers in this context because the time has come when a private soldier who has given faithful service is entitled to have at least a cubicle of his own, or a room, instead of having to go in with eight or ten other people. I shall not detain the House longer except to compliment my colleague, Deputy Gibbons and congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Defence.  I am sure he will do some of the things that many Deputies have asked should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not usually speak on this Vote but from this side of the House I should like to pay another tribute to the Army.  We have a small Army and fortunately it has not been called on to defend the country in any major way yet but, as a speaker on this side of the House said earlier, if such an occasion arose during a major war our Army would certainly be in a position to carry out holding tactics until, perhaps, help arrived.  Our Army has never lacked skill or courage.  Foreign observers have testified to the excellence of the training of our soldiers.</P>
      <P>When I occupied an official position some years ago in this city I came in contact with the Army frequently, both officers and other ranks, and I was greatly struck by the quality of those in all ranks of the Army and the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we are doing much less than <Col N="886" /> justice to our Naval Service.  This is an island and we are all anxious to see fisheries extended.  The harvest lying around our coasts could be very rich and the Irish people, through the Government, have many times shown their desire that the fishing industry should be expanded.  It is being slowly and steadily improved through the years but we have not yet sufficient naval ships to keep our inshore fishing free from marauding foreign trawlers.  We have not sufficient corvettes or naval vessels for the tasks we require them to do.  This need, unfortunately, is not being met at present.</P>
    <P>I know that this is very frustrating to our naval force and I would urge on the Minister the necessity of keeping up the service, not only for the purpose of maintaining the morale of these men but also in order to protect our fishing industry, which could be a great deal bigger than it is.  I hope that in the near future the Minister will expand this section of the naval force as being something vitally necessary for the wellbeing of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>I should again like to say that all of us feel proud of our small Army. On the occasions when the Army has served abroad, in the Congo, in Cyprus and other places, it has carried out its duties very nobly.  All Irish people are proud of the work which the Army did and of the reputation which it established for all ranks of our military forces.  I hope the Minister will continue to maintain that high standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate a few of the matters that were the subject of discussion here recently on a Supplementary Estimate.  I do not want to traverse the whole ground and I have no desire to prolong the debate except for the purpose of mentioning again some of the matters in order to get clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the questions that were discussed in the course of the debate on the Supplementary Estimate was the decision taken during the period which followed the distrubances in the North of Ireland last August.  At that time the Government took certain decisions, <Col N="887" /> mainly to station troops adjacent to the Border for the purpose of establishing there field hospitals.  Some concern was expressed at the time that a matter of this sort was decided on without any prior discussion or consultation with the other parties in the House.  In view of the fact that the House was not then sitting, it was not possible to announce the decision in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I feel that in a matter of this sort it is vital that responsible elected Deputies of the Opposition or of other parties should be informed.  It is true that the Opposition was informed after the event.  I mention that because I think that it is essential in a matter of this sort that whatever action is taken reflects the decision of the nation in the fullest sense.  Some comments were made at the time, mainly I think because of a possible misunderstanding of the actual functions which it was intended that the troops would carry out.  We hope such circumstances will not recur but in the unlikely event of such a situation developing it is essential that full consultation should take place.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view recently and want to reiterate now that the primary function of the Army in peace time is to come to the aid of the civil power.  While we have been fortunate enough on all occasions here since the State was established, or certainly shortly after it was established, to be able to depend with confidence on the Garda to maintain order, it is essential that in the event of circumstances warranting it the Army should be available to assist in the preservation and maintenance of law and order.  For these reasons it is important that the Army should be not merely a contented Army but an Army whose contentment is based on satisfaction with pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a great deal of discussion as a result of the findings of the Conroy Commission in respect of Garda pay and conditions and today I put a question to the Minister concerning the establishing of adequate representation for Army personnel, officers, NCOs and men, in respect of <Col N="888" /> pay and conditions.  The Minister replied that the question of pay and conditions was at present being reviewed but that it was not considered necessary to establish a body that would have on it representation from the Army side.</P>
    <P>I think that is a re-statement of the traditional view in respect of this matter.  This undoubtedly was the accepted policy in the past but there have been many changes.  Twenty or 25 years ago there was no conciliation and arbitration machinery for the Civil Service.  Pay and conditions were decided by a Minister or by the Government after they had considered the claims that were made or the changes, if any, that had occurred in the cost of living.  Since the establishment of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service, for teachers, for various categories of public officials, a very remarkable change has taken place in the attitude to these matters and that has been follewed by the application of similar conciliation and arbitration machinery over the whole range of employment, with a few isolated exceptions.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Conroy Commission and the thorough and exhaustive manner in which that commission investigated pay and conditions in the Garda has recently been commented upon favourably in the House.  There has been a decision by the Government to implement the Conroy Commission Report in respect of pay and allowances and steps have been taken to implement other aspects in respect of conditions, hours of duty, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come for the Army to be given representation. During the debate on the Supplementary Estimate I said I thought it was not necessary to establish a commission but I think it is right that Army personnel of all ranks should have a voice in the discussions on pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>A number of matters arose during the discussion of the Supplementary Estimate.  Apparently NCOs and men do not qualify for gratuities when leaving the service even though Board of Works personnel who work in Army <Col N="889" /> barracks side by side with soldiers are entitled to gratuities on retirement.  I understood from the Minister's reply to the Supplementary Estimate that the payment of disturbance allowances to officers who have to move are being considered.  I believe these matters and many more can only adequately be brought to the Minister's attention if Army personnel have the right to present their point of view, not necessarily directly to the Minister but through some kind of advisory section.</P>
    <P>I believe the standard and quality of Army personnel is exceptionally high in all ranks.  A development in recent times has been the number of early retirements and this is a matter of concern from two angles: first, because of the State expense involved in training these personnel.  Secondly, because of the limited prospects of promotion, many men opt out at an early stage and take up civilian employment.  There is a demand in civilian life for the qualifications which these men have and I think this emphasises the importance of reconsidering the whole resettlement approach at this stage.  The training given at the Army apprentice school in Naas and the Air Corps apprentice school in Baldonnel as well as the training given in the corps of supply and transport and signals afford Army personnel the prospect of better employment when they leave the Army but that training applies only to a very limited category of soldiers and men in other corps do not get any specialist training.  I realise that this is not the purpose of Army training but, as prospects for promotion are comparatively limited and the size of our Army is relatively small, integration into civilian life is important.  I would like the Minister to extend resettlement facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned fishery protection in the course of his speech. Most people who have read the recently issued publication by Bord Iascaigh Mhara have been surprised about the substantial increase in fish landings.  I was particularly pleased to note that one of the major ports is Dún Laoghaire, which is in my constituency. I know a number of fishermen there are concerned about the inadequacy <Col N="890" /> of our fishery protection service. Undoubtedly such a service requires protection vessels to move rapidly from one scene of operation to another and we should ensure that proper vessels are provided.  I feel it is important to protect our fishing industry because of the high State investment involved and also because of the large numbers employed in it.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the people who participate in civil defence are citizens motivated by the highest sense of public service, but the equipment and facilities provided for these people are inadequate and make training unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the equitation school.  I was glad to note that efforts are being made to acquire better types of horses and that more money is being made available.  There has been a good deal of misunderstanding about the equitation school in recent years.  When the equitation school achieved considerable successes in the late 1920s and early 1930s before the war, almost all international teams were Army teams and one Army was competing against another.  Since the war that situation has changed. Very few armies nowadays have anything like the same numbers in equitation schools and although some armies still retain a certain number the fact is that nowadays international show jumping is a highly competitive business and those engaged in it are, in almost all cases, professionals.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, impossible or certainly very difficult for an army equitation school to achieve the same success as when they were competing with teams that were exclusively army teams.  For that reason I welcomed the decision taken some years ago to field joint teams of army and civilian personnel. It is good for the Army, it is good for the civilians and it is good for the country.  We want to publicise our horsemen and women but, in particular, we want to publicise the quality of our horses and the mixed teams that have travelled abroad and represented this country have brought the very highest credit on themselves and the country.  At the same time, I think <Col N="891" /> there has been an improvement in recent years in the quality of the Army equitation school and the fact that they have acquired better quality horses enables them to compete at something like reasonable levels with those with whom they are in competition.</P>
    <P>In so far as the question of pay and conditions are concerned, I believe that the most urgent problem from the point of view of getting a contented and satisfied army lies in that field. As other Deputies have said, the service which our Army has rendered in the Congo and Cyprus and on observation duty in the Middle East and one or two other places has brought credit to them and renown to the country.  They have discharged their duties with the high standards that we at home have associated with the Army.  It has enabled them to get experience that would not otherwise be available.  This is one of the advantages of being a member of an organisation like the United Nations.  People may look at a body of that kind as a place where there is a great deal of talk and very little achievement.  We can claim that we have played some part in maintaining peace in certain troubled areas.</P>
    <P>Because of our history and our traditions and because of our detachment from the conflicts in a number of these areas and the fact that we in the past have been the subject of foreign domination by outside military forces we have been able to understand and appreciate the attitude of a number of these small emergent countries.  I believe that the Irish troops have been welcomed in all the countries to which they were assigned and played their part fully and effectively as United Nations troops in these areas.  I have no doubt that it has been a valuable experience for the officers, NCOs and men concerned as well as a source of pride to this country and to the people who are responsible for ensuring that our Army personnel are trained and equipped as well as our resources permit to discharge a peace-keeping function as part of our contribution to the solving of some of the problems of the troubled areas in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): When the Minister was appointed Minister for Defence I could not help feeling some sympathy with him because he is one of the younger members of the Cabinet, one of the men who should have some forward thinking, and yet it was obvious that he had been placed in charge of a very antiquated Department, a Department that has not moved for a great number of years.  It is not the Minister's fault; it is probably the fault of Government policy that, while we must have a Department of Defence, nevertheless it is regarded as the Cinderella of the public service.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I had occasion to visit some of the barracks and inspect some of the buildings.  I would agree with some members of the Minister's Party who spoke here today and who regard these buildings as quite antiquated and out of date.  It must be many years&mdash;indeed, before the establishment of this State&mdash;since anything worthwhile was done with the buildings at the Curragh.  Perhaps one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Kildare would not entirely disagree with me. The buildings there seem to be out of date, neglected, dull, drab and uninteresting, not the type of buildings that would encourage younger people to settle down and be happy.  That is to be deplored.  If we expect young people to join the Army even for a few years and certainly if we expect them to make a career of the Army we should provide them with pleasant, cheery surroundings and buildings in which to live, buildings which would be in keeping with the 1970s about which we hear so much.</P>
      <P>That is not the picture I got of the Curragh Camp within the last 12 months.  I fully appreciate that it would be a sizeable task to bring it up to modern standards but what we see there today represents an accumulation of neglect over the years.  Certainly, the present Minister could not be expected to have brought it up to date in his short time in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago when speaking on this Estimate I drew attention to the fact that there are many Army barracks <Col N="893" /> in and around the city of Dublin which are being allowed to fall into decay and which could be put to much better use.  They are occupying extremely valuable sites in valuable areas and with a bit of imagination&mdash;and I am sure the Minister has the necessary imagination if he had the necessary Government backing &mdash; these sites could be utilised for other purposes and the Army personnel at present occupying them could be accommodated on the outskirts of the city or in the neighbouring counties in much more suitable buildings.  As long as the present policy is continued we will have these drab buildings, these antiquated surroundings, which are certainly not calculated to encourage young men to join the Army or to be happy as soldiers.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, whether he be a short time or a long time in the Department of Defence&mdash;many of us thought he would be in Agriculture, but that may not be entirely relevant; apparently Deputy Blaney is weathering the storm there and it has not been necessary to change him into the new Department we were told about on the first day of the new Dáil&mdash;that he should bring his young mind and young approach to bear and get rid of the cobwebs, that he should modernise barracks and ensure that the Army we have, and an army is essential, is a model army, housed in modern conditions, with a modern approach, not some sort of antiquated establishment that might be more in keeping with conditions 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>I am sorry in one way to see the Minister at the beginning of his term of office finding it necessary to indulge in an intensive recruiting campaign because he thought the personnel had fallen fairly considerably.  Apparently the campaign has been reasonably successful because 1,456 men applied and 970 were accepted.  I hope the 970 are happy, that they enjoy their stay in the Army and, above all, that those short-term soldiers when they are discharged will be better citizens and they will be better equipped for their civilian lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in his brief <Col N="894" /> that the recruiting campaign goes on and he requested Deputies to do all they can to encourage young men to give their services.  Apparently the wastage in the Army is considerable. The Minister said he thinks that recruits will find their few years in the Army a rewarding experience in every way.  With that I agree.  I hope the few years spent by young men in the Army will be rewarding for them, that it will equip them for after life as tradesmen and technicians, security guards or something else.</P>
    <P>However, I often wonder do recruiting advertisements pay enough attention to the facilities provided in the Army for training tradesmen.  I believe that if these advertisements and this recruitment drive spelled out in black and white, in big letters, the opportunity offered in the Army for training young men in trades, and if they made it abundantly clear what these trades were, we would find more people available to join the Army, more people interested in spending five or six years as soldiers because, during that time, while they would be enjoying reasonable pay they would also be learning useful occupations.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the past the Army may not have been regarded as a prestige post.  I think something should be done to make it clear that the Army is an honourable occupation, that people who serve in it are professionals lending their services to the country and that they should be treated as such.  I suggest everything should be done to make that clear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave dealt with the Army jumping team.  I am glad to see that the Minister hopes that recent successes by the Army jumping team indicate that there is a bright future for them and that they will come back to some of their former glory.  Again, the Minister is in the fortunate position that he cannot be blamed for any of the shortcomings in his Department because he is there but a short time. Dealing with the jumping team he said in his opening speech that this marks the beginning of a new and successful phase.  It cannot be denied that some years back we as a nation, who were proud of our bloodstock, proud of the <Col N="895" /> fact that we provided some of the finest flat race horses and some of the greatest steeplechasers in the world, had not cause to be proud of our jumping team.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we were often ashamed that our Army jumping team and the horses provided for them were not keeping the name of Irish bloodstock before the world.  People may have this view or that about the Army, about whether it is essential or not, but I want to go on record as saying that I think it is essential and that it should be maintained at a reasonable but a modern standard.  About one thing, however, there can be no doubt.  This is an agricultural country which boasts and feels proud of the fact that it has some of the finest horseflesh in the world.</P>
    <P>Cheltenham is on at the moment and I would ask any of the most nationally-minded Deputies here were they not torn between Croke Park and Cheltenham on St. Patrick's Day?  Were they not proud of the fact that of the six races run at Cheltenham, Tom Dreaper and Pat Taaffe carried off two and Paddy Sleator and Bobby Coonan took the third?  Of course, they were. We were all proud.  We were switching between the two television wavelengths, between the Railway Cup Finals at Croke Park and the National Hunt festival at Cheltenham.  We were all delighted, as, I am sure, the Ceann Comhairle was, that Ulster acquitted themselves very well, and we were really delighted that we held our own at Cheltenham.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister said that during the past three years a total of £47,000 was spent on the purchase of horses for the Army but I do not consider that to have been enough because we are not purchasing horses for the Army but purchasing horses to provide a display window for the Irish horse throughout the world.  As I have already said, there world.  As I have already said, there are rumours that the Minister hopes to go from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry for Agriculture.  Here, he <Col N="896" /> is on common ground.  It is my belief that if the Army failed in everything else but succeeded in highlighting our horses, our steeplechasers and our flat-racers, they would be going a long way towards discharging their obligations to the country.</P>
      <P>As a fighting force, we could not hope to take on any of the mighty nations of the world but as a small agricultural country we have proved in the past, as we will continue to prove in the future, that our horses can take on the best in the world.  I suggest that the Minister, before he leaves the Department of Defence, should make his mark on the Department by ensuring that they have sufficient money. The Minister is forced into boasting about the provision of £47,000 for the purchase of horses for the Army.  I do not consider that to be a creditable performance.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by encouraging the Minister to make sure that the Army jumping team revert to their former glory, that they revert to the position of being able to hold their heads high whether it be in New York, London, Germany or any other place in the world.  If the Minister does that, he will have done a good day's work for the Army, for the agricultural industry and for the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>When this debate began I mentioned that it is sometimes said that there is a lack of interest in the Dáil with regard to matters pertaining to the Defence Forces.  However, after this rather long debate I do not think that can be said again with any degree of accuracy. Many Deputies contributed to the debate&mdash;a debate which ranged over a wide area.  There were not many areas of the Department of Defence that were not covered except, perhaps, the Army School of Music which drew a passing comment from Deputy Tully. The debate indicated a genuine concern on the part of Deputies on all sides of the House with regard to the training and education of soldiers, both young and not so young.  Young soldiers are now going to vocational schools where they can continue their post-primary education, while men who <Col N="897" /> have had long service are being prepared for re-entry into civilian life.  I am very pleased that the House has shown this interest in the welfare of our Army as well as our Naval Service because if we have been somewhat remiss in the past, this is one of the areas which has possibly been neglected to some extent.</P>
      <P>It is of the utmost importance for the Army that they take every possible advantage of the available educational facilities in any town in which there is an Army post.  As well as encouraging the younger soldiers to continue their post-primary education, it is equally important that the older ones be prepared as well as possible for their re-entry into civilian society.  I am glad to say that in both these areas we are now making considerable progress.  We can expand the training that is being given to soldiers at present in Galway through AnCO and I would hope that we would continue to develop this idea because it is vital for the morale of Army personnel that they realise that this House and the people generally continue to be interested in their welfare even after they have left the Army. We owe this consideration to our soldiers and we should avail of every opportunity to make sure that this particular aspect of a soldier's career is not neglected.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Tully, referred to Army catering. In our Army, and in a great many other armies, the traditional method of catering was rough and ready but I am glad to be able to tell the House that this particular aspect of a soldier's life is being looked after by the Army authorities.  Officers have been sent abroad to complete courses in catering and they are returning with their acquired skills which they are applying to the catering services of the Army.  Just like every other army ours must be well fed and the better a soldier is fed the better will be his morale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the debate there was a good deal of concentration on the general welfare of soldiers with regard to housing both in married quarters and in the billeting of soldiers in Army barracks as well as in the matter of <Col N="898" /> the provision of houses for soldiers after they leave the Army.  However, there was a certain amount of confusion about this.  Deputy Fitzpatrick painted a rather grim picture of what he thought was the situation on the Curragh.  He suggested that the buildings were old, neglected, dowdy and unsuitable for human habitation.  There is no question whatever of Army buildings being neglected.  There is no doubt, of course, that most of our Army barracks are a legacy from former times when these very barracks were occupied by soldiers of a foreign power to hold us in subjection.  That is no longer the case.  However, a great many of these Army buildings are in quite good repair.  In some cases, I would concede, they are not.  For instance, I was in the military barracks in Cavan some time last year, an old barracks which was pressed into service for reasons that the House is well aware of. Conditions there left a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>However, generally speaking, I do not accept that the buildings throughout the country are unsuitable for Army purposes.  I do not accept at all that there is any case of neglect.  For instance, one of the best new modern Catholic churches in the country is in the Curragh.  It was built some years ago by the Office of Public Works and is quite an exceptional piece of modern architecture.  There is a new gymnasium and a swimming pool of championship standards in the Curragh. New blocks of houses and modern quarters have already been provided there, as has a new magazine.  I do not suggest that there is an epidemic of building all over the country but I say that the Army, in their own typical way, are maintaining their own property very well indeed.  I have yet to visit a post with the appearance of neglect or carelessness about it.  The Corps of Engineers are constantly on the job of repairing and renewing Army buildings.</P>
    <P>Some varying opinions were offered about the function of the Army.  The words &ldquo;mission&rdquo;, &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; and &ldquo;function&rdquo; of the Army were used. The existence of the Army is accepted, generally speaking, just as is the existence <Col N="899" /> of the Garda Síochána, as one of the factors that support our democratic State and is essential for its continuation.  I think there is a broad general agreement and acceptance of this.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that, generally speaking, the image of the Army is very good. I am very grateful to Deputy Cosgrave for referring to this because from time to time one comes across some gratuitous and malicious piece of cheap journalism casting aspersions on the good name of the Army.  A good example of this recently appeared in the <i>Irish Press.</i> In this particular offering, which was published, I think, about a month or so ago, it was gratuitously and quite falsely suggested that the conduct of our troops in Cyprus was not all it might be especially in the matter of abstinence from over indulgence in drink.  There is no ground whatever for this malicious allegation. I cannot understand the purpose that lay behind it.  I should like categorically to deny it and in substantiation of this denial to refer to a report made by the United Nations as to the conduct of our troops in the service of the United Nations.  We can be quite happy and certain that we can be as proud of our soldiers serving in Cyprus as we were proud of them when they served in the Congo and in the Middle East.  Why people should think fit to make these totally unwarranted allegations is beyond me.  While it is irritating and disappointing that they should be made, I think we can rest reasonably happy in the belief and knowledge that our soldiers are doing their duty as we would expect them to do it and there is really not any reason for anxiety in that regard.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies&mdash;naturally most of them were Opposition Deputies&mdash; speaking on various aspects of Army strength and equipment, the Naval Service, helicopters and matters of that kind, got into a field that I personally call the arithmetic of defence.  They asserted, rather facilely in my opinion, that six frigates are better than three frigates&mdash;probably twice as good; similarly, that three frigates are better <Col N="900" /> than one frigate.  The same principle applies in the lifesaving operations of helicopters, according to those Deputies, who feel it would be far better if we had more helicopters because then we could have a more flexible and efficient service.  Those same Deputies consider that we would have a more satisfactorily equipped Army if we could devote more money to it.  All of this is self-evident and I do not think it is worthy of a great deal of comment except to say that it is as evident to me and to the Government as it is to the Deputies of the Opposition.  There are other matters that must exercise the mind of the Government.  At the end of it all, there is the relentless obligation to get our priorities right.</P>
    <P>Let us take the matter of the Naval Service as an example.  It is not necessary for any Deputy to say to me that we require ships urgently for the Naval Service.  I have already told the House of the steps we are taking to procure these vessels.  They are very expensive.  We would much prefer to have provided them long ago.  We would much prefer to provide more of them.  We are doing what I have told the House we are doing and we are doing it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As the debate proceeded I made notes of the various contributions.  I hope the House will forgive me if they are a little bit disjointed.  I have not had a real opportunity of arranging them in any kind of sequence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton returned to the question of the integration of the Army into society.  This is a rather stilted way of expressing an idea that he and I are aware of.  Deputy Clinton protested that the House may have misunderstood him when he spoke on this particular subject some time ago on the Supplementary Estimate.  However, he did produce some kind of document or leaflet from Britain and suggested that the Army could usefully be employed and integrated into society generally by engaging in such business as coastal protection&mdash;this I take to be the creation of coastal works rather than some naval business&mdash;the building of youth clubs, sports grounds and the restoration of canals.  I do not wish <Col N="901" /> to be facetious at the expense of Deputy Clinton, because I think I know what he means.  He also spoke of the provision of certain structures.</P>
    <P>I think that in there somewhere there is material for examination.  In the Army now in this context they are fully occupied in meeting their obligations. As some other Deputy commented, we have had to call upon the services of the FCA for security duties in recent times.  For that reason alone, I do not think it would be practical, in present circumstances anyway, to devote a great deal of the time of the Army to work of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton also mentioned the desirability of recruiting young horsemen as cadets for our School of Equitation. There are a couple of points about this.  One is that when cadets are being recruited, if they happen to be young horsemen at that time, this is taken into consideration when they are being interviewed for admission to the Army.  In any event, cadets are trained in equitation when they join.  I do not know whether there is anything further we could do in the matter of recruiting good young horsemen.  If any Deputy has any suggestion I would be very glad to hear it, because I have a lively awareness of the vital importance in the Army School of Equitation of the recruitment of good young horsemen.  Like singers or hurlers, horsemen are born.  Men are either horsemen or they are not.  No matter how flexible they may be, if they have not got it in them they will never make real horsemen.  I agree with Deputy Clinton that this is important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Clinton were both worried about what will happen when we join the European Economic Community.  I think this is a hypothesis about a hypothesis.  Consequently it is of such long range that even with our longest range&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish.  It is true to say that one of the leading countries in the EEC, the Republic of France, has pretty well pleased itself in the matter of defence and, in later times, the Federal Republic of Germany has evinced some considerable independence of mind on the business of defence, too.  As I say, it is a very hypothetical business and, consequently, I do not think there is any real need for us here on this Estimate to examine it in any detail.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Dr. Byrne is here. He will forgive me if I say that he made a very depressing speech.  He suggested that in the event of the Army having to carry out its first mission, to defend this country against aggression, we had not an earthly.  I think he read the same supplement to one of the English Sunday papers that I read recently, because I saw the arithmetic of the number of people who are now required to keep one man of the American army at the front as against 1939, 1918 and during the Civil War.  It started with the Civil War. The Deputy was on that theme.</P>
      <P>The general impression I got from listening to Deputy Byrne was that our Army would not have an earthly if called upon to carry out its mission and it would also appear that 100 guerillas would be equally able to overcome the Army in the second part of its mission, internal security. According to Deputy Byrne, the Navy is no good either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have enlightened the House as best I can about that. The FCA does not meet his requirements either, the Army riding school is on the decline, and the Army is bad at sports.  Really, Deputy Byrne should not be as depressed as all that because the Army has demonstrated in the past many times, and the country has demonstrated once or twice, that in emergencies we have this capacity for corporate action, that we have this capacity of rallying when it is necessary to rally.  I am perfectly happy <Col N="903" /> that, if it became necessary in the future, we would have something worthwhile to rally around in the Army as it stands at present.  I do not say that it is ideal.  I should like to see the Army very much improved in strength and armaments and everything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to live within our means.  A number of Deputies spoke about the sloppiness of the FCA turnout and the sloppiness of the FCA uniforms.  That is a bit unfair because at several venues, including my own town, on St. Patrick's Day the FCA turned out and they were extremely smart.  I was very proud of them as an Irishman and as a person who at the moment happens to be Minister for Defence.  The FCA uniform is not by any means the type of thing one would expect to see in a place where beautiful uniforms were preserved for the delectation of posterity. It is serviceable.  It could be improved and I hope it will be improved and the business of its improvement is at present exercising the minds of the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan opened with a short historical discourse which was highly inaccurate.  I do not think it is necessary to delve into it in any detail because of its inaccuracy and its irrelevance as well.  He expressed interest in the training of soldiers, both young and old, and he returned to the business of the stationing of the helicopter service in the west, about which I gave the House the score already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde gave us a sailor's contribution.  It was very informative but he has the common Fine Gael weakness for ordering frigates by the half dozen.  I wish we could, but we cannot.  He appreciates the value of a sturdy all-weather ship for the North Atlantic winter conditions in which our Naval Service must operate.  I value his opinion as an ex-Royal Navy man because he has experience of these matters.  When he was talking about the Naval Service he spoke with a certain panache which one would <Col N="904" /> expect from an old salt like himself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald made a contribution and examined the mission of the Army.  He said, accurately enough, that in his opinion the first function of the Army was to provide a cadre around which a larger force could be created in time of emergency; the second point was the business of internal security and, the third point, the United Nations function of the Army. Then he went on to this extraordinary, untrue allegation that it was suggested by certain Ministers that under certain circumstances the Army might intervene in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  Where he got this idea and why he expressed it I do not know, but it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the purpose of making this allegation must have been mischievous, because it is so grossly untrue that it could bear no other explanation.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald also had some interesting ideas on the business of fishery protection.  Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde, who is an old sailor, gave us some solid advice about this, but Deputy FitzGerald suggests that fishery protection could be provided by a boat and a man with a machine gun and that the boat does not have to be either fast or big.  I do not know what competence Deputy FitzGerald has in these matters, but that strikes me as being an extraordinary offering.  Naval vessels, according to Deputy FitzGerald, unless I misunderstood him completely, should be crewed by a naval officer with some local people.  I confess I do not understand that either.</P>
    <P>He also suggests that the Council of Defence does not meet regularly and he purported to know that it does not meet regularly.  Again I do not know where Deputy FitzGerald got his information, because it is not customary for the Minister for Defence to inform Deputy FitzGerald or anybody else except the individual members of the Council of Defence when he confers with them.  Why Deputy FitzGerald should build a false structure of untruths on this suggestion is beyond my understanding.</P>
    <P>He ended his homily by reading me a lecture on the obligation that lay on me to reply to the contribution he <Col N="905" /> made.  I must confess I was surprised, in spite of having watched Deputy FitzGerald in action for so many months and thought we could have expected something more responsible than that.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the function of the Army and the reaction of the Department of Defence to the disturbances in the Six Counties last year. The Taoiseach made it abundantly clear on more than one occasion precisely where the Government stand in this whole affair.  I referred to it myself a couple of weeks ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of Deputies Blaney and Boland, would the Minister like to repeat it?  We would not mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of Deputies suggested, as is commonly done in relation to the Old IRA special allowances, that the numbers are now so diminished that the cost is negligible, that the means test should be dispensed with and that we should try to treat the old soldiers, the men and women of Óglaigh na hÉireann and Cumann na mBan, somewhat better than we do.  It is necessary to say that at the present time 10,500 people are receiving special allowances and somewhat fewer than 9,000 are receiving military service pensions.  In the case of pensions it is costing £700,000 a year and in the case of special allowances it is costing £1 million a year.  I do not for a moment suggest that what these veteran men and women are getting is anything like what we would like to give them but I do assert it is by no means negligible.  If the scheme is to be successful at all there must be a means test and a means test demands that there will be an examination of a person's means, however small they are.  Occasionally one comes across the case of a person who is handled rather brusquely in the process of this means examination. I do not think it is very widespread and if any Deputy has a complaint to make I shall be very glad to have it investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davern, Deputy Tully and possibly one or two others seemed to <Col N="906" /> be rather aggrieved that I made no reference to the FCA in my short opening statement.  This is true enough, but I think the last to be aggrieved would be the FCA themselves.  However, it is worth mentioning that a couple of weeks ago I did pay due tribute to the FCA and to the other component parts of the Defence Forces and I do not think it is of any value at all for the Minister or a Deputy to lob out gratuitous compliments. This is not the kind of thing the FCA really expect.  They would much prefer to have more concentration on their own force and its development and I want to give it as much of that as I possibly can.  It is worth saying, when we are talking about the FCA&mdash;I think it is a repetition but I will say it again&mdash;that the type of service they have been giving, especially recently in the matter of security duties, is first class.  They do not really surprise the Army authorities, nor do they surprise me.  They are doing their job as we expected they would do it.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that Deputy Joe Dowling was displeased by the recruiting campaign.  I think he said it was ill-timed and unimaginative.  I should have thought that the contrary was the case.  The results are satisfactory enough.  I am told by the people in the Department of Defence that it is their experience that the autumn is a good time in which to start a recruiting drive.  I think other Deputies do not share Deputy Dowling's opinion of the quality of our recruiting campaign.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling and Deputy Power spoke of the provision of accommodation for apprentices at Naas.  There are proposals to build a new billet block but the project has been delayed because of some local difficulties.  We are doing our best to straighten out this matter and I agree completely with the Deputies that this accommodation needs to be provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne spoke rather tearfully on the matter of compensation for families of soldiers who have been killed overseas.  The Army Pensions Act provides for allowances for the widows and children of soldiers killed <Col N="907" /> in the course of duty; there is provision for a sum of £3 9s per week for the wife and £1 5s a week for each child.  In the case of a married man killed on duty while on UN service, a lump sum of £4,000 is payable in addition to the allowances I have mentioned and contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are available in these cases.  Deputy Byrne mentioned that the family of one of our men who was killed in the Niemba ambush was badly treated and that the Deputy was present when the widow was being evicted.  I do not know how true this is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Cosgrave referred to <Col N="908" /> the inadequate facilities for Civil Defence training but he did not say in what regard this training was deficient. If there are deficiencies I would be very glad if he would tell me.  I think the people in Civil Defence are particularly good; I have been to one or two centres and have seen them in action.  They have this zeal that one sometimes sees in volunteer, unpaid forces.  If Deputy Cosgrave would give me specific details about where he thinks deficiencies arise we might be able to do something about the matter.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of <Col N="909" /> payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1970, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>This token Estimate for £10 is being taken to enable Deputies to discuss the Estimate for my Department amounting to £25,410,000 which was passed before Christmas.</P>

To this should be added £1,550,000 included in the Vote for Remuneration and £70,000 in the Vote for increases in pensions to arrive at total estimated expenditure proper to the Vote in 1969-70.

    <P>As we are now nearing the end of the financial year and the expenditure proposed in the main and recent Supplementary Estimates has already been approved, I propose, with the permission of the House, not to enter into the usual detailed comparison of subheads with last year's provisions but to proceed immediately to report on the various services covered by the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>Postal business continued to grow in 1968.  The number of letters handled was approximately 450 million, representing an increase of over 2 per cent on the previous year.  Air mail correspondence was up by 14 per cent. Postings of first class mails by air rose by 12 per cent and the increase in postings of second class matter was 23 per cent. Figures for 1969 are not yet available but the indications are that the growth in traffic was well maintained in that year.</P>
    <P>The volume of letters and cards posted over the Christmas and New Year was some 2 per cent higher in 1968 than in 1967 and there was a further increase of much the same order last Christmas.</P>
    <P>Parcel traffic handled in 1968 was up by an estimated 4 per cent as compared with 1967 but postings from Britain in 1967 were adversely affected by restrictions following the outbreak <Col N="910" /> of foot and mouth disease in England.</P>
    <P>Counter business is also growing. As Deputies are aware, this covers a wide range of services for other Government Departments apart from those required for purely Post Office purposes.</P>
    <P>The standard of mail services given is high.  Normally, over 90 per cent of internal letters posted in time for outward despatches are delivered throughout the country by the following working day.  For parcels and second-class mail the standard is well above that normally given elsewhere.  The bulk of letter mail for places abroad leaves the country by air on the day of posting and, with few exceptions, letters received from abroad are delivered on the following working day.</P>
    <P>During 1968 70 motorised delivery services were introduced and in 1969 a further 63 routes were motorised. There are now over 370 motor delivery rural services in operation and about 25 per cent of the total route mileage in rural areas is being served by motorised posts.</P>
    <P>Thirty-one new postman posts were created in 1968 to deal with increased mail work arising from housing developments in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment in July last of the Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1969, literature and articles specially adapted for the use of the blind may now be sent free of postage to places at home or abroad by surface post.</P>
    <P>In 1968 special issues of postage stamps were made to mark the 800th anniversary of the founding of St. Mary's Cathedral, Limerick, the centenary of the birth of Countess Markievicz, the centenary of the birth of James Connolly and the International Year for Human Rights.  We also joined with other members of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations in the annual issue of the Europa Stamp.  The first group of the new series of definitive stamps was issued in October, 1968, and the remaining denominations in the series were issued at intervals in the early part of 1969.</P>
    <P>A special stamp was issued on 21st January, 1969, to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the First Assembly <Col N="911" /> of Dáil Éireann.  Other special issues during 1969 were on the Europa theme, the 50th anniversary of the International Labour Office, the centenary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, and a stamp featuring one of the works of the late Evie Hone.</P>
    <P>Seven special stamps will be issued this year, including the Europa stamp. This stamp will be of special interest as the design is the work of an Irish artist, Mr. Louis le Brocquy.  Other stamps will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of Terence MacSwiney, Tomás Mac Curtain and Kevin Barry, European Conservation Year and the 250th anniversary of yachting in Ireland and the founding of the Royal Cork Yacht Club. A stamp will also be issued showing the work of a contemporary Irish artist.  The stamp will feature a work by Miss Mainie Jellett.</P>
    <P>The number of telegrams handled in 1968 at 1,313,000, was little different from that for 1967 and the persistent downward trend of traffic continued in 1969.  The telex service on the other hand continued its remarkable expansion. The number of telex subscribers increased by 159 during 1968 and by over 200 in 1969, a total increase of 70 per cent in the two year period.  In 1969 calls to places beyond Britain exceeded a quarter of a million, 28 per cent up on 1968.  More and more firms are realising the advantages of this useful form of communication.  Planning for the telex service is based on maintaining an annual growth rate of about 35 per cent over the next few years.  The capacity of the satellite exchanges at Cork and Shannon was doubled during 1969 and work on enlarging Dublin exchange is nearing completion. Further extensions of these exchanges are already at the planning stage.  A new satellite exchange will be brought into service in Waterford early in 1971 and it has been decided to provide one later in Limerick and in at least one other centre.</P>
    <P>Extra circuits were provided on the Belfast and cross-Channel routes recently and arrangements are in hand to provide more.  A direct route to Germany was brought into service in <Col N="912" /> 1969 and the question of establishing direct routes to other continental countries is being examined.  The number of direct circuits between Dublin and the USA was increased from two to six in 1969 and when further circuits planned for 1970 become available direct subscriber telex dialling to the USA will be introduced. Telex service is now available to 108 countries and 97.8 per cent of all outgoing traffic is dialled directly.</P>
    <P>Data transmission has been developing rapidly in some countries.  It involves high speed transmission of data over the public telephone or telex network or over privately leased telephone or telegraph circuits.  Data transmission is closely linked with increased use of computers and we have already provided facilities for data transmission where required.  The demand so far has been small but, as more Irish firms obtain their own computers or rent space on computers, a growing demand for data transmission facilities is likely to arise.  This question is under active consideration in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is also expanding rapidly.  In 1968 calls numbered 291 million, 15 per cent more than in the previous year.  Of these 259 million were local and 32 million were trunk calls: 84 per cent of all calls were dialled directly by the callers.  Figures for 1969 are not yet available but the increase in traffic was again high.</P>
    <P>Demand for telephones during the year 1968-69 showed a remarkable advance, being 21 per cent greater than in the previous year: 22,300 exchange lines were connected during 1968-1969, 3,000 more than in 1967-68 and 6,800 more than the year before, but not enough nevertheless to keep pace with the new rate of demand.  The connection rate in the current year has been running at about the same level as in 1968-1969 but demand continued to rise and some 11,000 applicants were awaiting service at the end of December, 1969. Over half of these applications were in course of being met or were being processed.  Less than 7 per cent of these had been on hand more than a year and the great majority of the <Col N="913" /> older applications will be cleared shortly.</P>
    <P>My Department is very conscious of the need to improve the position and everything possible is being done to overtake demand and reduce the waiting list.  Planning at present aims at doubling the connection rate, and catering for double the present traffic, in the next four to five years.  My predecessor gave particulars of the extent of this programme when he was presenting the Telephone Capital Bill for £50 million last year to the House. It entails extensive cabling in all built up areas; provision of new exchanges and extension of existing exchanges; procuring new buildings and extending existing buildings to house the additional plant; expansion of trunk and junction capacity; increasing output by way of increased productivity from existing staff; recruitment of additional staff at professional engineer level; and recruitment and training of more technicians. All possible measures are being taken to speed the programme but present indications are that it will be some considerable time before inroads can be made into the waiting list if the pace of demand for telephones continues to increase.</P>
    <P>The basic exchange, trunk and junction networks are in constant process of expansion and improvement to keep pace with the increased demands on the service.  Progress with the extension of the automatic system continues. During 1968, 28 manual exchanges were converted to automatic working and a further 26 were converted in 1969.  In 1968 additional equipment to provide for future subscriber and traffic growth was installed in 47 automatic as well as in 100 manual exchanges.  In 1969 78 automatic exchanges and over 120 manual exchanges were similarly extended.  In addition, an automanual exchange was opened at Tralee in March last and new modern manual exchanges were put into service in Castleblayney, Castlerea, Donegal and Listowel.</P>
    <P>Over 600 additional circuits on 180 routes were added to the trunk system in 1968, mainly in underground cable; many open wire trunk routes were replaced by trunk cables thus improving <Col N="914" /> the quality and reliability of the service and 37 additional cross-Channel circuits were provided. Among the more important routes improved were many in the Counties Cavan, Cork, Laois, Monaghan, Offaly and Westmeath, as well as routes radiating from Cork, Dublin and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The year 1969 showed even greater progress in expanding the trunk networks, over 900 trunk circuits being added to about 230 routes including 51 on the cross-Channel route.  Six transatlantic circuits were added&mdash; two to Canada and four to the USA, making a total of 16 transatlantic circuits.  Other items among the more important works were expansion of the capacity of the trunk cables serving Carrickmacross, Ennis and Killarney; and completion of co-axial cable schemes between Arklow-Gorey-Enniscorthy, Cahirciveen-Killorglin, Ennistymon, Ennis-Kilrush, and Letter-kenny-Dungloe. The radio links between Dublin and Portlaoise and Dublin/Belfast/cross-Channel with a potential capacity of 960 circuits each were completed in 1969 and as equipment is fitted these will be brought into service.  Already 60 circuits to Portlaoise, 30 to Belfast and 30 to Britain are in use and it is expected that 212 more to Britain will be brought into service in early summer.</P>
    <P>Work on other high capacity radio links connecting Dublin and Cork, and Portlaoise and Athlone, is well advanced and circuits are expected to be available shortly.  Work is in progress also on provision of radio links between Portlaoise-Thurles and Limerick-Shannon-Ennis.  The capacity of the existing trunk cables serving Listowel, Macroom and a number of other places will be expanded by fitting additional equipment.</P>
    <P>An aerial cable between Ballina and Belmullet, an underground co-axial cable between Waterford and Dungarvan, and an underground co-axial cable scheme Athlone - Castlerea - Claremorris - Castlebar - Ballina are expected to be completed this year. Aerial cables, and aerial and underground co-axial cables between Galway - Clifden, Killarney - Kenmare - Sneem <Col N="915" /> and Portlaoise-Birr will be ready for service at the end of this year or early 1971.  In addition an underground co-axial cable scheme Athlone-Ballinasloe - Loughrea - Galway is expected to be completed in 1972.</P>
    <P>The first issue of the classified directory was distributed in June, 1969, and met with generally favourable comment. The 1970 edition is at present being distributed.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of changes have been made in the 1970 issue of the telephone directory.  It is printed in a different typeface with more space between the entries which makes for easier reading.  All the telephone numbers are listed in bold type and there is additional spacing between digits in four, five and six digit numbers.</P>
    <P>The preface too has been re-designed with the object of presenting useful information as clearly as possible.  Part I of the directory has been extended to cover a wider area.  In addition to all subscribers in Dublin city and county it now includes those subscribers in parts of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow who are in the Dublin local call fee area now known as the &ldquo;O1&rdquo; area.  The purpose of the change was to simplify the position regarding subscriber trunk dialling, emphasising that &ldquo;O1&rdquo; is the access code for making a call from outside the area to any telephone in the &ldquo;O1&rdquo; area.  In addition a new code for reporting faults was introduced in the &ldquo;O1&rdquo; area to coincide with the issue of the directory and new facilities for coinbox users in this area were also introduced.  They now have direct access to the fault report, directory inquiry and service difficulty services where previously they had to dial &ldquo;1O&rdquo; to be connected by the operator to the appropriate service. These changes involved changing the dialling codes for all of these services. One further point about the directory: despite the fact that all of the 200,000 odd entries in the volume had to be reset and that it contains 60,000 new or amended entries, it is the most up-to-date directory published by the Department for many years.  The weather service, which was introduced in 1967, continues to be <Col N="916" /> very successful.  Over half a million calls were made to the service in 1969.</P>
    <P>It had been expected that an automatic time service would be introduced in 1969.  Regrettably the manufacturer was unable to deliver the equipment as scheduled and the service will not be available until later this year.</P>
    <P>In mid-1969 a revised policy regarding provision of telephone kiosks in rural areas was announced.  Previously kiosks were provided only where they would pay their way.  It was decided to allow a modest subsidy in the case of kiosks in rural areas and to accelerate the extension of kiosk facilities to these areas.  It was also decided that this extension could best be achieved by replacing by kiosks these call offices in rural sub-post offices which are used fairly extensively. As a first step the rural kiosk programme for the current financial year was increased substantially.  The intention is to increase the annual provision of kiosks from 100 to about 200 for the next few years.  This will represent a three-fold increase in rural kiosk provision from about 50 to 150 a year.</P>
    <P>A five-year extended kiosk programme is being drawn up commencing in the financial year 1970-71 and centres are being selected for inclusion on the basis of the extent to which the call office in the local post office is used.  This will have the advantage that kiosks will be provided in the order in which they are likely to be of most benefit.</P>
    <P>Deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank, excluding surplus funds invested by trustee savings banks to which I will refer later, amounted to £23.9 million during 1968 and withdrawals to £25.8 million.  At 31 December, 1968, the total balance due to depositors, including interest amounting to £3.9 million, was approximately £118.3 million, an increase of £2 million on the figure for 31 December, 1967.</P>
    <P>During 1969 deposits and withdrawals amounted to £25.1 million and £27.1 million respectively.</P>
    <P>Net deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank by the trustee savings banks amounted to £0.4 million in 1968.  The total amount to the credit <Col N="917" /> of the trustee savings banks at the end of that year including interest and deposits amounting to £1.7 million in the new investment account service was £22.5 million, an increase of £1.3 million over the previous year.</P>
    <P>During 1969 withdrawals by the trustee savings banks on ordinary account amounted to £1.7 million as compared with a net deposit of £0.4 million for 1968 but this was more than counterbalanced by deposits totalling £4.9 million on investment account.</P>
    <P>The 6½ per cent investment bonds were introduced, under the management of my Department, in January, 1969.  In the first 12 months net sales totalled £5.2 million.  Interest on the bonds is paid twice yearly; the first payment, of some £78,000, was made on 31st July last and the second payment of about £173,000 on 31st January this year.</P>
    <P>Sales of savings certificates during 1968 amounted to £6.7 million and repayments, including interest, came to £6.2 million.  The principal remaining invested at the end of the year was £47 million as compared with £45.1 million at the close of 1967, an increase of £1.9 million.  During 1969 sales of savings certificates amounted to about £5.5 million and repayments, including interest, to £7.1 million.  The net outflow (£1.6 million) compared with a net inflow of £0.5 million in 1968.</P>
    <P>The aggregate result for 1968 for the savings media with which my Department is directly concerned was a net dissaving of about £1 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position improved during 1969, which produced a net inflow of savings of £4.8 million.  The improvement is attributable to the success of the 6½ per cent investment bonds and of the trustee savings banks' investment accounts which together yielded £10.1 million, against which must be offset a loss of £5.3 million out of the older media.</P>
      <P>I should like to record my appreciation of the excellent work done by the National Savings Committee in promoting small savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of money orders issued in 1968 was £34.2 million as compared <Col N="918" /> with £35.4 million in the previous year. Postal order business in 1968 was slightly higher, the value of orders issued being £8.74 million as compared with £8.64 million in 1967.</P>
    <P>Agency service payments made by the Post Office, mainly on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, increased from £50 million in 1967 to £55 million in 1968.  Post offices took part as usual in the half-yearly sales of prize bonds, handling about 30 per cent of the total collected.</P>
    <P>During 1968 new automatic telephone exchange buildings were completed at 58 centres including Cahirciveen, Castlerea, Dungarvan, Gort, Killarney and Muine Bheag. New manual exchange accommodation was provided at Castleblayney, Donegal and Westport.  Improvement schemes were carried out at Kinsale and Tipperary post offices.</P>
    <P>Works completed in 1969 included a new post office at Macroom, extension to Merrion and Wicklow telephone exchanges, and new automatic telephone exchange buildings at Ballina, Macroom, Tullow and 33 other centres.  Improved manual telephone exchange accommodation was provided at Castlerea, Clones, Cork and Listowel.</P>
    <P>Works in progress include new warehouses at St. John's Road stores depot; new post office, telephone exchange and area engineering depot at Claremorris; new post office and telephone exchange at Cavan; new district sorting office at Ballyfermot; new automatic telephone exchange buildings at Birr, Clonmel, Cobh, Loughrea, Newcastlewest, Tramore and ten other centres; extensions to the exchange buildings at Balbriggan, Rathmines (Dublin), Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Additional accommodation has been provided in Dublin for offices, training and exchange extension purposes.</P>
    <P>The first general issue of the new postmen's uniform of improved quality and design was made in December, 1969.</P>
    <P>A new colour scheme and official symbol for Post Office vehicles have been approved and are now being used on new vehicles.  The scheme <Col N="919" /> and symbol are the work of the Kilkenny Design Centre.</P>
    <P>The number of additional staff provided for in the Estimates is 922.  Most of the new posts are in the expanding telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the telecommunications services requires a steady intake of professional engineers, and I am glad to say that our recruitment efforts continue to meet with reasonable success.  Twenty-seven professional engineers were recruited from competitions held during 1968, and 11 from competitions held in 1969.  The Department's scholarship schemes&mdash; designed to supplement the intake of professional engineers&mdash;have been extended in scope; and scholarships are now available to students who have successfully completed two or more years of a university course leading to an appropriate degree.  This is in addition to the schemes under which scholarships leading to full engineering qualifications are available for school leavers and members of the Department's staff with suitable experience. Twenty students are at present studying under scholarships awarded under these schemes.  The benefits of these efforts are already emerging : during 1969 two young men who had obtained their qualifications through these schemes were appointed engineers in the Department.</P>
    <P>The technician trainee scheme continues to be successful.  At present we have over 350 young men in training. The scheme has been in operation in its present form since 1963, and has been invaluable in providing the Department with skilled personnel.  Nonetheless, it has been felt appropriate to review generally the recruitment and training of our technician force in the light of our experience to date and of the far-reaching technical developments of recent years.  This review is now proceeding.  During 1968-69 the Department undertook the recruitment and training of over 800 male and female full-time telephonists.  Thanks to the co-operation of the Civil Service Commission this big programme was successfully carried out.  Recruitment of telephonists to meet needs for 1970 is well advanced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Attention continues to be given to the welfare facilities available to the staff, and there are now eight welfare officers functioning in the Department. Six are in the Dublin area, and one each in the Cork and Limerick areas.</P>
    <P>The status and organisation of my Department have been referred to on a number of occasions during the Estimate debates in previous years. The recommendations of the Devlin review group in this regard are now being carefully studied.  The report recommends that the operation of the postal and telecommunications services should not, for the present at least, be transferred to a commercial State-sponsored body but should remain within the Civil Service.  The report also contains some far-reaching recommendations regarding the establishment of a new Department of Transport and Communications of which the postal and telecommunications services would form part.  The recommendations raised many complex issues and it is too early yet to come to conclusions on them.</P>
    <P>The changeover to decimal currency will take place on 15th February, 1971.  A committee within my Department is dealing with the many practical problems which arise for the Post Office.  My Department is also represented on an inter-departmental committee to co-ordinate arrangements for the changeover for the public service as a whole.</P>
    <P>In dealing with staffing matters last year my predecessor mentioned that improvements in pay and other conditions of service had in the previous two financial years cost a total of £1.34 million.  Since then, further pay increases have added to those costs.  Post Office staffs have benefited from eleventh round pay increases in 1968 and 1969 and in addition have secured improvements in other conditions such as working hours and holidays.  The net effect of these improvements in the last 18 months or so has been to add a total of approximately £3½ million to the Department's wage bill which, at 1st April, 1968, stood at about £15.2 million.  This increase in operating costs will clearly pose problems for the Department in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> During the year, the great majority of the staff of nearly 20,000 continued to give the traditionally high standard of service which we have all come to expect and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking them.  The year did, regrettably, have its upsets, with a series of work stoppages organised by a minority breakaway staff organisation.  Although these affected the Department's activities to a very limited degree, they caused much unnecessary inconvenience and irritation to some users of Post Office services.</P>
    <P>There was also a regrettable unofficial stoppage of work at Ennis which lasted for four weeks and there was a similar stoppage by delivery postmen in Dublin and suburbs for one day in support of a demand for cessation of delivery of post on Saturdays.</P>
    <P>My Department has been conscious of the constant need to attune its staff relations policy and machinery to changing times and attitudes.  For example, a subcommittee consisting of both management and the staff organisations is at present examining staff communications within the Department. One of the objects of the examination is to see how the staff can be given a greater involvement in the affairs of their offices.  Recently, joint consultation councils have been set up in the Dublin postal and Dublin engineering districts which are two of the biggest staff units in the Department. The councils consist of local management and staff representatives who will meet regularly to discuss all matters of local interest.  The possibility of setting up similar councils in other areas is being examined and I am hopeful that, in this way, the staff will get a greater sense of satisfaction from their work and that they will be encouraged to take a greater interest in it.  The question of having psychological surveys of staff attitudes <i>et cetera</i> carried out is also under examination and it is expected that some surveys of this kind will be undertaken during the coming year.  Their object will be to assess what factors, physical an environmental, may be causing dissatisfaction and tension, and to determine how job satisfaction can be increased.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, when speaking on <Col N="922" /> last year's Estimate, mentioned that the Post Office departmental council was considering whether any changes were desirable in the Department's staff regulations.  A subcommittee of the departmental council, consisting of both management and staff representatives, was set up to carry out a thorough review of these.  The subcommittee has reported on certain aspects of the matter and its recommendations have been accepted.  Other aspects are being examined at present, and as the examination will be a very detailed and thorough one, the deliberations of the committee are not likely to be completed for some time.  A committee on similar lines examined the regulations applying to sub-postmasters.  That committee reported some time ago and its recommendations are being implemented.</P>
    <P>The training function within the Department is receiving increasing attention.  The resources, both in personnel and accommodation, are being expanded steadily to meet the ever-increasing demands for training, both in the technical and management fields. During the year, additional premises were acquired for training, one for engineering staffs, another for refresher courses for telephone operators and their supervisors, and another for postal and general service staff and supervisors.  The training in these departmental schools is provided largely by departmental staff but outside personnel experienced in the training field are called in to help in areas where their expertise is considered of value.  In addition, the Department sends supervisors and other staff to courses conducted by the Civil Service training centre, the Institute of Public Administration, the Irish Management Institute and the School of Management Studies wherever it is considered they are likely to benefit from such courses.  Staff are also given facilities to attend university courses where the subject matter is likely to be of direct benefit to them in their jobs in the Department.  The Department is fully conscious of the need for increased training and what can be accomplished by it, and it is an aspect that will continue to receive very close attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> It was mentioned last year that the Department had employed industrial consultants to examine the organisation, grading and methods of work in the Department's engineering branch. The consultant's reports have now been studied, and largely implemented in so far as maintenance of the telephone system is concerned.  In regard to construction or new work, the consultants have pointed to the directions in which they considered efficiency could be improved, and a programme of work study has been undertaken with a view to determining the best organisation and work practices and setting standards of performance.  This will take some time but will be pushed forward with all speed, in consultation with the various staff interests involved.</P>
    <P>The Department's organisation and methods staff was expanded considerably over the last year or so, and they are making good progress.  As time goes by, more and more areas within the Department will come under their scrutiny and I am confident that in this way productivity will be raised considerably.  There are special difficulties in measuring work and improving methods in the clerical field.</P>
    <P>The Department have a big number of staff engaged on clerical work and any economies that can be achieved from the introduction of improved working methods and the setting of time standards should clearly be sought after.  With this object in mind, the Department is sharing in a pilot exercise in the Civil Service which is being undertaken by consultants in clerical work measurement and improvement. The consultants began their assignment in August last and it will extend until next June.  If the results prove encouraging the question of extending the operation to other areas will be considered.  I am happy to say that we are receiving full co-operation from the staffs involved in the pilot exercise.</P>
    <P>My Department expects to order shortly a computer which will process work such as telephone accounts, savings bank, wages and stores accounting. A considerable proportion of this <Col N="924" /> work is already done by data processing machines.  In order to secure as soon as possible some of the economies of computerisation and to gain experience of computer working in advance of delivery of our own installation, my Department has arranged to avail temporarily from 1st April next of spare capacity in an Aer Lingus computer for the processing of certain work on the telephone side.</P>
    <P>The commercial accounts for 1967-68 and 1968-69 have been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The commercial accounts present the position of the Department as a trading concern.  They are compiled in accordance with commercial practice to show the expenditure incurred and the income earned during the year of account, such charges as interest and depreciation being included in the expenditure. A balance sheet and statement of assets gives details of the Department's very large capital investments, mainly in telephone plant. The accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of these accounts that we determine financial policy, including the fixing of charges.  The policy of successive Governments has been that the Post Office should pay its way, taking one year with another. That means that the Department must earn a surplus in good years to meet the losses in bad years and to provide a reserve against contingencies.  If the Post Office did not pay its way, the loss would have to be made good out of general taxation.</P>
    <P>In 1967-68 and 1968-69 there were overall losses on the Department's services of £467,000 and £825,000 respectively.  In both years there were deficits on the postal and telegraph services and a surplus on the telephone service.  The deficit in 1968-69 would have been greater but for the increased charges which were introduced from 1st January, 1969.</P>
    <P>In the current financial year these increases plus growth of business were expected to yield a modest surplus of income over expenditure of the order of four per cent.  However, the latest pay increases effective from 1st June last costing £1.5 million approximately and other cost increases are expected <Col N="925" /> to reduce that margin to about half per cent.  The present pay agreements expire on 31st March next and some claims are already in the pipeline.  It is apparent that in the labour-intensive postal service at least the question of further rate adjustment must arise.  My predecessor gave a clear warning to this effect in his statement on the Supplementary Estimate in March last. He pointed out that to cover the then existing deficit on postal working and provide a margin for contingencies would require a 7d. letter rate; and that if postal pay rates continued to rise&mdash; as they had been doing&mdash;much faster than postal traffic, further adjustment of postage rates would be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>In the meantime there has been the further pay increase to which I have referred above and the present position is that the postal service is running at a loss of the order of £1 million a year.  This, I must emphasise, is the situation now before the twelfth round which will inevitably raise postal and other Post Office costs substantially.  A very high percentage&mdash;no less than 77 per cent&mdash;of postal costs consist of staff charges and the scope for mechanisation and for increasing the productivity of the large labour force employed is extremely limited.  Each 1 per cent pay rise costs the service roughly £100,000 a year but there is no ready means of securing savings even of this amount without adversely affecting the quality of services.  As I have mentioned earlier, we have to provide extra postmen, delivery offices, etc. in expanding urban areas and to provide extra force to cover such improvements in working conditions as reduction in working hours.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is not possible to effect more than marginal savings in rural areas where the population is declining. We could undoubtedly reduce our costs by reducing the general standards of service which are high by international standards.  But the kind of economies required to produce worthwhile savings, for example, less frequent deliveries or restriction of house-to-house deliveries would certainly not be welcomed and it is doubtful whether they would be acceptable to the public as an alternative to higher charges. Moreover, substantial savings could <Col N="926" /> not be secured quickly particularly in rural areas without considerable disemployment. We have a problem here on which I would be glad to have the views of the House.  Although losses on the telegraph service have for long been regarded as unavoidable or at least as a fair charge against surpluses on the telephone service, it is clear that continuing deficits on the postal service as well cannot be accepted.</P>
    <P>In referring to improved pay and conditions as the predominant factor affecting the financial position of the service, I should like to make it clear that I am not opposed to such awards and improvements.  Quite the contrary. In so far as they are secured through the operation of conciliation and arbitration machinery, which operates largely by reference to comparisons with outside employment, I am glad to accept and implement them.</P>

      <P>As has been the practice I shall confine my remarks on broadcasting mainly to important issues and developments affecting the television and radio services and to matters in which, as Minister, I have a statutory responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount to be paid to the Broadcasting Authority under subhead K in respect of net revenue collected <Col N="927" /> in the form of licence fees is estimated at £2,000,000.  This takes account of a net overpayment of £140,000 to the authority last year which was caused by a short-fall in actual net receipts as compared with the amount of grant-in-aid that was paid.</P>
    <P>The authority's annual report for 1969 shows that in 1968-1969 the television service produced a profit of £566,384 which was offset by a deficit of £422,072 on radio.  The overall surplus was £144,312 as compared with £370,824 for the previous year.</P>
    <P>On the basis that £1 5s Od of each £5 licence fee is intended for the sound broadcasting service, a sum of £657,000 is being provided in the current financial year for radio and £1,343,000 for television.  The amount thus allocated to sound broadcasting, together with radio advertising revenue, will fall short of expenditure on that service in 1969-1970 and the deficit will be a charge against RTE's general revenue.  I understand that the authority will have difficulty in meeting expenditure on current account in the current financial year.  A small surplus was originally forecast but calculations were upset by a number of unforeseeable factors.  One such factor was the happenings in the Six Counties last autumn and the continuing unrest there which necessitated increased expenditure on northern news coverage without, of course, any corresponding increase in revenue.  Another upsetting development was the strike at RTE from 23rd January to 22nd February, 1970, and the pay settlement, retrospective to 1st July, 1969, which ended it.</P>
    <P>In their annual reports for 1968 and 1969 the authority have referred to their worsening financial situation. Last year my predecessor informed the House that the authority had formally sought an increase in broadcasting licence fees and that their application was being considered.  The application has not to date been acceded to.  The matter is, however, being kept under review in the light of the authority's costs/revenue position.</P>
    <P>The number of licences current at 31st December last was approximately <Col N="928" /> 593,500 made up of 433,000 combined and 160,500 sound only licences.  These figures include the free licences issued to certain old age pensioners, veterans of the War of Independence and British and Northern Ireland retirement pensioners over 70.  The fact that these licences are free does not affect RTE, as the fees are paid by the Departments of Social Welfare and Defence.  I should merely like to say in passing that between 1st July, 1968, when the scheme was introduced, and the end of December last a total of 47,000 licences, 28,000 combined and 19,000 sound, were issued free to eligible pensioners.</P>
    <P>A special drive against holders of unlicensed receiving sets mounted in October-November last resulted in the detection of 18,600 defaulters and it is estimated that approximately 70 per cent of 27,500 original combined and radio licences taken out during those two months were purchased as a result of the campaign.  There is little doubt that evasion on a fairly substantial scale still continues, and I have some special measures in mind to deal with these people who persist in refusing to pay their due share for the service. I had hoped that the latest in detection methods would be available to supplement the house-to-house calls made during the recent campaign.  A new TV detection van has recently been delivered and will soon be ready for service.  Full use of it will be made in town and country districts, with special reference to areas which were not fully covered during the October/ November drive.</P>
    <P>I wish to see the number of unlicensed sets reduced further.  My predecessor indicated that proposals for new legislation to help towards this end were being prepared.  The scheme has now reached an advanced stage and I hope before too long to have the Bill before the House.  It will contain provision for increased fines for defaulters and will require the maintenance of records by radio and television dealers and rental companies.</P>
    <P>Coming now to capital development schemes, expenditure by RTE during the year ended 31st March, 1969, amounted to £612,300 and was financed <Col N="929" /> without recourse to borrowing.  The programme included acquisition of a site adjacent to the Montrose premises, purchase of additional mobile television broadcasting equipment and provision of further transmitters and transposers to improve the national transmission network.  Because of their less favourable financial position in the current year, the authority have had to cut back on capital expenditure to about £500,000.  Some £200,000 of this is being borrowed from the superannuation fund.</P>
    <P>My predecessor mentioned in February last that when four subsidiary VHF transmitters at Moville, Fanad, Castletown-Berehaven and Cahirciveen were operational, VHF reception would then be available over 99 per cent of the country.  I now understand that the Moville and Cahirciveen satellites will be functioning in the latter part of this year&mdash;somewhat later than was hoped for.  Before establishing the remaining two satellites I understand that the authority is undertaking further experimentation in the matter of reception and sites.</P>
    <P>I receive complaints from time to time about unsatisfactory television reception in certain areas, mostly small areas individually which are not being satisfactorily covered either by the main transmitters or by existing transposers. The poor quality of reception in these areas has been the subject of Dáil questions from time to time.  The authority is very much alive to the problem of covering satisfactorily these &ldquo;pockets&rdquo; of difficulty which comprise about 2 per cent approximately of the area of the State.</P>
    <P>Following a survey carried out for the purpose of determining priorities, three main areas have been named for early attention.  The first of these is the Mayo/Galway region for which three transposer stations are planned. Two of these have been established&mdash; one near Castlebar and the second near Clifden&mdash;and they have been broadcasting on limited power since shortly before Christmas.  A full service should be available from these stations in I understand, a matter of months.  I am told that the third transposer which is intended to serve Achill should also <Col N="930" /> be ready in a few months.  The Castlebar transposer will cover an area stretching from Ballina in the north to Ballinrobe in the south and will cover the towns of Foxford, Swinford, Claremorris, Westport, Louisburg and Newport.  The Clifden transposer will take in the west coast of Connemara as far north as the southern tip of Achill Island and as far south as Lettermullen.  The Achill Island transposer will cover the island and the northern area, including Belmullet and Bangor.</P>
    <P>The second area which is in the planning stage at present is West Cork. It is intended to provide additional transposer stations next year at Glandore and Ballydehob.  The question of improving reception in other parts of west Cork is being examined.</P>
    <P>The Longford area is also on the short list for early attention and it is hoped to provide a transposer in about a year to serve it.</P>
    <P>Work is also being done or is proposed on the consolidation of the existing thirteen transposers.  This is aimed at improving existing installations and involves modifications to aerial patterns, <i>et cetera,</i> which will result in better coverage.  The Cork transposer station has been extensively modified.  Investigation has shown that a better service can be provided in certain parts of Waterford by modifying the radiation power of the Suir Valley transposer.  The work will be carried out this year.  This consolidation programme also includes the installation of duplicate equipment which will reduce the incidence of failures due to fault conditions.</P>
    <P>The provision of transposers must, of course, be kept within the authority's capacity to pay for them, and I understand that it has been found necessary to put back until next year some installations originally planned for 1970.  Coming to the very small &ldquo;pockets&rdquo;, particularly those surrounded by mountains, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to give completely satisfactory coverage.  The authority will decide the order in which additional transposers are to be provided and obviously one of the most important considerations to be taken <Col N="931" /> into account will be the numbers of population to be served.</P>
    <P>I have gone into this question of poor reception in some detail as, like every Member of the House, I want to see maximum coverage available to our viewers at the earliest possible date.  Before leaving it I propose to refer briefly to the question of reception of RTE's programmes in the Six Counties and in Britain.  It is often pointed out to me that external programmes are received here, and that it should be a simple matter to arrange satisfactory reception of our signals by viewers and listeners&mdash;especially our own exiles&mdash;outside the State.  The first answer that must be given is that the reason that we can get tolerable reception of external television programmes along our northern and eastern boundaries is our practice of erecting high roof-top aerials which can take such programmes directly off the air.  If such aerials, to acceptance of which we had become conditioned some years before Irish television commenced, were erected by viewers outside our borders, the penetration of RTE's programmes would be substantially extended.</P>
    <P>Another major factor affecting the issue is that we are bound by international agreements governing the wavelengths and transmission power that we use.  This is rather too complex a question to deal with here, but I should like Deputies to know that I am especially interested in this matter and I have had a special study of it put in train.  It is already clear to me, however, that, international agreements apart, there are serious technical and financial obstacles to any significant improvement.</P>
    <P>I am often asked how soon we will have colour television and I can only reiterate that no firm plans are at present under consideration for its introduction. The authority is continuing to conduct experimental test transmissions. The existing transmitters are readily adaptable for colour television when this becomes practicable, but colour is not high on the authority's priority list.  Radio Telefís Éireann has already said that it should be able to receive and rebroadcast the 1972 <Col N="932" /> Olympic Games in colour and there are also prospects that the network will also transmit the World Cup series in colour this year.</P>
    <P>In February, 1969, my predecessor referred to the very marked development which had taken place in the realm of programmes of the public service type.  He made special reference to the Telefís Scoile series which I am glad to say have been extended.  Programmes for schools are now being transmitted up to 6½ hours per week over the school year.  The total number planned is 306 representing about 153 hours of transmission as compared with 246 programmes of 123 hours of transmission last year.  The programmes have been arranged in consultation with the Department of Education and cover courses in Irish, English, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Geography and modern mathematics. I understand that the courses are being widely availed of.</P>
    <P>About six months ago I approved the authority's proposal to extend Sunday afternoon television transmission by three hours over eight months of the year&mdash;broadly from October to May.  RTE proposes to devote this extra time to re-runs of home-produced programmes&mdash;for example, the Dairying and Co-operation series shown in Telefís Feirme&mdash;to foreign language series and to such matters as business management and development and art appreciation programmes.  The authority feels that there is an unsatisfied demand for programmes of this specialised type, programmes which cannot easily be fitted into the regular daily programme schedule or which should be &ldquo;repeated&rdquo; to catch a wider audience. These new programmes which probably have only a minority following at present will, I expect attract an increasing number of discerning viewers before long.  RTE sees this as broadening the range of television output and giving a greater emphasis to instructional programmes.</P>
    <P>The question of providing sound broadcasting stations to cater for the Gaeltacht areas in particular and Irish speakers in general is being examined in Radio Telefís Éireann.  I do not know at this stage when a report on the study <Col N="933" /> with cost and other data will be available.</P>
    <P>On programming, although I have no responsibility for particular programmes and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to express my personal comments, I have in the course of informal meetings with members of the authority taken the opportunity of exchanging views with them.  What I think is not sufficiently appreciated by the general public is the difficulties the authority have in carrying out the tasks entrusted to them.  The resources available to them are tiny compared with those available to the wealthy organisations which operate the broadcasting services which compete with ours to a greater or lesser degree.  This is a problem the RTE Authority will always have with them because unfortunately little can be done to alter the position to any substantial extent.</P>
    <P>Current affairs programmes have&mdash; inevitably in a small country&mdash;been very much in the news during the year. The authority have a particularly difficult obligation laid on them to ensure objectivity and impartiality in this field. Herein, of course, lies one of the major problems facing all broadcasting organisations because opinions differ as to what constitute impartiality and objectivity.  It is clearly too much to expect that RTE should be able to avoid criticism in its treatment of current affairs programmes.  What is important, particularly for a national service like ours, is that the efforts to achieve and maintain satisfactory standards of balance and objectivity should be continued unremittingly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> Deputies will no doubt have read with interest my recent announcement that the regulations governing communal television aerials have been relaxed.  The principal decision taken was to extend the number of outlets per multi-channel communal aerial to a maximum of 500.  A licence will be required for each such system and it will be necessary for the equipment to conform to technical requirements fixed by my Department.  The intention is that licences will be issued to local authorities, owners or lessors of estates, residents' associations and other groups of a distinctively local character, and of course to Radio Telefís Éireann.  The general intention is to meet the needs of people particularly in new building schemes, who are not permitted or are not able to erect individual rooftop aerials.  The relaxation of the restriction in this regard does not however mean that the way is now clear for the piping or relay of outside programmes throughout the country.</P>
