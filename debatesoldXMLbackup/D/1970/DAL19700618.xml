      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Health Boards Regulations, 1970 a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 8 June, 1970.</P>
      <P>This motion arises under section 4 of the Health Act, 1970, which requires the Minister for Health to make regulations specifying the number, constitution and functional areas of the health boards which, under that Act, will become responsible for the administration of the health services.  For the convenience of the House I have, as undertaken during the debate on the Health Bill, circulated an explanatory memorandum outlining the details of this proposed change in the administration of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So as to give the whole picture, this explanatory memorandum also refers tentatively to the proposals under the Act for setting up certain other bodies&mdash;Comhairle na nOspidéal and the three regional hospital boards &mdash;which will be specially concerned in the efficient organisation and development of hospital services.  However, the motion before the House now does not relate to these special hospital bodies: separate regulations on them <Col N="1419" /> will be submitted later, after the details of their constitution and functions have been the subject of consultation with the hospital authorities, the teaching bodies, and the other interests which will be affected by them.  Accordingly, I will not in this statement refer further to them, but will treat solely of the establishment of the new health boards.</P>
    <P>The Act requires that, before the regulations setting up the health boards are made, the Minister must consult the Minister for Local Government and also each county council and county borough, corporation and the Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  In addition, consultation with the National Health Council is required by section 41 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>All these statutory consultations on the draft regulations have now been completed and in the case of Dublin City, the formal consultations with the corporation, in the person of the commissioner, were supplemented by informal discussions which I had with some of the Dublin City Deputies.  I have also consulted a number of other bodies, including those representing various professional interests.  Many bodies and hundreds of persons have taken part in these consultations.  I would like to place on record my appreciation of the interest which they have shown in the proposals and the work done by them.</P>
    <P>I will present to the House the result of these consultations, but before doing so I should, perhaps, say some general words on the considerations underlying my design of the areas and constitutions of the health boards.</P>
    <P>In choosing the functional areas of the health boards, I had to have regard first to what would be a reasonable area for administrative purposes, without having the centre of administration too remote from any large sector of the people served.  Clearly, in modern times this requirement can be met by having far larger administrative areas than when transport depended on the horse.  There was, of course, no hard and fast rule which we could follow but a practical consideration which was borne in mind was that the <Col N="1420" /> areas should be sufficiently compact so that a board member could attend a meeting without an overnight stay and also that staff could travel out from the headquarters to the rest of the area without spending too much time on travelling.</P>
    <P>I had also to consider whether county boundaries should be followed in all cases or whether some counties should be split between two boards. Tradition more than logic can be said to govern the lines between counties and there was a strong temptation to be logical in designing the health board areas at the expense of county integrity.  North Carlow is, perhaps, orientated most towards Dublin, parts of Kerry and South Tipperary towards Limerick and North Roscommon and the &ldquo;panhandle&rdquo; of Cavan might best be administered from Sligo.</P>
    <P>On closer study, however, I decided that such apparently logical moves would be unwise.  Each county is now a unit in the health services administration and it is better to build by combining these units and accepting whatever anomalies there may be in the boundaries.  This has the further decided advantage that it will ease the quite considerable transitional problems affecting the staffs of the present health authorities.</P>
    <P>I think that my decision to stick to county boundaries was generally welcomed by the local authorities.  Of course, this will not mean that, for hospital services for example, each health board area will have to be self-sufficient. There is nothing to stop arrangements being made for, say, North Roscommon patients to go to Sligo or for Carlow patients to go to Dublin.</P>
    <P>In choosing the particular areas set out in the draft regulations, I had regard also to existing regions for other purposes.  There are regional systems at present for local government planning, for Bord Fáilte, for the Electricity Supply Board and for some other purposes. In general, the pattern of these indicates that the number which I have chosen, eight, seems about right.  In particular, I tried not to depart from the local government planning regions except for very good reasons.  In fact, <Col N="1421" /> the health board areas differ from the planning regions only in that Roscommon is associated with the west rather than the midlands, that Meath is associated with Louth, Cavan and Monaghan rather than Dublin and that Donegal, instead of forming a separate region, is associated with Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the constitutions of the health boards have, perhaps, given rise to more interest and controversy than the choice of the eight areas &mdash;understandable controversy.  I should mention, seeing that all involved were anxious to obtain the greatest possible representation.  Local authorities wished their members to form a substantial majority on each of the new boards, while the medical profession pressed for strong representation.  Representation was sought too by a large number of para-medical groups.  If I had agreed to meet fully the wishes of all interests, each board would have blossomed in numbers into a mini-Dáil.</P>
    <P>Now, one cannot state a hard and fast rule for the ideal number of members for a board, but a body which is an executive agency, such as the health boards will be, becomes less effective if its membership is too big. I took the pragmatic view, therefore, that if the members of the board were to form an effective body, they should not exceed about 30 in number.  This decision meant that I was unable to accede to requests from many quarters for representation or an increase in representation but, after considering the various views expressed on the constitution of the boards, I did manage to make some concessions which I will refer to in my detailed comments on each of the areas.</P>
    <P>The National Health Council and a number of the county councils made the point that there should be provision for the professional representation on the board to be spread equitably over the constituent counties.  I sympathise with this point of view and intend, in the constitution of the first board and in the regulations governing election to subsequent boards, to see if I can meet it to some extent.  However, any exact geographical distribution of professional representation will be difficult <Col N="1422" /> to achieve, seeing that, in the appointment of professional representatives, the main endeavour will have to be in getting a good spread of doctors among the different categories of the profession and in securing the professional people best qualified to act on the board.  It should be borne in mind, too, that the Minister, in choosing his three nominees to each of the boards, will have a chance to redress or reduce any geographical imbalance which results after the appointment or election of the professional representatives.</P>
    <P>I will now refer briefly to the proposals for each of the boards.  I should mention that, while the statutory consultations with local authorities took place in the months following the enactment of the Health Bill, I had already had informal contacts with representatives of all the local authorities concerned, before the Bill was passed, on tentative proposals which I had then circulated.  What was said during those informal discussions was borne in mind and a number of changes were made in the draft regulations before they were sent out for the purpose of the formal consultations. Hence, the scope for further changes arising from the statutory consultations was limited but I did manage to make some further concessions to local points of view.</P>
    <P>The population to be covered by the proposed Eastern Health Board&mdash;&mdash; 921,000&mdash;is by far the largest and the constitution of this board presented, perhaps, the greatest problems. Clearly, if local representation on this board were to be in proportion to population, then Dublin would have had such a preponderant number of members that Kildare and Wicklow would have an insignificant say in the work of the board.  In relation to this area and others I took a pragmatic line that representation of each county or borough could not be in simple proportion to its population, but that, where there were big differences in population, the larger authorities should have some additional weighting in their representation.</P>
    <P>My original proposal was for a somewhat smaller number of members than the 35 proposed in the <Col N="1423" /> draft regulations.  I have accepted an increase in the total number beyond what I would regard as the optimum in an endeavour to reach a compromise with the local authorities.  I should mention that, in this area, the five authorities concerned took a commendable initiative in meeting to agree among themselves on their representation on the board.  They agreed on a total representation of 23.  I did not fully accept this and the total local authority representation of 19 which I propose is a compromise between this and my original proposal for a total of 16.</P>
    <P>Kildare and Wicklow each pressed very strongly for four members, instead of three.  Wicklow County Council mentioned the peculiar geography of the county and thought that their representatives would have to number four if members of the public were to have a reasonable chance to contact them. In refusing these requests, I had regard to the relatively small populations of Kildare and Wicklow Counties when compared with Dublin, and to the fact that each of the counties will have a local committee on which many of the councillors will serve and maintain contact with the operation of the services.</P>
    <P>The four county councils concerned in the Midland Health Board&mdash;Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath&mdash; were reasonably satisfied with the proposed representation, although Westmeath County Council would have preferred to have five nominees on the board, having regard to its expectations of growth in population in that county.  The present population of Westmeath is about the same as that of Offaly.  If this proportion changes in the future, there could be an adjustment in the representation on the health board but there is no present justification for giving Westmeath higher representation.</P>
    <P>In the mid-western area, I had proposed to the local authorities that Clare County Council should nominate four members, Tipperary (North Riding) County Council should nominate four and Limerick City Corporation and County Council three each.  Limerick <Col N="1424" /> County Council made a strong recommendation that, on the basis of its population <i>vis-à-vis</i> Clare and North Tipperary, it was entitled also to four members.  I conceded this, bearing in mind that the total representation of seven from the Limerick area would still be below the total for the other two counties.  Clare asked for an additional member also, but I could not see my way to agree to this, bearing in mind the populations served by each of the three county councils concerned.</P>
    <P>The four counties concerned with the North-Eastern Health Board&mdash; Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan &mdash;have expressed themselves as satisfied with the proposals in the draft regulations.  This, I might mention, is one of the areas where there is a departure from the local government planning regions.  I decided that it was more appropriate that Meath, instead of being associated for health purposes with Dublin, should be associated with Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, particularly having regard to the existence of the major hospital centre in Drogheda.  The Meath County Council agree with me in this.</P>
    <P>For the North-Western Health Board, it is proposed to allocate six members to the Donegal County Council and four each to the Leitrim and Sligo County Councils.  Donegal represented to me that at least 50 per cent of the membership of the board, including the professional and other representatives, should be from Donegal.  While this might be justified on the basis of the populations of the three counties&mdash;Donegal's population is 109,000, as against a total of 82,000 for Leitrim and Sligo&mdash;I do not think that it would be desirable that any one county should have an overall majority in the membership of any board.  I accordingly regret that I cannot meet the wishes of Donegal in this respect. Sligo and Leitrim, I should mention, showed uneasiness that, in the selection of professional representatives, Donegal would achieve a preponderance and, as I mentioned in my general comments, I am considering how this could be avoided.</P>
    <P>The constitution of the board for the <Col N="1425" /> south-eastern area, which includes five counties and the City of Waterford, presented special difficulty.</P>
    <P>I should mention that, in the first place, Carlow County Council wished to opt out of this area and be associated with the Eastern Health Board.  I met a deputation from the county council on this matter and explained to them that I could not accept this change.  The reasons for this were that the population served by the Eastern Health Board as at present proposed was so big that it would be undesirable to add to it, and that Carlow, by reason of its small population, would have very little say if it were in the eastern board.  This county is in rather an unusual position, in that the town of Carlow and its environs are at least as convenient to Dublin as they would be to, say, Waterford but, if one rejects the solution of splitting Carlow county, I think that the logical place for it is in the south-east.  As I mentioned earlier, there will be nothing to stop an arrangement being made for Carlow patients to continue to go to Dublin hospitals.</P>
    <P>In their views on the draft regulations, Carlow County Council indicated that they were agreeable to go into the south-east only on the understanding that the major hospital for the area would be in Kilkenny.  I am afraid that I could not give any undertaking about this, as a decision on the major hospital areas in the country must await very full examination of the merits of the different possibilities.</P>
    <P>Each of the other local authorities concerned in this area have asked that their representation on the board be increased beyond the figure which I proposed.  I have examined their representations very fully but I do not think that the representation for any one authority could be increased without adjusting those for the others and, if they were all adjusted, the total membership of the board would go far above the figure which I regard as the optimum.  I have not, therefore, found it possible to make any concession to the views of the local authorities in relation to representation on the board in this area.  It is a fact of geography that the south-eastern area as we now <Col N="1426" /> propose it is a logical administrative entity; it is accepted as such as a local government region and by Bord Fáilte.  The small representation from each county on the health board for the area derives from the fact of there being so many local authorities in it and I can see no way of constituting a viable health board for the area except by having but a few from each county.</P>
    <P>The area of the Southern Health Board will cover Cork and Kerry. Kerry County Council had first proposed that there should be two boards, one for each of the counties, but I could not accept this, as I would not regard Kerry County as having a population sufficient to justify its having a health board of its own.  Suggestions were also made that it would be more appropriate for North Kerry to be associated with Limerick than with Cork, but I rejected any idea of splitting County Kerry in designing the areas for the health boards.  For one thing any such split would have made the proposition for having a large general hospital in Tralee, which is now proceeding, a doubtful one. Looking at the picture as a whole, I think that it is better that the whole of Kerry should be associated with Cork rather than with Limerick.  The Tralee hospital must become intimately involved with the large general hospital which is being planned for Cork and this can best be done by having the two counties together within the one health board.</P>
    <P>I originally proposed representation on this board of four for Cork Corporation, six for Cork County Council and five for Kerry County Council. This would have given none of the local authorities an absolute majority, but would give Cork city and county which have a population of 340,000 as against Kerry's 113,000, a two-to-one majority on the board.  Cork Corporation asked that their representation should be increased from four to five members and Cork County Council requested an increase in representation from six to seven members.  Kerry asked that their representation should equal the total for Cork city and county.  I have increased the Cork representation <Col N="1427" /> to meet the views of the two local authorities there and have increased the Kerry County Council to six so as to keep the proportion of representation the same.  I could not agree that Kerry is entitled to equal representation with Cork, having regard to the respective populations. Kerry County Council also asked that the Tralee Urban District Council should be entitled to representation on the board.  There is no provision for this in the Act.  They asked, too, that four or five of the doctors on the board should come from Kerry.  I agree that Kerry should have its fair share of the medical representatives and, as indicated earlier, propose to arrange accordingly, but I see no reason why this county should have a majority of the medical representatives, as the county council have proposed.</P>
    <P>The Kerry County Council asked that the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board should be from Kerry.  I would, of course, be in no position to comply with this request, even if I agreed that it was reasonable. The selection of the chief executive officer for the board will be a matter for the Local Appointments Commissioners and Kerry must take its chance on what county the person selected by the commissioners will be from&mdash;just as the counties within the area of any other health board must take their chance on whether a person from Kerry or elsewhere is appointed as their chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>Following the informal consultations, I had increased the local authority representation on the Western Health Board to six for Galway, five for Mayo and four for Roscommon.  Galway and Roscommon accept this but Mayo have asked that they should have six representatives.  I do not think that this would be reasonable, seeing that the population of Galway is considerably bigger than Mayo and that it has the major hospital centre of the area.  Mayo and Roscommon made some points also in relation to the medical representation on the board. I will bear these in mind.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat what I stated <Col N="1428" /> during the debate on the Committee Stage of the Health Bill, that, while the county and county borough council representation on the health boards is, of course, democratically sound, I feel certain that, once established, all the members of a board will think collectively for the general good of the whole area served.  I confidently expect that the contributions of local authority and professional members alike will be positive and not negative, in the sense of trying to weaken the health structure in any part of the board's area.</P>
    <P>The local advisory committees, which will examine the actual record of health services, current and developing in their areas, should be the spurs for any promotional policy required to maintain the principle of fair shares in the development of health policy.  I also expect that, through the delegation of day-to-day administrative matters and by the formation of executive committees, the health board's operations will be discharged more efficiently.</P>
    <P>This then is a summary of the views expressed by local authorities on the proposals in the regulations.  I hope from what I have said that the House will accept that the points made in each area have been very fully considered and that what is now presented in the draft regulations is the best compromise I can offer between the local views and the essential needs of the new administration.</P>
    <P>Deputies, I feel sure, will agree with me that almost any appeal for augmenting the number of local authority representatives from one county would be contested by other local authorities in the area and this would result in stalemate.</P>
    <P>I can report that the National Health Council, when consulted on the draft regulations, expressed agreement with them.  There was also statutory consultation with the Minister for Local Government who has offered no objection to my proposals.</P>
    <P>A number of the authorities expressed views on other local matters arising under the Health Act which do not relate to the draft regulations before <Col N="1429" /> the House.  I have not as yet had an opportunity to consider all of these points but will do so and communicate with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The draft presented represents what I, following the very full consultations which I have outlined above, consider to be the most effective pattern at this point of time for the administration of health services in accordance with the 1970 Act.  What is now proposed is not inmutable and, if the administrative needs of the services change, new regulations can be brought in at a later date, when the full effects of the change in administration can be seen in perspective.  For the present, I would ask that this House should approve of the draft of the Health Boards Regulations as now presented to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments on the Minister's statement will be brief because there are other Members here who, when the 1970 Health Bill was being discussed in the Dáil, made sensible and constructive contributions to that debate and I am sure they wish to speak now.</P>
      <P>I do not approve of what the Minister is asking us to do in regard to the health boards regulations.  More than once, both inside and outside this House, I have expressed the view that I have a sneaking suspicion of all the take-overs that are occurring all too frequently in this country.  Here, another attempt is being made to take away the powers of the local representatives. I believe that the county councils&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. I had a very agreeable debate with the House on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  Surely the principle of the establishment of regional boards has already been accepted by the Dáil and, indeed, welcomed by people from all parties?  We could have a debate lasting for days and days if we discussed now the principle of regionalisation.  I hope the House will co-operate with me as I co-operated with the House that the debate today should consist in discussing the constitution of the boards the principle having already been accepted.  I think that is a reasonable <Col N="1430" /> comment on my part and I would ask for your direction on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have dealt with the matter long ago had the Minister not made a speech.  I was referring to the fact that this is not the best way to run the health services.  For example, seven members of Cork County Council will be appointed to the southern health board.  That board will cover Cork and Kerry.  How seven members out of the 46 members of Cork County Council, all sensible, sober, decent men, can effectively account for the people of Cork city and county under the health service regulations is something that puzzles me. <Col N="1431" /> I believe this principle to be wrong. You have Dublin and Wicklow comprised in one area, with some 35 members representing nearly 1,000,000 people.  The health services involve practically all the community daily one way or another and this is too personal a thing altogether; too few members will be dealing with too many people.</P>
      <P>The last sentence in the Minister's opening speech is the most sensible one in it in that he says: &ldquo;What is now proposed is not immutable ....&rdquo; Things can be changed.  I think time will prove, as many people believe now, that the representation on these boards will not be satisfactory for the efficient running of the health services. I cannot understand why the Minister has decided that he will appoint on the first board all those who are not elected representatives.  Is that not what will happen with the first board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Perhaps, the Deputy did not understand.  We will ask the members of the various professions to nominate members on a non-statutory, informal basis to the first board.  I appoint only three.  Later, there will be much more elaborate statutory regulations whereby professional representatives will be appointed on a firm legal system.  I appoint only whatever numbers are indicated as ministerial nominees.  The rest will be appointed in an informal way by the professional organisations concerned within the health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I think the Minister is asking too much when he reserves the right to himself to appoint three members to each board.  Is it not true that all the good medical practitioners and all the good surgeons will be so busy they will not have time to attend meetings of this board which, as good members, they would be expected to attend?  Therefore, the best will not find their way on to these boards.  These meetings are held in the day time and, therefore, a great many of these people will be unable to attend.  They will be prohibited from doing so because of their activities in their professions.  The <Col N="1432" /> ordinary people will not have the voice they should have in a service for which they are paying so much both directly and indirectly.  The time is not far distant when these regulations will have to be changed and, when that day comes.  I hope that whatever Government is in power and whatever Minister for Health is in office will not be slow to change the regulations if time proves, as I believe it will, that they should be changed.</P>
      <P>I will watch with interest the activities of these boards.  I hope all their energies will be directed towards helping those unfortunate people who need health services, some of them daily health services.  I hope the boards will set about their work in a most efficient, impartial and honest manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <P>We welcome the establishment of the regional board. Anybody who has any experience at all of organising services for large population groups knows quite well that the old county boundaries, whatever their origin, can no longer be justified on grounds of administration or efficiency from the point of view of the utilisation of personnel, buildings and equipment.  There may be a certain amount of regret because of a loss of local power and local autonomy and the Minister will obviously find a certain amount of resentment on the part of local representatives.  I believe, however, that most of them when they get down to thinking about their real function, which is the creation of the most efficient health services possible, will readily understand that these can only be organised through the creation of regional units.  In olden days, when communications were very poor, the county hospital building programme was completely justified and not only because of deficiencies in communication but also because of the type of medicine and surgical practice at the time.  Things have changed very much now.  There are good communications between the various regions in the country, particularly in the arterial roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, the whole practice of medicine and surgery has changed in a very fundamental way in so far as there has been the development of <Col N="1433" /> specialisation&mdash;specialisation meaning that one simply could not afford to appoint a specialist, <i>per se</i>, to a single county hospital.  There has to be the peripatetic consultant who travels around three or four areas serving three or four health authorities in order to get the optimum use from his knowledge and experience and from the very costly equipment he probably will be using&mdash;operating theatres, diagnostic and treatment equipment of one kind or another.  To get the optimum use, from the community's point of view, from both personnel and equipment, you have to adopt this type of regional grouping system.  Again, we are trailing after many countries, particularly Britain.  During wartime, the system was that the surgeon travelled around three or four hospitals, visited many clinics, and there was a complete blurring of the county boundaries. We welcome this.  We accept the Minister's assurance as to the flexibility of his own attitude to it at the present time.  I think he will always have the problem of the overlapping&mdash;whether the ambulance should go 200 yards down the road if it belongs to a different county; whether a person has access to a hospital which is almost next door or must go to one 40 miles away which is within his administrative area.  These kinds of dilemmas will exist.  I should imagine they will greatly be reduced when the regional boards are established.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be possible to give the maximum amount of autonomy to these regional boards.  One of the sad processes of time here, over the past 50 years, has been the failure to achieve effective devolution of power from the centre.  On the contrary, power has gradually percolated back up.  Having attempted, away back, to get distribution of power throughout the community and, in that way, to try to educate people into a sense of responsibility for taking decisions in regard to their own affairs in local areas because of reasons which were then sound, I suppose&mdash;the fairly high level of inefficiency, failure to accept responsibilities in some of the local authorities for the provision of essential services and sometimes, indeed, corrupt practices of one kind or <Col N="1434" /> another&mdash;the managerial system was then imposed on the community.  I wonder if that phase has not passed now and if we might not attempt to re-educate our community into the establishment of a conscientiousness of group responsibility based on this type of much larger regional area.  I think the area where this is most obvious will be the spending of money, the budget.  I wonder what the Minister will do about the local budgets of these regional groups.  Will he try to achieve a standardisation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might deal with this?  To what extent will the regional authorities have the right to determine the budgets and the spending of the money which he allocates to them?  In attempting to establish regional groups, my concern is that, by attempting to keep too close control over them, he will maintain the central authority of the Department of Health which at present persists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We find here that the budgets must be approved by the Minister. To what extent will the Minister examine those budgets in detail or give a global figure and say, in effect: &ldquo;Spend within that global figure&rdquo;? That is a very important consideration. Ideally, the regional authority should be trusted with the global figure and then each of them developed in the way which best suits their particular areas.  The key to the development of regional autonomy will depend on the attitude the Minister adopts in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the making of appointments to the various authorities, Comhairle na nOspidéal will have responsibility for the regulation of the number and types of appointments, the specified qualifications, and so on&mdash;presumably, with the consent of the Department.  That is not very much changed.  But the Minister is going to leave the selection procedure for the appointment of staff to <Col N="1435" /> these institutions to the Local Appointments Commission until he has worked out some other procedure.  I wonder if he has any further details on the type of procedure he has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to do it stage by stage.  There is a time limit to everything. The most urgent thing is to set up the health boards.  They could operate without the regional hospital boards but, in fact, the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal will be set up by 1st April, 1971, and all the matters of which the Deputy speaks can be the subject of full discussion in the Dáil at a later date.  Today, we are dealing only with the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would help us if we had some indication of the way the Minister is thinking in relation to the replacement of the Local Appointments Commission by some other body.  In so far as it is referred to here, it seems perfectly permissible for us to ask him these questions.  I do not think the Minister should be so impatient of these queries.  They are made in relation to the Health Act, by all of us here <i>bona fide</i> in an attempt to help him in his difficult task of trying to establish these regional health boards and not for any other purpose whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in what the Minister proposes to do in regard to making appointments to the voluntary hospitals.  I referred to this before and I did not get a satisfactory answer. Will they be covered by the new appointing authority?  In relation to the Local Appointments Commission <Col N="1436" /> and the appointing of the personnel to the regional boards, I do not know if the Minister knows it but, at present, pending the formation of the regional boards and the appointment of the administrative and managerial personnel, a sense that the existing authorities are unwilling to commit themselves on fundamental decisions on policy has tended to develop.  I wonder if the Minister knows that? Secondly, how long does he think it will take if he is appointing either the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission to appoint the personnel to these boards?  Has he any idea whether he can expedite the formation of these boards, properly constituted, so that there will be the minimum delay in the establishment of these regional authorities?  As he probably knows, there are tedious delays in the making of these appointments by the existing methods.</P>
    <P>Could I ask the Minister about the Hospitals Commission?  What happens to the secretary and the permanent members of the Hospitals Commission? Will they take up a new function, or will they be replaced by any of the proposed boards?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That also is dealt with in the Bill.  It is also dealt with in paragraph 30 of the Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I do not know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  What happens to the part-time members of the Hospitals Commission?  Have they any further rights or do their appointments simply lapse as a result of the creation of the new regional boards? The Minister says that it is not mandatory <Col N="1437" /> to take the advice of the advisory boards.  They will simply give advice to the regional boards who will not necessarily have to accept it.  This is a very important consideration because the responsibility for the spending of money should rest to the greatest possible extent with the local representatives.  To that extent no reduction in their powers should be permitted by its dilution by giving to the advisory boards anything other than the right to make recommendations with no power whatsoever to see that those recommendations are carried out.</P>
      <P>The control of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum leaves the Minister for Health and goes to the eastern regional board.  Does the Minister indicate to the eastern regional board what specific function he has in relation to the Central Mental Hospital or does the eastern regional board decide that for itself?  What happens to the present inmates of the Central Mental Hospital?</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the creation of these regional boards.  It is most important that the Dáil should have an opportunity of discussing the proposed procedures fully because, while I know it is a very delicate change, the transition of the voluntary organisations and the voluntary hospitals into the local authority system has taken place over the past 30 or 40 years and, in recent years, has been greatly expedited by the fact that practically all the money going to these places is public money.  The old system of appointments to the voluntary hospitals should be overhauled and brought up to the level which we all accept for the making of appointments to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give careful consideration to this matter and bear in mind that the taxpayer or the ratepayer will expect to have certain rights in relation to the ordering and running of these institutions.  The voluntary hospitals have rights because they established these institutions in the first place, and provided this service efficiently over the years but, just as the member of the local authority or the country council must accept a certain loss of power and loss of authority in his area, similarly we can expect the <Col N="1438" /> same kind of co-operation from the various voluntary hospitals and voluntary health groups who will in the future be helping us to run the local authority services and who will expect to be paid by the local authority for the running of these services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will recall that when the Bill was being discussed in the House, he pleaded with us again and again not to pursue certain lines of discussion because we would have an opportunity later for a full debate on the matters then being discussed.  The Minister will understand, therefore, our disappointment this morning on seeing him intervene while Deputy Barry was speaking with the suggestion that we should not have the full discussion which the Minister had promised again and again we would have when the regulations came before the House.  While Deputy Dr. Browne was speaking the Minister again assured him that he need not pursue the matter now because we would have an opportunity later for a full discussion.  I would ask the Minister to note the contradiction which appears to arise in the assurances which he has given about a fuller discussion later on when, now that we have the first opportunity for a fuller discussion, the Minister seeks to limit the scope of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister referred to the fact that on his own initiative he had some consultation with some Deputies from the eastern region.  The first of these was, unfortunately, called at very limited notice of only three-quarters of an hour and it was impossible for several people who would like to go to avail of such an invitation.  I should like to assure the Minister that my absence from the subsequent meeting was not due to any sense of umbrage but apparently there was some failure in communication and I was out of the country at a Council of Europe meeting dealing with drug addiction when the Minister's subsequent meeting took place.  I gather that the attendance from my party was small but, apparently, there was some difficulty in communications and I should like to assure the Minister that we intended <Col N="1439" /> no offence.  We did and do appreciate very much the fact that he extended the courtesy to us of discussing the problem of the eastern region.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had to exercise the judgment of Solomon in the distribution of appointments on the new health boards.  The Minister will recall that when Solomon pronounced his famous judgment the rightful mother of the child was very displeased and the wrongful claimant was very pleased.  This morning I feel that people with the right approach to this matter will fault the Minister's judgment while those with the wrong approach may consider him to be right.  The Minister has given representation to the medical profession and the nursing profession and one does not criticise him for doing so.  Although he did yield in the course of the debate on the Bill to give a majority to local authority representatives, he has given them a simple majority of one.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities have no right to be on these or any other bodies except in so far as they represent the people who pay the rates and taxes and are entitled to the services. Health services are intended to benefit human beings and they are entitled to adequate representation.  It is not a question of satisfying the personal pride of people who have been elected by the people to represent them on local authorities.  The status of the people has been downgraded in these new health boards.  They are not being given adequate representation and this will result in two shortcomings, one, that the essential personal nature of health services will be overlooked and two, inadequate attention will be given to the provision of health services in the home.  The domiciliary end of health services which should be the growing one and the one to receive most attention is likely to be overlooked when our health services are to be supervised by boards which, to a large extent, will draw their membership from people who are concerned with the administration of institutions rather than with the end product of medical services in the homes of hundreds or thousands of people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> In particular we must regard the Eastern Health Board as too big.  It has been established by research work abroad that the optimum population for a health region should be 250,000 people.  Yet the Minister proposes in his draft regulations to have an Eastern Health Board which, according to the 1966 census, will provide for a population of 921,000, a population which on all the indications before the next census will have reached 979,000 and within a matter of the next five or six years will have gone in excess of the one million mark.  The Eastern Health Board has a region of responsibility which is four times greater in population than research workers and enlightened experience elsewhere would regard as desirable.  This we consider to be a grave mistake.</P>
    <P>Not only has it within its own immediate area or it will have within that area over one million people in the immediate future but it also has the preponderance of hospitals in the country and it draws its patients from all parts of the 32 Counties.  So that the responsibility of this health board will be not only for the provision of services for its own one million within its own confines but it will also be to ensure that hospital and other services are maintained in the best condition and run most efficiently to cater for probably 1½ million people who will resort to it from time to time.  Therefore, we regret the Minister has not seen the wisdom of dividing the Eastern Health Board region at least in two.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that to divide the hospital services, for instance in Dublin city, might not be the best way of providing for the administration of these hospitals but to have two separate health boards within the area of the proposed Eastern Health Board would not deprive either of the opportunity of sending patients from one half of the board area to another.  As the Minister has correctly pointed out, the fact that Carlow is to go into the south-eastern health region is no reason why patients from north Carlow would not be sent to Dublin.  He expects that will necessarily occur.  There certainly would have been every opportunity for ample mobility of patients within the <Col N="1441" /> two half-regions of the Eastern Health Board if the Minister had only divided it but he has now created a monster of a health board which is far removed from that which we understood was intended when the Health Bill was being brought into operation.  On the Minister's own admission it is nearly four times greater than what he considers to be the suitable figure to attain. We believe he has done a grave disservice to the people who live in Dublin and the adjoining counties of Kildare and Wicklow in creating this giant which, we believe, will not provide the personal services which are very necessary if our health services are to be helpful and meaningful. The new area in the eastern region appears to be trimmed to suit administrative convenience only.  It is certainly not suited to the need of the people who live in the east of the country.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations provide that the people of Dublin city whose population now exceeds 650,000 shall be represented by only seven representatives. Out of a total population of 921,000 two-thirds of it will have only seven representatives and the adjoining areas with a population only one-third that of Dublin are to have in all 12 representatives.  This is not equitable particularly when the financial contribution of the area containing two-thirds of the population is nearly four times that of the remainder.  Appreciating all the Minister has said about the difficulty of giving proportionate representation and appreciating that some disadvantage might have to be suffered by the area with the greatest density of population, we consider that the Minister has erred very much against the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>At present the functions of the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, aldermen and burgesses of Dublin are discharged by a commissioner appointed by the Minister for Local Government.  I would ask the Minister to confirm if we are right in interpreting the new Health Act to mean that the commistioner would have power to appoint seven persons to the new Eastern Health Board to represent the Dublin Corporation.  The Act provides that in the appointment of members of health boards local authorities may form <Col N="1442" /> groups and that groups may nominate members of the local authority for membership of a health board.  The Act goes on to say that other persons may be appointed by a local authority by operating the majority system of voting amongst those local authorities who do not form groups for the purpose of making nominations.  This would appear to entitle the commissioner to appoint seven persons to the new Eastern Health Board.  If we are right in this we would urge that such appointments be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It may help the Deputy and may also relieve the minds of other Deputies from Dublin if I say I have got agreement from the Minister for Local Government that he will make arrangements under his powers to appoint seven people, and, of course, they will have to be politically on a fair and representative basis.  One of the ways of doing it is actually to appoint Deputies.  Anyway the Deputy can be assured the Minister for Local Government has agreed that in respect of the Eastern Health Board he will have the power under the relevant Act to appoint some persons to represent Dublin Corporation, and I can assure the House it will be done on a fair and equitable basis from the point of view of the interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is good news and, subject to seeing the Minister's nominees, we welcome this gesture.  If a new regional health board is to be successful at all it must have full representation from the very beginning, and it is only proper that those who are in communication with the people in the area through their political activities should have full representation on this board.  In making the choice the Minister for Local Government should be guided by the experience of the past and he might, perhaps, consider appointing TDs and TCs who have had experience of the old Dublin Health Authority. There are many TDs and councillors from all parties who have served loyally on the Dublin Health Authority and on the old board of health before that, and I believe they have a great deal to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the commissioner has been unable to devote sufficient <Col N="1443" /> time to the workings of the existing Dublin Health Authority which has a smaller area and is a smaller responsibility than that which it is proposed to entrust to the Eastern Health Board.  As a result, several members of the presently defunct city council have been invited back to play their part as members of visiting committees.  In fact, most of those who were so invited have accepted the appointments and are working.  This is a fair indication of the fact that there are in Ireland many people who are prepared to assist the community even though they do not get the recognition of status or the right to wear robes or adopt the other trappings of office in relation to those duties.  I would, therefore, renew my appreciation of the fact that it is proposed to appoint to the new regional health board people who will represent the citizens of Dublin.  However, I emphasise again they should be people who have served in the past because they will bring the best knowledge to bear on the work for the future and they are in the best position to be of assistance.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention briefly the problems which will arise for staffs of the various local authorities.  I know the Act provides that no employees may have their conditions of service in any way worsened by reason of the establishment of new health boards, but it does seem to me that a problem will arise for employees of existing health authorities who find themselves transferred to these new super bodies which will have areas of greater extent than local authorities have at the present time.  For instance, you could have an employee of the Wexford County Council, who at the moment is liable for transfer only within the borders of Wexford, on the creation of the new south-eastern region, being required to transfer to Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary (South Riding).  There are many who, apart from being direct employees of the local authorities, have appointments in hospitals and have built their homes and their families have set down their roots in particular communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We went through <Col N="1444" /> that in detail on the Bill, and I gave an assurance in that respect.  It does not arise on these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I say it does arise to this extent.  We could argue that all these areas which the Minister is proposing be halved in size in order to lessen the difficulty which could arise by reason of the transfer. Therefore, it is very proper that we should on these draft regulations mention this problem.  It is an argument against having bodies which are too big, because, as I mentioned earlier, they have medical disadvantages, social disadvantages and also disadvantages for the staff.  We ought to be concerned in the drafting of these regulations to try to reduce these disadvantages, and that was the purport of my remarks.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Bill several Members urged that industrial democracy should operate in the formation of these new health boards, and the argument from many sides of the House was that representation should be given on the new health boards to the non-medical staffs of local authorities.  We notice that no representation has been given to these people in appointments which the Minister is proposing to make.  It will be open to the Minister, apparently, to select some non-medical person for appointment under the three which he has reserved to himself.  We would urge him to do so.  It is a pity, however, he has not made arrangements within the regulations themselves to ensure that such representation will be given.</P>
      <P>We appreciate that the Minister has a difficult task and that he did his best according to his lights.  I have no doubt that were each Member of this House to be given the task each would probably come up with some different choice.  It is only in the light of experience that we shall know who is right and who is wrong.  One can only hope that wisdom will prevail and that such changes as will be necessary will be made from time to time.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House asking that the Health Board Regulations, 1970, be approved arises from the Health Act, 1970, which, as <Col N="1445" /> the Minister said, was discussed at considerable length in this House.  Many of us took part in those discussions, some of which were quite detailed.  We on this side of the House had fundamental objections to that legislation, but that time has gone and the Act is now passed.  What we are being asked to do here this morning is to approve of the first move, as we may describe it, in the implementation of the provisions of that Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that we did not find him unreasonable in the course of the discussions.  That is quite true. Unlike any of his colleagues in the Cabinet he came quite a part of the way to meet the views of the Opposition. My opinion is that the legislation has been improved very much because of his attitude and because of the helpful attitude and desire of everybody to get the best possible health services under the circumstances.  The Minister referred also to the consultations which have taken place since the Act was passed and, like Deputy Ryan, I want to express my regret in relation to the eastern region that I was not in on these discussions.  I do not hold the Minister responsible for that.  Something went wrong in the arranging of these meetings and while there were two attempts to do it it was badly done in the finish and some of us who would have liked very much to have been present were not present.  Certain compromises have been made, as the Minister said, and these compromises have gone at least some way to meet the objections of the various local authorities in relation to representation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the enormous size of the eastern regional board.  This is something we discussed at considerable length but it is no harm to justify again the increase of one in Dublin county and in the Dublin region generally.  At the moment the Dublin Health Authority cater for one-quarter of the population and with the added two counties the eastern region will be catering for approximately one-third of the population and it will have approximately 31 per cent of the total budget.  When one has regard to the fact that for the Dublin Health Authority <Col N="1446" /> the present budget is approximately £14½ milion one gets some idea of the enormous responsibility that is now thrown on to the eastern regional board.  I can understand the Minister's great difficulty in acceding to the request of Carlow County Council.  They wanted to adhere to the Dublin region. Because of the already enormous size of the Dublin region it was felt that it was already too big.  I quoted the advice I got from an American expert who at that time said that the optimum number in a group that should be catered for for health services was 250,000.</P>
    <P>We have arrangements well under way in Dublin county alone to provide probably within ten or 15 years for populations in three areas each of which will have a bigger population than Cork.  The Minister said that if it was found that the representation is not right for the various areas this can be increased.  Can this be increased by ministerial regulation or will it require legislation to make these very necessary adjustments?</P>

      <P>That makes it easier because if we had to have fresh legislation we would be having it much sooner than anyone of us would like.</P>
      <P>One consolation for many areas is the fact that they can continue to get institutional services on an agency basis regardless of the regions being set up by the Minister.  How flexible is that or how favourably will it be regarded? Is it the general intention that as far as possible the institutional services required will be confined to the region in question?  Will it be frowned upon if there is a bit too much crossing the border for institutional services on the part of any area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>Reference was made in the memorandum circulated by the Minister to the Hospitals Commission. <Col N="1447" /> Deputy Dr. Browne asked what would happen to the commission and how would the transfers take place and the Minister said that these people would be transferred and that their position would be guaranteed in the hospital boards.  Will all the members of the Hospital Commission have to go before the LAC as the CEO of the Dublin Health Authority is required to do?  Indeed, I think the closing date is today.  The Minister says that he has not got around to considering all the details, that this is the first move, and that this will come in time.  I am sure the Minister has his mind made up already and if it is required that the chief executive officer of the Dublin Health Authority must go before the LAC in fairness there should be the same requirement for people at present employed in the Hospitals Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back again to the figures for the various representations.  I remember when arguing for an increase in the representation for Dublin county I pointed out that the midland region had a population of 178,000 people and had a membership of 12.  At that time it was proposed to give Dublin county three representatives for a population of 174,000.  That has since been increased to four but it is still, even ignoring the enormous growth of the area, very much below what one would regard as a proper representation for the area.  I can see the Minister's difficulties are great.  One difficulty is the already very large size of the board.  Of course all of us have had experience of working on these boards and rarely do we have anything like a full attendance.  I was pleased to hear the Minister tell the House that it is now possible to have Dublin Corporation represented on the board from the beginning.  As Deputy Ryan said, it is no harm to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that before the council was abolished the members of the health authority were selected in accordance with political strengths in the corporation and regard should be had to this when the appointments are being made from the corporation.  They cannot be made in the way they are <Col N="1448" /> being made in every other local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister when moving this motion gave the type of advice with which all of us on this side of the House would very readily agree.  We have the legislation now, whether we agree with it or not.  Of course, there is an immense amount to be said for the regionalisation of the institutional services.  Large boards will now be set up comprising persons from a variety of local authority areas.  They will represent many different people, for instance, the nursing services, and various sections.  It is the duty of everybody serving on these boards to regard their responsibility as being collective responsibility for the entire area.  There is a natural tendency to have a parochial outlook and to misplace loyalties.  I agree with the Minister that people should forget they represent a particular section or area and, instead, should have regard to the overall improvement of the health services in the entire region.  This is extremely important and I hope it will work in this way.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the speed with which these boards will be set up and the time scheduled for putting into operation the new legislation. Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the slowness in making appointments through the various means and asked the Minister if anything could be done to expedite the procedure so that the legislation could be put into operation as quickly as possible.  Perhaps he was expressing the sentiments of all of us in this matter.  Certainly, the Minister cannot be held responsible for any delay in the implementation of the legislation.  Neither can Members of the House be held responsible because there was not any undue delay in the passage of the Bill through the House. We can only wish it well in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right and proper that we should have a full and frank discussion on this important matter concerning the radical changes that are about to take place in the health services with particular reference to the establishment of health boards.  We cannot fault the Minister or his Department <Col N="1449" /> in respect of the amount of information available.  Information has been readily forthcoming from them in this regard.  This is to be welcomed because the changes that are envisaged are a matter of great concern for all our people.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated, I understand, that the majority if not all of the changes provided for in the legislation will be implemented by April of next year. Therefore, there is not much time left for us to bring home to the Minister and his Department the kind of changes that we desire in this regard. We welcome many of the changes in the main and that is why we support the Minister today and assist him as best we can to get the motion through the Dáil as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>We are primarily concerned in these draft regulations with representation on the health boards.  It is to be observed that the number of public representatives has been kept to a minimum. We appreciate the Minister's difficulty that to increase the numbers from any given local authority might cause reaction from other authorities, or stalemate, but we should not allow a situation to develop where the existing county council or health authorities and the public they represent might consider themselves to be too far removed from participation in the affairs of the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider the close relationship that has existed between county councils and health authorities and the hospitals and health services which they provided in the past.  One can readily imagine the radical changes involved in separating these county councils from the future health services pertaining to the people they represent. We all owe a deep debt of gratitude to public representatives, public officials and managers of health authorities for their dedication to duty and, in particular, for their contributions towards improving the hospital services in their respective areas.  We must appreciate the amount of energy, time and money that was expended in transforming an archaic and outmoded health service and in bringing institutions into line with modern standards.  We must not forget the part <Col N="1450" /> played by these county councils and all who were involved in that transformation.</P>
    <P>Those of us who serve on public bodies have witnessed the change from the old workhouse, the old barracks or county home which we inherited from the British regime to modern buildings where our people are cared for in sickness and in health and where excellent standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>The most important feature of these local institutions is the friendly atmosphere and the individual attention provided in an environment where people can feel they are amongst friends.  This will go to a large extent in the creation of the health boards. Those of us who are members of local authorities are about to witness the loss of autonomy and control of our local hospitals and health institutions generally.  These powers are being ceded to a larger autonomous body that will comprise a conglomeration of counties.  In the process, it is fair to suggest that much of the intimate relationship and personal attention that we lavished on our local institutions will probably be lost for ever.  While it may not be relevant on this motion, there is concern about the future of these hospital services and the health services generally when they are transferred to the larger health bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we are dealing with the composition of the boards that are being set up.  This is the matter before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making a comparison between the composition of these boards about which we are now <Col N="1451" /> talking and the boards which had responsibility for our health services up to now.  It is a fair comparison to make without going into detail.  It is difficult to see what effective &ldquo;say&rdquo; representatives from county council areas would have on the larger boards.  In my own south-eastern region there will be three members on the board out of a total of 31.  It is difficult to understand how those three representatives from South Tipperary can have an effective voice in maintaining a particular standpoint for, say, the retention of a hospital or an effective say in the future use of the services in the area or anything else.  They can clearly be outvoted by the members from the other counties combined with the representatives from the various professions in the health services, doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses <i>et cetera.</i> I would, therefore, ask the Minister if he would elaborate on what he considers to be the functions of the local health committees.  We would like to maintain the closest possible liaison between the existing public representatives, the local health committee and the health boards we are now proposing to establish.  What functions will those local boards have?  Will they have any effective say in determining who will be granted medical cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was relevant to relate the functions of the health boards to the boards proper. However, the Minister seems to be in an aggravated mood today and does not feel I should refer to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would wish to ensure that the staff of our present health authorities are safeguarded in the <Col N="1452" /> transfers which are about to take place. Are those staffs likely to become redundant and, if so, what is to become of them?  Can they expect preference in respect of the new appointments which will be created? Much controversy will centre on the location of the headquarters of the health boards.</P>

      <P>Again, the Chair would point out to the Deputy that the draft regulations are solely concerned with the setting up of the boards and with the membership of the boards.  There will be other regulations at a future stage dealing with those other matters.  The present regulations are confined to the setting up of those boards.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Chair's ruling but it would be a pity if any attempt were made to frustrate or inhibit public representatives from eliciting further information or, indeed, broadening the scope of the debate to some extent.  I am sure the Minister would wish for the co-operation and understanding of all of us in public life in bringing about this transformation with the least possible disruption or anxiety on the part of all concerned. If the debate is to be restricted very considerably people may well get the wrong impression.  There is a lot at stake in this.  The health of our people and the services which we are to provide for them in the future are involved. The role played by all of us in public life with regard to those health boards will have a great bearing on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's remarks in respect of the south-eastern region are rather brief.  He mentioned the difficulties experienced by Carlow County Council which felt it should <Col N="1453" /> be merged with the south-eastern region.  He has been careful to avoid the pertinent points put to him at the meeting of the public representatives in those various county councils.  I do not know if it is prudent to go into that matter here.  Perhaps we will get another opportunity of dealing with it. I express the hope, therefore, that in the establishment of those boards the utmost liaison will be maintained and that it will be seen that the representatives, however small in number, will have an effective say on those larger bodies in maintaining and improving the health services for the people of our respective areas.  That is as much as one can hope to say on a restrictive measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at very great length on the regulations.  The Minister in drafting the regulations has been obsessed to ensure that the boards would not be too large and as a result the various local authorities are under-represented. If I talk about Dún Laoghaire Corporation having only two members to be appointed to this the Minister will reply that that was agreed to by Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  I know Dún Laoghaire Corporation did, in fact, agree to two but I did not agree with that.  I thought it should be more. I do not want to take the Minister on a tour of Dún Laoghaire but I must point out that it is almost impossible for the two Dún Laoghaire representatives to be available to all the people in the area.</P>
      <P>The function of the representatives on this board is to be available to the people as they should be.  I do not want to talk about the increased bus fares and so forth the people will have to meet in order to get to their public representatives in Dún Laoghaire.  With four for the county Dublin is under-represented. It is impossible so to site the four County Dublin representatives that they will be available to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that the representation can be increased in the future by an amendment of the regulations.  As has already been pointed out by Deputy Clinton, there will be a large increase in the population of <Col N="1454" /> County Dublin in the next few years. In regard to the Dublin city representation of seven, certain ex-members of the Dublin Health Authority have come back to the authority and are at present on sub-committees of that authority.  Those representatives should be the persons whom the Minister will appoint as the Dublin Corporation representatives. Reference was made during this debate to the chief executive officer of the Dublin Health Authority.  It was said that he would have to go before the Local Appointments Commission.  There was an inquiry as to the position regarding persons employed by the Hospitals Commission.  I agree that the Minister should not make fish of one and flesh of another and I feel that the employees of the Hospitals Commission should also go before the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on these regulations.  I dealt with it on the Bill.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting a number of Swedish doctors and public representatives. Apparently in Sweden social welfare and health are divorced.  One of their problems in Sweden at the moment is to bring them together.  I feel that under these regulations the Minister is tending to destroy any liaison which there is between health and social welfare.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to employees of various health authorities being taken over by the new bodies. I want to impress on the Minister that those employees should be at least as well provided for as they are at present. They should not be moved from where they have bought houses and settled down unless it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the overall position in these regulations whereby the public representatives have only a bare majority of one over the medical representation.  The medical and other representatives will be representatives without taxation. While I know the Minister can say that <Col N="1455" /> public representatives are not being taxed directly they at least have to meet the ratepayers once every five years and give an account of what they have done and how they have spent the local authority's money.  The medical representatives would never have to do that.  That is possibly a retrograde step especially in view of the fact that the representation for the medical profession and others is so high compared with the local authority representation.  These are the few matters I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a serious matter which I want to direct to the Minister's attention.  This matter is germane to the regulations.  I appeal to the Minister in this matter.  Firstly, I want to thank the Minister.  It is only fair that this view should be expressed in the House.  I do not think any piece of legislation has ever been more thoroughly documented in this House. Everyone appreciates the way the Minister worked on the Bill before Christmas.  The Minister seems to think we are taking a long time to discuss these regulations.  We are not; I think we will have them today and that is not too bad.</P>
      <P>I will not go as far as my colleagues in the two parties who have said that the local authorities' representatives are being badly treated.  That is not so. They are in a majority of one in every one of these boards, so far as I can see.  All they have to do is attend and, if there is a serious matter which they feel vitally affects their people, I do not think the representatives of, say, County Kerry&mdash;since that county has not been mentioned&mdash;would have any difficulty in persuading the representatives of, say, County Cork to join in with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the city commissioner who will have a share in appointing the representatives of the abstract figures of the Lord Mayor and Burgesses of Dublin will appoint people who are already on the health board here.  I will make only a brief reference to this matter but I think that in the case of the city of Dublin there is something seriously wrong when one finds that <Col N="1456" /> only 15 per cent of the people have medical cards, and in the county of Dublin only 8 per cent of the people have these cards, as against 40 per cent of the people in County Limerick who have them.  County Limerick is being subsidised to the tune of £25 million or £30 million for the dairying industry.  That is all I want to say about it, but there is something seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>I want to put a serious idea to the Minister about a matter which I raised on the Bill and on which the Minister made me a promise.  I take it that the Minister did not fulfil this promise for good reasons, but he did not even mention it.  I appeal to the Minister, when appointing his three representatives on each of these boards, to appoint one person from among the ordinary working staffs of some hospitals or some part of the institutions in each of these areas.  The Minister clearly misunderstood what I had in mind in view of what he read out in his brief about it.  I was not thinking of the conditions of employment of these people.  I was thinking of the kind of contribution that can be made by the most ordinary man on an occasion like this.  It has been said correctly &ldquo;To the people is given judgment&rdquo;. One can get as good a piece of judgment, and often better, from an ambulance driver than from a highly qualified surgeon and it is judgment that will be involved here.</P>
    <P>The Minister appoints three persons. The Minister did not mention this in the Seanad.  I trust he considered it, since he promised me he would, but I again appeal to him to appoint one of these people.  There are thousands of ordinary workers employed in these services and everybody else gets representation. In spite of all the talk we have heard this morning from people who are on county councils about the county councils not being adequately represented I want to be honest&mdash;it behoves politicians to be honest on occasions&mdash;and say that there is majority representation for the local authorities on each of these boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point, but it is there and on a serious matter there is no question but that they will vote together and will, therefore, be able to carry any matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have no difficulty in finding a suitable person.  I appeal to him to appoint one of these people. We all know that one of the most distinguished Ministers we ever had in this House was Deputy Tim Murphy, who was Minister for Local Government. He was a postman early in life. If anybody suggests to me that such people are not often very much better than specialists, I will not accept it from him.  Therefore, I make this appeal to the Minister.  I am not interested in the conditions of employment of ambulance drivers or people who sweep the wards in this matter, how much a week they are paid.  I am concerned that when every other kind of person is being represented on these boards they should be represented by at least one person.</P>
      <P>The answer I got from the Minister on the Bill was that this would be broadening the boards.  Some of these boards have 32, 33 and even 35 members.  They are probably too big already from an administrative point of view, and that is a defect, but one extra person will make no difference. I want to make a genuine appeal to the Minister to put one person on each of these boards who can speak for the ordinary workers in the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the arguments put up by the last speaker. I submit that the medical representation on these boards is there for a specific purpose.  They are not there in a trade union capacity; they are there in an advisory capacity.  Our hospital services, as developed over the last 20 or 30 years, are deplorable. They would be the laugh of any administrative body in the world if they were examined.  This is not the time to go into that subject but, if the Deputy wishes to cast his mind back&mdash;and I will discuss this with him at any time &mdash;to how things have developed here and looks at the situation at which we have now arrived, which is partly historical but also due to our own mismanagement, he will see that it has <Col N="1458" /> derived in great measure from the fact that we did not have proper medical advice.  This is the first attempt that has been made to secure this advice.  I do not want to be misrepresented here. We did not have that medical advice in the Department of Local Government or in the Department of Health or indeed we did not pay sufficient salaries to secure the standard of service in our Departments to get proper advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has pleaded for the ordinary man.  We have in every county council 22, 23, 24, 25, or 26 ordinary men who have operated our county council services for a number of years, and we see what that ordinary man's advice has given us. The result has been a hotch-potch hospital service which we are now trying to put into order; and it will cost a huge amount of money and many years of endeavour to bring some order out of the chaos.</P>
      <P>The criticism I have to make of this regulation is not of the regulation <i>per se.</i>  We accept the principle of specialisation.  We must accept that in a modern world, or else go into the backwaters altogether.  Therefore, we must accept a measure of decentralisation or regionalisation.  One cannot bring a specialised service to every crossroads; all one can do is bring every crossroads to a specialised service.  The essential thinking behind the Bill and on which these regulations are drafted is to achieve that purpose, and we, on this side of the House, accept that in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, these regulations are being introduced in a piecemeal fashion. With all due respect to the Minister, I feel he should have tried to avoid that because we are inhibited a little bit in getting a global picture of how he intends to proceed.  He has not disclosed everything he has at the back of his mind.  Even in regard to these simple regulations he says that the non-elected members will be in the first instance appointed on an informal basis and later on appointed on a more formal basis based on regulations.  This is a <Col N="1459" /> small matter.  I do not see why these regulations should have been left to be dealt with later, with, perhaps, another discussion here.  The Minister has already submitted that there will be five or six doctors, a chemist, a pharmacist, general nurses, psychiatric nurses and so on on a board.  That is the general format of the non-elected members on these health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that there will be a dilution of local authority power on these new boards but there is no corresponding reduction in local taxation.  I believe there should be a parallel between local representation and the local demand.  If there is going to be a centralisation of <Col N="1460" /> authority, there should also be a centralisation of payment.  If the Government want to regionalise or centralise health administration they must be prepared to make increasing subventions from the Exchequer to meet these payments.  That is only justice and commonsense.  That is my second criticism of these regulations but, as I said at the beginning, it is more a criticism of the parent Bill itself than the regulations.</P>
      <P>My third criticsm is on the question of piecemeal regulations.  A Deputy from the Labour Party thanked the Minister for being very informative. As far as the Act is concerned, that is so; but he is strangely coy about the hospital board regulations which he is going to introduce later.  It seems to me that, while he is going to great lengths to meet local sentiments in respect of these regional boards and has conceded that the majority of one would be allowed to local elected representatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already gone into great detail on this matter.  I was enormously patient with the House on the Health Bill.  I listened and gave endless information and I am quite right to resent the fact that somebody gets up in the Dáil at this stage and says there is no indication on the proposed election of the members of the regional hospital boards when an approximate concept of this is given in paragraph 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>White Papers and regulations that come before this <Col N="1464" /> House are two different matters.  The White Paper is a relatively informal document and is entirely different from what is written into legislation and regulations and the Minister is perfectly aware of this fact.</P>
      <P>As regards the administrative areas, the brief from the Minister is quite limited.  He deals with the design of local board areas and also with that very sensitive area at present: collective responsibility.  I do not know that existing geographical areas and various functional units have ever been uniform or coterminous.  The Minister mentioned that he has been thinking on the lines of local government and Bord Fáilte regional areas.  I do not know whether the areas he has laid down will stand the test of time.  He is right to say he is leaving it flexible and that the position is not immutable.  Various bodies, such as the Land Commission, Post Office and the Revenue Commissioners, devise their areas on a functional basis; and, although the Minister is adhering to county boundaries, it may evolve that in some cases he will have to depart from this practice. Our county boundaries were drawn up many years ago and they were not designed to conform with the most appropriate functional areas for health purposes.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's flexible approach and his reference to this in his speech.</P>
      <P>For some purposes, particularly in the matter of election to the Dáil, it might be desirable to have county boundaries and constituencies coterminous, but a case could be made for a departure from county boundaries where health administration is concerned.  The Minister mentioned County Carlow as an example.  He could also have mentioned County Clare, which I understand goes in with the southern region.  Parts of that county are within 20 miles of the university city of Galway and there are probably many areas which would be better put in with another county for administrative purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I adhere to my viewpoint that we should have had hospital board regulations before us when discussing health board regulations in general because the hospital boards will ultimately <Col N="1465" /> become the dominant body in health administration.  They will be less democratically elected and there will be an increasing centralisation of authority.  While some centralisation is desirable, one must draw the line somewhere.</P>
    <P>With increasing centralisation there will be an increase in officialdom and the principles of democratic authority and responsibility will be diluted.  That is the reason I consider we should know exactly where we are going and be aware of the entire position as regards regulations.  This piecemeal introduction of regulations was too smooth.  The Minister got very hot under the collar on this matter.  He said he had not time, that he had to consult with many bodies.  The Minister may have a point here but I am also entitled to my viewpoint that we should have had these regulations submitted with the health board regulations so that we could know how far and how fast the bureaucratic approach to health administration was evolving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to voice the disappointment and disapproval of many people in County Wicklow at the refusal of the Minister to accept the proposal of local authority representatives in Wicklow to increase their representation from three to four members on the Eastern Health Board.  I am sure representatives from County Kildare are equally disappointed at the refusal of the Minister likewise to increase their representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his original proposal the Minister considered that 16 local representatives were sufficient to represent the Eastern Health Board area, and, of that number, six were from the Wicklow-Kildare area and ten from the Dublin area.  I agree with the Minister that the Eastern Health Board presents the greatest problem for him. On a population basis or an area basis, it is a difficult board to administer. Undoubtedly, the bulk of the people in this area live in the city and county of Dublin and on that basis one might consider that people in Dublin city and county should have representation which would largely outweigh that of the two other counties.  However, there <Col N="1466" /> is another side to the story and the Minister has admitted that he has taken into account not only the population but also the size of the area. Of the three counties, County Wicklow is the largest, and yet it only rates three representatives.  In his original proposal the Minister decided that County Wicklow should have three representatives out of 16 but we are now being given three representatives out of a total of 19, which reduces proportionately the voice of my constituency and county on the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The board will have 35 members. Looking at the composition of the board from the point of view of other members, medical practitioners, dentists, pharmacists and so on, it is reasonable to assume that the vast majority will live or be based in Dublin city or county.  These people will have just as much say as local authority members and they will represent the city and county of Dublin, as well as their professions.</P>
    <P>It could eventually turn out that Kildare and Wicklow would have six representatives on the Eastern Health Board whereas the city and county of Dublin would have as many as 29.  I do not say this will happen, but it could be the evolution.  It is unlikely that dentists, pharmacists and nurses, for instance, will elect a member from the Wicklow or Kildare areas because of the vast numbers in these professions in the Dublin area.  The request by Wicklow and Kildare for an extra member on the board from both these counties was a reasonable one, remembering the number on the board and the likelihood that most of the other representatives, apart from local authority representatives, will be based in or around the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Geographically, Wicklow is a difficult county to represent because of the difficulty in travelling from east to west and from north to south and those wishing to bring their problems to the notice of the health board will have difficulty from the point of view of travel.  The bus services are confined to the eastern and western sides of the county.  It is difficult to travel from <Col N="1467" /> east to west or vice versa.  If the three representatives were to come from the more densely populated areas those in the west and south would have difficulty in meeting these representatives without travelling long distances from the outlying areas.  There is no problem in Dublin because constituencies change with a changing population and a representative on the regional health board would not necessarily have to coincide with the constituency area. Perhaps the Minister would have another look at this and appreciate the merit of the case made for increasing representation for both Wicklow and Kildare.</P>
    <P>Since the dissolution of the Dublin and Bray local authorities consultation with these bodies is impossible.  The people in Bray have had no council since the Bill was introduced.  It would be logical to have one member on the health board selected from the Bray area.  There is a heavy concentration of people in Bray and, for that reason alone, I would ask the Minister to appoint an extra member for that particular area.  The dissolution of the council has left problems in that the people have had no voice.  Their only public representatives are the members of Wicklow County Council.  The people have had no opportunity of showing how they feel about the health boards.</P>
    <P>Again, representation is inadequate from the point of view of the number of medical card holders in Wicklow as compared with Dún Laoghaire or Dublin county.  Only 7 per cent or 8 per cent of the population of Dublin are covered by medical cards whereas 30 per cent of the population of Wicklow are covered by medical cards. Almost 20,000 are covered by medical cards.  They should have larger representation on the health board.  As things stand, there will be only three representatives.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at the representation from the Wicklow area, bearing in mind that the board will be based in Dublin and that those constituting it will more than likely live in Dublin.  I ask the Minister to increase the number from Wicklow and <Col N="1468" /> Kildare from three to four.  That was the original suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept without question the fact that the Minister has put an amount of work into this.  We had a long discussion here on the Bill and the Minister issued a very informative White Paper.  I do not, however, accept his attitude that we should not discuss this.  This is a most important matter.  We are talking about the regionalisation of health services and their implementation by regional health boards.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is not prepared to listen and that he should constantly intervene to shout down those who are putting their particular points of view.</P>
      <P>For the Minister's information, as far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, we spent a long time yesterday in our health committee, of which I happen to be the chairman, discussing the matter and the regulations here before us this morning.  It is the duty of the House to discuss these regulations, if necessary, at length.  We are taking a very vital step in setting up these health boards and in regionalising health services.  Everybody is entitled to express his view.  It would be much better for the Minister to listen quietly instead of intervening every five minutes to explain that so-and-so is out of order.</P>
      <P>With regard to regionalisation, by and large the division is probably a fairly sound one, but there are some criticisms I should like to make in regard to it.  It would have been much better to have left Dublin on its own. Dublin is a colossus and it will swallow the others.  Deputy Kavanagh made a very reasonable case and, having listened to him, I cannot help feeling that, even if the Minister were to accede to his request and give Wicklow and Kildare extra representation, that would still not give them parity with Dublin.  It would have been better if the Minister had dovetailed both Kildare and Wicklow into one of the other regional boards.  However, I have no doubt he has done what he has done after consultation with all concerned and on the advice of his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> The old principle of no taxation without representation should be adhered to.  If I lived in Wicklow or Kildare, which I do not, and if I were representing either of these two counties, which I do not, I would feel that I was getting a raw deal because those whom I represented were not having a full say in the management of their own affairs.  These regulations should not be the be-all and end-all.  There should be flexibility.  One may work hard, one may listen to arguments in a lengthy debate, and so on, but that does not mean one is always right.  The purpose of Dáil Éireann is to debate and discuss. The Minister would be well advised to listen to the suggestions of Deputies about these regulations.</P>
    <P>I am also not very clear, on the regional health board question, as to what exactly will happen.  With respect, I think this is a point the Minister should fully clarify to the House for the purpose of those who will constitute, shall we say, the background or the civil service of the regional boards.  In every county at present&mdash; we know a health authority which is going to be dissolved and to disappear &mdash;there are officials who are specifically dealing with health matters such as medical cards and with disability awards, which were always conducted by the Minister's Department, and many other facets of, shall we say, medical administration and politics. Let me come to my own area down Wexford way which I think is called east central.  It seems to me that the administrative centre under the regional board will be based in Kilkenny.  For that matter, it seems quite obvious that there must be a transfer of officials from their existing establishment into Kilkenny unless it is envisaged that these officials would be allowed to remain in their original area and travel each day and get travelling expenses, but that does not seem practical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that I spent eight days describing in detail what the <Col N="1473" /> health boards would do and the conditions of service in relation to the employees, how they would be protected, the arrangements for responsibility for staffing and conditions.  Even at the time the Health Bill was going through.  I gave an indication that there would be eight boards.  I even published the major parts of the constitution of the boards.  The only thing in this is some change in numbers of representatives of each county and the professions. Marginal changes in the numbers were made.  Otherwise, everything was known even including how these health boards would be set up in the sense of their size and composition.  I discussed this whole matter in the greatest detail. I gave a complete picture of the function of the health boards.  The sections in the Health Act clearly indicate the functions of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister's argument, if he has already given the delineation of the health boards when the Health Bill was being discussed here, we are not even allowed to discuss that.  The Minister's attitude is absolutely beyond me.  If I may say so with respect, I think it is a puerile attitude for a responsible Minister to adopt, for the Tánaiste, No. 2 in the Irish Government, to come in here to try to muzzle everybody who tries to express an opinion.</P>
      <P>On the matters that the regional health boards will decide for themselves I have another query for the Minister.  There have been certain recommendations with regard to the setting up of these regional health boards and in regard to the siting of hospitals.  I now want to ask the Minister something which will no doubt send him off the deep end straight away.  I cannot help that.  He should try to be patient.  The question is: who will decide where the hospitals will be sited and what the general overall hospital policy will be?  Will it be decided by the regional health boards, or by the Minister, or by the hospital boards?  We want to find this out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My difficulty is that I will not have an opportunity of speaking on this anywhere again.  I am not a member of the local authority and therefore I will <Col N="1474" /> not have any say on the regional board, not that I particularly want to have it.  I want to find out what the functions of the regional board are. Deputies and Senators will have to meet their local representatives and put before them, in as clear words as possible, what the exact position is.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister two specific questions.  One has caused quite a row, or a furore, or a storm in his breast.  That is the simple question of what exactly will be the position of the health officers who now function in my county when he sets up the regional health board in Kilkenny. Apart from a long diatribe saying that he had explained it all previously, the only thing he said was there would be no worsening of their conditions.</P>
    <P>My other question is with regard to the siting of the hospitals, which is most important to the people who live in the area.  They are interested in that question.  The Minister has given no definite decision on this, nor has he indicated who will give the decision. Will this decision be taken by the regional health boards or by whom will it be taken?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Deputy that we are not discussing the regional hospital boards. The House will have an opportunity of dealing with that matter when it comes before us again.  We cannot anticipate the debate on that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply trying to find out who takes the decision with regard to the siting of hospitals. Surely the siting of the hospitals is most important in relation to the setting up of regional health boards? You cannot run a regional health board unless you have full knowledge of the overall administrative plan.  I take it that the regional health board will be the controlling administrative body.  I think I am right in that.  I do not think that even the Minister would disagree with that.  It may be the only thing with which he agrees in what I have said here this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the regional health boards represent a decentralisation from central control.  The officials of the Department of Health know that <Col N="1475" /> I have never been a great advocate of central control but this is a decentralisation and a regionalisation.  Is the Minister giving that function to the regional health boards or is he not?  I have no doubt that the Minister will answer that question for me with all the courtesy he can command when he gets up to reply.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which interests me.  The regional health boards will take over the functions of the Hospitals Commission which is to be dissolved.  As I understand the position, the function of the Hospitals Commission was to decide for what purpose the different funds allocated to them from the Hospitals Trust were utilised.  They acted in an advisory capacity.  It seems to me that they acted in a national advisory capacity. The Minister has said that there can be interchange between the different health boards.  He mentioned commuters. That seems to be a small matter and to relate only to two regions along side each other.</P>
    <P>Formerly the Hospitals Commission allocated the funds on a national basis. My query is: when they go out of existence and are superseded by these regional boards how will they carry out the function of the Hospitals Commission because they are individual regional boards?  Does the Minister intend to carry out that function himself, or does he intend to hand it over to the regional boards?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does it. The Minister takes the national decision from the recommendation of the three regional hospital boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for the three regional boards. Surely there are six or seven boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three regional hospital boards, as the Deputy will find in paragraph 31 of the White Paper.  They are being charged with the general organisation and development of hospital services.  They will be studying the needs of the hospitals and the requests of the hospitals both in relation to consultants and to improvements in hospitals and I will have to <Col N="1476" /> correlate the needs of the three regional hospital boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>By the regional hospital boards, not the health boards. That is clearly indicated in the White Paper and it was also explained during the debate in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I know everything was explained during the debate.  We had a little difficulty, Sir, before you took the Chair.  The Minister feels that anything that was discussed during the debate on the Health Bill should not be mentioned now, even though it is relevant to the regional health boards which I have been discussing amid considerable interruptions from the Minister.  However, the matter has been settled amicably and I think the Minister has decided to desist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express the same view as my colleague, Deputy Hogan.  We expressed our view yesterday at a party meeting that it was unfortunate that the Minister saw fit to bring in these regulations piecemeal.  My recollection is that the implication in the debate to which the Minister has referred so often today was that these regulations would be brought in together.  If the Minister had seen fit to bring in all these regulations at the same time this House would have a much clearer picture of the situation than we have at present.  We have a piecemeal picture at the moment of what will happen. I appreciate that the Minister wants the health boards to function as soon as possible.  The establishment date he mentioned was 1st October so that they would be functioning by 1st April, 1971.  I note from the explanatory memorandum that the setting up of the hospital board will be on 1st <Col N="1477" /> April, 1971 and the effective implementation of the regional board itself will be on the same date.  It does not seem to be a very tidy way of doing the job that the regional health boards should go into full functioning on 1st April, 1971 when the auxiliary bodies inextricably associated with them are not even being set up, I think, until 1st April, 1971.  I, therefore, join with Deputy Hogan in saying that I think it would have been tidier to bring in all the regulations together rather than do a piecemeal job as the Minister has done.</P>
    <P>It is extremely unfortunate that a Minister such as the Minister for Health who has possibly enhanced his prestige somewhat, at least beside his own colleagues, in this health legislation and has tried to do the best he can in letting us have all the information possible&mdash;something I personally appreciate&mdash;should have tried in this debate to stifle discussion.  It is no credit to him.  I think it is the first time in 20 years in this House that I have had to listen to a continuous attempt to interrupt and stifle debate.  I sincerely hope that as long as I am here we shall not have to listen to it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the Minister's efforts to ensure that the Health Act will be in operation by 1971.  We must pay tribute to him because in the year he has been in office he has certainly applied himself very diligently to every aspect of the measure to ensure that the Act will be functioning by 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very logical approach in the formulation of the health boards. While I am naturally very concerned with our own board, the Eastern Health Board, in general I can find no fault with the functional areas outlined.  I have looked through these regulations and I see the Minister has been very generous to the medical profession.  He has considered them fully and the medical profession have every reason to be thankful to the Minister because he has ensured that throughout the country they will have 25 per cent representation on the health boards. That is a very generous gesture to the <Col N="1478" /> medical profession especially when you consider that there are only 2,500 doctors in the country and nearly three million people.</P>
    <P>I discussed informally with the Minister a short time ago the composition of the Eastern Health Board. The only thing I am disappointed about is that he has not seen fit to give Dublin City greater representation on this board.  There are three-quarters of a million people in Dublin city and, on a population basis, Dublin City Council would have approximately 15 members on the board. Instead, we find there are only seven representatives of Dublin city.  As far as I can see the Minister acceded to the request of members of Dublin County Council to increase their representation but may I ask now what was the Minister's proposal originally in respect of representation for Dublin County Council?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Six.  We increased it by one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the nine persons appointed by election by registered medical practitioners practising in the functional area of the board, I should like it be conveyed to the bodies representing the medical profession that the nine persons to be appointed by them should be from areas not essentially in Dublin City but that they should be located in various parts of the functional area of the Eastern Health Board.  This would ensure that they would then act also as citizens of their areas and not necessarily only in their capacity as medical practitioners.  This might offset the imbalance at present on this board with representatives of the medical profession. I speak as a doctor but also as a citizen in saying I should like to see this happen.  Perhaps the Minister would bring this to their attention and suggest that the medical practitioners appointed to the board should be from areas not necessarily confined to Dublin City.</P>
      <P>I should have thought that we might have more than one person appointed by the nursing profession.  One as against nine in the case of the doctors seems a little unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1479" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  There are two, one general and one psychiatric. That is a good idea.  I overlooked that.  I should imagine that the representatives from Wicklow and Kildare might feel somewhat perturbed at having only three members each.  It would be understandable if they felt this to be a little unfair to them.  I agree that, if there are too many members, the board would be unwieldy and unable to act properly.  Because of that I am loath to complain about the representation for Dublin City.  I think that 35 members is sufficient on a health board; to exceed that number would perhaps be abnormal.  I hope the members of the board will not be there solely representing their local interests but will act as members of a board not just taking care of vested or local interests but in the common interest.  If this principle were remembered by them and perhaps by Members of the House we might see the logic of the representation.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would have brought in the regulations regarding Comhairle na nOspidéal and the three regional hospital boards at the same time.  That would have given us a better picture, perhaps, and we could have discussed all these together. Probably there is a reason for not doing so.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has mentioned the point that this does not mean that the hospital services of each health board will have to be self-sufficient. There is nothing to stop arrangements being made for, say, North Roscommon patients to come to Sligo or Carlow patients to come to Dublin. What would happen if, say, North Roscommon patients had to come to Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The Health Act, 1970, will operate to a large extent through a number of <Col N="1481" /> boards to be established by regulations made by the Minister.  For some time past I have been noticing a trend under which legislation which was passed in this House operates largely through regulations or statutory instruments made by the Minister.  In some cases that is inevitable, but it is of the utmost importance that, in the case of the Health Act, where it has been specifically provided that these regulations shall be brought before the House and passed by the House before they become law, that provision be treated seriously.</P>
      <P>Like Sir Anthony Esmonde and some other Deputies, I noticed the Minister was somewhat impatient about any detailed discussion on these regulations. The Minister has the reputation of being a reasonable and polite man, a man who believes in full and frank discussion in the House.  It is a pity that he has adopted the attitude he has adopted here today, and if I had any doubt as to whether or not I should speak on this motion, I had no difficulty in making up my mind when I noticed the Minister's impatience.  We are handing over here to the Minister in these regulations a very powerful weapon, and it is our duty as Members of this House to read these regulations, to discuss them, to put forward our views on them and to get such information from the Minister as we require.  I trust the debate will continue on the basis that we are doing something of importance here.  Section 4 of the Act, while it imposes responsibility on the Minister, also imposes responsibility on the Members of this House to see that what the Minister is doing coincides with the wishes of the House and is in accordance with the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the establishment of these regional health boards and regional hospital boards is the beginning of the regionalisation of local government.  Following the regional planning boards and the regional boards under which Bord Fáilte operate, it is, perhaps, a gentle and a good way of doing it.  It is gratifying to see that in deciding the regions, after some consideration the Minister decided to respect the integrity of <Col N="1482" /> county boundaries.  I hope I shall be excused for saying in passing that I only wish I could have convinced the former Minister for Local Government that he should adopt a similar attitude when he was defining constituencies. I wish I could have convinced him that he should preserve and respect the county boundaries of Leitrim, for example, but all the persuasion at my disposal was not able to do that.</P>
    <P>These boards will either succeed or fail during the first few years of their existence.  That imposes a very serious obligation on the Minister because he has taken responsibility for appointing something less than 50 per cent of the entire personnel of these regional boards.  Perhaps, the local authority will appoint a majority, but the members who would normally be appointed by the medical practitioners, the dentists and so forth in the area will be appointed by the Minister.</P>

Is that not correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I approve of that.  It is not as in the case of the Association of Municipal Authorities: they send up three and <Col N="1483" /> the Minister appoints one.  That will not happen here.  If the Minister asks a certain professional body to put forward a nomination he must appoint that nomination.  I approve of that. Nevertheless, I would ask the Minister to embrace as many of these professional bodies as possible, any of them with any organisation within the region, to make sure that these boards are as broadly based as possible and will get off to a good start.  If the first boards do not inspire the confidence of the people whom they are to serve, the confidence of the medical and other professions who think they are entitled to representation on them, they will be a failure.</P>
      <P>Something which strikes me on reading the regulations in conjunction with the Act is in regard to section 4 (2)(a) which says:</P>
      <P>Membership of a health board shall consist of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  persons appointed by the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>We go then to the Schedule to the Act and we find that there are two ways by which local authorities may appoint members.  One is that a group within the county council, say, can get together for the purpose of appointing a member.  That is a good thing because in a county council where one party might have an overall majority they might be tempted to be unfair and this ensures that the minority will at least have some representation.  It appears to me, however, that the group are bound to appoint a councillor and they cannot appoint anybody else.  The Schedule says:</P>
      <P>Any group of councillors comprising the necessary number of councillors may nominate a councillor to be a member of the board and he shall be appointed on that nomination without any voting.</P>
      <P>The other appointees of the local authority may be members of the council or may not be members of the council.  I should like the Minister to tell me if that is so, if my interpretation is correct and also if that is the intention, or is it merely accidental.</P>

      <P>The remainder of the members of the board shall be appointed successively by a majority of the votes of the councillors who are not members of any group of councilors ...</P>
      <P>But if we go back to section 4 the county council may appoint councillors or non-councillors.  We could interpret section 4, if it stood alone, as meaning that a county council could appoint members of a county council or people who are not members of a county council.  It does not mean anything else.</P>

I agree with other speakers that it is an immense area which should have been left to itself and Wicklow and Kildare should have been fitted into some other regions.  That is all I wish to say.  I spoke mainly to establish the principle that we are entitled to discuss these regulations and we would be in breach of our duty to our constituents, to the House and to democracy if we did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express very great disappointment that the Minister could not see his way to accede to the recommendation made by members of the local authorities in the proposed eastern region that greater representation than is envisaged should be given. The Deputy from Wicklow made the case that Wicklow and Kildare were entitled to greater representation than they are getting because of the size of the area involved.  I can sympathise with the Minister in his task of making out the various apportionments in this region, having regard to the size of the population of the City of Dublin and even of the county of Dublin and the borough of Dún Laoghaire.  I am sure he must have given some consideration to the fact that these are reasonably compact areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we in Kildare and Wicklow may orientate towards Dublin to some degree&mdash;parts of Wicklow and north County Kildare&mdash;I fail to see how the southern portions of either of those counties could be regarded as orientating entirely towards the city of Dublin. I have no grouse with the Minister in <Col N="1487" /> regard to the professional representation on the board but I am worried that the representation given to Counties Kildare and Wicklow is insufficient to meet the demands that will be made on the members when the boards are finally set up.</P>
    <P>Let us take County Kildare as an example.  I wonder if the Minister gave any thought to the fact that if one was to base the representation on electoral areas&mdash;there are four such areas in Kildare&mdash;we could possibly have three representatives on the board from the one area.  Anybody familiar with rural areas will be aware that the people in those areas cherish the personal contact they have with their representatives. They like to know that they have a representative living near hand and to whom they can bring their problems but this might very well not be the case in Counties Kildare or Wicklow.  I am sure that when the councillors meet they will see to it that representation is spread out as much as possible and as fairly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility that the Minister may have in mind the political representations on those county councils where one representative would be chosen from Fianna Fáil, one from Fine Gael and one from Labour but what would be done if we had Independents?  What are we to do if the board do not represent a fair distribution of the representatives in the various counties?  Perhaps, the Minister will have a look at this matter and see if it will be at all possible to give an additional representative to Counties Kildare and Wicklow.  As I have said, we tend to orientate towards Dublin but there is a fear that Kildare and Wicklow would become the poor relations on the board.  Let me give an example.  The boards would concentrate more on the city of Dublin than on the rural areas.  We in Kildare have sent a proposal to the Minister's Department to have a psychiatric unit attached to the hospital at Naas but this proposal has not been accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on the Health Act, the Minister promised us a chance of discussing the setting up of the regional health boards and I wish to discuss very briefly the motion before the House.  The Minister gave us a very informative brief.  Under section 4 of the Health Act, 1970 the Minister for Health is required to make regulations specifying the number, constitution and functional areas of the health boards which, under the Act, will become responsible for the administration of the health services.</P>
      <P>The first comment I should like to make is in relation to the actual constitution of the health boards.  When speaking on the Health Act, I referred to the composition of the health boards and I may have given the impression at that time that I was in favour of there being a majority representation of the medical profession on the boards.  I should like to make it clear that while I am in favour of a majority of medical representatives, I wish to make it clear also that, if at all possible, there should be representation from the local authorities.  By this I mean that if there are people on local authorities of medical standing or background or with para-medical associations the Minister should request that such people be appointed to the boards; I have in mind a person such as Deputy Hogan who is a member of a county council. It would be far more efficient to have someone with a medical or para-medical background as the local authority representative rather than a lay person.  Efficiency is what we are aiming at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, this could not always be possible nor could the Minister legislate for it but, perhaps, he could recommend to the local authorities that if there must be a choice between, say, Jack and Tom and if Jack has medical experience, he should be selected if at <Col N="1489" /> all possible.  I would be grateful for the Minister's comments on the feasibility of this suggestion being implemented in some form or other.  Are we establishing health boards with a majority of people who have no specialised knowledge of what the health services are about?  If we take a cross section of people who will probably comprise the majority of the health boards, we know that these will be representatives who have been elected by the people to local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states he has no power.  He may not have statutory power to do this but he could possibly make an unofficial recommendation. I will merely make one comment concerning the Eastern Health Board, which takes in the Dublin area. The Minister rightly stated that this is the largest health board area in the country.  Unfortunately, in Dublin city there are no local authority elected representatives with whom the Minister can discuss the matter.  He has had consultations with the city commissioner, supplemented by informal discussions with some city Deputies.  The <Col N="1491" /> Minister has made a fair effort to find out the feelings of city Deputies regarding the type of representation they would require on the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was setting up the Eastern Health Board, being aware of the fact that he could not have what we might term proportional representation of local elected representatives, he said he would endeavour to compensate for this on a much fairer basis. I congratulate the Minister on this. Comparing the populations of Wicklow and Kildare with the very large population in Dublin city, the result could be a fantastic majority of the local elected representatives on the health board, without giving the people of Wicklow or Kildare a fair or reasonable representation.</P>
      <P>This would be a fine thing if the Minister were consistent.  Unfortunately, he has not been consistent, and I do not know why.  He has been inconsistent because, when we come to the establishment of the Southern Health Board, we find the Minister has apparently agreed to some more equitable form of representation for the population of these areas.  This is the health board which will cover Cork and Kerry.  Kerry County Council at first proposed two boards.  The Minister stated we did not want too many areas to administer and that there would be only eight health boards in the country.  Kerry County Council, after a discussion, agreed they would go in with Cork county and form the Southern Health Board.  The Minister has not been consistent in dealing with the representation on this health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Eastern Health Board, the Minister stated that representation could not be strictly in proportion to population.  In the case of the Southern Health Board, however, we find that he initially proposed four representatives for Cork Corporation, six for Cork County Council and five for Kerry County Council.  He said that this would not give any of the local authorities an absolute majority.  That is quite true, but it would give Cork city and county, with a population of <Col N="1492" /> 340,000 as against Kerry's 113,000, a two to one majority on the board. Here we have an example where the population has very definitely been taken into consideration.  On a strict population basis, Cork city and county would have a majority of three to one on the board&mdash;that would be 300,000 against 100,000.  The Minister has not kept to that strict representation, but he has given Cork County Council and Cork Corporation an absolute majority here neither of them as separate bodies getting individual majority.  In the Southern Health Board we proposed that there should be ten members from Cork and five members from Kerry.  Following representations which the Minister received from the local authorities it seems from the Minister's brief that he overruled all the professional interests and all medical groups as regards their representation. The Minister has concentrated on local authority representation.  He has increased Cork representation to meet the views of the two local authorities there.  Cork Corporation representation has been increased from four to five members and Cork County Council representation from six to seven members, giving them a total of 12 members. This gives one additional representative to the Kerry County Council, giving them a total of six members which is still 50 per cent but still no one of the individual bodies has an overall majority.  I feel that is why the Minister could not have agreed to the proposal put forward by the Kerry people who went to see him and who said that he should give some form of recognition to the Tralee Urban District Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that.  With regard to the eastern region the Minister has specified that there should not be strict adherence to the concept of local authority representation being in line with the number of people in an area. Under the Act the Minister could not have done this, but could have increased the representation of Kerry County Council on this board.  The Minister could have given consideration to this point.  We know that the <Col N="1493" /> people in Kerry have been bullied under the new Health Act.  They have been pushed from Billy to Jack; matters have gone from logicality to illogicality. From what the Minister said earlier we know that tradition rather than logic can be said to govern the lines between counties.  There was a strong temptation to be logical in designing the health board areas at the expense of county integrity.  Kerry County Council made representations to have a health board of their own. Why should they not have one?  They have been divided into two or three parts.  They are now in line with Cork. With Cork County they form the Southern Health Board.  They do not appear to have sufficient representation on this board compared with the representation of the Cork Corporation and the Cork County Council.  I would not accept the local authority representation on the Southern Health Board.  I would vote against it.  Kerry County Council have a very difficult job because of the terrain and the distances involved in the county.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred earlier to the factors involved in the establishment of an efficient health board and to the fact that travel has now become so much easier.  The health board could cover a far wider area.  The Minister said that there was no hard and fast rule which could be followed but that practical considerations must be borne in mind.  Areas should be sufficiently compact so that board members should be able to visit the areas of administration freely.  The area of the Southern Health Board as proposed by the Minister includes County Kerry where the terrain is unusual.  There is a population of 113,000 spread over a large area.  I speak from personal experience as a man who is familiar with the position and has practised there.  I am familiar with the front line movements of the medical health services as they exist in a county like Kerry where an outlying district may be several miles from the nearest hospital.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the representation of the Kerry County Council on the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no obligation on the Minister to give us so much detailed information.  The Minister must be <Col N="1494" /> commended for doing this.  The Minister informed us that the Kerry County Council had asked that the majority of the medical representatives on the health board should be from the Kerry area.  The Minister said this was not a valid recommendation.  The Minister should give careful consideration to this proposal.  The Minister has given consideration throughout the whole discussion to the needs of the patients, and has shown concern for the elderly person and the young child.  He is anxious that the service to these people should be very efficient. This is the aim of the health boards.</P>
    <P>A chain is as strong as its weakest link and we do not want the weakest link of our health services to be at the tip of the Dingle Peninsula or in the Kerry mountains.  We wish to see a strong and efficient health service.  That is why I ask the Minister to consider increasing the representation of the Kerry County Council on the Southern Health Board.  I am pleased to note from the Minister's brief that he has, in fact, apparently given unofficial sanction to the hospital in Tralee.  It is mentioned in the Minister's brief as being a full general hospital.</P>

Why should we victimise Kerry in this matter?  Why should Kerry be the poor relation under our new Health Act?  Why should it be the weakest link in the chain of our health services?  I can only say that I will vote against this motion because of the fact that Kerry has not been given sufficient representation on the Southern Health Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be seen from the foregoing that the EEC is still at a very early stage in its political evolution and its members are at present bound only by the general terms of the Treaty of Rome, which do not impose specific obligations on member States in the political field.  In this situation it is not possible to be more precise now about the political <Col N="1496" /> implications of membership which may evolve.  The Government have clearly indicated our acceptance of the aims of the Treaty of Rome and our readiness to join with the member States of the EEC in working towards the realisation of these aims. It is recognised that, as the Communities evolve towards their political objectives, those participating in the new Europe thereby created must be prepared to assist, if necessary, in its defence.  As a member of the expanded Communities, Ireland would be playing her part in shaping their political development and, therefore, would have a voice in all the decisions to be taken in this field, as in other aspects of the Communities' activities.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative. As regards the second part we have seen press reports concerning a possible application by South Africa to join the EEC but we have no confirmation of these reports.  As the Deputy is aware the Treaty of Rome provides for membership by European States only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not a member ourselves at this time.  I feel it would be unlikely that membership of South Africa would be possible because the Treaty of Rome envisages that membership would be confined to European States.  The relevant articles are Article 237 of the EEC, Article 205 of Euratom and Article 98 of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty.  Only a European State may apply for membership under the terms of these articles.  As regards association, there does not seem to be any precedent for a developed African country, there is a precedent for undeveloped or developing countries.  I think the nature of the regime there would be a difficulty too.</P>

The fact is that we are now preparing the basis on which we can set up an organisation and administration to deal with precisely this problem.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to alleged delays in paying disability benefit.</P>
      <P>Disability benefit becomes payable for the first time on any claim only on submission of the second medical certificate, usually a week after the claim is made.  Payment of benefit then commences and continues on receipt of subsequent medical certificates, normally at weekly intervals.  In some cases there may be no title to benefit and in others it may take some weeks to establish title to benefit.  In the vast majority of cases, however, payment is made promptly on receipt of the second and subsequent medical certificates.

      <P>Cattle entering the State from the Six Counties must be accompanied by a permit issued by the Ministry of Agriculture establishing their TB attested status.  Such permits are not issued in respect of breeding stock which have failed to pass the brucellosis test.  In the case of breeding animals going to herds in the brucellosis eradication areas positive evidence of having passed a brucellosis test must also be furnished.</P>
      <P>Cattle from Britain and the continent are required to meet stringent veterinary requirements including tests for specific diseases prior to import.

      <P>I am not so aware. Exports of eggs to the Six Counties since 31st March last, when the UK minimum import price system came into operation, have been slightly above the level of the corresponding period of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced by my Department on 4th March last, the UK Government decided to introduce the minimum import price system for shell eggs and certain egg products with a view to stability of the UK egg market following their decision to phase out their present producer price guarantee system and abolish the British Egg Marketing Board.  The new system provides that, if shell eggs and egg products are sold on the UK market below the prescribed minimum import prices, a general import levy will be imposed equal to the amounts by which the lowest prices of imported eggs and egg products from any country supplying a significant quantity fall short of the minimum import prices.  As a result of discussions between the British and Irish Governments these levy provisions do not apply to eggs imported from Ireland and no question of a levy would arise <Col N="1513" /> unless the Irish exports themselves were supplied below the UK minimum import prices.  Arrangements were made with the few small exporters concerned to observe the new UK minimum import prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will consider having the Exchequer bear the full cost of applying the general autumn dressing for warbles in view of the fact that the reintroduction of the general autumn dressing would not now be necessary if it had not been discontinued by his Department in 1967.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the statement in the second part of the question.</P>
      <P>Previous general dressing campaigns were paid for by the herdowners and they would therefore have also paid if there had been a general campaign in 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, there are no funds in the Vote for my Department which could <Col N="1514" /> be used to pay the cost of general autumn dressing for warbles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this campaign was discontinued before the warble fly had been properly eradicated?  Had it been properly eradicated then it would not be necessary now to re-introduce the scheme.  Its withdrawal in 1967 was a departmental decision and the cost should therefore be borne by the Department and not by the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. The Deputy should be aware of the real facts.  There has been a recrudescence of warble fly infestation.  I believe eradication will have to be a continuous process and there will have to be constant vigilance to ensure against infestation, something similar to the vigilance exercised in the case of bovine tuberculosis eradication.  Part of the onus must fall on the farmers. The original eradication scheme demonstrated the benefits, but many of us are to blame in that we were not thorough enough in carrying out the scheme.  Every rural Deputy is aware that there was a certain reluctance to dress in-calf cows and this enabled the warble fly to survive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it is very difficult to regard the scheme as having been a worthwhile one when infestation has recurred three years after the cessation of the scheme, infestation to almost the same level at which it was prior to the scheme?  There is something radically wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <P>Since the commencement of the strike 1,283 licences remitting the import duty on 370,000 tons of cement have been issued but nothing like this quantity has been imported.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the duty is to protect Irish manufacturers and, in accordance with normal practice, the duty is being remitted because the Irish manufacturers are unable to supply their customers.</P>

We are quite well aware that there is 500 per cent, 600 per cent, profit being made on imported cement by means of licences. I am quite certain this information would be of interest to the Revenue Commissioners.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Jute bacon wrappers may be imported under licence free of duty only where they are required for packing bacon for export.  This is fully in accord with Government policy and I feel that a change in the licensing arrangements at this stage would not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To refuse duty-free licences for wrappers that are to be re-exported would not prevent firms here from importing <Col N="1522" /> them under the bond or drawback arrangements administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  Under these arrangements importers are entitled to recover duty paid on goods that are re-exported.</P>

For this reason and also because of the extent to which employment in the Clara district is dependent on this industry, my Department have been giving and will continue to give special attention to the situation there.</P>
      <P>The steps taken to safeguard the employment of the workers at Clara include special arrangements negotiated for jute products under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, grants by the Industrial Development Authority towards the cost of adaptation and diversification projects carried out by the firm concerned, financial assistance under the technical assistance scheme administered by my Department, facilities for the importation of materials, where necessary, and assistance in the field of marketing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find a gentleman's outfitters in which the stock and display of British manufactured shirts does not take priority over Irish manufactured shirts; if he will state the present customs duties and restrictions applicable to the importation of foreign shirts; and the steps being taken to promote the manufacture and sale of Irish shirts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that certain Dublin men's outfitters tend to highlight the imported article rather than the Irish one.  I am satisfied, however, that this practice is not general in Dublin or in the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> The present rates of customs duty on imported shirts are: full and preferential 36 per cent; preferential 24 per cent and United Kingdom and Northern Ireland 14.4 per cent <i>ad valorem.</i>  In addition to the <i>ad valorem</i> rates there is a specific duty on men's shirts costing 8s each or less, of 2s 10.6d each where they are of United Kingdom and Northern Ireland origin, or 4s 9.6d each on such shirts originating elsewhere.  Boys' shirts costing 5s each or less attract, in addition to the <i>ad valorem</i> duty, a specific duty of 1s 11d each in the case of United Kingdom and Northern Ireland shirts and 3s 2.4d each in the case of shirts of other origin.</P>
    <P>The total value of made up textile articles, including shirts, that may be imported from 16 specific low cost countries is limited to £100,000 per annum.  Shirt manufacturers are eligible for technical assistance, readaptation and re-equipment grants to enable them to operate more competitively.  The sale of Irish made shirts is included in the promotional activities of the National Development Association.</P>

Is the Minister aware that if one goes from here to Dame Street one will find in all the gentlemen's outfitters, except one, that it is only British shirts that are on exhibition in the shop windows? Will the Minister not exhort retailers to have regard to the national duty of promoting the sale of Irish goods which in many cases are of better quality because Irish shirt manufacturers are not exporting more shirts than they are selling on the home market?</P>

      <P>I fully agree with Deputy Ryan's sentiments on this matter. Deputy O'Leary suggests that the Minister is not interested but I spoke on this specific subject when replying to the debate on the Estimate for my Department.  Deputy Ryan asked if I was aware that there was only one shop between here and Dame Street offering Irish-manufactured shirts in the window.  I am not specifically so aware but I am aware that far too many shops that are inclined to describe themselves as the &ldquo;pricey&rdquo; and &ldquo;quality&rdquo; shops apparently insist that quality and foreign products go together. I want to make quite clear that anything I can do to discourage that type of development I shall do.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company that they invited tenders by public advertisement for temporary premises for letting as a general drapery shop.  The tenancy has been offered to the person who submitted the highest tender.  The rent at which the lease will be granted is substantially higher than that offered by the next highest tenderer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is grave satisfaction among the residents of this new town because the premises have been let to a nonresident while one of their own members was willing to give this service? The only reason they offered the premises for tender was that representations were made on her behalf to rent the premises.  Would the Minister not agree that the company's action in this case is not in accordance with their expressed wish to create a happy community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy means the degree of dissatisfaction?  I am not aware of the degree of dissatisfaction mainly because I did not think that the name of the successful tenderer or new tenant had become public as yet except in so far as the unsuccessful tenderers had been notified that they were unsuccessful.  I think it is unfair to suggest that SFADCO are upsetting the local community by appointing an Irishman and a Clareman <Col N="1532" /> to a tenancy of this nature when he is the highest tenderer.  Where there is an advertisement of this nature and where premises are offered for tenancy on a tender basis, there is no reason to change from the practice, whereby the highest tender is accepted if there is not some specific reason why it should not be accepted.  I do not think there is any justification for dissatisfaction here.  It is not a question of some foreigner being brought in; it is a question of somebody who, perhaps, is not actually living in the town area.</P>

      <P>Three or four years ago there were, perhaps, feelings about certain sectors of industry that they might find it very difficult to survive.  There are changing patterns and changing approaches and it does not necessarily follow, that particular industries which at present might not be expected to survive, would not survive and, perhaps, flourish, it may be, for want of a better phrase.  In any event, where there is danger I am hoping to be in a position to spell it out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards has completed a feasibility study in regard to a safety standard for plastic bags. While the study reveals that it would be technically feasible to draw up such a standard, it was also apparent that there would be certain practical difficulties involved in its application. Manufacturing and distributing interests have been consulted in an effort to find a solution to these difficulties and these consultations are still proceeding.</P>
      <P>The institute has from time to time, drawn attention on television programmes to the dangers involved in these bags for children and it will continue to use publicity to this end, as opportunity offers.</P>
      <P>I would urge parents to exercise particular care to ensure that their children do not play with plastic bags as their misuse can result in loss of life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his predecessor promised that as soon as these findings were presented by the institute he would take steps to implement the safety measures?  I specifically mentioned the feasibility of having perforations or holes made in these plastic bags and he said he would bear that in mind.  Seeing it is so long since the Minister got the findings of the institute, the Department are being very lax in putting them into practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The making of perforations or holes in plastic bags can be suitable in certain instances, but there are obviously particular commodities which go into plastic bags where perforations or holes would not be suitable. There are complications involved. That is why I say consultations are still going on between the manufacturing <Col N="1537" /> and distributing interests and my Department with a view to arriving at a satisfactory solution arising from the report of the institute.</P>

If there are difficulties that can be ironed out before a specific decision is taken I am all in favour of trying to iron out those difficulties and finding a solution acceptable to the vast majority of people and which has a far greater prospect of success. I am rather surprised at the suggestion of the bulldozing approach which is being called for by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been press reports suggesting that this country has been one of the biggest purchasers of CS gas?  The Minister refers to it as smoke, a term first used by the Stormont authorities.  In fact, it is gas. There have been reports published suggesting that we are the largest purchasers of this gas.  The Minister owes it to us to state that this cannot be regarded as any kind of security equipment. Would the Minister, therefore, give us some information about the amount purchased, the reasons why, whether there have been any increased purchases in the past year, what they were, and whether those increased purchases have anything to do with internal or external developments?</P>

Having regard to the fact that all right thinking people are appalled at the possibility of the use of this relatively untested and potentially injurious gas against citizens of the State, would the Minister give a categorical assurance that under no circumstances will the gas be used until it is established beyond all medical doubt that it will cause no long-term injurious effects to human beings and that innocent persons will in no way be affected by its use?</P>

The Minister is probably no doubt <Col N="1556" /> aware that recent reports have indicated that long-term effects, including serious chest complaints and serious skin irritations, can develop even years after such people have come in contact with the gas.  There are also indications that serious nerve complaints can develop.  Having regard to the fact that those investigations are still proceeding in the United States and elsewhere, would the Minister not now give a categorical assurance that until all those doubts are removed this appalling, noxious gas will not be used under any circumstances in this island?</P>

      <P>Major works which are contemplated to reduce any pollution that may occur include the laying of the new Dodder Valley sewer now in progress and the south-west Dublin drainage scheme which is at planning stage.  These will be followed by a new outfall works at the South Wall.  These schemes are estimated to cost about £9½ million.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, are adequate to enable planning authorities to deal with the problem of replacement of period buildings.  A development plan can provide for the preservation of amenities and in particular for the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest. A planning authority cannot grant permission for a development which would contravene materially the development plan without the consent of the Minister.  Furthermore, in operating their powers of planning control, a planning authority has to have regard to the proper planning and development of their area&mdash;including the preservation of its amenities; they may refuse permission for the development or attach such conditions to it as they see fit, including conditions regulating and controlling the design, colour and materials of structures.</P>
      <P>It is within the framework of this legislation, designed to ensure the proper planning and development of each area, that the replacement of appropriate buildings should be secured rather than by a blanket provision which could operate in individual cases against sound planning.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for a most comprehensive reply.

This is the centre of the proposed regional tourist area.  It is a well-known tourist area and the people feel that toilets should be provided there.  It is being set up as a tourist area by the Tourist Board.  It is an urgent matter to have toilet facilities there.  The previous Minister refused even to consider this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>As the House was informed in reply to previous questions on this matter the rapid development of Dublin city and its environs has tended to tax temporarily the existing water supply system in certain areas, including those referred to by the Deputy.  Schemes are, however, in planning or actually under construction by the local authorities concerned to ensure that an adequate supply of water will be available in all areas as soon as possible.  The Dublin City and County Manager has made public appeals asking consumers, as a precautionary measure, to limit their use of water and not to hose gardens, wash cars, <i>et cetera,</i> while the present dry spell lasts.</P>
      <P>I fully endorse this appeal.  A piped water supply is an essential public service in a built-up area.  The cost to public funds of harnessing, treating and supplying the water to consumers is heavy.  It is vital, therefore, that everyone should appreciate the necessity to use the public water supply in a responsible manner, particularly during lengthy spells of dry weather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning authorities have wide general powers under section 19 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to indicate development objectives for their areas.  Subsection (3) of section 19 provides that a development plan may indicate the objectives of the planning authority for any of the purposes mentioned in the Third Schedule to the Act.  The Third Schedule lists a wide variety of matters which may be the subject of general or specific objectives in development plans.  These include items related to the securing of the greater convenience and safety of road users and pedestrians, the establishment of the line, width, level and construction of new roads and the regulation and control of the layout of new development, including requirements as to road layout and the provision of service roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if a development plan does not set out objectives of this kind, a planning authority would be entitled when dealing with applications for planning permission under section 26 of the Act to attach any conditions to a proposed permission which they consider appropriate in the particular case. Such conditions might require the provision of new roads to certain widths and standards.  Any applicant who considers <Col N="1576" /> that proposed conditions are unduly onerous would, of course, be entitled to appeal against them.</P>
    <P>There are no limitations imposed by the Act as to the standards the planning authority may require to be met, but I would hope that any standards laid down would be reasonable and in the interests of the proper planning and development of the area.</P>

      <P>In a letter dated 11th December, 1969, the Kerry county engineer informed the Department that the county council had recently passed a resolution that the Minister for Local Government be requested to classify the road from Dingle to Tralee and the road from Dingle to Castlemaine as national secondary roads.  Following a review of the national roads network the council were informed by letter dated 20th February, 1970, that the Minister was unable to accede to their request in regard to the Tralee-Dingle road.  I was not aware of this correspondence and I regret that in my reply to the Deputy's question of 4th June it was stated that no representations had been received in relation to this route.  Yesterday a letter dated 16th June was received from the county council requesting me to receive a deputation on this matter.  This request is under consideration.</P>

      <P>Figures of the number of lifeguards available on all beaches are not available in my Department. The employment of life-guards is a matter for the local sanitary authorities and my Department has repeatedly urged that they be employed at all bathing places where conditions warrant.  While standard qualifications have not been laid down, I understand that persons being employed are normally expected to be between the ages of 19 and 45 years, of good physique and character, and to hold a medal or certificate of proficiency in life-saving from an approved body such as the Irish Red Cross Society or the Royal Life Saving Society.

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald gave notice that he would raise the following matter: the pass mathematics papers which have been the subject of protest by six educational bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because, while every year there are complaints about some questions on the papers, and this can be regarded as inevitable, what has happened on this occasion in regard to the pass paper is on a different scale and is of a different character from what has happened previously.  It is unique to have a situation in which six teaching bodies involved either in a specialist or general way with the teaching of mathematics have protested in the strongest terms about the paper.  As the Minister is aware, the bodies concerned are: the Irish Mathematics Teachers' Association; the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland; the Conference of Convent Secondary Schools; the Catholic Headmasters' Association; the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools and the Teaching Brothers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these bodies have protested and have sought a new paper.  They have not done this without a good reason. There will always be some degree of conflict on the appropriateness of a particular paper but when all these bodies protest in such strong terms and demand a new paper I think the Minister ought to take the matter seriously.  He cannot simply dismiss it <Col N="1585" /> because his Department who are responsible for the papers say they are all right.  Education is a co-operative business.  It is not something to be run bureaucratically from above without consultation on or consideration of the expert views of the people concerned and the Minister ought to be prepared to listen to such views when they are expressed by a responsible body, or bodies, in a responsible way when it is a matter of public import.  The Minister will appreciate, from his own experience as a teacher, how easily it is for pupils to become demoralised and frustrated when faced with something they regard as unfair, something outside their experience, something with which they cannot cope and, in the middle of this examination which they are undergoing at present, the repercussions of this paper can be very considerable. Not alone will the failure rate be very high, unless the marking is completely distorted, but the impact on the students must overflow into their other work because the frustration and demoralisation it has created for them is bound to have its impact elsewhere in the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>A number of points have been made about the paper by the people concerned. Mr. Buckley, chairman of the Irish Mathematics Teachers' Association, has said that the content of the paper is too theoretical.  I quote from today's <i>Irish Press:</i></P>
    <P>Its content requires deep theoretical knowledge.  It was unjust, we think, and there was a complete change of format from the previous four years; this year is the end of a five year cycle ... next year there will be a new programme and a new syllabus.  We also think that it will discourage future pupils from taking mathematics.</P>
    <P>He added that:</P>
    <P>... he did not know why the paper had been set in the first place. It was very difficult because, besides the format change, the language in which the questions were couched was new, in the sense that it suggested to him that this particular <Col N="1586" /> paper could have been set for what he would call mathematicians.</P>
    <P>Normal Leaving Cert.  pupils, however, who were doing maths at a pass level could not be expected to be mathematicians.</P>
    <P>They could only be expected to be able to reach a certain standard of maths at a practical level. &ldquo;This paper, we think, was not a paper for pass standard&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the view of Mr. Buckley, a man of whose view account must be taken because this is an organisation of experts in this particular area, mathematics teachers, and this is their voice through their chairman.  What he has said must be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The fact that his view has been supported and endorsed independently, or in consultation with him, by all the other teaching and managerial bodies must also be taken account of and now I have just been handed a letter which has come in to a member of our party on this subject:</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to No. 2 paper in pass mathematics on which all the adjectives in the English language have been used and I honestly believe that Questions Nos. (2) to (6) are not on the pass syllabus, but it is impossible for students to understand them let alone answer them.  It is grossly unfair to candidates whose whole future depends on this examination and the strain and tension is increasing daily as each successive paper comes.</P>
    <P>That is the view of someone who has written in on the subject today.  I have been talking to a mathematics teacher within the last hour and discussing the paper with him.  In fairness, I should say that I am not qualified to speak on the details of the paper.  It is a long time since I studied mathematics and mathematics were never a good subject with me.  I am necessarily speaking at secondhand in a matter of expertise. I claim no expertise.  It is not the function of Members of this House to be experts in everything.  It is rather our function to represent the views of people who are experts in their own area when these views have validity <Col N="1587" /> and seem to be worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the paper in the light of the comments.  The Minister will see that the complaints are not necessarily that there are a large number of things not one of which should appear on any paper and in such a form; there are some things which should not appear on a pass paper and other things which should not appear in the form in which they appear, with a theoretical bias, but almost all the questions are in some degree too difficult or too theoretical and that makes the paper unacceptable. On any paper in which there is a choice there can be two or three questions outside the competence of the normal student.  Students have to answer six out of ten and, from the point of view of choice, they can take them in their stride.  When there is virtually no question which does not contain a difficulty of the kind I have mentioned and the pupil finds he can answer nothing fairly readily within the course he has covered, then he becomes completely demoralised.</P>
    <P>I understand the first question is acceptable as regards (a) but, as regards (b), I am told the ordinary pass mathematics pupil, even though taught by someone experienced in teaching honours mathematics, as is this particular teacher who was speaking to me today, would not understand the question.  This is not something he would normally do; it was never on a paper before.  It would probably frighten most students.  Question No. 2 is mesmerising in its length.  May I mesmerise the House with it?  This is what the pupil is supposed to take in when he sits down in front of the paper.  I think the question could quite validly have been asked without going so far as this:</P>
    <P>(a)  p and q are two numbers which can be written as non-terminating decimals with patterns as follows:</P>
    <P>p=</P>
    <P>2.10110111011110111110111110 ...</P>
    <P>q=</P>
    <P>2.020120112011120111120111112, ...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> Say whether each of the numbers is rational or irrational.</P>
    <P>(b)  is a theoretical question:</P>
    <P>Give an example which shows that the sum of two irrational numbers can be a rational number.</P>
    <P>Can the product of two irrational numbers be rational?  Explain your answer by giving an example.</P>
    <P>Pass pupils do not study mathematics in that way.  This is too theoretical for pass pupils.  The questions on a pass paper are meant to be practical questions within the competence of a pass student.  The ordinary pass student would find it difficult to put down examples.</P>
    <P>Part (c) of question No. 2 has not been asked since 1950&mdash;20 years ago.  It has been resurrected this year with all the other impossible things in this paper.</P>
    <P>Question No. 3 is too generalised and theoretical and, in regard to (b), 14 sets are needed to answer the four questions under (b), which is also, I am told, unduly theoretical.</P>
    <P>This is 4 (a):</P>
    <P>The numbers1/n, n and (&mdash;1)n are the nth terms of the sequences S(¹), S(²) and S(³) respectively.</P>
    <P>Then there are questions asked about that.  I have been told the ordinary pass pupil would have knowledge of 1/n but no knowledge of the square root of n and the sequences S(¹), (²), and (³) he would never have seen before.  This notation is not used in the teaching of pass mathematics in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Question No. 5 as asked is one which the pupil would not recognise as a normal formula of logMn.  With regard to (b) it would be necessary to pursue this to infinity, which is not normally done, and it is, in fact, doubtful if this is on the course.</P>
    <P>There is a slight difficulty in 6 (a) but it is one which would be acceptable if it were in isolation on the paper; (b) involves the drawing of a graph, which is unusually difficult, and the rest of <Col N="1589" /> the question is regarded as too difficult and involved.  It would frighten away the pupil, quite apart from its content. Question No. 7 is more for honours than pass.  It has never been on a pass paper except in the form of an equation, but it is not in that form here. Pass pupils might be able to manage the first part of 8(a), but they would not be able to manage (b).  It is an honours question and should not appear on a pass paper.  Question No. 9, the ordinary pupil will read and pass on, not knowing what it is all about.  This kind of question is not normally done in the class.  There is a minor difficulty in that the last part is:</P>
    <P>Solve the equation g(x)=4.</P>
    <P>There is no reference back to &ldquo;g&rdquo; earlier on.  An honours student would know enough to look back but a pass student would not.  Question No. 10(a) is all right.  The second part is too theoretical; (b) is all right; (c) is a totally different question unrelated to 10(a).</P>
    <P>There is no question on that paper in respect of which questions cannot be raised from the point of view of validity and appropriateness.  It is no good the Minister saying that this is all on the course.  With mathematics anything can be on the course, but this is a pass course and pupils are prepared to deal with questions capable of a simple or elementary approach. There is a clear distinction between honours and pass and no one question on this paper falls clearly into the pass category.  In every question there is a difficulty.  With such an indictment as that, coming from such an authoritative source and with such support from all the teaching interests concerned, the Minister really ought to reconsider this.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the <i>Irish Press</i> of today's date, there is an excellent editorial headed &ldquo;Maths Paper Crux&rdquo;.  The <i>Irish Press</i> is frequently to be complimented on its editorials on subjects like this, particularly in the field of education in which it shows a great interest.  The editorial reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Irish Mathematics Teachers' Association is a responsible body, and not one in the habit of making complaints about the examinations <Col N="1590" /> set by the Department of Education. For that reason its statement yesterday attacking the pass maths paper in the current Leaving Certificate examination should merit careful attention.  The teachers' condemnation of the paper has been strong and unqualified, and the bland rebuttal of the charges by the Department will do little to assuage the considerable public disquiet which the teachers' statement has raised.</P>
    <P>The Department did have expert advice in the setting of the papers and presumably the normal care was taken.  But quite clearly there either exists a serious conflict of interpretation between the teachers and the Department as to the content of the course or else the Department is setting standards not normally attainable at Leaving Cert. level.  In the final analysis the people best qualified to judge the capabilities of the students, and those most familiar with the courses done by the students are the teachers, and the extent of their dissatisfaction with the papers clearly indicates a breakdown or lapse of some sort.</P>
    <P>If the Department goes ahead and refuses to yield to the teachers' request there are two possibilities, neither of which will do any good to the public image of the Department. If the failure rate is no higher than usual, the suspicion of a &ldquo;ready up&rdquo; within the Department will not easily be removed, and doubt may be cast on the credibility and reliability of the whole examination system.  If, on the other hand, there is a high failure rate, all the indications will be that the Department's refusal to admit the possibility of an error resulted in many students failing, who would otherwise have passed.</P>
    <P>That is a responsible and reasonable approach to the problem.  I trust the Minister will take account of what is said in that editorial in the <i>Irish Press.</i> His Department's statement, as reported in today's newspapers, about choice in the paper is, I understand and I have evidence in the form of the paper for 1968&mdash;untrue.  The Department is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> In regard to the Leaving Certificate Maths (Pass) it was stated that the paper this year contained a far wider selection of questions than in previous years.</P>
    <P>This is an incomprehensible statement for the Department to make.  If they know so little about their own papers, I do not think their judgment on the content of the paper should be taken seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What relevance has that to the complaint that this paper is totally different in character to the last four papers within the syllabus?  If the Department meant that then somebody was simply trying to dodge the issue and to raise a red herring here. The syllabus is not at issue.  We know that four papers have been set on this syllabus.  So far as I am aware, they did not give rise to any similar dissatisfaction. However, in the fifth and final year of the syllabus, a totally different kind of paper has been set.  It may be appropriate to the syllabus for next year if the pupils and teachers are told what to expect.  We can raise standards all the time&mdash;gradually&mdash;but people must be given time to adapt to them. The teachers must be given time to understand the new approach.  To introduce, in the fifth year of a five-year cycle, a totally different kind of paper and at a level completely inappropriate to pass, and to try to justify it by the red herring of a bigger range of questions is disreputable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is in a difficulty.  I, also, should be in a difficulty if I were in his position.  In going over this paper, not being a student or a teacher of mathematics, my own knowledge of mathematics does not enable me easily to judge whether or not the allegations are true.  The Minister may well be in the same position.  Perhaps he is&mdash;I hope he is&mdash;better qualified mathematically than I am.  Before taking a final decision on this matter, however, the Minister ought to see the people concerned.  If he is not in a position to <Col N="1592" /> give a positive reply this evening to my request to set another paper&mdash;he may be in difficulty about deciding it on the spot&mdash;I would urge on him to receive a deputation from the Irish Mathematical Teachers' Association and any other bodies who want to see him on this matter, to listen to them as I have listened to them and then, having listened to them and having got the views of his Department, to make up his own mind.  I would urge on the Minister not to take a negative decision unilaterally on the basis of the only advice given to him by people who inevitably have an interest in defending the paper for the setting of which they are responsible.</P>
    <P>If there is a difficulty, because of the technical complexity of the problem, the Minister will require to think about it and he will require advice from a wide range of sources.  He has open to him the advice of these bodies.  If he is not able to state positively that he will agree to set another paper, he should agree immediately to meet these associations and to be briefed on both sides of the case.  The demoralising effect of this paper on students is causing great concern.</P>
    <P>A difficulty has arisen in some centres due to the absence of a sufficient number of log tables.  There are two schools within a few hundred yards of this House who complain that, at the centre which they share, there were simply not enough log tables and students had to wait their turn for them.  That meant that the students were not able to tackle the paper as they would have wished to tackle it and to do the questions in the order of their choice.  They had to wait their turn for the log tables.  The Minister knows the tension that exists at examinations.  He should be sympathetic in this matter.  Quite apart from the main problem here today, I would ask him to ensure that adequate sets of log tables will always be available at the various examination centres throughout the country and that a situation will not occur again of the type that has occurred this year where there was a scarcity of log tables.</P>
    <P>On the main issue, if the Minister <Col N="1593" /> has not a positive answer tonight in relation to the protest over this year's leaving certificate maths (pass) paper, I urge him to see the experts involved and then to make up his own mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly may I say a few words?  I assumed that Deputy FitzGerald started at 5 o'clock and that I had three minutes in which to speak.  It is fitting and proper that this rather anomalous situation should be raised on the Adjournment this evening and I rise to support the points made by Deputy FitzGerald.  I think the basis of the complaint is quite legitimate, in the light of the information we have received.  There does seem to have occurred a rather serious error of preparation in the setting of the pass maths paper, leaving certificate, and, arising from this, there is a very urgent need for the Minister to give the public reassurance, to resolve the situation and to get rid of the confusion and concern.</P>
      <P>While Deputy FitzGerald and myself are quite well aware of special pleading that does occur in relation to some examination papers, on this occasion, in the light of the reputable information conveyed to us by the mathematics teachers themselves and by their association, it would be fitting and proper that the Minister should meet them, consult with them, rather than rush into the precipitate, defensive reply which we may anticipate from him this evening.  We believe, therefore, he should have these consultations and, having heard all the evidence from all sides, make up his own mind and relieve the current rather serious confusion and distress that has occurred which is damaging&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I may say that I have very carefully considered <Col N="1594" /> this matter.  Not only did I discuss it with the officials of my Department&mdash; which was obvious&mdash;but, for the reasons stated by Deputy FitzGerald, I also discussed it with various mathematics teachers.  Having considered the matter very carefully, I cannot accede to the request to set a new paper.</P>
      <P>Let me deal first with the technical side of the matter.  This paper was set out in accordance with the syllabus for secondary schools for the leaving certificate issued to secondary schools, pass course.  I want to emphasise that fact.  Some reference was made to the possibility of some of the questions being based on the honours course. So far as I am aware, nobody has suggested otherwise.</P>
      <P>The main cause of the complaint appears to be that the format of the questions was not the same this year as it was in previous years.  All I can say about this is that the format of some of the questions this year was not the same as in previous years but this is normal procedure.  Each year some changes are made in the format of some of the questions.  In many instances the format of the questions was the same as it was in previous years.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into detail in relation to the papers here, as Deputy FitzGerald did, except to say that I discussed some of these questions with mathematics teachers and I found that in many of the instances where Deputy FitzGerald suggested the questions were too difficult the teachers concerned accepted that they were not too difficult.  I might also add, of course, that all the teaching organisations concerned were involved in the framing of the syllabus.  This is the syllabus, as I said before, from which these papers did not depart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information given to me personally from a number of sources indicates that a high proportion of the schools would be disturbed, in fact very disturbed, if there were any question of setting another paper.  I want to emphasise that.  I was also assured by these schools and teachers that where students read the questions the average student was able to reach the same degree of success in answering <Col N="1595" /> the paper as he would in previous years.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies are aware of the position in relation to mathematics. The pass and honours courses are entirely different.  Only about 12 per cent take the honours course.  The pass papers, therefore, must cater for a very wide range of student ability and in the process they must provide the standard necessary for university entrance, for entrance to the Civil Service, for entrance to teaching and the various other professions and occupations.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this of which Deputies are not perhaps aware. This paper has to satisfy the collaborating examiner from the university. There are two papers in mathematics, paper 1 and paper 2.  Paper 1 consists mainly of the traditional material and paper 2 deals with the more modern aspects of the syllabus.  Candidates' marking will be based on their answering of both papers.  Taking the two papers jointly, I am satisfied, as are many others with whom I spoke, that they provide a fair test in mathematics for the average leaving certificate student.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that what we are dealing with here is the leaving certificate.  If we do not seek a sufficiently high standard for that examination&mdash;and might I add, if we are not seen to seek a sufficiently high standard&mdash;then our educational system will be devalued.</P>
    <P>As both Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Desmond mentioned, there is nothing unusual in representations being made to the Department in relation to individual examination papers. Very few years have elapsed in which there have not been representations in relation to one subject or another. These representations have always been borne in mind in relation to the marking of the papers.  This course will be followed in the case of the mathematics papers, 1 and 2, this year.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am satisfied from the very careful consideration I have given to this paper that it would not be the right course to set another paper and this view has been backed up by the <Col N="1596" /> schools and by the teachers with whom I have spoken.</P>
