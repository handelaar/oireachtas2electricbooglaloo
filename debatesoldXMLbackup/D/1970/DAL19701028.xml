    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will introduce legislation whereby members of the Dáil will be enabled to seek information concerning statutory bodies who receive assistance from State funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind State bodies in receipt of assistance from voted moneys.  I consider that legislation on the lines envisaged by the Deputy is not necessary.  At present, in the case of such bodies, there is opportunity for annual parliamentary debate on their affairs.  The Minister directly responsible <Col N="2" /> usually gives a detailed account to the Dáil of the policy objectives and programmes of the bodies under discussion and answers specific questions raised by Deputies in the course of the debate.  Further-more, the annual reports and accounts of these bodies are laid before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputies also have recourse to the parliamentary question and, of course, they may contact these bodies direct for information.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, in regard to statutory bodies, that it is not proper to reveal information which may be considered as a breach of commercial secrecy or as an undue interference in the managerial independence to which these bodies must be entitled if they are to be enterprising and efficient.  I would add, however, that the general position is being re-examined in the light of the recommendations in relation to these bodies in the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that State bodies disburse public funds and that it is impossible for Members of this House elected by the Irish people to get any information from the Taoiseach as head of the Government or any of the appropriate Ministers?  To illustrate my point I shall ask the Taoiseach about the £800,000 that was supposed to be disbursed last year by Bord Fáilte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I have a reply from the Taoiseach?  He states by way of answer to a Dáil question that this information can be made available.  I find it is not possible for me as one Member of the House &mdash; and I think the same applies to other Deputies &mdash; to get information which we should like to have on the disbursement of public funds provided by the Irish people to State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fullest information possible is made available to the House having regard to ordinary commercial prudence.  In the specific matter referred to by the Deputy there is a similar problem, but as I indicated to the Deputy the Public Services Organisation Review Group have reported and their report is being examined.  A major decision has already been taken and further decisions will be made according as the examination is completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8 together.</P>
      <P>I discussed with Mr. Heath many matters of mutual interest, including the application of both our countries for EEC membership, the working of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the situation in the North.  On this last subject I expressed my views about the quality and speed of reform.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to go into further detail on the subjects discussed.</P>
      <P>Our conversation was cordial and very useful.  We agreed to meet again next year, and further meetings could then be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether he gave any indication to the British Premier that the best way of obtaining a Government in the south of Ireland which would be united in commitment to a peaceful solution of the Irish problem would be by having an early general election and his own replacement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be right that conversations like this should be disclosed in detail, but I went into all aspects, or as many as I could in the time at my disposal, relating to our interest in the proper functioning of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of this meeting was the Taoiseach so confirmed in his confidence in Mr. Heath and the Stormont Prime Minister as to express in the United Nations some days later his total confidence in their handling of problems in this area?  In other words, was information passed to the Taoiseach, in his meeting with Mr. Heath, which confirmed and underlined the correctness of his speech at the United Nations in New York?  What reasons led the Taoiseach to make that surprising speech at the United Nations in New York?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with the British Premier or did the British Premier inform the Taoiseach that he was about to impose <Col N="7" /> levies on our exports to Britain which may seriously affect our agricultural producers in the near future and which are in breach of the Free Trade Area Agreement entered into between this country and Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had already received communication of proposals to impose levies.  That matter has been taken up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, when will that matter be taken up?  Is the Taoiseach aware that this will seriously affect our agricultural exports?  This is about the fourth breach of this agreement by the British Government.  The Taoiseach and the Irish Government have stood idly by in the past three years while more and more breaches of this agreement have been committed by the British Government.</P>

      <P>May I put a supplementary question to the Taoiseach in relation to Question No. 5?  In the course of his discussion with Mr. Heath, was any reference made by the Taoiseach to the wish of the Irish Government for the urgent provision of special welfare services for Irish <Col N="8" /> emigrants?  Was any reference made to the plight of Irish emigrants and to the need for special care and special services for them?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has been reported in certain newspapers this morning as having said that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, gave details of his economic proposals to a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party last night.  I should like the Taoiseach to say whether or not this is true.  If not, he should make a statement to allay the fears of the Irish people.  In my personal experience, Budget secrets have never been disclosed generally.  After going to the Cabinet the Budget then comes to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, the Minister for Finance indicated, as was already well known, that he proposed to introduce in the Dáil today certain Financial Resolutions.  He did not in any way refer to the content of these Resolutions.  He then explained the purposes <Col N="10" /> of the prices and incomes legislation in terms similar to those he had already used at a press conference two weeks ago.  He went no further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether or not the statements attributed to the Taoiseach in this morning's public Press are true?  Here is an example:</P>
      <P>Mr. Lynch said that because of the seriousness of the economic situation this was fully discussed at the meeting and the Minister for Finance, Mr. Colley, in outlining his proposals indicated he proposed to introduce Financial Resolutions today and outlined the proposals in the legislation which proposed to deal with prices and incomes.</P>
      <P>We take it, therefore, that the Minister for Finance did not disclose details of the proposals to be announced in the Dáil today?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to establish a special Ministry to tackle the problems of pollution.  Some time ago I requested the Minister for Local Government to arrange for high-level inter-departmental discussions on the subject of co-ordinating measures on air and water pollution.  These discussions have been held and, as a result, the Minister is arranging to set up a working group representative of all Government Departments concerned to examine and report to him on the nature and extent of the air and water pollution problems, the different remedial strategies that might be adopted, the cost of such strategies and the distribution of the cost between the State, local authorities and the private sector, including industry, the adequacy of existing legislation and the need for new legislation.</P>

Does the Taoiseach agree that in view of the warnings given by Dr. Terence Chapman of Baggot Street Hospital pulmonary unit and also by Mr. Arthur Dewhurst of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, who said that drinking water in this country will be a problem by 1980, he should say whether or not he fully believes that it is essential for him to set up a special <Col N="12" /> Government Department or else appoint one Minister with special responsibility to address himself to this ever-growing problem?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that the parents of these 869 children are extremely worried in regard to getting these children into suitable institutions? Would the Minister not also agree that in five years time many of these children, if not the majority of them, will be beyond treatment and would he not do something urgently to get these children housed and into suitable institutions, even if they are not perfect institutions, and thus relieve the parents and other members of these families of this worry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Most institutions will not accept a child after 12 years of age; all of them I think would not accept children after 14 years of age, and eventually when the child reaches 18 he is destined to end up in a mental hospital.  This is the criminal position, not so much the waiting list but the fact that boys and girls now reaching the limits may not get into an institution in two or three years' time.  What steps are being taken by the Department to change regulations and encourage managers of institutions to accept boys and girls at an age at which they are not now accepted?  This is the terrible part of the problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement about the strong representations made in late July, 1970 to his Department by the Dublin Health Authority arising from the acute need for additional suitable accommodation for the adult mentally handicapped and for geriatric cases; and if he accepts the validity of the proposition of the authority that there should be appointed a category of nurse equivalent to that of State enrolled nurse in Britain for a high proportion of the nursing care required by patients in the authority's hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On 16th October, 1970, I received a deputation of members and officials of the Dublin Health Authority to consider the authority's proposals relating to (1) accommodation for psychiatric, including mentally handicapped patients; (2) accommodation for geriatric patients; (3) the establishment of a grade corresponding to <Col N="25" /> the State Enrolled Nurse grade in England.</P>
      <P>I informed the deputation that I was prepared to approve of new building at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, which would contain 170 beds for mentally handicapped persons, together with a new physiotherapy unit.</P>
      <P>With regard to the accommodation needs of geriatric patients, this depends in the first instance on the level at which community services are available. Such services include special housing for the aged, home visiting by public health nurses and social workers, and the provision of meals for persons unable to cater for themselves.  The provision of welfare homes providing living accommodation for elderly persons close to the community and to the various communal facilities is an important part of the total geriatric service. I informed the deputation that I would be prepared to agree to the provision of new welfare accommodation provided that the homes could be suitably located.  I also stressed that the health authority should satisfy themselves that the various domiciliary services were fully developed so that institutional care would be confined to those who were strictly in need of it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the grade of State Enrolled Nurse, An Bord Altranais, having examined this matter at some length, have decided against the introduction of this grade of nurse at the present time.  Certain measures have been taken by my Department and by An Bord which should help to ease any nursing shortages which have arisen in geriatric institutions.  These include the payment of a special allowance of £40 a year to nurses employed full-time on the institutional care of the chronic sick, the granting of increments to married nurses and the making of an arrangement whereby general nursing students will do part of their training in geriatric units or institutions.  It is too early yet to say what effect all of these measures will have on areas where shortages have arisen.  At the discussion with the deputation from the Dublin Health Authority, I agreed that the question of how to meet the staffing difficulties which have arisen in the authority's institutions would be further examined.</P>

      <P>St. Vincent's Hospital is a voluntary institution in respect of which I have no direct functions save to determine the annual amount of revenue deficit which may be recouped from the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that increased charges for the emoluments of accommodation and rations were introduced at the instance of the Hospitals Commission in St. Vincent's and all other hospitals participating in the deficits scheme with effect from 1st April, 1970, in line with similar increases in the case of nurses employed in local health authority hospitals.</P>
      <P>These increases in charges were introduced concurrently with the salary increases granted to nurses under the first phase of the 12th round.  The increases, contrary to what the Deputy was informed, did not nullify the effect of the first phase of the 12th round. The increase in salary granted to a student nurse works out at 30s a week approximately.  The increase in the charge for emoluments works out at 13s a week approximately and it is fair to add that the charges for these emoluments had not been increased since 1964 although several salary increases have been awarded since that time.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the report on the Appropriation Accounts for 1966-67 in the course of which the Public Accounts Committee drew attention to the fact that charges for services provided for resident hospital staffs had not been increased in recent years although salaries and wages had increased considerably.  Since 1964 to date, the salaries of student nurses have increased by approximately 67 per cent while the charges for emoluments have increased by only 25 per cent in the same period.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 43, 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The negotiations with Ireland and the other applicant countries are taking place within the format of what is called the &ldquo;Conference between the European Communities and those States which have applied for membership of the Communities.&rdquo;  The opening of this conference took place in Luxembourg on 30th June at which statements were made on behalf of the Communities and each of the applicant countries.  Copies of the statement made by me on that occasion have already been furnished to Deputies.  Since the Luxembourg meeting, we have had two negotiating meetings with the Communities &mdash; one at Ministerial level on 21st September, and the other at the level of Ministers' Deputies on 20th October.  It has been agreed with the Communities that we should have one meeting at Ministerial level every three months and one meeting at deputies' level of Ministers' deputies on 20th however, that meetings could be held more frequently if this was felt to be necessary.  We are satisfied that the frequency of meetings agreed for this country, which is the same as that agreed for Denmark and Norway, should provide adequate parallelism between our negotiations and those of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Copies of the main statement made by me at the Ministerial meeting with the Communities on 21st September are being made available to Deputies.  In that statement I set out in some detail the matters which we consider require to be discussed in our negotiations including problems of particular concern to us for which we are seeking special arrangements.  On the basis of this <Col N="33" /> statement and information furnished to the Community Delegation at the meeting in reply to questions, agreement was reached on the items to be given priority in the negotiations and the manner in which these items should be dealt with at this stage.  Certain matters are being discussed further by the Ministers' deputies and other matters have been referred to the Commission for preliminary study in contact with the Irish Delegation.  Decisions on the various matters arising will, of course, be taken at Ministerial level.</P>
    <P>Agreement was also reached at the Ministerial meeting on a procedure for consultations with the Irish Delegation during the negotiations.  This procedure provides that, after Ministerial meetings with each of the applicant countries, the chairman of the Community Delegation will inform the other applicant countries of the progress made. The chairman will provide similar briefings after meetings of Ministers' deputies if the problems under consideration so warrant.  In addition, the Commission is to provide the applicant countries with a constant supply of detailed information.  The Community will be prepared to enter into consultations with an applicant country upon request.  The conclusions reached in the negotiations with each of the applicant countries are to be provisional and final conclusions are to be adopted only in multilateral discussions between the Community and all the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>In preparation for further discussion, and to facilitate the studies by the Commission, memoranda have been submitted to the Community Delegation on a number of matters raised by the Irish side.  Further memoranda will be submitted shortly.</P>
    <P>At the meeting at deputies' level on 20th October there was a review of the state of work on the matters which have been referred to deputies and the Commission respectively.  Statements were made by the Irish Delegation on various subjects and the Community Delegation indicated that their examination and study would proceed in the light of the memoranda submitted or to be submitted and the statements made at the meeting by the Irish Delegation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> The next meeting at Ministerial level between Ireland and the Communities will take place on 15th December.  In the meantime, there will be a further meeting at deputies' level on 27th November.</P>

Would the Minister indicate to the House what steps are proposed to keep Deputies informed, at least to some extent, as to what is happening?  Secondly, would the Minister confirm, if such be the case, that since the negotiations opened the representatives of the Community have made no requirement whatsoever regarding the qualification or the abandonment of Ireland's policy of neutrality?</P>

I should like to ask the Minister in view of what he has discovered in the intervening period, particularly with regard to the effect of the Mansholt proposals on the structure of the Irish agricultural community, whether he would like to repeat to the House this formula of &ldquo;without reservation&rdquo;, or whether the Minister has discovered any reservations in the interval?</P>

      <P>The question relates to the EEC.  To allow the rules arising out of the application of the Treaties of Rome and Paris to apply here certain changes in the Constitution will be necessary.

For example, under our Constitution the court of last resort in <Col N="38" /> this country is the Supreme Court, but the European Court would be the deciding court in terms of the interpretation of the Treaty of Rome.

      <P>Members of the House will have learned with the deepest regret of the death, following a brief illness, of Deputy Patrick O'Donnell, ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.  By the death of &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; O'Donnell, as he was affectionately known, the House has lost one of its most popular and energetic members.  First elected in a by-election in 1949, he retained his seat in successive General Elections.  From 1954 to 1957 he was Minister for Local Government, an office he discharged with great distinction.</P>
      <P>An eloquent debater, his frequent contributions to our deliberations were always constructive and well informed and, though a most persuasive advocate, his views were totally free from rancour.  He had on many occasions displayed to good effect his comprehensive grasp of the problems of the farming and fishing communities: equally noteworthy was his deep knowledge of the Irish language and his interest in its revival.</P>
      <P>Fully dedicated to his constituency and its people, on whose behalf he laboured so tirelessly, he served on the county council and many local bodies. He also served for a number of years with the Officers Training Corps of the Army and during the Emergency he was a district adjutant in the Local Defence Force.</P>
      <P>He represented Ireland at various international conferences including the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>Through his untimely death his party has suffered a heavy loss, his constituency of Donegal-Leitrim a devoted representative and powerful champion, and the House a conscientious and universally popular member.</P>
      <P>I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his bereaved widow and family our deepest sympathy.</P>

In view of the fact that these motions are on the Order Paper can the Taoiseach indicate whether it is proposed to provide time this evening or tomorrow morning after the discussion on the first two Financial Resolutions in order to consider this?  The Taoiseach will appreciate that in present circumstances it is unreal to discuss any other business in advance of these motions.

I do not propose, therefore, to go into any detailed explanation of the provisions at this stage.  I merely wish to refer to the fact that they are part of what might be described as a package deal, the second part of which will come under the Financial Resolutions to be discussed later in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Broadly, they provide for temporary control of incomes across the board &mdash; not merely wages and salaries &mdash; for control of rents and for an extension and a strengthening of price control machinery.  That is a broad outline, and all I wish to say in explanation at this stage is that the various economic indicators which make this package deal necessary will be referred to in more detail by me later.  However, there is one indicator with which every man, woman and child in the country is familiar, and that is the grossly accelerated rate of prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister in his blustering remarks in introducing this Bill has given clear evidence of the malaise in the benches behind him.  We are all conscious of the grossly accelerating rate of price increases.  We were so conscious of this on the 23rd April last when the Taoiseach introduced the Budget on behalf of the then Minister for Finance that we reminded him that the turnover tax would lead to this present situation.  We have no confidence in any prices and incomes policy introduced by any member of this Government.  Anything they produce, we reject.</P>

      <P>Because this is a matter of confidence and of trust I shall be dealing with it in some detail later but suffice it to say now that this appalling mess for which the Government by their ineptitude, by their incompetence and by their lack of courage are responsible, cannot be solved by any composite, contrived or panicky method put together by the two halves of Fianna Fáil.  We reject this Bill and will not support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand <Col N="56" /> the approach of the Minister for Finance to this measure.  His concern for the Irish housewife now is pathetic, particularly when one remembers that during his long reign as Minister for Industry and Commerce he did nothing to control prices.</P>
      <P>In ordinary circumstances we would not oppose the First Stage of any Bill on the principle that we would like to see what was in it but the Minister let us know most of the details on Friday night last.  As far as this party is concerned and as far as the trade union movement is concerned neither they nor we will ever agree to any measure which takes away the right to free collective bargaining.  The Government failed to control prices and they now pretend to put a blanket on all incomes. I do not believe this will be so. If the Government wanted to control prices they have had adequate machinery for doing so during the past four or five years, but they have not done so.  In fact, the only commodities investigated under the Prices Bill were electricity and bread while the price of everything else has soared since that Act was passed.</P>
      <P>In the Budget speech delivered in April last by the Taoiseach, deputising for the then Minister for Finance, we were assured that there would be strict price control.  There has been no evidence of this and neither has there been any evidence of any intention on the part of the Government to enforce any sort of price control.  The Minister for Finance has told us that price control will be limited to certain items.  As far as I can remember, this involved the principal items that went into the basket of the housewife.  If there is to be price control, it should be such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we all welcome the change of heart on the part of the Minister &mdash; I do not know who influenced him &mdash; in regard to the 12th round agreement, this change is typical of the Government's indecision.  Within a short week they have changed their minds on a very important matter.  This will not satisfy the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and those affiliated to it.  The Government have shown disregard and disrespect for the views of the trade union movement. I am aware that the trade unions <Col N="57" /> have sought an interview with the Taoiseach.  This was asked for while he was in New York and I do not know whether it has been granted.  The Bill will now be printed but there will not have been adequate consultation with the trade union movement.  As far as the employer-labour conference is concerned it will be seen that the trade union movement were honest and sincere in trying to work out a wage formula but the Government decided to have this blanket freeze.</P>
    <P>We are not impressed either by the Government's proposals as stated by the Minister for Finance that there will be control of dividends and profits. <Col N="58" /> Dividends and profits can be put aside and paid on the 1st January, 1972 but wages and salaries lost cannot be recovered.  We are aware that it is possible to have measures to control wages and salaries but we do not believe that there will be control of dividends and profits or of profits on the sale of lands.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Government that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are opposed violently to a wage freeze and that as far as we are concerned, we will support the trade unions of this country in whatever legitimate action they decide on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 16th of this month I announced certain measures which the Government had decided to take in relation to prices and incomes up to the end of 1971.  To-day I will be putting before the House some Financial Resolutions to complement those measures in bringing under control the inflationary forces which show no sign of easing of their own accord &mdash; rather the reverse.  This inflation is clearly manifesting itself in symptoms which are plain to all &mdash; money incomes far outpacing national production, rapidly rising prices, an increase in consumption of imported goods and a continued serious deficit position in our balance of payments.  This steadily worsening situation could not be allowed to continue and the Government had to face up to the task of formulating a programme of restraint which has, understandably, aroused opposition in some quarters.  The Government are convinced of the necessity for prompt and effective action to safeguard the economic future of the nation and we will not be deterred by any unpopularity which our policy may encounter.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Incomes</i>
      </P>
      <P>The forces which are generating inflationary pressures are of long standing.  Total domestic income rose by 10½ per cent in 1968 and by 11 per cent in 1969.  The acceleration in the rate of growth of employee income in the non-agricultural sector was much greater &mdash; 13½ per cent in 1969 against 10½ per cent in 1968.  By far the greater part of this increase came from increased earnings, as distinct from increased employment.  In regard to the likely development of incomes in 1970, it is provisionally reckoned that total domestic income will rise by about 11 per cent, with non-agricultural employee income increasing by as much as 13-14 per cent.  This trend of income increase is far in excess of the real growth of national production which is likely to be of the order of 2 per cent in 1970.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Consumer prices</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the decade 1958-67 consumer <Col N="62" /> prices rose on average by about 3 per cent.  Following increases, in accordance with this pattern of 3 per cent in 1966 and in 1967, the index rose by almost 5 per cent in 1968.  In 1969 the inflationary momentum gathered further pace and a rise of 7½ per cent was recorded.  This exceptionally high increase has been exceeded in the current year &mdash; the latest index for mid-August shows a rise of 8.4 per cent as compared with a year ago.</P>
    <P>The rise of 7½ per cent in our consumer prices in 1969 compares with increases in the same year of 2.6 per cent in Italy, 2.7 per cent in Germany, 5.4 per cent in the United States and 5.5 per cent in the United Kingdom. While prices and costs have been rising sharply this year in the United Kingdom and other industrial countries, we continue to outpace most countries in our rate of cost and price inflation.  For example, our rise of 8.4 per cent in consumer prices in the 12 months to August last compares with a rise of 6.7 per cent in the United Kingdom over the same period.  In fact, our price rise in this period was greater than the price rise in all the advanced countries of Europe.  Indeed, only two European countries have had greater price increases than Ireland this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Consumer spending</i>
    </P>
    <P>Consumer spending last year was very buoyant, rising by almost 12 per cent in money terms and by nearly 4 per cent in volume.  This rise in consumption was reflected in a big increase in imports of goods ready for consumption which contributed to the record deficit of £69 million on current external account.</P>
    <P>In the early months of this year the momentum of consumer spending, helped by pre-budgetary purchases, gathered pace.  In March and April the retail sales index, which provides an indication of the trend of consumption, rose by no less than 16 per cent in money terms and by 9 per cent in volume.  The pace slackened considerably in the following months and, for a while, actually fell in volume, largely as a result of the disruption caused by the cement and bank disputes.  The indications since July are that, with the settlement of the cement strike and <Col N="63" /> the revival of activity in the building industry, consumer demand is again becoming strong.  In August and September imports of consumption goods ready for use are provisionally estimated to have risen by 10-15 per cent as compared with the corresponding months of 1969.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Balance of payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our exceptionally large deficit in the balance of payments last year was due to a rapid increase in merchandise imports which was not offset by growth in merchandise exports.  Earnings from tourism were not sufficient to bridge the steadily growing gap between exports and imports.  This gap more than doubled between the two years 1967 and 1969, rising from £107 million to £218 million.</P>
    <P>The trade return for the first nine months of 1970 shows no real improvement in the position.  The import excess over the whole period was marginally less by £3 million but this was due to distorting movements in imports of ships and aircraft.  If these commodities are excluded, the import excess <i>rose</i> by £7 million.</P>
    <P>The troubles in the north and our rapidly increasing prices must have deflected many tourists from our shores this year, and it is unlikely that our tourist receipts will show much increase. Some improvement in invisible receipts under other heads is expected but the overall position is likely to be a deficit not far short of £60 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Competitiveness</i>
    </P>
    <P>In 1969 unit wage costs in Irish industry increased by over 10 per cent, a rate which was more than double that in British industry.  No firm figures for 1970 are available as yet but it is possible that these costs will show a further increase of 10 per cent. While this rate is only slightly higher than that expected for British industry in 1970, it represents, nevertheless, a further deterioration in our competitive position.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effects of inflation</i>
    </P>
    <P>While higher prices for imports have been to some extent responsible for <Col N="64" /> these adverse economic trends, the main cause has been excessive income increases.  Increases in incomes in excess of the growth of national productivity cause prices to rise by roughly the amount of the excess.  This price inflation has many undesirable &mdash; and, indeed, dangerous &mdash; consequences both for the individual and for the economy.  It creates a vicious circle of price rise &mdash; income increase &mdash; price rise.  It encourages people to spend instead of saving.  With low savings, there is low investment and fewer job opportunities are created.  Consumption is encouraged thereby enlarging our import bill.  Price inflation also erodes the competitiveness of our goods both on the domestic and foreign markets thereby reducing exports and further increasing imports and unemployment.  It discourages tourists, whose spending is particularly important for the less developed areas, from coming here.</P>
    <P>These are not theoretical deductions of what might happen if prices rise excessively. We are at present experiencing many of the adverse consequences I have mentioned.  Thus, over the past year, industrial production has slackened significantly.  While strikes accounted for some of this, the fall in industrial production in the second quarter of 1970 is a matter of serious concern; excluding seasonal adjustments, this was the first fall since the second quarter of 1966.  Unemployment has increased.  Consumer imports are mounting and the external deficit is at an unacceptably high level. Tourism is in danger of losing its momentum.</P>
    <P>It was to mitigate these consequences that controls in income increases were recently announced and that this Suppelmentary Budget is being introduced.  These measures may cause some hardship, but if they had not been introduced, the hardships which we would have had to face would have been far greater and more enduring. As an economy we do not live in isolation. We must pay our way even at the cost of some restrictions.  If these are not applied when, as at present, the occasion demands it, large-scale unemployment and emigration would ultimately <Col N="65" /> ensue.  We would, in fact, be throwing away the fruits of social and economic development which we have so painstakingly gathered over the last decade or so.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Real Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>We cannot enjoy a standard of living higher than that which our national output justifies.  If we continue to insist that we can, the realities of economic life soon show us our mistake.  Past trends in real and money incomes are sufficient to bring this home to us.  Over the last decade, total money incomes have increased by almost 120 per cent. Over the same period, real incomes rose by nearly 50 per cent.  The disparity between these two sets of figures goes far to explain the increase in prices of 48 per cent over the period in question. The growth in national output over the decade was almost 50 per cent.  This is similar to the rise in real incomes over the period, a factor which illustrates the close relationship between real income and national output.</P>
    <P>To bring the matter closer to home &mdash; wages of industrial workers rose by 42 per cent between 1965 and 1969.  In real terms the increase was 19 per cent, the amount by which the national output rose over the same period.</P>
    <P>We must dispel the illusion that rising money incomes represent rising living standards.  They do not.  It is the rise in national output that is the true and only real measure of the increase in the standard of living.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income restraint</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no truth in the assertion that the recently announced restraints on income increases will erode workers' living standards.  The increase in these living standards in recent years has been but a fraction of the increase in nominal incomes.  The Government's proposals will narrow this gap while ensuring that real standards will increase on a sounder and more desirable basis than before.  The Government are fully aware that these restraints on incomes will be unwelcome to many because they have disappointed those who think that their money incomes can continue to grow rapidly, irrespective of the rate of expansion of our national output.  These people are ignoring the experience of recent years <Col N="66" /> which has made it clear beyond any doubt that, when money incomes rise faster than output, part of the increase will inevitably be negatived by rising prices.  However, many people show an extraordinary reluctance to face this elementary truth.  They concentrate on raising the nominal value of their income without regard to its real value to them, and also without regard to the suffering their action imposes on some of their unprotected fellow-citizens, or to the grave injury they inflict on the national economy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Timing of Government Intervention</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government would have much preferred that a programme of voluntary restraint on incomes would have been agreed between employers and employees, when it was so obvious that this was vital to our national wellbeing. We did not intervene until it was quite clear that agreement would not be reached and until claims had been made for some 13th round pay increases which must have startled many ardent trade unionists both in this country and abroad.  Wildly unreasonable though these demands were, we know from experience that they would have set the pattern for 13th round claims generally and, because the country simply could not afford them, they would have disrupted national activity on a wide scale and for a long time, before being settled, inevitably, at a level that could not be justified by reference to the growth in national output.  No responsible Government could have delayed action any longer or have refrained from the measures which we propose to adopt. We have a duty to safeguard the national economy and to protect the weaker sections of the community from the consequences of the selfish actions of their better placed fellows.  We do not intend to fail in that duty however unpleasant it may be.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose these measures must reckon with the fact that, if no action is taken, prices could well rise next year by as much as 10 per cent. Since prices have already risen sharply in 1969 and 1970, a further and even greater price rise in 1971 would aggravate the serious social and economic problems which rising prices have already generated.  Failure to act now <Col N="67" /> would, in addition, mean that the external deficit would be much greater than even the record 1969 level.  Corrective measures to avoid price increases and external deficits of this order are clearly unavoidable in the national interest.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Legislation on prices and incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me to anticipate the specific proposals which will be contained in the forthcoming legislation on prices and incomes. There are, however, a few general comments which I would like to make at the present stage.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the final stage of the Employer/Labour Conference discussions took place in an atmosphere where truly staggering claims were being put forward and where it appeared that expectations had been aroused of increases in excess of 12th round settlements.  The Government were, therefore, forced to review the situation in the light of these developments. The Government's initial proposal was to spread the burden evenly over all incomes and to apply in 1971 a uniform increase of 6 per cent, with adjustments, to all employees.  They came to this conclusion with extreme reluctance as they were aware that it would limit the increases payable in 1971 to amounts below what would have applied in certain instances if the second phase of 12th round agreements had been allowed to run its normal course.  They felt, however, that the balance of advantage lay in treating all employees on a common basis.</P>
    <P>It has now become clear, however, from the public reaction, that adherence to this approach might well jeopardise the general acceptability of the proposals. The Government have accordingly reconsidered the matter and, as I announced yesterday, have decided that the restrictions should not apply to the increases due under the second phase of 12th round agreements in 1971.  Subject to this modification, the new legislation will incorporate the measures announced on 16th October.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with wages and salaries because they constitute 60 per cent of all incomes and because, in the economy as a whole, they dominate the cost element in production. <Col N="68" /> Restraint on incomes is not, however, being confined to pay.  It is being applied right across the board to dividends, rents and fees for professional and other services, as the Government feel that it is essential that the curbs should apply to incomes generally. At the same time, complementary action is being taken to extend and strengthen price control.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that on reflection our people will realise that, in our present difficult economic circumstances, no more equitable solution could be devised.  It has the real merit that whatever they receive in 1971 is more likely to retain its real value than it would if the Government were to avoid decisive action.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Government expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The controls on incomes and prices are primarily designed to prevent the unjustifiable increases in nominal money incomes and costs which would have been experienced next year if present trends had been allowed to continue without interruption.  But the existing pressure of demand needs to be reduced also.  Excessive demand in both the public and the private sectors must be attacked without delay.  The inflationary effects of a likely deficit on Government current account must be minimised and the over-rapid expansion of public expenditure moderated.</P>
    <P>The sharp rise in pay rates and in prices experienced over the last six months or so has, of course, increased public expenditure, a large part of which consists of remuneration for the public service.  It will be recalled that a similar increase in the last financial year was matched by a corresponding rise in revenue, over and above the budget estimate.  As a substantial allowance was made for revenue buoyancy in this year's budget, there is no evidence that last year's pattern will be repeated.  Present indications suggest that current outgoings could be some £23 million over the budgetary level while revenue will show only a small rise.  This means that there would probably be a deficit of the order of £21 million on current account if no action were taken to reduce it.  To meet a deficit of this size by borrowing would be inappropriate and indeed, <Col N="69" /> indefensible, in view of the inflationary pressures affecting the economy generally. We have, therefore, been carrying out a vigorous and searching review of all heads of current spending in order to bridge the budgetary gap as far as possible from the expenditure side.  It is regrettable that, at this stage of the financial year, the scope for economies is quite limited.  Most items are, by now, fully committed and virtually incapable of being cut.  We have, however, instructed all Departments and agencies that economies must be achieved wherever possible, even at the expense of dislocation and possible suspension of some services.  We have decided to secure economies of over £7 million and to hold current spending within a total of just over £491 million. These reductions do not preclude the possibility of some further assistance for agriculture this year.  The Government are considering representations made by farming organisations and a decision will be taken when their examination of the matter has been completed.</P>
    <P>Capital spending also is being subjected to a critical review and, while reductions at short notice are not easily achievable, we hope to bring the capital programme below the total of £194.5 million contemplated in the budget.</P>
    <P>The principal non-capital items exceeding the budget provisions are as follows:</P>

    </table>
    <P>When this year's budget was being prepared, a provision of £10 million was made to cover the current year's pay increases for the public service. This figure was based on a realistic assessment of the kind of pay round the economy could reasonably support. In the event the 12th round for the public service was fixed at a level higher than provided for, and grade claims required more money than expected.  The modified pay restrictions now proposed, while reducing the bill, could not head off a net excess of <Col N="70" /> about £8.2 million over the budget provision.  This excess is spread across all heads of the public service &mdash; teachers, gardaí, Army, the Exchequer element in local authority staff costs as well as the central civil service.</P>
    <P>Despite the recent fares increase, CIE continues to experience serious financial difficulties attributable mainly to high pay awards for large numbers of employees.  CIE could not meet the escalating pay bill from revenue at the old rates; the company was obliged to raise its fares but there were obvious limitations to this and, as a result, a substantial part of the extra cost must be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The big increase in expenditure on the Social Welfare vote is mainly related to the prevailing state of the economy.  There has been a sizeable and persistent rise in the numbers unemployed &mdash; a factor which should give pause to those advancing extravagant pay claims, because it may well be an early manifestation of the much greater fall in employment which unchecked inflation could bring about.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for the excess looming on the Defence vote.  These include the extension of the Cyprus mandate, the cost of additional security measures, provision for fishery protection vessels and a short-fall in receipts from the UN.  The large excess on the Health vote is mainly caused by price and other cost increases reflecting general inflationary pressures.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer cannot escape these extra liabilities, and in so far as they cannot be met either by offsetting economies or by the revenue provided in the budget, it is necessary to consider raising part of the money from additional taxation.  Otherwise, the entire deficit would have to be paid from borrowing which would, of course, aggravate the inflation from which the economy is suffering.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fiscal measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ideally, in circumstances of such inflation, fiscal policy should aim at producing a current budget surplus, thereby drawing off purchasing power and dampening demand.  But at this stage of the financial year, and given <Col N="71" /> the size of the likely excess of expenditure over revenue, it is unrealistic to think of producing a surplus.  Further reductions in expenditure beyond those indicated are impossible without severe hardship and widespread disruption of services.  The increase in the tax burden which would be required to produce the requisite revenue in the remaining five months of the financial year would be quite severe.  My purpose, therefore, is to minimise the likely deficit by the greatest possible reduction in spending and by a number of tax measures which I consider likely to have desirable effects in moderating present inflationary tendencies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for 1971-72</i>
    </P>
    <P>At this stage in the present financial year it is necessary to have regard to the economic situation which is likely to confront us next year and to select a fiscal programme suitable to that situation.  As part of revised arrangements for a more orderly consideration of budgetary matters, preliminary estimates of expenditure and revenue in 1971-72 were made several months ago and the Government have had them under examination for quite some time. The total figure of expenditure showed an alarming increase over the current year, due principally to the steep upward trend in pay and prices.  Our primary aim has been to cut back this figure so as to reduce the pressure on demand and to bring the total as close as possible to estimated revenue at existing rates.  By considering next year's expenditure well in advance of the usual time, I hope to introduce more flexibility and to minimise the constraints imposed by commitments.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be inadvisable to take final decisions at this stage on next year's expenditure as developments over the coming months must be taken into account but, subject to that reservation, the work of settling the broad outlines has nearly been completed. The utmost economy in Government spending will be imposed even though this may involve reductions in certain services and the deferment of many improvements which would be <Col N="72" /> desirable if the general economic and financial situation were easier.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Up to now, budgetary policy has aimed at balancing current expenditure and current revenue rather than deliberately producing a surplus or a deficit.  Over most of the last decade, a deliberate policy of deficit budgeting would have been contrary to the requirements of our general economic situation, but some economists would argue that, in certain years, it would have been justifiable to aim at a surplus. To the extent that this could be achieved only by increasing taxation, however, it would be necessary to guard against the danger that the tax burden might discourage enterprise and retard the satisfactory rate of economic growth attained in the sixties. But the intense and growing inflation of recent years, and the extent to which money incomes have been racing ahead of national output, may make it necessary to reconsider our former attitude. While, as I have already explained, a surplus could not now be achieved in 1970-71 without severely disrupting the economy, this does not rule out the possibility that we shall in future aim at a surplus on current account in conditions of inflation or at a deficit when economic activity is depressed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Against the total of just over £491 million within which we hope to contain current expenditure in 1970-71, we estimate total revenue at £477 million leaving a deficit of under £14 million. It will be appreciated that the uncertainty normally attaching to estimates, even at this stage of the year, is heightened as a consequence of the prolonged closure of the banks.</P>
    <P>I propose to raise the sum of £5.3 million by additional taxation and to meet the residual deficit by borrowing. I have given a great deal of thought to the selection of tax measures which will have the least effect on the cost of essentials and will have little if any impact on persons in the lower income ranges.  In view of the restraints on prices and incomes, I consider that it would be undesirable to increase the burden of direct tax on personal taxpayers. <Col N="73" /> The Government are determined that fiscal policy will not only curb inflation but will, to the maximum extent possible, avoid price increases which would make it more difficult to hold the line regarding restraint in incomes.  For this reason I am, on this occasion, leaving untouched the main body of indirect duties.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of companies</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to obtain the bulk of the additional taxation required by increasing the direct taxation of companies by £3.5 million this year.</P>
    <P>At present, companies are liable to pay corporation profits tax at the rate of 7.5 per cent on the first £2,500 of profits and at the rate of 23 per cent on the balance.  Income tax at the rate of 7s in the £ is also payable, but the corporation profits tax is deducted in arriving at the profits chargeable to income tax.  As a consequence, the maximum combined rate of income tax and corporation profits tax is just under 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I propose to disallow the deduction for corporation profits tax in computing the profits chargeable to income tax. The change will come into effect this year and will increase the amounts of tax due for payment by companies on 1st January, 1971.  It will yield an additional £3.5 million in the current year and £6 million in the year 1971-72. The maximum combined rate of income tax and corporation profits tax on companies will be increased to 58 per cent.  As companies can deduct income tax on payment of dividends, the net effective burden of tax on companies is reduced to 44 per cent in a typical case where about 40 per cent of profits is distributed to shareholders. This is not high when compared with that in other European countries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wholesale tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>In our existing state of growing inflation I consider it advisable to curb expenditure on luxury and less essential items.  I propose, therefore, to increase to 20 per cent the rate of wholesale tax on those articles which are now liable at 15 per cent.  The increased rate will take effect from 1st November. The articles which will be subject to the 20 per cent rate are yachts and <Col N="74" /> other pleasure craft; motor cars, motor cycles, scooters and mopeds; caravans; radio and television sets, radiograms, record players, gramophones and gramophone records.  The estimated yield from the increase is £0.9 million in the present year and £3.2 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The only other tax increase I am proposing is to raise the rate of road tax on private vehicles by approximately 25 per cent with effect from 1st November.  The new rates will be as follows:</P>

    <P>The increases work out at somewhat less than 25 per cent for small cars and somewhat more for bigger cars.  The rates applicable to motor cycles will be subject to a corresponding scale of increases.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that these measures will yield an additional £0.9 million this year and £2.1 million in 1971-72, all of which will be made available for general Exchequer purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>The restrictive effects of this additional taxation, added to the restraints on prices and incomes, should help to abate the excess demand now coursing so rapidly and so injuriously through the economy.  Personal saving can make a limited but worthwhile contribution. The instalment savings scheme was launched recently to encourage the individual saver to set aside part of his income for a definite period in return for a sizeable tax-free bonus.  It is too early yet to appraise the response to that scheme but the indications so far are very encouraging.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Credit policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is regrettable that our action on prices and incomes and on the fiscal <Col N="75" /> front cannot be rounded out by suitable measures in relation to credit. However, the bank closure has deprived us of reliable information regarding developments in the credit field over the last six months.  As soon as adequate information becomes available a credit policy appropriate to the economic situation will be formulated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>The increases in taxation proposed in this Supplementary Budget are estimated to yield £5.3 million in the remaining months of this year and £11.3 million in 1971-72.  They are presented as a rational and necessary supplement to the prices and incomes policy and as part of a series of reasoned measures whose purpose is to re-impose some degree of balance on the economy.  To many persons in the lower ranges of incomes they will bring the reassurance that the Government are seriously concerned at the personal hardship caused by soaring prices following in the wake of unreasonable and unsustainable pay settlements.  Detached observers, both <Col N="76" /> at home and abroad, will recognise that the Government are firmly determined to slow the gathering impetus of inflation and to restore order in the economy.</P>
    <P>The remedy we are prescribing may be unpalatable but I trust that it will not be too long before its good effects begin to materialise.  We shall continue to keep the general economic situation under close and constant scrutiny and, while we confidently expect that the steps we have chosen will prove adequate, we shall be prepared if necessary to take further action in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>Our economy is fundamentally sound and in the past decade has achieved a rate of growth far in excess of anything experienced before.  It is our firm belief that the measures we are now taking will give it a breathing space in which to recover from the effects of the inflationary developments of the past year or two.  This short pause will give the economy time to renew its strength and resume the advance towards the realisation of its full potential for economic and social expansion.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Minister's statement concluded without <Col N="77" /> even the traditional timid suspicion of a clap from the few Fianna Fáil Deputies who remained in the House to listen to him and from the few members of the Government who sat through it is surely indicative of the realisation not only by the Government but the party that this Government has now landed the country in a most appalling economic mess.</P>

      <P>Today we had what the Minister has been pleased to call a package deal.  We had measures which are drastic and severe, much more so than they should have been; measures which were improvised and hasty, giving evidence of hasty thinking and bad planning but, above all, we had a situation disclosed today which has resulted from the Government's panic decision last week to take action because of their conviction that their vacillation had created an impossible situation.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that inflation is insidious and dangerous.  It is insidious because initially it is a pleasant thing and the more it goes on the more it gives an appearance of prosperity and the temptation is to let in an atmosphere of euphoria and to regard the make-believe as a reality.  It is dangerous because eventually and inevitably it corrodes the pay packets of the workers and saps the earning power of the economy and eventually brings about its own deflation.  It is a cruel end if inflation is not attended to and watched.  Of course, in order to deal with inflation you need prudent management; you need wise planning and, above all, you need courageous and dedicated government and this is just what we have not had in the past two years.</P>

      <P>Inflation really hit this country in the early weeks of 1969. The Government knew it; the economists knew it and the people knew it. Not only did it hit the economy but it spread quickly, so much so that an alarmed Minister for Finance took to radio and television on March 18th, 1969, to proclaim a national emergency <Col N="78" /> because we were face to face with an economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Deputies may remember that broad-cast. Here are some of the headlines: &ldquo;Haughey Warns On Costly Pay Increases&rdquo;; &ldquo;Warns That Hardship Will Result&rdquo;; &ldquo;Haughey Terms The Situation Critical&rdquo;.  That was the time when, if we had in office a prudent, wise and courageous government, remedial action could have been taken which would have averted hardship to the workers.  But, of course, to take action would have meant unpopularity at that time.  It would have meant that the Government would be faced with an initial electoral disadvantage.  This took place in the dying days of the last Dáil and so, three weeks after the crisis was announced, the then Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government waved his fairy wand and proclaimed a state of prosperity.  He brought in a Budget some three or four weeks later, in the latter part of April, a phoney Budget with his eyes on the ballot boxes and the Dáil was dissolved and an election held.</P>
      <P>The people are now paying the price of the dishonour that Fianna Fáil and every member of the Government did to the country at that time.  They knew there was a crisis.  They were afraid to face up to it because they wanted to retain their hold on office.  The election took place and they had, one would have expected, the obligation then of dealing with inflation which was still developing and still affecting the economic strength of the country.  Frankly, I and every other Deputy and everybody at all concerned with the economic affairs of the country expected that this nettle would have been firmly grasped by Deputy Haughey as Minister for Finance when he prepared to introduce the Budget on 23rd April this year.  But no.  In the absence of Deputy Haughey that Budget was introduced and it did not even recognise the existence of inflation &mdash; quite the contrary. It proceeded to do the one thing that would make the inflationary situation ten times worse: it proceeded to double the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, now we know why.  On April 23rd that Government was in the grip of a power struggle and it was not <Col N="79" /> thinking of the economy of the country but each member was thinking of the other man's shoes and that is why an ill-conceived, disastrous Budget was then introduced by a government feuding and intriguing among themselves and merely concerned with scoring personal points instead of doing their duty by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The result is that alarmed by their own vacillation, their own inefficiency and their own neglect they are forced now, in a doomsday situation &mdash; if I may use that term, to borrow it from a recent trial &mdash; into action.  But the unfortunate thing is that what they are doing now is too late.  The harm has already been done. They let things go too far and the plain fact is that the danger of inflation has already left its mark on the economy and the inflationary deflation is already taking place.  There is growing unemployment; there is falling production. The Minister himself told the story in his speech &mdash; a fall in industrial production in the second quarter of 1970, unemployment increasing, tourism losing its momentum and the economy already deflated as a result of uncontrolled inflation.</P>
      <P>In other words the timidity and the vacillation of this Government has already marked the score, set the course for our economy.  No wonder social welfare has gone up.  No wonder the indent for social welfare has increased outside the Budget proposals because unemployment is rising.  We have already started to price ourselves out of export markets because our costs have increased.  Production is falling and the economy is deflated.  Therefore I say that whatever benefit or merit, from an economic point of view, there might have been in this Budget it is now too late.  The only effect of these proposals will be further to deflate the economy, further to increase unemployment, further to affect production and further to make for a severe recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the price of incompetence. This is the price the people have to pay because that Government over there had not sufficient honour to act as they <Col N="80" /> should have in the spring of 1969, because they were not prepared to do the right thing and the courageous thing, to take remedial action when it was necessary.  Their failure to do that has to be paid for now by growing unemployment queues, by people having to pay increased prices, by a pay freeze, by all the things that affect ordinary under-privileged people paying for the mistakes of Fianna Fáil.  I say that these measures are hastily conceived.  I say they are improvised.  I say they are the result of panic and their marks are there in everything that has been done.</P>
    <P>A package deal, says the Minister for Finance, announced 11 days ago as a result of a Government decision. People will remember what was announced &mdash; a pay freeze starting there and then, a pay freeze in accordance with which and under which the State was going to dishonour its own agreements, its own pledged word; a pay freeze which was going to frustrate phased wage agreements that had been brought about as a result of careful and patient collective bargaining.  The Minister announced it and he said that these terms were not negotiable; he was not going to budge and every Fianna Fáil camp follower and sycophant from the Minister for Justice down cried &ldquo;courage &mdash; what a courageous Government this is&rdquo; but they were met by an angry roar of annoyance from an aroused people, expressed through the trade union movement, through the Fine Gael Party and through other responsible organs of opinion &mdash; a roar of anger at the social injustice involved in the State proceeding to dishonour its pledged word.</P>
    <P>Then that roar of anger was taken up by those inside Fianna Fáil who wished to make use of it for their own particular purposes.  Suddenly, before the Fianna Fáil Party met last night the Government proceeded to change feet and announced that they were going to give way.  The sycophants over there were not crying &ldquo;courage&rdquo;, they were crying &ldquo;caution&rdquo;.  They were not clapping them on the back, they were saying &ldquo;take care&rdquo;.  The result is that the Government were forced to recede. What is left?  A hastily contrived measure of taxation and a pay freeze <Col N="81" /> aimed at deflating an economy already deflating.  The wrong measure at the wrong time.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that these decisions, this policy, are symptomatic of a tired team of Ministers, too long in office.  It is time for them to go.  There is token rumour in the papers that the Taoiseach is thinking.  Let him stop thinking.  Let him have courage, dissolve Dáil Éireann and go to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this discussion and these limited proposals are certainly irrelevant to the economic situation in which we find ourselves and more particularly irrelevant to the political situation that has obtained over the last six or nine months.  Before I talk about these new proposals I would say, with reference to a suggestion made earlier, that the sooner we get on to the Motion of No Confidence the better because these proposals will not have the slightest impact on the tremendous economic difficulties we have, the difficulties created by a party who have been in office since 1957.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Charlie Haughey in a remark he made at his press conference last Friday, that he saw no necessity for a Supplementary Budget.  There is a necessity for a Budget, a Budget that will do what Fianna Fáil pretend all their Budgets do and that is to distribute in a far more equitable fashion the moneys available to the Government and to make people who can afford to pay more to pay more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what this is all about.  The Government are to raise £5.3 million by three tax proposals and to borrow the other £8.7 million.  It appears to me that if that is the extent of the problem that they see, a deficiency of £14 million, they are certainly not &ldquo;with it&rdquo; as far as all the various ills we have are concerned.  I would describe the Minister's proposals and his great furore as &ldquo;much ado about nothing&rdquo;.  We are told there will be an increase of £3.5 million in direct taxation on companies.  Whether or not this will be passed on to the consumer we just do not know, but the Minister will <Col N="82" /> have to insist that this will not be done. We know there are various devices whereby certain returns can be concealed and, with a little bit of manoeuvring and bookkeeping, this increase could be sent down the line, despite what the Minister said on the last measure on which he spoke, in relation to prices and incomes.  If the Minister is sincere he will ensure absolutely strict price control.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to increase the wholesale tax to get a further £900,000 in the current financial year. He lists certain things which he describes as luxuries or near luxuries. This increased taxation will have its effect.  It will have its effect on those workmen and tradesmen who have to have a car in order to travel to their work.  It will certainly have an effect on those who travel on motor cycles or scooters.  I think the Minister should take another look at this particular provision to see how it can be modified. We are told £.9 million is to be raised by way of road tax.  In view of the criticism by Fianna Fáil in the past about robbing the Road Fund, we are, I think, entitled to ask whether that £.9 million will go into the Road Fund or whether it will be used as ordinary revenue.</P>
    <P>We are also told that prices may rise 10 per cent next year.  There will, of course, be another Budget in between, but there should be some indication that those who are on small allowances <i>vis-à-vis</i> the cost of living will get some sort of compensation in the very near future, compensation which is not provided for here despite what the Minister has said about price increases.  There is nothing whatever in this.  As I said, a debate on these proposals will not get anybody anywhere because this Budget does nothing more than relieve the Government of their responsibility of facing a deficit of £14 million at the end of the present financial year.</P>
    <P>It is high time a stop was put to the antics of the Fianna Fáil Party. They are speedily bringing the Government and the country into chaos, in some cases into anarchy and disorder. Do they realise what damage their behaviour has done over the last six months?  Do they realise that a <Col N="83" /> certain amount of irreparable damage has been done by their activities &mdash; in some cases by their inactivity?  Not alone have they damaged the economy by their neglect but they have completely shattered the morale of the people.  We have reached the stage where nobody can believe anything that any Government Minister says.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an example of this chaos on the part of the Minister for Finance in regard to the 12th round and phased agreements when he did an about face, under what pressure we have yet to discover.  It is obvious the Government have devoted no attention to the affairs of the nation.  I should like to take the Taoiseach up on one point he made when closing the debate on the Motion for the Adjournment. He alleged that this party had agreed to the proposed long recess.  We had not.  We agreed that business should be concluded by a certain date in July but we complained bitterly of the inactivity on the part of the Government and of the Dáil over such a long period, a period during which so many things were happening, things which should have been discussed here by the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>Words do not appear to mean anything any more.  In this I accuse the present Minister for Finance.  If he looks at column 2028 of the Official Report of 20th May, 1970, he will see there an assurance given by him that there would be no Supplementary Budget this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what reason the Minister had for saying that at that particular time.  The framing of a Budget may be Government responsibility but there is always the mark of the Minister for Finance on it.  We do <Col N="84" /> not know whether it was the mark of Deputy Haughey that was on that particular Budget, or that of Deputy Colley, or of the Taoiseach, or of the Government as a whole.  Deputy Haughey said last Friday night there was no necessity for a Supplementary Budget.  He certainly should know.  We said that the Budget introduced last April was wrong and ill-conceived.  We said it was ineffective in its purpose and in its implementation.  We said it was injurious, as it has since proved to be, to the economy and to the livelihood of the men, women and children of this country.</P>
      <P>There were two major problems to be faced when the Budget of 22nd April was introduced.  One was unemployment and the other was prices. These problems were not tackled by the Government in that Budget.  If they had been we would not now find ourselves in a situation in which unemployment stands at the unusual figure of 58,821.  In the month of September unemployment was 9,412 higher than it was in September last year.  Neither was there any effective action taken, even though the Minister had the machinery at his disposal, to deal with prices because in the second quarter of last year, as a direct result of the doubling of the turnover tax, prices went up by 4.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Budget last April was supported by all the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was defended very vigorously by Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance.  I believe that Budget is responsible for our present economic crisis.  One would imagine from the statements of the Minister today and the various statements of the Taoiseach and other Ministers that somebody else was to blame. Fianna Fáil ought to accept once and for all that they have the primary responsibility for the economy.  They have the primary responsibility to ensure that there is no inflation.  Inflation has been growing over the last three or four years and the Government have not taken effective measures either to minimise or to cure that situation.  It is not the members of the Government who will suffer as a result of inflation; it is the ordinary <Col N="85" /> wage and salary earners and the farmers.</P>
    <P>We have a measure introduced here today by the Minister, defended vigorously and vehemently.  It is a measure designed to ensure that the incomes of wage and salary earners and their standard of living will not be improved for another few years.  I do not believe the people can trust the Fianna Fáil Party any longer.  They certainly can have no faith in the various economic measures they have introduced over all the years they have been in government since 1957.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he is quite sure he will have a majority in a few days or in a week's time.  I am not too concerned about the internal difficulties of the Fianna Fáil Party, but I am concerned because they are the Government. I am concerned that as a result of the in-fighting which has gone on in the last five or six months irreparable damage has been done to the country and to its economy.  Because of the advance publicity in regard to this Budget we thought it would be designed to alleviate a very, very bad situation. The economic life of the country is at stake in this Budget.  It appears tome that more important to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party is the life of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Even though the Taoiseach says he has a majority now, I do not believe that he has a mandate for either this Budget or the repressive wage and salary legislation he tried to push through this House.  I do not think he has any mandate for anything else he introduces here.</P>
    <P>Therefore, why wait?  Why cannot this House now give its decision whether Fianna Fáil should continue in office?  I am not concerned about that party but in view of past happenings why not give the members of Fianna Fáil who appear to oppose him an opportunity of declaring if they have confidence in him.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to delve too deeply into this matter but there have been some extraordinary comments made in the past weekend.  One of the ex-Ministers has stated that the Taoiseach should adopt the honourable course&mdash; namely, to resign.  Others suggested there was no necessity for the introduction <Col N="86" /> of a Supplementary Budget; another was directly opposed to having Deputy Jack Lynch as Taoiseach. Such fun and games may be all right in the Fianna Fáil Party but the people of the country are suffering and are demoralised.  For that reason, so far as those measures are concerned we shall not delay the House.  They are not of any great consequence and will do nothing to alleviate our difficulties.</P>
    <P>One can only be astonished at the casual and bland approach of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister announced the proposals for a wage and salary freeze with a smile on his face and then gratuitously told us they would last for only a while.  I do not know for what period they will continue because the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have totally ignored the trade union movement, which has been severely criticised and blackguarded in some quarters recently.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance introduced these proposals with indecent haste. There was not proper and full consultation between the trade union movement and the Government on the proposals before us.  There was much loose talk about exorbitant demands. There was a report in the papers to the effect that one union was seeking £19 10s per week.  If the Minister knows his job he is aware that this is not so.  There was no such demand made by any trade union executive on any employer and on the basis of such loose talk there was no justification for the Minister for Finance for introducing these repressive measures that were supported by the entire Fianna Fáil Party here today.</P>
    <P>However, that is the approach adopted by the Minister for Finance in these urgent matters; but who can forget what the Taoiseach said quite recently when he stated in reply to a question that there was no crisis?  I do not believe anybody else in the Fianna Fáil Party believed that statement.</P>
    <P>We had another crisis merchant, Deputy Haughey.  When he was Minister for Finance on the 18th March he spoke about a crisis, but two weeks afterwards he told the House in a bland <Col N="87" /> manner that there was no crisis.  The Minister for Lands in some part of the West of Ireland told us recently that there was no crisis; and we had the father figure, ex-Taoiseach Mr. Seán Lemass, announcing on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme last night that there was no crisis &mdash; it was only a matter of personal differences.  I do not know what is meant by personal differences within Fianna Fáil, but some of those Deputies regarded as rebels proclaimed themselves to be a different type of republican than Deputy Colley or Deputy Lynch.</P>
    <P>There are many crises in this country.  There is the economic crisis in which we have inflation and for which the Government are responsible. We have a crisis in the matter of prices for which the Government are responsible and we also have a crisis in unemployment.  There exists a crisis in agriculture for which the Government are responsible.  We have a crisis in the matter of houses whereby unfortunate families must wait six or seven years before getting a house. That is the responsibility of the ex-Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, whom the Taoiseach once described as the Rock of Gibraltar.</P>
    <P>We have a crisis in regard to our balance of payments but what do the proposals now suggested do to remedy all the defects I have mentioned?  The present proposals are a patchwork effort and the entire exercise is so miserable that we would nearly have given permission to borrow the £14 million.</P>

      <P>I have spoken many times about the introduction of a capital gains tax but we are told that the effort would not be worthwhile. Some of the efforts the Government make to collect revenue may not be considered worthwhile and I suggest that they should introduce not only a capital gains tax but introduce a tax that would ensure that the people who have money pay their rightful share of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that in the Bill there would be control over dividends <Col N="88" /> and profits, but we all know that if a person at a certain level in business is told his salary cannot exceed X thousand pounds per year there are many ways of reimbursing him.  He can be given a car, his subsistence allowance can be increased, he can be given more money for entertainment expenses, but what can the Minister do to ensure that these things are not done?  He will take power if Dáil Éireann gives him that power, but we will not.  He will try to control the wages of people who pay every penny due on their income tax.  There was talk some three or four years ago of a proposal to ensure that people would pay income tax in accordance with their real incomes, but nothing was done.  The road workers, the factory workers and the civil servants cannot evade payment.</P>
    <P>There are five or six crises which we regard as very serious; we have recently had the grave crisis in the north that was exacerbated by the antics of members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not believe that this petty and pitful package of proposals is any answer to these crises.  Public morale has been completely shattered by recent events, and this I regard as possibly the most serious crisis of all.  When we go to our constituencies we are asked by people: &ldquo;What is happening?  What are the Government doing?&rdquo; How can the Government expect to have the confidence and respect of the people after the events of the past six months?  The people are astounded by what has happened and they are disillusioned about the integrity of Ministers and those who hold public office.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have done immense damage to the economy and to the morale of the Irish people.  It appears that the affairs of the nation have been completely ignored but the Government cannot ignore them any longer.  The interests of the country should not be subordinate to the interests of Fianna Fáil.  The affairs of the nation and the crises, which the Taoiseach does not believe exist, are second place on the Government's agenda.  My party consider it is time that the ordinary people of Ireland are heard and we believe that the electorate should be allowed to vote.</P>

      <P>The Minister is apparently unaware that motor cycles and scooters are used by workers very frequently.  There is a wholesale tax increase on these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these are not luxury articles? Throughout the country, if not around the city, where there is no public transport available lowly-paid workers use motor cycles and scooters for the purpose <Col N="90" /> of getting to and from work. They get no income tax remission for them.  I pointed out to the Minister previously that I felt he had never had the doubtful pleasure of having to travel to work on a motor cycle or scooter.  If he had, he would have much more consideration for their users.  It is a shame that these vehicles should be included in this.  In addition to that, there is the question of the cheaper type of car.  Does this include secondhand cars as well as new cars?  Surely the Minister is aware that the practice for a group of people travelling long distances to work is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that people have been travelling long distances to work and two or three people travelling such distances club together to buy a car to keep them off the tremendous list of unemployed in this country?  If we have not got wholesale tax on secondhand cars, we have such tax on car replacements. Old cars are seen on the roads every day.  People have to buy odds and ends to keep them running.  In most cases they buy new parts and pay tax on them.  I know Deputy Donegan will disagree with me, but I have no particular objection to a tax on yachts or racing cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at this.  The Minister should also consider the question of radios.  In the 1970's people can say that TV is a luxury but I do not think radios can be classified as luxuries. Many people in this country at the present time are using radios because they cannot afford to pay for a television set.  That may be amusing to those with fat salaries but it is not amusing to those with an old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What about caravans? Are they classed as luxury items?  This may apply in the case of the moneyed <Col N="91" /> class.  Many homeless people in Dublin and all over the country who are unable to provide houses for themselves can provide themselves with a permanent caravan.  Has the Minister made any provision whereby caravans bought out of the necessity to house people, whether by local authorities or by individuals, are exempted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that Louth County Council has already bought the caravan and it would not be subject to this.  I am aware that there are people using caravans or mobile homes as their homes.  I am also aware, as are the Deputies opposite, that the vast majority of caravans are used as luxury items.  Many of them are hired out.</P>

      <P>On any financial proposal it is amusing to hear the efforts made by Deputy Tully.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party need not laugh just because they have not been told so often that they are arrogant. Think about it and see what I mean.  The vast majority of caravans are used for luxury purposes.  It is not possible to make a distinction.  In regard to the case being made about motor cycles and scooters Deputy Tully worked valiantly, as always&mdash;<Col N="92" /> and I give him credit for that &mdash; and produced the argument about secondhand cars.  They are not liable to this tax.  The Deputy then spoke about replacements. They are not liable to this tax either.  Then the Deputy went back to new cars and new motor cycles. Young people who are not very well-off use these.  It is also true to say that there are plenty of people using both cars and motor cycles purely on a luxury basis.  These are young people whose parents provide them with such things.  The majority of people who use cars and motor cycles use them on what would commonly be accepted as a luxury basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true of the majority of cars and motor cycles in this country. As that is so, we cannot have a distinction between them.  The tax we are talking about is in existence and we are talking about an increase of 5 per cent.  In my opinion what we have to do is try to raise revenue at this late stage in the year and within the constraints of which I spoke earlier.  This is not an item which could be regarded as bearing down on the poorer sections of our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the Minister up on the question of whether people use motor cars for luxury purposes.  Let us think of a farmer with 50 to 60 acres of land who is running a dairy farm.  Such a man might need a veterinary surgeon.  The veterinary surgeon would have to go to the farm.  He simply cannot do without his motor car.  It is one of the <Col N="93" /> necessary expenses he has to incur, although it is something he would like to do without.  We can think of teachers who have to travel distances to schools because, through planning restrictions, they are unable to build themselves houses beside the schools.  Most of those people regard a car not as a luxury but as a necessity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of caravans, I suggest that the Minister very easily could distinguish between the people who have caravans for pleasure and those who own caravans because they cannot get houses.  He should be able to amend his proposals to enable local authorities and recognised voluntary social service groups to be exempted from this tax in respect of caravans provided as temporary homes for people awaiting rehousing.  It should be a simple matter for the Minister to amend his proposals to include such recognised groups who provide this very essential service.  It has become essential to provide caravans temporarily for people awaiting rehousing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of caravans used for such purposes is very small in relation to the total number and consequently the amount of the wholesale tax involved would almost certainly be only equal to, or perhaps even less than, the administrative costs that would be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the caravan population is increasing mainly because caravans can be described as a safety valve in the housing shortage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This has to be calculated in relation to the total number of caravans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the housing shortage the increase in the number of caravans in recent times has been disproportionate. The Minister should not decry any consideration we may seek to give to the provision of mobile <Col N="94" /> houses.  This provision means that the Minister is increasing the cost of housing to some people by as much as 6 per cent.</P>

      <P>As this is a general discussion it affords me the opportunity to say, first of all, that this is not a mini-Budget of £5.3 million: it is a Budget of £21 million.  If we examine the statement of the Minister for Finance we find he intends to borrow £8.7 million, to save £7 million and by extra taxation in this year to raise £5.3 million, which is a total of £21 million. I want to suggest that the savings are very unlikely to occur.</P>
      <P>Last week there was to be a wage freeze which was to include the end of the 12th round.  Those of us involved in negotiations on wages, salaries and conditions of employment, on whatever side we are, know the 12th round consisted of three instalments with a tenure of approximately 18 months.  There were various types of first, second and third instalments and various reductions in hours and advantages for employees granted also in three instalments. The first instalment came around last April, the second was to have been around next January and the third the following April with a tenure of a further six months.</P>
      <P>This was to have happened last week but when it appeared to the Government that they could not carry this wage freeze they immediately relented and said they would let the rest of the 12th round continue.  This was the only just thing to do.  Their attempt to do a most unjust thing was defeated by the action of the people, apart from politicians at all.  I heard of this on the 1.30 p.m. news yesterday.  Is it possible for any Department of Finance, any Minister for Finance or any Cabinet sitting around a table to assess exactly what the situation will be on savings in relation to a fundamental change such as this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the revolt by the local authority employees who would have been deprived of a two-stage increase of 7 per cent and 10 per cent.  We had the Civil Service in the same situation.  In <Col N="105" /> the middle of all the ganging-up by the Government party as to whether or not they would vote with or against each other, today they were capable of assessing exactly what saving there would be.  Everybody knows that stopping inflation is something like stopping a ship at full steam ahead in the middle of the sea.  There is a famous non-fiction book about the <i>Andrea Doria</i> where two huge ships three miles apart knew they were going to collide and could do nothing about it.  The ship of state is a huge one and nobody stops it in one day. I want to make the point that no matter what is carried here tonight the ship of state will proceed on its way, people will live the same way, and the deflation in consumer spending which is suggested here will not occur overnight.  People do not do things that way.  It is quite an impossibility within 24 hours to assess exactly what the situation is on the saving of £7 million.  I suggest this will not happen and if anything happens it has been based merely on a guess.</P>
    <P>Let us see what is in the Minister's speech.  The figure for extra taxation, apart from anything else, in a full year is £11.3 million.  Therefore, this is no small Budget and is no small impost. It is a very serious impost affecting us in many ways.  Very often speeches can be as interesting for their omissions as for what is in them.  One of the omissions in the speech is where the £7 million saving is to come from.  I do not know because I have not been told.  If the Minister can tell the House tonight it will be a great help to know where it can come from.</P>
    <P>Is this saving to come from housing, from a tougher interpretation of social welfare regulations, from economies in health provisions, from not sanctioning sewerage for villages and provisions for roads?  If the Minister has acted as I suggest merely on a guess and now comes along and says he intends to make his guess good, he can do so, but only by further damaging the economy, by further depressing the poor people of this country who need housing, the people in the villages who need sewerage and the people who need roads.</P>
    <P>It is quite striking the Minister did <Col N="106" /> not say where he intends to save his £7 million.  In the situation we face today it was incumbent on the Minister, as his predecessors did in their major Budget speeches, to say not only where he intended to raise taxation but where he intended to save.  This was not done.  It was a break from precedent. It is a mistake and is something which bodes ill for the necessary things we wish to do and the services we wish to maintain.  You have the question of the borrowing of £8.7 million.  There was a naïve suggestion from the Minister that because of the bank strike he did not know what the position is as far as the economy is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister clarified what he said it would help us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in regard to the credit situation we did not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am speaking about, in regard to the credit situation he did not know.  In other words, the Minister does not know if some fellow wrote cheques that placed him above the overdraft limit; neither at this stage do the bank managers know.  However, the Minister does know the balance of payments position; he knows the balance of trade and various other figures; the figures for imports of consumer goods, the figures for imports of capital goods and the figures for exports. All these figures are available to him. Therefore, there was no need for the Minister to be so naïve about the situation.  In regard to his £8.7 million borrowing he is almost certain to go to the banks.  That means £8.7 million less will be available to the private enterprise sector.  That means a credit squeeze, and the size of the credit squeeze can be far greater than the £8.7 million being removed from the funds available for private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the question of the people who have not fully negotiated the twelfth round.  I know of a factory in my constituency&mdash;a director of which was on the plane in which the Taoiseach returned, quite <Col N="107" /> by accident I hasten to assure the House&mdash;who have not fully negotiated the twelfth round yet.  They are in the process of negotiating with their 700 employees.  Are they affected by this legislation?  Are they to be allowed to make their bargain with their 700 employees or are these employees to remain at the same wage level until next December 12 months I know most of the twelfth round claims have gone through but there are certain negotiations which are not completed. I can give another instance where a pension proposal in relation to quite a large number of employees is not completed. Is this pension proposal frozen also?</P>
    <P>These are the results of hasty legislation from a Cabinet that is split from top to bottom.  These are measures which could have been introduced at one-tenth of their strength and viciousness about 18 months ago before a general election.  However, the Cabinet, because of their own internal strife, let the country go to blazes and now have had recourse to such measures as will cause unemployment and the gravest dissatisfaction and upset for the people.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that he knew right through the period of internal strife in Fianna Fáil that things were very bad.  I want to remind him that were it not for the cement strike and the bank strike imports would have been far greater.  Let him think of the amount of goods that would have been imported by any builders' supplier in this city, the amount of timber and other necessary goods, even the raw materials to make blocks.  Let him think of the effect of such imports on the balance of payments. Let him think of the accidental &mdash;some say it was not accidental but I shall call it accidental&mdash;slowing down of the economy because of the cement strike and the lack of imports.  It means that our balance of payments position today would be infinitely worse were it not for the cement strike.  We have this Cabinet beating the heads off one another metaphorically while doing nothing to root out the evil that had become apparent before the last general election.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House <Col N="108" /> with the statement already made by Deputy O'Higgins in regard to the crisis of 18th March produced by the ex-Minister for Finance and the fact that three weeks later, when a general election had been decided upon, everything in the garden was lovely; every housing scheme was sanctioned; every sewerage scheme was sanctioned; money was as plentiful as daffodils in the spring.  Fianna Fáil have done what, perhaps, the greatest parliamentarian that has ever sat in this House said they would do before he left.  I refer to the former Deputy James Dillon.  He said: &ldquo;Give them enough rope and they will hang themselves.&rdquo; I believe sincerely now that they have got enough rope and that politically they have succeeded in hanging themselves.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the particular financial resolution under discussion and to what, in my view, is an incorrect decision, the wage freeze.  Fianna Fáil are like Lannah Machree's dog, going a bit of the road with everyone.  If it was a fact that the employees had got a rough run&mdash;and there is still a wage freeze even though a portion of the twelfth round yet to be implemented is to be allowed to run its course&mdash; there was the necessity politically, so that the Fianna Fáil worker in the factory would be able to say: &ldquo;It was not only I who was affected&rdquo;, to make an attack upon profits, dividends and various other items that would be regarded as affecting the proprietors of a business.  For this reason and for this reason alone, and not for revenue purposes, at all, there is this provision whereby for the first time the income tax on the first £2,000 of profit of a company is not deducted before corporation profits tax is assessed.  I want to say something that may not be a vote-catcher and will not endear me to everyone in this House, and, indeed, I remember the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman expressing the same view: part of the problem in our old established businesses is that they have not got enough profit and that they need profit for the purpose of re-investment to keep themselves abreast of the challenge of the Common Market and all the other challenges of the seventies. We are now putting a further tax upon <Col N="109" /> Irish businesses and this tax is to remove a portion of their profits when they never needed them more.  I suggest this is being done merely as a political ploy, that Fianna Fail thinking is: &ldquo;We have had to be rough on the workers so we must be rough on the employers as well.&rdquo;  This is not good financing. To approach this properly there would need to have been given at the same time an incentive for re-investment where re-investment would employ people or defend the jobs that were there.</P>
    <P>Remember that in page 7 of the Minister's speech that has been circulated he adverts to the drop in industrial production in the first half of 1970, the first drop that has ever occurred since I came into this House 16 years ago.  Of course, that drop is the result of galloping inflation, of neglect by the Government.  It is the result of the fact that the Government were prepared, for their own political purposes, to let the economy run riot as long as they got their votes and from their votes got their jobs.  I find it extraordinary that some of the good friends I have in Fianna Fáil do not rise up against this, that they can find themselves living with that party, that they can find themselves within that consortium that are prepared to disregard economics, to disregard the measures that should be taken at certain times, to place the very livelihood and the jobs of our people in jeopardy so that everything can be related to the time of an election; so that the timing of benefits, when the jam gets on the bread, is before an election so that the timing of unpleasantness is deferred until after an election.</P>
    <P>In this instance, there was the other major upheaval within Fianna Fáil. When that major upheaval was at its worst and when the people down the country were wondering whether or not they would support them, when there was this waivering by the uncommitted voter, it would have been political suicide to do what should have been done then, even half or quarter of what has been done tonight.  There we were.  We were slaves of this political machine.  We were slaves of the monolith which is now split down the middle. <Col N="110" /> We were slaves of the fact that Fianna Fáil comes first, God second and the people of this country a very bad third in a very badly galloped race.</P>
    <P>If there was a £21 million deficit forecast&mdash;as is stated in the Minister's speech&mdash;on the Budget as produced on 23rd April, 1970, why did we wait until now?  What happened in between? Were all the advisers of Deputy Haughey before 23rd April stone mad? I do not think they were.  Those of us who have been here for some time, who have served on the Committee of Public Accounts, who have been involved in the business of this House and have experience of it, know that the estimates of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; that loyal band of advisers &mdash; and of the civil servants &mdash; to whom everybody in this country should be grateful for their service &mdash; have always been accurate in the extreme. There have been occasions when it has been possible to balance the Budget to within one part of one per cent.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves with a Budget that was perfection on 23rd April, 1970 and, in the middle of the month of October, will produce a deficit of £21 million.  What happened?  How did the horse get out the gate?  Who unlocked the gate?  Was the Budget of 23rd April a fraud?  Was it related to the election of June 18th?  Was it a situation that allowed the restoration of Fianna Fáil to power, as they thought, for a further four years when the fact was that, at that time, it looked as if they could not get back?</P>
    <P>Let us face it.  The great surprise of the last five political years was the last election.  The Opposition Parties had great hopes before the election. Everybody thought Fianna Fáil was out of favour and that Fianna Fáil would lose seats.  What happened, in the event?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They increased children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil played the same old card trick once again. They bought the votes.  They increased the children's allowances.  They gave everybody something.  It was a distribution <Col N="111" /> Budget containing within it a horrible and despicable doubling of the turnover tax.  But the doubling of the turnover tax was something that did not hit immediately.  The people did not just notice, when they went out, that they were paying 5 per cent instead of 2½ per cent &mdash; a shilling instead of sixpence &mdash; in every £.  They forgot that this was an accumulating tax: when the husband bought a &ldquo;pint&rdquo; he had to pay his 5 per cent and when his wife went to the grocer, the butcher, the draper, and so on, she had to pay 5 per cent on her purchases. It was 5 per cent on practically every purchase made in coin or notes.  The result was galloping inflation.</P>
      <P>May I again quote the former Deputy James M. Dillon, for whom I have such great respect, and refer to the many times he told us in this House that the first stages of galloping inflation are the most pleasant time in the life of a State?  Wage increases came along.  Everybody was happy. There were not huge increases on beer, wine, cigarettes, and so on.  There was just a doubling of the turnover tax but it represented £20 million in a full year.  We are now talking of another £11.3 million in a full year and a deficit on the basis of a Budget produced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, to balance. If I remember correctly, he budgeted for a slight surplus.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that our civil servants and our Revenue Commissioners deliberately led Deputy Haughey astray.  I do not believe our economy went utterly wild since 23rd April last.  Deputy Haughey has come out within the past week and said that there is no need for these measures.  I do not know if he will avail of the opportunity to take part in the general debate and say why he thinks there is no need for these measures.  If this had been dealt with in a non-political way, if Fianna Fáil had not put their votes in the election first and if there had been constant attention to the economy over the past 18 months, and if there had not been this hell of a row in Fianna Fáil, such brutal measures as those now before us would not in any way, at any time, be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> Added to this, and glossed over by the Minister for Finance in his statement, there will be a vicious credit squeeze.  We have adverted to the effect of the cement strike and also to the effect of the bank strike.  My constituency is close to the Border. Friends of mine down the country have been going to the north of Ireland with large bundles of cheques which they received for goods down here and on which they were trying to borrow money in the north.  Consider the position of a business here buying £10,000 worth of raw materials each week from a firm in Britain and which had been doing so for 20 years.  For the first four weeks or so of the bank strike the firm in Britain accepted, let us say, their cheques.  When the fifth week came, they started to realise that their liquid pool was now £50,000 less and that they could not continue to accept pieces of paper because they had to pay their employees and they had to pay for their raw materials or, if it was a raw material taken from the earth, they had to process it.  Quite clearly, they could not continue on lines and therefore there was a disincentive, during the strike, to industrial producers here to import.  These people then ran down their stocks. They went to the north of Ireland and lodged large sums there in Irish cheques.  To my knowledge, they were given accommodation up to three-quarters of the value of Republic of Ireland cheques which they lodged. They succeeded in buying, therefore, enough raw materials to keep their factories running.</P>
    <P>The bank strike plus the cement strike damped down the economy to such an extent that there is no doubt that there is inherent in this situation a balance of payments difficulty such as was never experienced before.  Nothing more than the utterly artificial and accidental situation that prevailed kept these facts from being available for all to see.  They betoken a vicious credit squeeze at a time when the terms of trade have been in favour of this country.  I am quite specific on this. The Minister for Finance has been very glib in his speech.  He omitted to say how he would save £7 million.  He said the price of goods coming into the <Col N="113" /> country had gone up by 10 per cent in the previous six months or so but he did not mention by how much our exports had gone up in price in the same period.  I want to correct this position. The terms of trade were in favour of this country during all the period when this Government put it in pawn.  I almost used an unparliamentary expression instead of &ldquo;Government&rdquo;.  I am glad I did not do so for the sake of the dignity of the House which it is going to be so hard to preserve.</P>
    <P>The terms of trade were all in our favour: we had good harvests: we had an extra trade for our cattle and things were going well and yet the Government allowed the economy to run riot. We are now facing a credit squeeze as sure as I stand here and I should like any Government spokesman to estimate how many million pounds worth of goods were not imported and, therefore, not written into the balance of payments figure in relation to the bank strike and the cement strike.  Such a situation betokens unemployment.  I am here 16 years.  I lost my seat in 1957 at the time of the Suez crisis and the Korean War.  I remember very clearly the present Tánaiste, who was naturally trying to get back into office, coming here day after day and asking numerous questions as the price of cattle fell.  Every time he asked ten more questions the price of cattle fell another 5s per cwt.  From that time I have had to endure, with other Members, the gibes from the Government about what happened in 1957.</P>
    <P>What will happen now?  Our unemployment figures are running on average at 10,000 more than for the corresponding week of last year.  The Minister for Finance has adverted to a fall in industrial production.  We have a balance of payments difficulty hidden by the facts I have now stated. We have £8.7 million removed from the economy when there was never more need for capital investment in businesses to combat Common Market competition and competition as a result of the Anglo Irish Free Trade Agreement and freer trade.  A measure was introduced today that will remove £3.5 million this year from private business and £6 million in a full year <Col N="114" /> in relation to corporation profits tax when there was never more need for capital investment in that type of business for the reason I have already stated &mdash; increased competition.</P>
    <P>These are taking away the life blood of our economy, the preservation of jobs which is even more vital than the creation of new jobs.  I know industries that came here and are doing well employing many people and exporting all their produce &mdash; exactly what we wanted.  But remember we gave them freedom from income tax for 15 years.  Then, go back to the good, honest Irish firm that has been employing people decently for decades and in some cases for the best part of a century.  They now have to face an impost in corporation profits tax to the tune of £6 million when they most need a capital injection.  They have to meet this dual blow of, first, the credit squeeze that is coming as sure as the crow flies, and then the removal from them of £6 million in a full year of profits utterly necessary for reinvestment at this stage.</P>
    <P>I do not think dividends in this country have been spectacular.  Most industries have had to think of freer trade conditions.  Whether you are for or against this you must go with the tide and there was retention of profits and reinvestment afterwards.  Earlier Deputy Corish rightly commented on the injustice of imposing a wage freeze on employees and at the same time only restricting dividends when everybody knows you can keep the dividends and distribute them at the end of the freeze period.  In fact, that has not been the pattern in relation to profits in Irish industry in the last decade or certainly in the last six or seven years.  The pattern has been to get more and more money by borrowing or to get as much as possible by profits and reinvest it in case they would be put to the wall by freer trade conditions.</P>
    <P>Today's mini-Budget stands condemned if only for the reason that on those two fronts it takes away the livelihood of workers and the opportunity of employers to keep their heads above water in the difficult times ahead, times of intense competition. <Col N="115" /> We have seen action taken in the last 24 hours by the British Government indicating there will be no sentiment or sympathy for small nations and that we must be as good as, or better than our foreign competitors if we are to continue to preserve jobs which are so necessary.</P>
    <P>When one adds turnover tax to the selective wholesale tax we have in this country now a purchase tax &mdash; as one may call it &mdash; of 25 per cent over a wide range and variety of articles. Quite properly Deputy Tully referred to the small car and motor scooter which people use to get to work.  After he had spoken I referred to certain circumstances in which a person had to keep a car for business purposes, farming purposes or some other reason. The truth is that most cars in this country are not kept for Sunday driving and are not a luxury.  We are a hotch-potch society.  We have not a huge number of industrial employees or of millionaires or of any one class but we have a variety of people, some self-employed, some farmers, shopkeepers, industrial employees, employees in services and shops, civil servants and local authority workers and so on.  In our kind of country and with our kind of population it is not possible, as it would be in the city of London, for so many to go in a tube train to work 15 or 20 miles away in as many minutes.  That is not &ldquo;on&rdquo; in this country and Fianna Fáil have not helped the position with their spectacular closures of the link railway lines around this city.  That is beside the point but it is a fact that up to, perhaps, 90 per cent of the cars in this country are not pleasure cars but are a necessary adjunct to the preservation of jobs.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Tully occasionally comes up the Ashbourne Road.  I always do so.  There is a large number of employees in the Finglas area, in Unidare and other firms, for whom no decent bus service is provided.  If I go out in the evening at the end of work time I find myself in a trail of cars not one of which is worth £300, or certainly £400, and these are the <Col N="116" /> cars to which Deputy Tully was referring, cars belonging to workers who must have them to get from the Naul or the Ward, or other parts, right into Deputy Tully's constituency and in some cases down to places beside my own constituency, to their jobs in the morning or perhaps at night.  No matter what anybody says, to put a 25 per cent tax on a small motor car is a disgrace.  You can talk about diamond necklaces, fur coats, yachts and so on if you wish but when you talk about ordinary priced small motor cars it is quite unfair to suggest that they are luxury articles.  I never thought I would see the day when the unfortunate fellow, with a wife and children, who has perhaps to go in my constituency down to the GEC factory in Dunleer, where there is no housing for him and where he cannot live, and who has to buy a small new car, would have to pay 25 per cent to the Government and would then get no allowance for the cost of going to work even though the director would and would pay 5s 3d in the £ above the meagre allowance in his PAYE. This is what they have given to us.</P>
    <P>Again, of course, it is a sign of the complete ineptitude of the present administration and of the fact that this was a hastily trumped up piece of legislation that when questioned on the matter of mobile homes the Minister for Finance replied that mobile homes with no wheels would be subject as caravans were to this additional and punitive selective wholesale tax.  I want to assure him that that will hit the courts if he ever tries to apply it.  I am glad that one of the legal luminaries of the Fianna Fáil Party, my good friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Michael Kennedy, is present, because he knows perfectly well that if you put a tax on caravans you then start to differentiate between caravans and various types of system built houses, or prefabricated houses or mobile homes constructed away from the site and then brought to it and you will have the greatest difficulty trying to put a tax on a mobile home.  Perhaps &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; is the wrong word as far as the law is concerned.  What is generally meant by a mobile home is a rather temporary <Col N="117" /> type dwelling provided for an old person or a single person until the local authority can build a proper house for that person.  I want to assure the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister that these are homes, these are houses and if there is an attempt, on the basis of caravans, to put a tax on something just because it was partially or wholly constructed away from the site the Government will have plenty of trouble indeed and they will end up where a lot of them were last week, in the Four Courts.  However, that rather sad episode on the Government side must be out of order and I must not continue on that line.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to refresh the minds of the people.  At the time of the Cork and Kildare by-elections some time ago the Army got a rise in pay and 12 per cent, which was indicated as a proper wage increase, was given to every Government employee and the two by-elections were won by Fianna Fáil.  I want to go from there to the 1965 election and the 1965 credit squeeze and refresh people's memories in regard to which came first, the chicken or the egg.  Having done that I want to go back to the March 18th speech of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, when he said there was a crisis, his succeeding speeches before the election of June, 18th, when there was no crisis, his Budget of April 23rd sandwitched in between, and a £21 million deficit tonight.  All these figures put logically to the people mean that this Government are discredited, dishonoured and disreputable and they should go to the country.  I refer to some of the advice tendered to the Taoiseach by some members of his party.  The course of honour was open to him.  In the present dishonour and discredit in which the Government stand for the reasons I have outlined if they do not go to the country they will be rather like the fox that would not run, they will be dug out and torn to pieces by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was commenting on the April Budget I said that it appeared to be a lazy man's Budget presented by somebody who had his mind on other things.  How right I <Col N="118" /> was.  We were assured by the Taoiseach, acting for the Minister for Finance, that the Budget was a balanced one and there would be no need to introduce a supplementary budget at a later stage.  This was repeated again and again by Deputy Colley when he took over as Minister for Finance.  The extraordinary thing about it is that there are so many contradictions in this effort put before the House today.  I agree with a lot of what Deputy Donegan said but I disagree with some of the conclusions at which he arrived.  One of the comments made today by the Minister was that the troubles in the north and our rapidly increasing prices must have deflected many tourists from our shores this year.  I suggest that he could have said &ldquo;the troubles in the north and the south&rdquo; because I am associated with a tourist organisation and I am aware that the troubles in the south at a particular stage had a far more adverse effect on this part of the country than the troubles in the north.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that while provision was made for the increase which it was expected would be paid to public servants and officers this year, because of what had happened only a small rise in revenue was expected.  Do we forget what happened last year?  There were fairly substantial wage increase granted but none of them was so great as those granted generally this year.  For the last four or five weeks before the Budget we were working overtime here passing supplementary estimates and although the Budget of the previous year was supposed to have been struck in such a way that it would balance we finished up the year passing supplementary estimates amounting to £35,800,000 and there was still a surplus of £250,000 on the revenue for the year.</P>

    <P>I suggest that, because of the substantial increase in wages granted before the credit boom collapsed &mdash; call it what you will: buoyancy of revenue, or anything else &mdash; the amount of extra revenue which will be collected out of the wage packets of the ordinary workers will be very, very substantial and I suggest that this effort today is <Col N="119" /> not so much an effort to gather in increased revenue, as was suggested, but rather to damp down the economy, the economy which is, as someone said earlier, already seriously damped down because of the failure of the Government, particularly over the last six months, to do their job.</P>
    <P>One thing which makes very sad reading in the Minister's speech is his statement that extra money is required because of increased payments for social welfare.  He went on to add that those increased payments are due to the increase in the number of unemployed. For the last six months we have had a figure of round about 10,000 more unemployed than we had in the same period last year.  Not alone have these unfortunate people to be paid unemployment benefit but they have to get unemployment assistance because many of them have run out of their unemployment benefit entitlement. We are, in fact, losing the revenue which should be coming from them for insurance stamps &mdash; not a mean figure &mdash; and from income tax.  The Government moan and say that because of the increased number of unemployed extra money is required to pay them.  Surely this is one clear example of the failure of the Government to do their job.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, said in this House that the test as to whether or not a Government were doing their job was the number of people at work and the number of people on the unemployment register.  On that basis this Government have most certainly failed, and failed miserably, to do their job.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out at the time of the last Budget there was absolutely no effort made to try to provide the additional employment necessary even at that time in order to bring the figures on the register down to reasonable proportions. It was obvious to those of us associated with the working people that a serious position was going to arise.  This was exacerbated by the effects of the ill-conceived British Free Trade Area Agreement on this country: as the weeks go by the number of unemployed rise.  I shudder to think what the position will be if we <Col N="120" /> are ever unfortunate enough to be forced into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the extra cost for Defence and the extra cost for Cyprus.  He referred to the shortfall in the payment from the United Nations.  Would the Minister let us know exactly what he means by that? If I got the picture correctly the Cyprus effort was supposed to cost us nothing except the cost of our soldiers. Our soldiers were being paid.  We have not taken on additional troops.  We have a standing Army and that Army is being used in the Cyprus operation. Where then does this extra cost come in?  I understood the UN were paying their share.  The former Minister for External Affairs was very shaky here on one occasion when he was questioned about whether or not the UN were paying their share; he eventually admitted that, while they were supposed to be paying, they owed us a considerable amount of money.  Could the Minister say whether this money is money owed, money which is recoverable, or is it something which will be written off as a bad debt because the UN are not prepared to honour their commitments?  Let us get the position clear.  Let us also find out whether or not we can continue to afford the luxury of keeping our troops in Cyprus.  At certain periods during the past year, maybe even now, some of us felt there was far greater need for our troops here at home than there was in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>One of the things which amuses me, though it is indeed tragic, is the effort the Government put into their case that factors other than the Government had increased prices and costs here.  We all know that the biggest single factor which caused increases in prices this year was the ill-fated increase in the turnover tax.  We all know that greedy people increased the turnover tax by five per cent, having originally charged 2½ per cent over a period of six years, because they thought people had forgotten there was such a tax.  Is it not true that the turnover tax more than anything else pushed up the cost of living?  Is it not true that the only thing the workers could do was to look <Col N="121" /> for compensation to repay them for the amount they were losing?</P>
    <P>The comments made by the Minister today were rather amusing.  He talked about his own experience with regard to workers and he rather decried my suggestion that he knew very little about what the ordinary working people have to put up with.  I come from a working-class family.  I know what I am talking about.  I know there are people who, if they do not get enough wages to pay for what they need, cannot go to a bank and get an overdraft or borrow from rich friends. They go without.  It is rather a pity that the Minister really cannot understand the position.  If a worker gets an increase in wages and that increase barely enables him to live and then finds that, because of additional taxation, some of that increase is taken back from him, he is right back where he started.  He and his family are living on a substandard diet, with bad clothes and very little entertainment. They cannot afford it.  This is the position with a very substantial number of working-class families.  I wish people would understand that.  Some people were rather inclined to find this funny, but I wish they could understand that there are people who do not get 52 weeks wages in every year.  Some may get constant work but, if they fall ill, they have to wait for weeks for social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>I consider this utterly unfair. Because of a shortage of staff these unfortunate people do not get their cheques in time and many of them go hungry.  Can this be appreciated by those whose job it is to regulate the economy?  Do they appreciate the position of a man who finds £5 or £6 deducted from his wage packet at the end of the year because PAYE was not operated properly?  Out of his £14 he is asked to pay £5 or £6 income tax and he goes home to his wife and family with less than what will buy food for the week.  This is happening. We are told by the Minister that these people should be able to pay tax and there should be no objection so far as turnover tax or any other tax is concerned. The State needs the money and that is that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> The Minister has increased the wholesale tax on what he describes as luxury goods.  He includes in that category scooters, motorcycles and television and radio sets.  He did not refer at all to something the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Brian Lenihan, talked about some years ago. Not a word about the fur coats.  Not a word about jewellery.  As Deputy Donegan said, many workers buy cars as cheaply as they can; on everything they buy for those cars they pay both wholesale and turnover tax.  They get no remission in tax no matter how far they have to travel.  They are expected to carry on and keep smiling.</P>
    <P>These people could very easily stay at home and draw unemployment benefit for a period but they prefer to work and the State continues to punish them.  A scooter used by a working man is regarded as a luxury; a motorcycle is regarded as a luxury.  Admittedly, many young people buy small radio sets frequently as a status symbol but there are many old people unable to afford a television set and they are very glad to buy a cheap radio set. These people will now have to pay an additional 5 per cent for this luxury.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us fair warning that further steps will be taken if necessary.  The sword of Damocles is over our heads and everybody will have to pay more.  I am not sure whether the increase in the wholesale tax is a prelude to the added value tax the Minister's predecessor earlier stated he would introduce in next year's budget.  The figure of 20 per cent will be in line with what the unfortunate people will be expected to pay when the added value tax is introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a gentle reminder that we may expect an early Budget next year.  The main heads of the Budget are prepared and he is considering next year's expenditure well in advance of the usual time.  To me this means that we shall have an early Budget and, therefore, the amount of extra money which must be provided now is not expected to carry over to the normal Budget time.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the matter of wages and the package deal.  It is true that the Government altered the original deal and allowed what the <Col N="123" /> Minister was careful to mention here as the second portion of the 12th round wage agreements.  The Minister is not so naïve as to imagine this would pass unnoticed.  Male employees were awarded an increase of 50/- plus a second round increase of 34/- but the Minister must be aware that when the negotiations were proceeding his predecessor insisted that there would be the same percentage increase granted to women.  There was a third phase inserted for women but what the Minister is saying today is that the men will get the full 12th round but the women will lose 17/- per week which will be due to them on 1st November, 1971.  I consider they should have got the increase the men received.  The Minister was a signatory to that agreement but he now says that only the second phase will be honoured.  In effect, he is saying that the women will lose the 17/-per week The fact that the Minister at first refused to honour the agreement that had been made freely and to which he was a signatory&mdash;even though he reversed some of his decisions&mdash;means that he is dishonouring the position of Minister for Finance.  The sum of 17/-may not appear of much consequence to him but to a working-class woman who is depending on her wages this is a substantial amount and I should like to make it clear to the Minister that he has not heard the end of this matter.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that the arrangement which was made and broken by the Minister for Finance has meant the death-knell to phased agreements.  When phased agreements were introduced our most difficult job in the trade union movement was to persuade workers that something like this would not happen.  The workers often said: &ldquo;A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&rdquo; and they believed that if they agreed to the policy of phased agreements the Government would certainly do something to interfere with the agreements.  This is not the first time the Government have done this and the workers were fully aware of that fact.  I believe that the policy of phased agreements will not be accepted because people whose phased agreements terminated before the standstill will have to be content <Col N="124" /> with what they have got until the end of 1971.</P>
    <P>The whole argument in favour of this package deal was made apparently on the assumption, as Deputy Corish pointed out, that certain things would happen which did not happen.  The Employer/Labour Conference broke down.  It could have been recalled. Let me enumerate the suggestions made by the trade unions because it is only fair that they should be on the records of this House.  The trade union movement suggested that the 12th round settlements should be moderated; they suggested a bridging operation involving 18-month agreements for increases of £2 10s, and £1 10s in some cases, and nine-month agreements for increases of £2 10s in some other cases, with a cost-of-living review in both cases.  They considered this bridge would lead the way towards general acceptance of real wage increases of 5 or 6 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The galling point in this matter is that the 6 per cent now announced by the Minister for Finance with effect from 16th October is a lesser sum than that offered by his representatives who were discussing this matter and a lesser amount than that offered by the employers in the Employer/Labour Conference. This demonstrates that the Minister does not know what he is talking about.  In addition, the idea of a percentage increase has for some time been regarded with disfavour by the trade union movement because 6 per cent to a person with £40 per week is twice as much as 6 per cent to a person earning £20 per week.  This is basic economics and one does not need a degree to understand it.  Yet, this is the suggestion now being made&mdash;that 6 per cent across the board is the amount that should be paid.  The Minister has made a serious mistake; having backed out of some of his proposals, he would be well advised to reconsider the entire matter.  There was a suggestion that electricians were seeking an increase of £19 per week.  That is not true but it was one of the scare stories used by the people who wanted to create the situation where this so-called agreement could be introduced.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister for <Col N="125" /> Finance we are in dire need of money. I do not agree that that is the situation. I think he has introduced this Supplementary Budget for a different reason.</P>
    <P>A very substantial sum of money was voted by this House for the relief of distress in Northern Ireland.  Before it is pointed out that this has nothing to do with the Budget let me relate it to it.  At that time I asked the Taoiseach if, in fact, some or all of that money had come out of State funds. The Taoiseach's reply to me was:</P>
    <P>Some reports mentioned that the consignment was of the order of £80,000.  I made inquiries as to what the quantity of arms in question would be likely to cost and I was told that it would cost probably less than half that amount&mdash;about £30,000.  I made specific inquiries, too, as to the source of the money and if it had been paid.  I was absolutely assured that the money did not come from any State funds.</P>
    <P>We have now sworn evidence, and the whole country knows, that a substantial proportion of the money did come from State funds.  There was mention of £100,000 less 11s.  Would the Taoiseach talk to the Minister for Finance and suggest to him that he could get that money back?  There are possibly people who would be able to give it to him without making the bank manager uneasy and that money would fill some of the hole.  These people are in a better position to pay than are the working-class people of this country who are being asked to do it.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief. I cannot say that I welcome a Budget at this time of the year nor do I welcome the restraints and policies which are found necessary.  The fact of the matter is that we are living in inflation at the moment.  This is not entirely peculiar to Ireland.  It is fairly widespread in Europe and in the free western world at the moment.  Inflation has been galloping along faster here than in other countries.  It surprises me to hear Deputy Tully say there is not inflation here and that we are running into some form of depression.  There is a big problem and it can be seen in the demands made at the moment and <Col N="126" /> envisaged in the 13th round.  There is wholesale inflation.  There is a projected deficit of something in the region of £21 million in the public services and this is indicative of very heavy spending. This is largely made up of wages. Public service remuneration projected for the current fiscal year is £8.2 million.  I can only assume that there is an increase in wages and pay.</P>
      <P>With reference to CIE despite the heavy increase in fares which took place, there is an additional subsidy of £3.6 million to the company.  CIE employ a large labour force.  All indications are that the wages bill has been rising at a rate not in keeping with the production achieved.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully sees no problem.  He does not think the cement strike had any effect.  Deputy Donegan sees many problems and has no answers for them.  He closes his eyes to them entirely and says they do not exist. Neither Deputy Donegan nor I like them.  We are sympathetic to each other in that respect.  We do not like the increase in company tax.  It is not a modest increase.  It is at the level of 16 per cent.  One can get an idea of the heavy impost this will be.  There is a 16 per cent increase and a total tax of 58 per cent in respect of the profit of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt what the effect will be on the dividend policy.  If this is something which must be done and a <Col N="127" /> sacrifice which has to be made at this time it is only fair that we make these sacrifices.  We are asked to make these sacrifices until 31st December, 1971. This is not just a policy of taxation. This is much harsher than what was employed in the matter of control of wages and in trying to get them down to a reasonable level.  Comments are made in the newspapers and in this House on what is happening in regard to wages.  There is no doubt that the demand made by the building workers was a flat £7.  The current rate for a 40-hour week is 9s per hour and that produces £18.  An increase of £7 on that £18 is quite hefty.  It could be close to 35 per cent.</P>

      <P>Up to quite recently the number of cars in the country was few.  Now there are many cars and I want to see many more.  Driving from the west nowadays one can see on many evenings of the week tremendous numbers of cars pulled up at modern saloons and hotels.

      <P>Would the Deputy say this is preparation for one?  I, like many other people in business, do not like these restrictive policies.  The squeeze now being put on profits is something we would much prefer to do without.  Manufacturing industry is under grave pressure in face of the prospect of freer trade, freer competition. To face this we must become more efficient which in turn means better methods and better training. This costs a lot of money but we hope this drought will not last too long because I could foresee this having a serious effect in the long term.  The rate of taxation on companies is one of the highest in Europe.  This will not help the industrial side of our economy to any great extent.</P>
      <P>There was comment on the additional expenditure of £3.6 million by the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister indicated that it was caused because there were more people drawing unemployment benefit which, again, is an indication that there is a severe tendency for unemployment to rise.  It is obvious to me that this increase in taxation on company profits will not do much to encourage investment here.  While the emphasis is on exports and while every effort is being made to export, we must have regard to the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> I can assure the House that the control of prices at manufacturing level is no myth.  There is real control and I would only hope that further controls at retail level would be as effective as they are at the manufacturing level. These, then, are the realities.  I, as an individual, accept them and we, as a party, accept them because at the moment we are on a crazy path to inflation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One effect of these measures is that many Taca men will be caught in the net, particularly in the surtax net.  In these measures the wholesale tax on certain commodities is being increased to 25 per cent.  Cars are included among these commodities but as many Deputies have said already, a car is not a luxury in many cases.  Many workers employed in the building industry come from places as far away as Drogheda and further north as well as from Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow each day to work in Dublin.  Usually two to four people travel together.  These people will be hit hard both by the increase in road tax and by the increase in the cost of cars.  The Minister has said that there is no purchase tax on second-hand cars but, of course, the cost of such cars will be increased indirectly.  If a new car costs another £50, a second-hand car will go up in value by £30 or £40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to surtax I presume that the allowance against income tax on the first £2,500 will remain at 7½ per cent.  If this tax were increased it would hit small businesses.  Above the figure of £2,500 there will be an increase from 50 per cent to 58 per cent or, approximately, 1s 6d in the £.  What I do see wrong with this is that Irish companies are now being taxed while those drawing a dividend from English companies are not taxed at all because we have no say in English companies.  This can encourage people to take money from <Col N="132" /> Irish companies and invest it in English companies.  I am not sure of the figure for English companies but it is about 42 per cent&mdash;that would be the total amount&mdash;whereas here it is now 58 per cent.  This is doing no more than making more money available to the Government.  It is merely another way of collecting tax.  It is not providing any incentive for people to save and it will not prevent people from overspending.</P>
    <P>A person who draws a dividend now can still live well.  Why not impose surtax on the actual money he draws out of a company this year even without freezing dividends?  If he leaves his money in the company he will be able to get shares at the end of this freeze.  Also there are many people working, for instance, in Guinness who invest their money there and who might be earning £400 or £500 per year from their investment.  These provisions will mean that many people will pay corporation tax to the extent of 1s 6d in the £ extra on each £1 they earn.  A man living on a small amount of money&mdash;I think the limit is £500 per annum&mdash;is not entitled to social welfare benefits.  Such a man cannot get an increased dividend. Those wage earners who have received the 12th round increase can receive an increase of 6 per cent while a person in the category I have been speaking about can get no increase whatsoever. Would it not be better to pay out the money now and then impose a blanket for a number of years if necessary?</P>
    <P>There are many architects, solicitors and other professional people who will pay nothing extra under these measures. I have no wish to speak about people in any particular profession but I might say that some of them are getting a lot more than many businessmen, those who export and otherwise. This is particularly true when these professional men are Taca tainted.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to understand Fianna Fáil policy for many years.  It seems to me that they devise their policy as they go along.  When I came to Dáil Éireann in 1963, shortly after the introduction of turnover tax, I saw many Fianna Fáil Minister and <Col N="133" /> Deputies running up and down the corridors of Leinster House offering building jobs and various other jobs so that they might win a vote.  They won that time by one vote, but after that the cost of living escalated and the Government, of course, had to find more money to pay public servants and so on.  What they did was to have a credit squeeze.  This was the first cause of inflation.  Three years ago they foresaw inflation as they foresaw it 18 months ago when the then Minister for Finance warned the nation about the dangers of inflation but made no mention of any such danger in the Budget introduced shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were warned by Fine Gael, by Labour, by economists, by businessmen, by trade unions and many others that turnover tax would ruin the country but they said they knew better.  I hope it was not the civil servants who advised them. Deputy Tully described the last Budget very aptly when he called it a lazy man's Budget.  Deputy Haughey was too busy sharpening knives for the Taoiseach to bother about the Budget, so he took the easy way out and doubled the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>An incomes policy will work only if the Government's policy is co-ordinated with it.  Generally there are two methods used to balance the Budget. One is to increase indirect taxation which reduces personal spending&mdash;it is indirect taxation that we have here&mdash; while another method is to declare a credit squeeze which stops investment. That is the package deal that the Minister for Finance has given us.  Undoubtedly, increased taxation increases the cost of living.  A credit squeeze creates unemployment and an increase in unemployment reduces the demand for goods and services.  If there is less demand for any product, that puts up the unit cost of that product, which again starts the race to inflation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that under any circumstances this is a 12 months job. The Minister will keep it in operation for as long as he can, or until the trade unions or others make him change it.  When it ends, what will <Col N="134" /> happen?  Will we have increases of 20 per cent or 30 per cent in the following year?  What good is that?  There must be some other solution.  The Minister is allowing no increased rate for increased productivity.  I believe that where increased productivity can be shown there should be an increase in wages.  Lately I heard&mdash;and I think this is wrong&mdash;that there will be a &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; campaign by various unions if they cannot get an increase.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion about the building industry and the Minister was questioned about it.  The Government should have their priorities right.  To me the priorities in building are housing, schools and hospitals, and office blocks should only be built, and this money injected into the economy, at the stage where there is no demand for houses or hospitals or schools.  I shall deal with that later.</P>
    <P>For years the unions were blamed, employers were blamed, prices were blamed, everything was blamed for inflation. I never heard the Minister say that the Government were to blame or even 1 per cent or one-tenth of 1 per cent to blame.  For some years past we have had inflation in this country caused by Fianna Fáil.  I will give examples of that later on.  During the past number of years we have had nobody governing this country.  If we pick up the paper tomorrow morning we will see ten Ministers opening this and opening that.  Sometimes they open schools.  I do not see the point in that. Surely the key can be turned and the children let in without opening the schools officially and having a wine or a beer party afterwards.  Ministers are opening this and that when they should be sitting in their offices doing their jobs instead of going around the country looking for publicity for themselves and for the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are looking for votes in the next election and not running their Departments.</P>
    <P>During a by-election campaign a Minister took six weeks off before the election.  That is the way the country is being run.  About 18 months ago Deputy Haughey, then Minister for Finance, told us on television that we were really in trouble and that there was a credit squeeze.  They then decided <Col N="135" /> to hold an election and things were all right two months later.  If they had allowed that Dáil to run its full course, without holding the election at that time, we would have realised the state the economy was in and we would have been ducking all over the place with guns being fired because they were all involved at that time with both things running at the same time.  They held the election a year earlier and they are now in power but they will not stay in power for very long.  If they had held the election a year later we would have known about the arms trial and the bank strike.</P>
    <P>Taxation which affects the workers must certainly put them in a position in which they will make demands.  I cannot see these measures lasting unless the Government set about doing their job properly.  We must make sure that all the ESB charges are controlled and that indirect taxation is controlled. If there is any increase in taxation, rates must be controlled and I am not speaking only of the rates on a sizeable house.  Rates are paid on corporation houses.  Everyone pays rates.</P>
    <P>When you buy a pound of butter or a pound of sugar you are paying for the rates on the supermarket or shop. If you buy a drink you are paying for the rates on the shop.  It is included in the price.  The same applies to the purchase of drapery goods.  Wherever you buy anything you are paying for the rates which are built into the price. Rates must be controlled if taxation goes up.  Shortly before the Minister introduced this provision he said that after this debate no prices would go up.  It is amazing to note the number of firms who jumped in the day before: the FUE, the employers' organisations and others.  I would not blame them for that.  They were 100 per cent right.  Who led them?  CIE led them. The day before, they got their increase.</P>
    <P>The post office got their increase some three weeks earlier.  Over the past 12, 13 or 14 months the post office increased their rate by 50 per cent and then they increased that rate by 50 per cent.  To give an example, a very short time ago a telephone call cost 4d.  It now costs 6d. and it is going <Col N="136" /> up to 9d.  Most business people were told that the wage increase was to be 7 per cent and, depending on the amount of labour employed, it was to be less than that, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 per cent.  The cost of a telephone call&mdash; and this is not taxation in the Budget &mdash;went from 4d. to 6d. and is going up to 9d.  That is an increase of 125 per cent against the 4 or 5 per cent on average allowed to business people and the 16 to 25 per cent wage increases.</P>
    <P>I cannot give the exact figures in relation to bus fares, but the increase is in the region of 40 per cent.  The figures vary at different stages.  The 1s. fare is now 1s. 5d, an increase of approximately 40 per cent.  It can be averaged down to a little less.  In my own constituency, because there are not sufficient schools in Bonnybrook and Kilmore, a child has to go to St. Patrick's, Drumcondra, to school and the mother must go with him four times a day.  It costs her 10d per trip and 5d for the boy.  She has to pay 5s a day because there are not enough schools in that area.</P>
    <P>The Government get the money to spend and I do not know where it goes. It must be like the £100,000 which disappeared a short while ago.  Fianna Fáil make up their minds as they go along along.  I do not believe they have any plan.  An ordinary business man or a trade union plans for two, three, four or five years ahead but Fianna Fáil make up their minds as they go along and, if they get stuck, they add on something extra.  This is proved by the introduction of two Budgets each year.</P>
    <P>The worst thing I have seen done for a number of years was the introduction of retrospective taxation for death duties.  In business or in politics the one thing a man has is his word of honour and he should keep it.  There is not much of that around nowadays judging by some of the things that have happened.  We saw the 12th round agreed on.  We saw the Minister cutting across the agreement and refusing to pay the second part of it.  He asked local government employees and civil servants to be responsible and to take a 7 per cent increase and he would give them 10 per cent later.  Shortly afterwards he told them they would <Col N="137" /> not get the second part of that increase. Now he has changed his mind because there is pressure on him, because there could be a split and Fianna Fáil might have to go to the country, not because of this but for other reasons, and he decides to pay the second part of the agreed increase.  Is the Minister implementing the twelfth round <i>in toto</i> or is it just a cash involvement?  I do not know the Civil Service grades but a person in, say, the second or third grade, was to get a certain increase plus the 17 per cent.  Does this person get the increase for his grade or does he not?</P>
    <P>In 1958-59 a house of about 1,100 square feet cost about £1,900.  That house would cost £5,500 today.  Land at that time was £575 to £600 an acre. It is £10,000 today.  This is how prices have increased.  Since 1957 there have been depressions and crises and Fianna Fáil always came up with the most fantastic excuses&mdash;the Suez crisis, the Chinese war, Vietnam or the Korean war.  They have no excuse this time. They have made a mess of the economy and they must take the blame.  Do not start blaming trade unions, employers or workers for it.  Blame yourselves and your own mishandling of affairs.  For as long as I remember, Fianna Fáil have not planned for anything but a stop-go economy.</P>
    <P>The phased agreement was one of the finest things introduced into free negotiation between union and employer. The unions kept their side of the agreement.  As Deputy Tully said, very often the officials had trouble with the members who wanted the whole increase at once but the officials convinced them that to take a phased increase would be better for them in the long run.  How many unions will accept this now?  Would anybody here, as a member of a trade union, tomorrow morning accept a £4 increase at the rate of £2 now and £2 in 18 months time?  Would Deputy Colley, the Minister for Finance?  Not likely.</P>
    <P>We have seen the introduction of a group of people known as Taca in this country, a group brought together to supply funds to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Members either give an election subscription or an annual subscription and they get in return patronage from <Col N="138" /> a Minister or a Fianna Fáil dominated county council.  One has only to look at the list of names at the front of any Government building&mdash;the architect, the engineer, everybody concerned &mdash;and one sees that 90 per cent of them are Taca people and of the other 10 per cent some of them have been there for years.  The builders are Taca people.  Again the odd one has been there for years.  Go to Collinstown and see who does all the building out there or look at the machines used for road widening around the country and look at the names on them.  Shortly before the Wicklow and Cork by-elections on my way from Cork I saw machinery with a certain name on it.  I decided to check on who he was.  I was out in Greystones and he turned up with a Fianna Fáil sticker on his car.  It is known in the building community in this city, of which I am a member, that if one has a problem, if one wants to get land passed and there is a slight doubt about it, there is only one way to do it and that is to get a Fianna Fáil architect.  If that is not done it will not be passed.  Go to Local Government tomorrow morning and you will see the Fianna Fáil architects walking in.  I never pass by without seeing them walking in.  I know them.  I was at school with some of them.  How can the people of Ireland and business people be expected to be honest when they see this in Fianna Fáil?  The people have become a little more enlightened lately on account of what has happened in the courts.  These things have been kept under the carpet for a long time.  For years we cried &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo; here and even the newspapers said we were only shouting about it.  Now the people understand it.</P>
    <P>I cannot see this pay pause lasting but if it does last will the Fianna Fáil Government get down to work and try to get agreement about proper negotiation and fix up trade union matters instead of shouting and doing no work?  We should try to get all demands into a two month period. If May and June is the period all payments should be retrospective to the 1st May.  We should do away with leap-frogging because leap-frogging does no worker any good and it does a lot of harm to the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> I want to ask the Minister what will happen to the person who has not got any moiety of his twelfth round?  Will he get a twelfth round?  Will the female worker in the Civil Service or semi-State body, where it has been agreed that on a phased basis female workers will move on to the male scale of pay, get her increase?  Will this be allowed in the twelfth round, or is it just money with no side benefits?  I presume that, if there is a clause in the agreement referring to an increase in the cost of living, that also goes.  When Mr. Wilson brought in his controls in England he spelt them out.  It was not a panic situation like that here. I presume that, if there is an incremental scale plus the 12 per cent, the man gets it.  If there is an apprentice carpenter who is senior he must get senior rates and whatever goes with it?</P>
    <P>I want to say something about office blocks.  One or two were built on a trial basis and all the space was taken. As a result three or four more blocks were built.  Then a couple of companies were formed, and I guarantee none of the people in Fine Gael or Labour were directors of them.  As soon as the office space was available the banks, the insurance companies and the Civil Service took it and they paid a price of 25s to 30s per square foot for it.  Private enterprise would have paid nothing like that for it.  The Civil Service, the banks and the insurance companies should have left those office blocks alone and let demand and supply work out the cost.</P>
    <P>What happened?  We had the ex-Minister for Finance saying he intended to get a big office block built.  The Bank of Ireland and insurance companies wanted them also.  They got them but they paid for them.  They are now paying from 30s to £2 per square foot for space in those office blocks. During the next 18 months the cost will increase to £3 a square foot. If they left those office blocks to private enterprise at the beginning the cost would have been 18s a square foot and it would then have gone up gradually to 25s and 30s a square foot.</P>
    <P>Who is causing inflation?  It is the Government who are causing it.  They <Col N="140" /> inflate everything they touch because they do not know the value of anything. A businessman would laugh at the way they act.  No businessman would employ anybody on the front bench over there because they are not capable of running anything.  The Minister for Finance says that he will control house prices.  How will he do this?  If he controls the land he cannot build.  How will he control houses?  If he puts a price on them they will cut down on the cost and instead of using a four-inch skirting board they will use the next size.</P>
    <P>We should make a law tomorrow morning that, if there is a new house for sale, it should be compulsory for the builder to state the floor area and then the tenant would not be completely in the dark.  I do not mind a man buying a bad suit because he will buy many in his lifetime, but very often a man will purchase only one house in his lifetime.  Anybody who breaks his word on an agreement is not worth his salt.</P>
    <P>The local government employees had an eleventh round where they were allowed a percentage increase on a floor rate but before they negotiated the twelfth round they were told there would be no bar.  They could look for grade increase and if they did not get them they could get their 17 per cent.  They agreed to accept the 7 per cent first, unlike other workers who looked for the higher percentage first.  When the first part of this increase went through, the Minister for Finance said the second part was not being given.  He then changed his mind.  Will those grade increases which have been agreed on be honoured? Will the grades who had their claims in before April 1st get their settlement in full?  As far as I know, the Minister said that those whose claims were in on 2nd April would be settled by having the first half given from the 1st October and the second half on 1st April, 1971.  I should like the Minister to clarify those matters.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the Civil Service where a particular grade must go for their increase before another can go for it.  If one man gets his increase, although he may be junior to the man above him, he gets more <Col N="141" /> than the man above him unless the Minister lets this go through.  The Minister's Department must be very short of money because the draughtsmen in Dublin Corporation are being paid back twelve months to last October. The Mayo County Council and a few other county councils have not been paid.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might be. In the case of the banks there was an agreement between them that, subject to reasonable competence, all ladies on scale 2 who at present have more than twelve years' service will be advanced from the date of resumption of work to the appropriate service point on scale 3.  It is further agreed that when they have completed their twelfth year of service all ladies will be promoted to a more responsible job carrying the scale 3 rate provide they are generally competent to carry out such duties.  Will that be implemented or not?  Will we have them out on strike again?  It might suit the Government to have them out on strike again.  I have many more things to say about this but I will leave it to the vote of no confidence because the one thing a person has in business is his word of honour.

      <P>Our party's position on these proposals has been rather fully stated by the Leader of the Party, Deputy Corish, and by our spokesman on Finance, Deputy Tully. I do not want to add much to what they have said because I do not think anyone here on the Opposition side wishes to protract this debate.  What the country wants to see us get to is the motion of no confidence.  They want to see how long they will be stuck with the most incompetent and disastrous Government in our history as an independent State.</P>
      <P>I just want to concentrate on one point on which I should like the Minister to answer some specific questions. This arises from the Minister's statement in which he lists the items, or some of them, on which the Government's Estimates have been very widely exceeded.  We have got used to these under-estimations and we now take figures like these very much in our stride.  However, there is one of them about which I should like to know much more for obvious reasons.  On page 15 of the Minister's speech he says:</P>

    <P>I do not propose to comment on the first four of those items.  We know something about those increases, but I do want to ask some questions about this excess in Defence expenditure. Further on the Minister says:</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for the excess looming on the Defence Vote.  These include the extension of the Cyprus mandate, the cost of additional security measures, provision <Col N="143" /> for fishery protection vessels, and a short-fall in receipts from the UN.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been following events in this country since May will want to know a little bit more about a £1.6 million excess in the Defence Estimate and about the cost of these additional security measures.  I want to ask here three specific questions: (1)  What proportion of the unexpected rise in Defence costs is due to the cost of additional security measures?  In other words, what has been the cause of these measures and how come that at this date they are so unexpected seeing that the situation which presumably precipitated additional measures arose as long ago as last August?  (2)  What in general terms has been the nature of these measures?  I realise that in part of this area the Minister can plead and may plead that there are security reasons why he may not even inform the Dáil.  I think the Dáil in present circumstances would receive such an answer with some scepticism and so would the country.  Anyway we have the right to know in general terms what the answer to that is.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whatever the answer to the first two of those questions may be, how does the Minister expect us to believe his answers to these questions or to any question relating to this subject? I am not here impugning the personal credibility, probity or honour of the Minister for Finance, but I am querying the credibility of the entity to which he belongs.  The credibility of that entity, which is unfortunately the Government of this country, is not highly regarded by the country generally and the Government will experience that when they are obliged to face the country.  One of the Minister's colleagues in the Government is a convicted liar.</P>

      <P>I was trying to explain, if I may, with your patience, how it does arise.  These financial measures which the Dáil is asked to pass&mdash;and it is not a mere formality&mdash; arise out of a situation described in a speech we have heard from the Minister <Col N="144" /> for Finance.  Among the reasons adduced by the Minister in that speech why these sums have to be granted is the cost of additional security measures. I have queried what these additional security measures are, what they cost and what degree of credibility in relation to Defence and other questions is to be assigned to the reply of any responsible Minister in the present circumstances following the result of the arms trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to agree to increased taxation of the nature of 25 per cent on motor scooters, motor cycles and motor cars.  In many cases these are necessary.  Very few motor vehicles in this country are used solely for pleasure.  Rural Deputies have stressed the importance of a mechanically-propelled vehicle for the purpose of transporting people to their places of employment.  The same applies in the city areas of Finglas and Ballymun, for example, where residents of those areas have to travel to factories on the south side of the city.  It is completely unjust to introduce this measure and to ask us to agree to increased road taxation in a situation where no allowance is made from the point of view of income tax for the taxation paid in respect of such vehicles.  The Minister for Finance has made a big error in introducing a proposal to increase from 15 to 20 per cent the wholesale tax on luxury goods&mdash;specifically in regard to the purchase of caravans.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is completely out of touch with what is happening at the moment.  Many newly-weds and homeless families are housing themselves in caravans or mobile homes.  Sometimes they live in them for many years.  If one drives along the Naas Road and around Clondalkin one sees caravans parked alongside the road.  The Minister proposes to increase the tax on this necessary method of housing for so many of our people, unfortunately, by at least 6 to 7 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately some of our people have had to provide housing for themselves by way of caravans or mobile homes because of the disastrous handling of the housing problem by Fianna Fáil.  Apart altogether from the crows' nests in Ballymun Fianna Fáil has now turned some of our people into a new tinker class in Clondalkin, for example.  Not only that but Fianna Fáil are also trying to drive them off the road.  It is a disgraceful attempt to batten on the inevitable result of the housing problem in this country.  In Ballymun, there are <Col N="148" /> young families living in flats which are 16 and 17 storeys high.

      <P>One of the most remarkable things about this turnover tax was that while it included all types of medicine for human beings it completely excluded any medicine purchased for animals, canaries or cats or dogs.  Writers and artists got special tax exemptions while the general population was hit very heavily by the increased turnover tax.  Also, the onus of collection of this taxation was thrown on the shopkeepers.  This has contributed very largely to the critical situation in which we now find ourselves after so many years of Fianna Fáil mismanagement and misrepresentation, after a year in which Fianna Fáil got into government with approximately 600,000 votes against a combined opposition vote of 700,000, a year when, prior to the crisis announced by the previous Minister for Finance and which suddenly disappeared, the new constituencies were drawn up which, in particular areas, are so comical in their boundary lines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Earlier, we were asked by the Minister to consider the first Resolution here concerning luxury goods.  All agree that jewellery and yachts and such things are luxuries but I feel the Minister has overlooked the very grave problem in housing and has contributed greatly to putting the lower priced home, the mobile home and caravan out of reach of lower paid workers many of whom use these to provide themselves with housing.</P>
      <P>The third Financial Resolution will result in a decrease in the amount of home investment, a decrease in industrial development and in the number of jobs.  This is all contrary to what the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the IDA are attempting to do.  We had the ridiculous situation in the last Budget where the Minister was referring to inflation.  That Budget was defended by the present Minister as the previous Budget was defended by him as being a proper one at that time. Now he is trying to rectify the shortcomings of that Budget.  Under Resolution No. 3 the Minister will contribute to the extinction of certain borderline companies.  It will not affect foreign companies coming in as they will still enjoy 15 or 20 years taxation exemption but it will certainly affect some of the older home industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to have an increase in the number of unemployed which, as the Minister should know, will result in an increase in the number of social welfare and unemployment benefits paid.  We are going to have a decrease in the moneys available to these industries for expansion, a decrease in the amount available for re-investment in their business.  It is a type of taxation which while attempting to hit the moneyed people is, in fact, going to have an adverse affect on the workers. <Col N="152" /> It will result in increased unemployment and it will backfire.</P>
    <P>In many ways it is weakening many industries at a critical time, when we are at a critical stage in negotiations for our entry into the EEC.  It will reduce the capacity of some of these companies to survive when we do enter the EEC.  In fact, it is the opposite type of resolution which should be brought in in order to encourage these companies to strengthen themselves and to increase their capacity for expansion and survival and thereby provide more jobs and thus help to alleviate unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a big mistake here, just as he made a mistake in some of the other Resolutions.  He cannot be expected to see everything; he is looking over his shoulder an awful lot, but certainly he should see some of the more obvious flaws on which he is asking us to vote.  The Government have got to get more money there is no doubt about that.  Government funds have obviously been mishandled. We still do not know the date of payment of the Seven Days Tribunal or who is going to pay for the arms trial but money will have to be found.  Obviously, the money is going to come from the taxpayer's pocket to pay for these two fiascos, these two circuses.  It is a pity to see the Minister at this stage attempting to block the crippling inflation which we have, attempting to put off, perhaps, the inevitable devaluation of the pound.  Already he has relented in regard to the second stage of the 12th round because the credibility of the Government front benches is such that no employer or employee could have any further confidence in any wage increase negotiated.  We opposed this and we opposed it as strongly as we could and as a result of our opposition and of the counsel of others we have succeeded in getting the Minister to reverse that decision to limit the increase in the second stage of the 12th round.</P>
    <P>The Government have obviously lost touch completely with the working class people.  The increase in road tax on motor cycles and scooters indicates to a certain degree the shortsightedness of the Government.  Many of these vehicles are necessary for different <Col N="153" /> sections of the community to get to work.  The milk man has to be in at a time when there are no buses running and very often the shift worker on his way home has no means of transport other than a scooter or motor cycle. None of them has an allowance for their small vehicles.  Many of them, perhaps, would rather travel by public transport but as it is not there they cannot do so.  On many occasions we have appealed for a certain tax exemption to be granted to those who have to travel over two miles, but this has been ignored.  This is a section in regard to which the Minister should give consideration for exemption in regard to road taxation just as he should reconsider the possibility of investigating the financial circumstances of people who buy mobile homes or caravans.  As Deputy Donegan pointed out, to differentiate between a mobile home and a caravan will be practically impossible.  To include mobile homes which have not got wheels will be challenged in the courts.  There is also the question of including radio sets as luxuries.  I do not think they are luxuries any longer.</P>
    <P>One of the most unpleasant things which we witnessed was the way in which CIE and the Post Office got in with their increases before the Minister clamped down.  This possibly would indicate that there was a leak to certain quarters that a freeze was coming and that they should get in with their increase as soon as possible.  The Minister earlier referred to the fact that he was aware that poverty existed but I think he has forgotten how severe poverty can be.  As late as a year ago members on the opposite benches were stomping around the country announcing different policies and solutions for borders and so on but they have rapidly forgotten that those as well were part of their policy.</P>
    <P>One thing which I regret to see is the necessity for an increase in the Defence Estimate caused by our troops keeping the peace overseas, along with the British troops.  If the United Nations owe us money they should give us the money and the bill should not be thrown once more on to the tax-payers. This is not solely a Budget <Col N="154" /> which hits the well-off sections of the community because it hits many of the lower paid people.  Because of that it is going to create hardship and lead to a greater tightening of the belt than is apparent at first glance.  The Minister obviously has not had time to think of the many innocent people who will be caught up by the imposition of these Resolutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which no reference has been made so far in this debate.  That is the major cause of the inflation in this country. Deputy Gallagher seems to think the ordinary workers were responsible for it.  I have no doubt at all as to who the people are who are mainly or wholly responsible for it; they are the people sitting on the front benches over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred today to current expenditure by the State of £490 million.  We are told GNP has gone up and the Minister quoted a capital programme of £190 million, making a total of £680 million to be completed. Let me compare the year 1970 with the year 1960.  What was Government expenditure in that year?  In case the Minister has not learned it since he took up office a short while ago let me enlighten him: it was under £200 million.  Now he and his Government, in the year 1970, are going to spend well over £600 million.  Very much worse than that is a matter to which I have referred time and time again here&mdash;the creation of credit by the commercial banks.  In October of last year the commercial banks created credit to the tune of £25 million for the Government.  We learn from the <i>Quarterly Bulletin</i> of the Central Bank, which we got a few days ago, with regard to Government stocks that £25 million worth of an issue of 8½ per cent Conversion Stock, 1973, was taken up by the associated banks at the end of March.  We are told in the annual report of the Central Bank, which could not say a good word about Government expenditure, that in the current financial year to 31st March next of the £75 million extension the Government are to get £50 million and the rest of us £25 million.  The Government are employing <Col N="155" /> directly and indirectly at the very most 200,000 out of the 1,000,000 who work.  Yet, they are to get £50 million out of the £75 million additional credit to be created by the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not tell me how inflation has been created.  That lying crowd over there, as they are now proved to be, need not tell me how this inflation has come about.  I know how it has come about.  How many ordinary people are spending today 3½ times as much as they were spending in 1960?  But the Government are doing just that.  I asked the Minister a question about the sale of gold by the Central Bank.  He did not enlighten me.  I notice the information is in this document.  I am sure the Minister knew the answer.  They have sold an additional £5 million worth of our small supply of gold between the end of March and the beginning of June at 35 dollars an ounce.  The price of gold is up now to 40 dollars an ounce. Are we trying to jettison everything? Are we selling the country out?  This is how it appears to me.</P>
    <P>There is only one good aspect in this whole thing and, strangely enough, the Minister did not refer to it; I refer to the fact that our exports, in spite of all the talk about wages on the part of the Tánaiste, have increased more than our imports.  That is an important factor because it means that the percentage deficit in our balance of trade is down.  It was 60 per cent last year and it is down to 50 per cent this year. Our exports as a percentage of total exports and imports are about ten per cent more this year than they were last year.</P>
    <P>What is the use of the Minister coming in here with all this nonsense, for that is what it is?  I know why this has happened.  It has happened as a result of all the talk by the Tánaiste; it is in all the publications by the NIEC and the Central Bank and all the rest of them.  But there is no real evidence to support it.  It is an attack on the people with the lowest incomes, the ordinary workers.  That is what it is.  It is a dirty, filthy business.  I do not mind how it is embellished or what swank words are used to describe it.  I could <Col N="156" /> not care less.  I have seen this thing too often and I know too much to swallow something from a man who was over in the Department of Industry and Commerce for a number of years, a Department in which they did not bother any longer about serious problems.</P>

      <P>An additional £16.6 million was used for conversion of 8½ per cent Conversion Stock, 1970, of which £18.2 million fell due for redemption and then the redemption of important other stocks could not be carried out.  That, of course, will be done in the same way.  Foreign issues amounted almost to £18 million in the eight months ended last August. Foreign issues by the Government amounted to £18 million.  Is the Minister old enough to remember the time his party put the sign of the pawnbroker on every hoarding in this city when Deputy McGilligan was issuing an internal loan here?  It happened in the year 1950.  That party opposite put the sign of the pawnbroker on every hoarding in this city.</P>
      <P>And that is not the whole story.  In addition to these loans the Government negotiated in August a credit facility for £12 million with a number of foreign banks.  That, of course, is the same as using the printing press.  What is the printing press?  It is the best known method of inflating.  There is nothing to compare with it.  The ordinary worker has no printing press.  But the Government has unlimited facilities for using the printing press and they were doing it good-oh while the banks were closed.  It had to be done. Otherwise the economy could not have kept ticking over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other day the Taoiseach said that the rest of us had no figures.  How could we have any figures when the Government ceased to issue the Exchequer statements when the banks had been closed for a month?  They could have issued something in substitution, if they felt like it, but that did not suit their book.  Yet the Taoiseach comes out blandly last week and says: &ldquo;We have the figures and you have not&rdquo;.  In fact, the Government have <Col N="157" /> no more real figures in relation to the economy than we have.</P>
    <P>This whole thing is somewhat irrelevant to the whole situation and that is why the Opposition parties when they saw these Financial Resolutions said: &ldquo;Ach, this is stupid&rdquo;.  The Government have destroyed their own creditability and they have destroyed the credit of the country.  They destroyed it in the Autumn of 1965 when they went from America, where they were refused a loan, to the International Monetary Fund, to Germany from Germany to Britain, and, in a loan of £5 million, the only genuine subscriptions amounted to about £250,000 and another £250,000 came from an insurance company which is really operating in this country and the subscription was, therefore, part of their normal subscription to our National Loan. Ten years earlier the Government could have raised £50 million in London at the drop of a hat but, when the Government went for a loan of £5 million, they got genuine subscriptions of only £250,000 and the underwriters sold the loan down three or four points within a couple of weeks. The Minister need not talk to me about what is creating inflation in this country&mdash;the Government are the chief creators.  Inflation is now the fashionable word.  In reply to a question some time ago the Minister told me that inflation exists all around us.  It is worse in this country than in Western Europe at present and I do not think the Minister would deny that fact.</P>

      <P>I intervened in the debate to draw attention to the fact that the Government and their minions, and I include in this the NIEC, the Central Bank, <i>et cetera,</i> all speak with one voice.  The NIEC produced 28 unanimous reports.  Imagine the situation where 28 men could write and sign 28 unanimous reports on so complex a subject as the economy.  These men are busy people and probably did not even bother to read the reports.  Although the reports are circulated to Deputies free of charge I do not believe they are read by Deputies, with the possible exception of Deputy FitzGerald.  The reports are probably read by civil servants who are already part of the system of purveying this rubbish.  The field was left open to them and they have not got anywhere.  I should like the Minister to tell me how many copies of the various reports are purchased by the ordinary members of the public. I do not believe that even Deputies who are supplied with the reports read them.  For instance, I shall not cause Deputy Dowling to blush, although I wager I am more conversant than he is regarding the economy.  He certainly has not shown any evidence of having read the various reports: he is much better speaking about differential rents as he did some time ago.</P>

      <P>Apropos my comparisons with 1960, recently I read a statement by Mr. McGough regarding the major expansion of milk products &mdash;now £33 million as compared with £6,500,000 in 1960.  An interesting point is that the amount of subsidy for milk products in 1960 was approximately £5 million.  Today, in order to achieve an export figure of £33 million we have to spend £35 million in subsidies.  This is the ultimate in nonsense.  I am glad the Government changed the system although this should have been done five or six years ago; I protested about the matter in the 1965 election.  It is useless to pretend that one can continue with that course of action with any success.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to talk about the generality of the provisions in this Bill except to offer this observation. In this country we have come to accept venality and corruption as the norm from Fianna Fáil and this is not surprising.  We are keen on festivals and in the last few months we have had such a festival of lies that people are no longer surprised at anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, who distinguished himself in the last few days by scurrying for cover, told me a few months ago at a by-election that although Fianna Fáil might not be distingushed by their morality or intellectual ability at least one had to admire their political intelligence and their skill as operators.  What strikes me about this Budget is its extraordinary stupidity.  It is belated and inadequate and, after the passage of almost half a year, a rather irrelevant intervention in relation to a situation which apparently went unrecognised by the Government when the Budget was introduced in April.  The failure to <Col N="161" /> understand what was being said with extraordinary unanimity from all directions&mdash;from different political parties and economists and others&mdash;was a mark of stupidity, incompetency and ineptitude.  We will spend time in a few days recalling to some of the financial experts on the far side of the House the marvellously ridiculous things they had to say a few months ago.  I do not propose to do it now. I want on this occasion, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, your guidance on this point. I am using the typescript of the Minister's speech and I want to refer to the last item on page 15:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principal non-capital items exceeding the Budget provisions are as follows:</P>
    <P>and there is a sum of £1.6 million under the heading of &ldquo;Defence&rdquo;.  I need your guidance here because I heard the extraordinary ruling&mdash;and I say extraordinary because I am inexperienced in these things&mdash;of the Ceann Comhairle in regard to my colleague, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, who was endeavouring to discuss this matter and who was ruled out of order.  I propose to proceed gently and patiently and if I transgress anywhere the boundaries of what is permitted under this heading I have no doubt but that you will stop me and instruct me and perhaps explain to me more clearly than I was able to understand from what the Ceann Comhairle said why we are not permitted to discuss the matter on page 17 of this text where the Minister specifically referred to the excess looming on the Defence Vote.  I quote the second paragraph on page 17:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are a number of reasons for the excess looming on the Defence Vote.  These include the extension of the Cyprus mandate, the cost of additional security measures ....</P>
    <P>I understand that my colleague.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, was ruled out of order when endeavouring to discuss this matter.  For a period during which these expenses to which the Minister referred were incurred the Minister for Defence was Deputy Gibbons.  We will be talking about this again in the <Col N="162" /> debate on the motion of confidence or no confidence as the case may be. This is an item which the Minister might well have omitted at this time. I rise largely to urge the Minister to omit this item of Defence from the present package for the reason that, in fact,&mdash;and this is not a particularly pleasant thing for a parliamentarian to have to say&mdash;I am convinced that in the recent past the Minister who was responsible for the incurring of these expenditures misled this House. I am absolutely convinced that the Minister misled this House.  I am satisfied that the Minister said things to us which were not true.</P>

I suggest that is relevant to the matter under discussion.  That is why I gave the references to the pages.  I would be very interested to have it explained to me why I am out of order and why it is not proper to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a great deal more to say.  The Minister for Finance <Col N="164" /> has, in fact, by this action and by others of his recent actions expressed an opinion as to the reliability of the Minister for Defence during a material time when these expenditures were incurred. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion, this reliance by the Minister for Finance, which is indicated by his inclusion of this item, is entirely misplaced.  The evidence for this, of course, we will have occasion to discuss in greater detail on a future occasion. I trust we will discuss it in the near future.  I should like to add that I feel that it would be proper for the Minister for Finance to clarify the propriety of the inclusion of this heading in his speech of today, in view of the fact that we have a statement from the Taoiseach that the expenditure of the moneys which would come under the Estimate of the Department of Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it would not, and the Deputy knows it.  It is dragging it in by the hair of the head.  It does not come under the Department at all.  I take it the Deputy is referring to the funds in relation to which the Taoiseach said there were investigations proceeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Finance is being a little disingenuous. He is well aware that the time of persons was spent in pursuance of activities and that those persons were on the payroll of the Department of Defence&mdash;that their salaries and expenses were coming not from the special grant of the Oireachtas, which may or may not have been misused, but from the vote for the Department of Defence.  Does the Minister deny that that occurred?  Does he deny that the present investigation may have to concern itself with Department of Defence expenditure as well?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears I have now five minutes, according to the arrangement entered into between the Whips. In any case, all I have to say I can say quickly.  The real reason why we are here tonight discussing an autumn <Col N="166" /> Budget, the reason why the Minister had to come to the House today and shamefacedly admit to us that the economy of the country had been allowed to drift into a deplorable state, is simply that we have had no Government in the country for some considerable time past.</P>
      <P>Instead of a Government concerned with efficiently and effectively administering the affairs of the nation, we had a warring group of Fianna Fáil Deputies and Ministers, concerned about their own internal troubles and engaging in matters that have done irreparable harm both inside and outside the country&mdash;outside the country when it was never more important that the good name of the country and our ability to govern ourselves as a nation should be evident to all.</P>
      <P>In the first page of his statement the Minister referred to the necessity for prompt and effective action.  After 32 years of Fianna Fáil Government we have an admission about the deplorable state of the economy, about the way employment is dropping, the way the balance of payments has gone against us.</P>
      <P>I understand now that there has been no agreement between the Whips. Nevertheless, I do not wish to keep the Minister out, but I should like to say that we should not be deceived by messages of one sort or another to the effect that there has been agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair was perfectly clear by indicating that all it had was information on this matter.  The Chair made a query in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told about the prompt action the Government are now taking, a Government which have been noted for their irresponsible promises prior to elections and prior to by-elections&mdash;a crisis today and no crisis tomorrow, avoiding taking action to try to keep themselves together. Keeping themselves together as a party and as a Government has been practically their sole occupation for <Col N="167" /> some considerable time.  I understand that in the past hour there has been another meeting and that now there is a new agreement, that Deputy Blaney has come around and that he is now to toe the line.  Now, therefore, there is a new decision to hang on and not let the people have a hand in trying to save the country.</P>
      <P>We have heard about this prompt action.  On page 2 of the Minister's speech we are told the consumer price index rose, on average, by about 3 per cent during the decade 1958 to 1967, and that this trend started to change in the latter year.  We had a 5 per cent increase in 1968, this rose to 7½ per cent the following year and it is now running at 8.4 per cent.  Still we are told about the prompt action.</P>
      <P>If the Government were taking prompt action why did they not move when they saw the trend?  Why did they not come to the House then with measures which the people would not have felt at that time instead of coming now with a steamroller?  They were putting off the evil day with <i>ad hoc</i> measures, stumbling from one crisis to another.  That is the kind of Government we have had for too long.</P>
      <P>We have been told about the drop in employment.  The yardstick of the Government was the number of new jobs, the numbers in employment, but the Minister had to come in today and say they have failed in that measurement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not told anything about the effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  That agreement was entered into in spite of the fact that everybody on this side of the House warned the Government that the whole balance of advantage would pass to the British side.  We are not told that the Government failed to deal effectively with the numerous breaches of the agreement by the British side and what these breaches have cost the economy. We are not told anything about the extravagances and misuses that the revenue of the country was put to but we are told about the large deficit in the balance of payments.  We are told that tourism is down and one of the reasons we are given for that is the <Col N="168" /> troubles in the north.  There is not a word about the troubles in the south. These must not be mentioned.  Although we were told only a short time ago that there was no drop in tourism this year, we are now told&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that the income from tourism was not great enough to make up the deficit and that this was due to a lot of other causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister go on to elaborate and say this drop was due to troubles in the north?  Why did he not refer to the troubles in the south?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I do not think even the Deputy would suggest that such troubles as we have had in the south kept tourists away, whatever else they may have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that the real growth of national production is only 2 per cent in 1970.  Everything that we have been told this evening spells out clearly the failure of the Government to do their own job.  We are told about the extra cost for Defence and for extra security precautions but we are not told in any detail <Col N="169" /> why this extra security was needed. However, most of us have a good idea as to why it was needed.  Certainly, it was not needed because of any increase in the numbers in the Army or because of the purchase of better equipment. Neither was it caused by increased fishery protection.  Last spring we were presented with a crude Budget, a Budget that was designed, one would have thought, to create inflation. It was obvious that it was a Budget prepared by somebody who was not doing his job and whose time was engaged in other pursuits.  Certainly it was not prepared by someone who was concerned with the circumstances of the time.</P>
      <P>Extra taxation is now being imposed on luxury goods.  Cars are included in this category.  According to my estimation, the tax on a 14 h.p. car is now being increased by £16.  I know many working men who have bought these bigger cars as old cars because they can be obtained at a reasonable cost.  Five or six men might be using such a car to travel to and from work each day and this extra tax will hit such men very hard.  From listening to the Minister one would think that the only people who drive these bigger cars are wealthy people but this is not the case.</P>
      <P>There has been a change of heart in relation to the 12th round increase. This is something we all welcome.  We had reached the deplorable position when the Minister for Finance and the Government did not intend to honour agreements entered into by themselves. What sort of example would this be for the working people and for the trade unions of the country?  However, there was a change of mind when pressure was brought to bear on the Government both by the Opposition parties and by the trade unions.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not try to explain &mdash;this is typical of the sort of day to day policy-making we have had here for far too long&mdash;why all rents are pegged except differential rents.  Would the Minister tell the House why this is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>When the Minister is replying, I hope he will clarify some points in relation to the taxation on cars and other vehicles.  Earlier he did not seem to know whether, for instance, ambulances would carry this increased taxation.  Neither did he seem to know whether mini-buses bringing staffs to institutions or, indeed, to industrial employment, would carry this extra tax.  If they do, this is increasing costs and off we go on a whirlwind again.  This will not deal effectively with inflation.  It is an extraordinary measure and one that needs some clarification by the Minister.</P>

      <P>As I have only a few minutes to conclude, I shall not be able to reply to the debate we have had, but it can be done if necessary on the Bill which will follow these resolutions.  However, I should say now that from the criticisms made, ranging from the accusation that we were doing nothing to the accusation of Deputy Donegan that this was no <Col N="171" /> supplementary Budget but a major imposition on the taxpayers, it is obvious that we are probably about right in the Budget.  I have not time to go into a number of points that I would like to deal with, but there is one particular point I should like to mention and that is in relation to what we have heard from the Labour Party regarding price control.  I am sure we will have an opportunity during the next day or two of hearing from them. I invite them to explain to us and to the country what they have in mind. They have said that I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, made no effort to control prices.</P>
