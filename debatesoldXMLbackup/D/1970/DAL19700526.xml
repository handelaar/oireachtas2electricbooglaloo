    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has received any indication from the Attorney General as to when the latter expects to receive the final reports of the special investigations being carried out into the recently attempted illegal importation of arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when he expects the Attorney General to decide what action is to be taken by him arising out of evidence submitted by the Taoiseach in connection with the alleged activities of Deputies Blaney and Haughey in attempting to smuggle firearms into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's decision is expected to be taken as soon as he has completed his investigations and examination of the relevant documents and information.  I have not received an indication as to when that might be.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody wishes to rush the Attorney General unduly but the Taoiseach will appreciate the amount of disquiet there is about this whole affair?  In view of the fact that serious allegations have been made against two ex-members of the Government who are still Members of this House, I want to get an assurance from the Taoiseach that this matter will not phase itself out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate what is the reason for the delay?  Are investigations still continuing or have they concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, investigations are still proceeding.  The Deputy will appreciate that I do not interfere in the activities of the Attorney General in such matters.  In reply to Deputy Corish, when I was asked on a radio or television programme a week or two ago whether I thought the decision of the Attorney General would be known within months or within weeks I said that I hoped it would be within weeks. That is still my hope.  I would not expect the matter to be phased out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The case was handed to the Attorney General about two weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps more than two weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Taoiseach informed the House that the Attorney General was privy to the initial investigation and that he joined with the Taoiseach in assessing the situation in the first place?  Why should there be this delay now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is purely a legal matter within the competence of the Attorney General.  I have not asked him about the delay but he is aware of my desire to have whatever action he may decide on, taken soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of the Attorney General deciding not to take any action, can the Taoiseach say what he, himself, proposes to do since it was the Taoiseach who made the allegations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not considered that yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the Attorney General is being permitted exclusively to act within his sole discretion, without any reference back and without any submission or direction from the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject out of hand the implication in that question.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Attorney General is acting within his own discretion, within his competence and completely objectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm for Deputy Desmond to tell the House and the country that this man attends at Government meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, may I ask the Taoiseach if, apart from the criminal prosecutions envisaged or anticipated, if it is further intended to have a public inquiry&mdash;I would say a sworn inquiry&mdash;into the full circumstances of this particular conspiracy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that in reply to a supplementary question the Taoiseach indicated that, in the event of the Attorney General not taking any action, he would bring the matter back to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Corish in the course of the debate I said that that would not be the end of the matter as far as I was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain the Taoiseach said he would bring the matter back to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in view of the fact that one Minister for State is now responsible for the Departments of Labour and Social Welfare he intends to proceed with the full integration of these Departments in the context of a Department of Employment and Social Security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The assignment of the two Departments of State mentioned <Col N="5" /> to the same member of the Government is not related to any intended integration of these Departments. As the Deputy is aware, the Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group has recommended a different combination of the functions concerned.  The recommendations in that report are being examined by the Government in a logical order, and the decisions on the distribution of functions between Departments of State will be announced when this examination is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>The Ambassador was invited to call on the Deputy Under Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 20th May in connection with another matter.  At the conclusion of the discussion on that matter, it was conveyed to him that the presence of an Army officer in the north had caused some embarrassment to the authorities there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When one party to the negotiations refused to accept them it cannot be taken as the end of the dispute.  Furthermore, I want to emphasise again that my Department are continuously in touch with the situation. As I have said here so frequently, I am very slow to intervene.  We have the Labour Court, the conciliation service, the Joint Industrial Council, and these provide ample machinery for negotiation.  However, if people sit down at the negotiating table they are likely to be influenced, prejudiced or conditioned one way or the other if they believe there are other sources to which they can appeal, that intervention might take place.  I am most <Col N="12" /> anxious that the existing machinery be used to the full.  In connection with the cement strike I should say that right now the unions concerned are examining a clarification statement from Cement Ltd. in regard to their latest offer in the light of the workers' demands.  Therefore, I do not want to interfere or to say anything that might prejudice what is likely to be the outcome of that.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Cement Ltd. negotiators have maintained a hard line in this dispute on the basis of what they assume to be the best for the economy, as they interpret it?  Is he also aware that immense hardship has been caused to thousands of workers' families and that this dispute is now at a stage of deadlock, while his Department have shown little initiative in this dispute?  Is the Minister further aware that the Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, intervened successfully on numerous occasions in disputes to bring about settlements whatever about his recent interventions in other areas?  Would it not, therefore, be proper for the Minister for Labour to show a little more initiative in bringing about some settlement disposition on the part of Cement Ltd. who enjoy a monopoly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If it is to be a question of my giving a directive to one side or another I cannot see how we can face the overall situation in relation to strikes.  I am well aware of the damage this strike is doing to the economy generally. It is not helping the balance of payments because cement is being imported whereas in the past it used to be exported.  However disastrous the effects of the strike may be, the ultimate decision could be much more disastrous to the economy if we are going to settle every strike by acceding to the demand, thereby getting a settlement at any price.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what is the statutory authority which governs the opening and closing of the commercial banks in the Republic; the days of the week on which they must legally remain open; and the Government orders which permitted them to remain closed to the public on such days during the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no law requiring the banks to stay open on any particular day or days.  Banks must close on the days appointed under the Public Holidays Acts, 1871 to 1924, to be bank holidays.  In addition to or in substitution for usual bank holidays, <Col N="17" /> the Government may appoint any specified day to be a bank holiday. The only days so appointed during the past 12 months were the first Monday in June, 1969, which was in substitution for Whit Monday, and 1st January, 1970, closing on 1st January being traditional for accounting purposes. Next Monday, 1st June, has also been appointed as a bank holiday in substitution for Whit Monday.</P>

      <P>Could I point out to the Minister in the bluntest fashion possible that the second inter-Party Government had this question before them and their legal adviser was of the opinion that the banks could not close without a Government Order? This was true.  I appeal to the men who were in the second inter-Party Government regarding this.  The Minister does not need to give me that kind of answer.  I know what the facts are about it.  The Minister should not give this kind of answer to the House. It is not correct.  The Minister is not telling the truth.</P>

I think what the Deputy is referring to is the fact that on a previous occasion a request was made by the banks to the then Government to make an Order, which they made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  That lapsed in December, 1957.  It does not now apply but the legal position is as I have stated it according to the best advice available to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices paid for milk by individual creameries, including branches of the Dairy Disposal Company Limited, are determined by the financial returns from the various activities carried on by those creameries and by the State support payments. I do not accept that the prices paid for milk by Dairy Disposal Company creameries are substantially different from those paid by co-operative creameries.  Some co-operative creameries pay higher prices than those paid by some Dairy Disposal Company creameries and some of the company's creameries pay higher prices than are paid by some co-operative societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider that the introduction <Col N="25" /> of a uniform price for creamery milk throughout the entire country would be in the best interests of the creamery industry and would lead to the increased efficiency in the industry, which is essential if producers are to obtain the best returns for their milk. There is, in fact, considerable scope for improving the returns to milk producers through rationalising the structure of the industry and I would strongly urge all creameries to give earnest and urgent attention to this aspect of creamery development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 to 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the concern of Deputies at the size of the increase which it has been necessary to permit in motor insurance premiums, and I can assure them that it was only after careful examination that I reluctantly concluded that an increase of this magnitude was unavoidable.  When figures for the year 1969 became available some time ago, they indicated a worsening of the claims experience of companies and it became clear that a very substantial increase would have to be permitted.  In deciding what increase I should permit, I did, of course, allow for profits on other branches of the companies' business&mdash;but it is completely wrong to suggest, as one Deputy does, that there were fat cheques elsewhere from which losses on motor business could be met.  I also made some allowance for income on the companies' investments, although they pointed out that as they had made heavy losses on motor business for a number of years, it was not possible to attribute a large part of their investments to this branch of business. Again, I disallowed part of their application because I was not satisfied with the extent of the cost savings which have been made in recent years. In this connection, however, I should point out that the cost ratio has, in fact, been reduced for some years past, that it would take some time to effect <Col N="35" /> substantial further savings and that meanwhile it would not be possible to expect the companies to go on losing money at the rate they had been doing. After careful consideration of these and other factors, I reached the conclusion that an increase of 17½ per cent would have to be permitted.  I shall keep a special eye on the claims experience of the companies, and, if it should show a significant improvement from the levels of 1969, I will reduce the rates of premium permitted.</P>
    <P>It is true, as some of the Deputies' questions imply, that it has become increasingly difficult in some cases to obtain insurance cover for cars and motorcycles.  This difficulty stemmed principally from the fact that with increasing claims the rates of premium had ceased to be economic for the companies, and I expect that with the new rates, cases of difficulty in securing cover should be rare.  For such cases, as Deputies are aware, there is special machinery under the auspices of the Minister for Local Government, for dealing with individual cases of drivers regarded as bad risks who find cover at reasonable rates hard to get.</P>
    <P>My predecessor announced last November that he was considering having an examination made of the Irish insurance industry and he subsequently indicated that he was specifically concerned about certain aspects of motor insurance.  I have, in fact, decided to set up a representative committee to review the field of insurance, with wide-ranging terms of reference which will enable the committee to consider, as they think fit, the various matters which I have mentioned, as well as other issues of a more general character such as have been raised by Deputies in these questions.  I expect to be in a position to announce the composition and terms of reference of the committee shortly.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should say in reply to a number of specific points included in the questions, that application for an increase was made on behalf of the majority of the companies on the 7th November, 1969; that the application was not referred to a prices advisory <Col N="36" /> board because insurance is outside the scope of the Prices Act; and that I have no reason to anticipate that the increase in premiums will have appreciable adverse effects on car sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that certain companies in Dublin have refused to accept any new applicants for motor insurance while other companies have agreed not to accept transfers from these companies?  What is the position regarding applicants endeavouring to obtain motor insurance? It is a constitutional requirement that all motorists must have third party insurance but this is not available to them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that one insurance company did announce its intention not to renew its existing motor policies&mdash;this is what the Deputy is referring to&mdash;but I have been given to understand that the chairman of the Accident Officers Association indicated in a public statement on 22nd May last that it is not true that other companies are not willing to cover an applicant who was refused by a particular company.  As I have indicated in my reply, arising from the sanctioning of the 17½ per cent increase I do not think it will be possible for any motorists to get car insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Following his sanctioning of a 17½ per cent increase why should the Minister now set up a representative committee of inquiry? Surely the Minister is fully aware that 80 per cent of motor insurance in this country is in the monopoly control of three or four major British motor insurance groups?  These groups are in intense competition for motor insurance in Britain and they do not appear to incur the same losses there.  Yet the Minister accepts fully the data&mdash;which I regard as fraudulent substantiation&mdash; given him of alleged motor losses in the Republic?  Quite frankly, I think the Minister has been taken for a ride in an uninsured and decrepit motor vehicle.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that the proposed increases in premiums would be no more than minimum premiums and that in very many cases much higher premiums are demanded by insurance companies?  Furthermore, these insurance companies exclude everything that can be excluded under the Act; they are giving the minimum cover for the maximum rate.  It had become almost impossible&mdash;as I said in the question which I put down before the increases were announced&mdash;to get cover at reasonable terms before these increases were sanctioned.  Having regard to the fact that insurance is compulsory, does the Minister not consider it his duty to take drastic steps to ensure that cover is provided at reasonable terms?</P>

According to insurance companies one is not an adult until one has reached the age of 30?</P>

Will the Minister, therefore, say to the insurance companies, the legal profession and the medical profession that it is time to lay off and give over collecting the fat cheques that arise when a person has the misfortune to meet with an accident?

      <P>I have arranged to meet a joint deputation from the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union on Thursday of this week to discuss the situation involving junior hospital doctors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not wish to comment on that.  The Deputy has seen the <Col N="47" /> observations of the IMA and the IMU.  Were I to comment such comment might reduce the chances of arranging a settlement.  We should be able to arrange a settlement having regard to all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>While appreciating the Minister's anxiety that a settlement will be arrived at on Thursday, can the Minister say what steps he is now taking to ensure, should a settlement not be reached, the safety and comfort of the sick and injured in hospital?  As I understand the situation, some of the resignations are due to take effect from next Tuesday and, unless steps are taken to provide alternative medical care for people in hospital, a considerable amount of human suffering may occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of these resignations being finalised we would naturally advise the hospitals to restrict admissions to emergency cases and to postpone admissions in cases in which surgery is not immediately necessary, together with taking whatever other steps are open to them to ensure that emergency cases can be catered for.  We will give whatever advice is necessary if no settlement is reached.  I can hardly believe there will not be a reasonable settlement.</P>

      <P>Is it not true, judging by the headlines in this evening's papers, that hospitals all over the country are, <Col N="48" /> in fact, taking the measures the Minister says he would advise them to take if the talks break down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If, by any chance, some particular hospital failed to take appropriate measures, then my Department might be blamed; therefore, while recognising the intelligence of the administrators of the hospitals, it is better for me to give the departmental point of view as to what is absolutely essential should there be a breakdown in these negotiations.  I would naturally expect every hospital to think of the measures I have indicated.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday I had mentioned that some of the executive staff of the board were doing their jobs reasonably efficiently.  I had also spoken about the composition of boards and before the debate was adjourned I was discussing the transportation of fish from such places as west Cork to Dublin and its transportation back again for sale in Cork.  Since the adjournment I have got some documentation which was not available to me last Thursday and, as a result, I must ask the indulgence of the House if I speak for a longer period on this matter than I originally intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of the date of the inception of the Fisheries Board but for many years prior to that we had a fishing industry in Ireland and in south-west Cork we had a thriving fishing industry.  We had such major <Col N="51" /> centres as Kinsale, Union Hall, Baltimore, Skull, Bantry and Castletownbere together with a number of smaller centres all engaged in fishing in a big way and in the export of fish to many countries abroad.  Apparently, without any help from public funds they were able to do this with boats in no way approaching the type of vessels we have today and with antiquated equipment. The lifting of fish from boat to shore was manual work and I do not think even winches were available then. Despite all those handicaps we had a thriving fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has been given various injections of public funds since our own Government took over.  The Estimate for the current year for fisheries is more than £1.8 million while the grant in aid to the board is £.35 million.  We also have other moneys voted for fishery development.  I am not finding fault with that or with money for the incidental works such as harbour improvements but I am wondering if we are getting value for the money.</P>
    <P>When you read the report for 1968-69 you do not find, so far as numbers are concerned, that there is any great progress.  The total number of men engaged in the industry on a permanent basis last year was 1,687 which is not a very big figure, even in relation to our small population, spread over a coastline of several thousand miles.  There is nothing to boast about in that as regards development.  In addition we are told there are 3,756 men in part-time employment.</P>
    <P>With all the money, all the talk about fish and fisheries, all the grants-in-aid and trips abroad and everything you could conjure up about the fishing industry, we find that on this coastline the total number of workers, both permanent and part-time, is less than 5,500.  Is there something wrong there? Years ago before the board got its teeth, I venture to say that the number of people engaged in the fishing industry was far in excess of 5,500.</P>
    <P>Let us examine how we are progressing despite all the money that is being poured into fishing.  I have here a <Col N="52" /> leaflet issued by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Fisheries Division, 3 Cathal Brugha Street, Dublin, 1, giving the landings of sea fish, quantity and value returned as landed.  In 1967, the total value of the fish known as demersal fish&mdash;if the Minister knows what that is&mdash;does he?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can look up his dictionary when he returns to his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not try to be too clever with words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Or he can ask his Parliamentary Secretary now.  That is fruit for thought for the Minister for the night.  In any case, it includes sole, brill, turbot, plaice and that type of fish.  In 1967, the total value of the catches was £1,079,794.  Despite the depreciating value of money the increase is rather insignificant.  It moved to £1,111,747 in 1968 and increased by another £100,000 odd in 1969.  Despite the fact that we read of the launching of new boats and the provision of modern gear and modern equipment, the headway there is insignificant to my mind.</P>
      <P>The total value of net fish stands at £2.1 million according to this report. Lobsters, crab fish, escallops, or shellfish in general, brought our total figure up to less than £3 million last year. The crab fish side of the industry accounts for almost £1 million of that, and our exports to the Continent alone of crab fish of the different varieties reached about £707,000 last year.  I understand the figure was almost £1 million so, if we take that sum from the total value of our fish catches, the other types of fish account for a little less than £2 million.  These are small figures when, according to the Bill we are discussing, the board is looking for borrowing power of up to £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with this statement we have a graph of our fish exports which I am sure the Minister will read later on.  This year the graph shows just more than 2½ million of which £1 million, in round figures, is accounted for through the export of shell fish. This is happening in an island with <Col N="53" /> so many thousand miles of coastline. Our imports of fish are increasing steadily.  I understand that the figure for last year was £1.86 million, representing 60 per cent of the value of the fish caught at home.  In this relatively small island with a population of less than 3,000,000 people, and with so many miles of coastline, why should we have to hand out £1.862 million for imported fish?  The type of fish we are importing is the type we have abounding in our own waters.  There is no special type of fish according to the accounts we have in this abbreviated report.</P>
    <P>I suggest that something is wrong with the fishing industry.  Are we giving it the attention we should give it or are we just ploughing public money into the fishing industry, keeping it going, making a nice soft living for some people who do not wet their feet so far as fishing is concerned but who stay comfortably ashore and draw the dividends?  I do not want to repeat what I said here on Thursday last so far as that aspect of the industry is concerned.  I do not want to take up the time of the House in doing so but we know&mdash;and I think this was mentioned by Deputy Begley earlier in this debate&mdash;of people who are getting soft money.  The Minister can define the term &ldquo;soft money&rdquo; for himself. I am sure he can do so without any help from me.  The people who are paying that soft money are the small men, the men who have to go out into the wind and the weather and fight against the seas and the waves to try to catch fish and bring them to shore and take what they get without any more ado.  I hope the new Minister will take that up with the board and see that that type of person is protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I must illustrate. The Minister is from an inland place and I assume that he has not much knowledge of fishing so it is essential to illustrate in detail.  There is not any sea around Kilkenny, Callan or Castlecomer. To come to the fellows who will get the soft money: people who put down a deposit on a boat and, for that deposit, get a share in the boat and get the same return for it as the man who was out working at sea catching the fish.  That is the fellow who gets the soft money.  I am referring to people who never go to sea but who get the boats and get other fellows to go out and to brave the storms and waves while they remain safe on shore and then get the money and put it into their pockets. There are a number of such people around our coasts.  I should like to see the money paid for fish going into the pockets of the people who catch it.  I mentioned here already the case of seven fishermen who get the same weekly return for their work but no details of any kind as to how the sum is arrived at.  They try to get the information on fish prices through radio reports.</P>

I am not in favour of a person having £1,000 and giving it towards the cost of a boat and getting, in return for that, the same <Col N="55" /> return as the fisherman gets for his work on the boat.

      <P>I gave the information in the most simple form possible. Seeing that the Minister is now in this position, I think there is an obligation on me to give the information to him. Let me turn now to another subject. We have people banded together in organisations of different kinds.  Almost <Col N="56" /> all our people are now in an organisation of one kind or another.  The gun is out demanding so much&mdash;or else. That is the way our Irish system is working today with closely-knit groups and organisations demanding, in many cases, more than their slice of the loaf. There is no organisation so far as the ordinary fishermen are concerned: they number about 1,600 around our coasts. They are far too removed from each other.  They are one group who need organisation and someone to look after their interests.  I trust the board will try to have the ordinary fishermen from Donegal to Mizen Head organised.  Tell the fisherman his rights.  Hold meetings with him.  Let him know where he stands.  Protect him, where there is need of protection, from exploitation.</P>
      <P>The boatowners or skippers who are acting conscientiously and giving justice to their fishermen have nothing to fear or to dread under such a position. In actual fact, it would be to their advantage also.  I do not want to go back on statements made here last Thursday which hinted at unsuitable applicants getting boats through political representations.  The information available to us about the board is so limited that I am not conversant with how such applications are processed. I am satisfied that the chairman is a man of the highest integrity: I know him and other senior executives from their visits to west Cork.  There is one thing we do not know in relation to those who are members of the board and those who have been members of it in the past: we do now know how they function.  I am glad to give the Minister one of his early lessons on the fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will benefit by it.  I am satisfied he will take action.  It is impossible for a person from an inland place to know what is happening around the coast.  One must be on the spot.  One must meet these people.  One must find out what is happening. I am a representative of this House, paid from public funds and paid to travel from Schull, County Cork, to attend meetings of this Dáil <Col N="57" /> The aim of public representatives should be to measure up to a standard set down here by Deputy Haughey. I came across it accidentally.  It is a reference to the role of a TD. He said he does not get anybody anything that he is not entitled to but he can make sure that a person gets what he is entitled to.</P>
      <P>I have never claimed in the course of my public life that I have endeavoured to get anything for anybody that he was not entitled to but I am endeavouring to get for our people what they are entitled to in justice and if some people get more than their share either in the fishing industry, the agricultural industry or any other industry it is self-evident that others get less than their rightful share.  That is what I am bringing to the notice of the Minister this evening.  I do not like to see any man, no matter what his role, his political affiliation or his vocation in life, getting less than he is entitled to from this State.  What I want to see is justice and justice only, irrespective of how it will react on my own personal fortunes.  The day is gone when our people would be gulled by party hacks going around implying that benefits were got for our people to which they were not lawfully and legally entitled. If such benefits were got for people and if statements that some people here can get benefits for people to which they are not entitled are correct then that is fraudulent.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to bring home is the desirability of getting fair play for the ordinary fisherman, the fellow who has no capital, who must do the actual work out in the sea and who must gamble on having a good catch or his income will be very small.  The Minister will appreciate the uncertainty of the average fisherman's income.  If fishing is good he may have a good week's income; if the weather is unfavourable or if the fish are very plentiful and prices are down, he will have a small week's income.  We should make sure he will get what he is entitled to and that some people do not take from his table some bread that is lawfully his.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shellfish are very important at the moment in west Cork.  I was very pleased to read that despite the national <Col N="58" /> figures for our sales of fish&mdash;incidentally Deputy Creed was not able to solve this problem either&mdash;we are catching £2.9 million worth of fish and we are selling £2.5 million worth so that we are eating scarcely any fish at home except imported fish.</P>

      <P>The Minister solved that since Thursday.  However, we must be using a large amount of the imported fish ourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we imported £1.862 million worth.  Let us get down to this industry which is netting £1 million annually.  I am sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are reasonably conversant with the shellfish industry. It does not require big boats and usually two people can man a boat. The work is reasonably difficult.  The income could be deemed uncertain.  Of late in our area the position is bright and sizeable quantities of shellfish of all varieties are caught.  One million pounds on the export market is a big figure.  I wonder what advice or assistance does An Bord Iascaigh Mhara give to people who catch these fish? They are not too sure of prices.  They are not conversant with market fluctuations. Most of these fish are sold on the Continent.  These people do not know whether in Paris today oysters or crab-fish or lobsters are doing well or doing badly.  The board should step in and make daily announcements on market fluctuations and market prices for that kind of fish and let those who catch the fish know what the prices are.  There are sometimes radio announcements about fish prices but I have been told they are unsatisfactory and that in many cases they are not too factual. We know what a small variation could mean in the price of such costly fish as lobster, prawns and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in West Cork are trying to help our gross national product and our balance of payments by the catching of fish, particularly the valuable fish I have been referring to.  On the last occasion I referred briefly to the necessity for some of the money being expended <Col N="59" /> by the Fisheries Branch to be spent on harbour and pier development works.  I do not want to go into this question again.  In fact, I did not think it was relevant at all to the discussion until it was pointed out to me by the Acting Chairman last Thursday that it was quite relevant to discuss harbours, piers and slips on this Estimate, something I thought unusual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the Official Report.  We will move away now from the discussion on the fishing ports.  I discussed the ports last week and mentioned the necessity for developing them.  We are very pleased with the work at Baltimore.  It is giving reasonable employment.  The products are excellent.  The development works at Castletownberehaven, although delayed for a long time, are now very satisfactory. I have indicated to people from other centres who are pressing for work to be done that all the money cannot be found to carry out works simultaneously at every port.  Much money had to be expended at the major pier in Castletownberehaven.  I hope that Castletownberehaven will soon take over the position which Killybegs now holds.  We have other ports.  I am not going to mention them in this debate.  I am doubtful about the relevance of this question.  If it had not been for the direction from the Chair the last day I do not think I would have raised the matter.</P>
      <P>As we know, charity begins at home. We have had representations about the piers at Schull, Baltimore, Kinsale and other places.  I would ask the newly-appointed Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Fahey, to take note of them.</P>

I cannot understand why we should have had to import £1.862 million worth of fish last year. <Col N="60" /> Why should we have had to do that? How is it that we cannot catch sufficient fish to meet our own requirements?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will agree that how that money is to be expended is relevant to the discussion.  It is a big question to give a State-sponsored body the power of borrowing up to £5 million, particularly as, as has been indicated by various Members, time and time again, information is being withheld from Members of this House as to the activities of such bodies.  We get some kind of general statement from the board under discussion.  We did get the actual figures for imports of fish in previous years in the annual reports from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara but we do not get them any longer.  We were given more detailed information about the type of fish we were importing than we are now given.  This is an important question.  Why cannot we catch a sufficiency of fish in our own waters? There are thousands of miles of coastline to meet our requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>An opportunity for more exhaustive examination is required. Part of this £5 million which the board expect to borrow will, I presume, be borrowed shortly.  There has been a sum of £1.1 million written-off recently as losses and liability.  When dealing with public boards it does not seem to matter whether they make profit or loss.  The personnel are sure of their pay and superannuation.  In private businesses it is the manager's job to watch the business and to be very careful; he is dependent on the business for his livelihood; if he is not <Col N="61" /> very careful he will be faced with bankruptcy.  I do not wish to specify any particular State-sponsored board. We have CIE and other such boards. It does not matter whether they suffer losses or not.  Of course they lose.  The citizen is asked to pay through turnover tax, income tax and taxes on all foodstuffs and commodities.  This situation occurs too often with regard to State-sponsored bodies.  The State balances the books when necessary. When State-sponsored bodies are concerned, no one will lose his job in so far as the personnel attached to the particular board are concerned.  If funds are not available and losses are incurred Cáitlín Ní Hoúlihán will pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the board should do more than they are doing at present.  They should try to ensure that the necessity for importing such large and costly quantities of fish will not arise in the future.  I do not wish to disagree with the ruling of the Chair.  The fishing industry is costing public funds a great deal of money.  It is an industry from which many people in the country are not benefiting one iota.  People in Dublin and in midland towns buy fish at substantially more than was paid for it to the man who caught it.  The price of fish in Dublin is exorbitant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in inland towns and even in towns where fish is caught locally are paying high prices for fish.  Possibly that is the reason why fish consumption is so low.  Even if fish consumption was higher it might not benefit local fishermen.  Fishery imports would have to increase.  There are only 1,600 people employed permanently in the fishing industry and 3,600 people employed in a part-time capacity in it. <Col N="62" /> The figures could be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity of visiting Iceland and of listening to lectures from people in that country on every aspect of the fishing industry.  I was able to see for myself the prosperity of the country where 90 per cent of their income was derived from the fishing industry.  Iceland is in a much more difficult zone for fishing than Ireland is.  There is not much difference in size between the two countries.  Possibly we have more coastline than Iceland.  Our population is much higher.  Surely their methods are much more modern than ours in so far as the handling of fish is concerned.</P>
    <P>Last month I had an opportunity of attending Bergen fish market in Norway.  When that fish market is compared with our method of selling fish it is easy to see why we are not successful. I spent a couple of hours at the market because I was very interested in seeing how the fish was offered for sale. The market was held in an open square and the fish was offered for sale under the most hygienic conditions. The number of people buying fish was far in excess of what the number would be in a city of comparable size such as Cork.  It happened to be a Friday but I am sure that that did not influence the people who attended the market.  I am suggesting that the fish consumption there is much higher because of the way in which it is presented for sale. We could certainly learn much from them.  Our method of selling fish is not conducive to increased demand.  We are lagging far behind other countries in this respect.  The authorities should pay more attention first of all, to the price of fish and, secondly, to the methods of marketing fish.</P>
    <P>It would not be fair for me to take up any more of the time of the House since there are other Deputies from coastal as well as other areas who are anxious to speak.  Before concluding I should like to say a word about the newly-appointed Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his Parliamentary Secretary.  These men have not yet been in office long enough to have become conversant with their particular Department.  I do not know whether <Col N="63" /> Deputy Fahey will be made responsible for Fisheries but, at any rate, I am very pleased that he has been appointed to the post of junior Minister. I have known Deputy Fahey since he became a Member of the Dáil. It pleases me to see Deputies from rural Ireland being promoted.  There may be other Deputies who would claim to be better equipped for such posts by virtue of having many letters after their names but Deputies from rural Ireland may be much more in tune with what is needed to be done in relation to this particular Department. I have great respect for Deputy Fahey although we have disagreed on political issues.  He has now been assigned to an important post and I, as I am sure the other Deputies in the House also, wish him every success during his period of office.</P>
    <P>However, the only addition I would make to that is that I hope that period of office will not be for too long because we all know how anxious the House is for a change in Government. I shall have a talk with the Parliamentary Secretary in the not too distant future to discuss some of the matters that come within the ambit of his office in the hope that this may produce better results than open discussion. I see the Minister has come in and to him, also, I should like to extend my best wishes for his success in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. As I have said here before, our population is too small for us to take mean advantages.  It would be rotten for one party to be pleased because another is in difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very nice of the Deputy to say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my opinion that we should have more co-operation in a country like this of less than 3,000,000 people.  While I criticised the Government and their activities during the recent debate I now extend my best wishes to both the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary.  Their work in relation to fisheries is difficult enough but it is much more difficult in relation to agriculture.  I can only <Col N="64" /> hope that their work will help to prosper and advance the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of the points raised by Deputy Murphy. His problems would appear to be similar to those which exist along the Kerry coast.  If we are to discuss this increase to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara we must also discuss how the money is to be used.  I should hope this money is intended for the purpose of extending the fishing industry and thereby reducing the imports of fish.  We should endeavour to get some proportion of the £168 million that is available in EEC countries.  This is important because our figures to date in respect of fishing are miserable when compared with those of other European countries. Of course, I would like to see much more money being devoted to the fishing industry if it were possible to do so.</P>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that the efforts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Fisheries Division over the years have lent themselves to the landing of fish economically.  As Deputy Murphy said, the Department is costing this country £1,800,000; it is costing up to £600,000 to run An Bord Iascaigh Mhara alone, and it will take practically £500,000 to service this £5 million borrowing.  Those figures added together far exceed our £2,500,000 fish exports for 1968.  It must also be considered that £1 million of those exports are mainly fresh water fish, salmon and shellfish, and £600,000 of them are purely herrings much of which are landed by foregn trawlers on our coasts.  That leaves us with a balance of £700,000 plus about £400,000 worth that is consumed at home, a little over £1 million altogether.  If it costs us up to £3 million to produce £1 million worth of sea fish landings, then this is not a good picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of the fishery committee in the Council of Europe for two years and I have the returns of various European countries for export landings.  The export landings of fish in Ireland in 1968 were 49,000 metric tons: the Faroe Islands, which is very small in size and population, had 107,000 tons; Iceland, which would be comparable in size but has <Col N="65" /> a much smaller population, had 836,300 tons; Norway, which would be comparable to Ireland in size and population had 3,010,000 tons.  The value of our export landings was $6.3 million or £2.8 million.  The Icelandic figure was $86,300,000 or £34,500,000. The Norwegian figure was £100 million, despite the fact that owing to climatic conditions, Norway has only a very short fishing season.</P>
    <P>If there had been a more active approach by the Governments of the past and even by the Government of today to the value of fishing particularly along our west coast, our fishery exports should be in the region of at least £30 million today.  That would give employment both afloat and on land to about 40,000 people.  This would make a vast difference because the major portion of it would apply to our west coast and would certainly be the answer to the problem of the declining population in that area.  It should be remembered that we have an all the year round fishing season which the other countries have not.  Still our returns are miserable having regard to the general fishing possibilities here. According to EEC estimates there is a market of £186 million for fish over and above their own landings.  It should be possible for us to get our fair share of this market.  When shall we have a realistic approach to the value of this industry which could help so much to stem the emigration from the west, in particular, and from the congested areas all over the country?  There are half-hearted talks at times about keeping our people along the western coastline. There are the country development teams and so on but they seem to shy away from fishery development.</P>
    <P>From the time I came to this House I have made efforts to have something done in my own area, particularly in Dingle, Cahirciveen and adjoining areas.  As Deputy Murphy stated, going back 50 years ago, we had no boards and practically no Fisheries Division. Yet a vast number of people was engaged in the fishing industry.  Smallholders succeeded, between fishing and managing their small holdings, to rear big families and produce the necessaries <Col N="66" /> of life, pursuing a way of life that was ideal in those days.  The start of the decline in fishing was the close down of the American market for both herrings and mackerel.  This was brought about by changes in health legislation at the time.  Most of the fish in other days was packed in barrels, sent across the Atlantic and sold in open markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is loath to interfere with Deputies in the development of their arguments in the debate, but the Bill before the House deals with the activities of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the provision of money for that body.  As the Chair has pointed out previously, the Estimate for Agriculture and Fisheries will be coming before the House when the general policy in regard to fisheries can be dealt with.  The Chair is anxious not to allow the discussion to become so wide as to get away from the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the failure of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to develop, and I am anxious to see that any new borrowings will lead to far wider development than has taken place in the past.  My experience since I came to the House is that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have set about and succeeded in a policy of conservatism. They sold out the various landing houses and processing places along our shores.  This is not conducive to development.</P>
      <P>We now have a position in which we are doing much less fishing than when we had no boats.  The reason our fishing has declined is that there was not enough vision to establish processing plants, which should have been the answer by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara as a State body.  If they had established those processing plants and packaged the fish so that it would reach the market in the form the purchaser requires we would have much more fishing done here.  I am certainly anxious to see the maximum amount of money channelled into fishing and I want to see an increased number of processing plants established.  I take it the money now being granted will be mainly for boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along the coastline in my county we have several different types of engines <Col N="67" /> and we cannot get a repair depot to repair many of those engines.  I know of a fisherman who was waiting six months for a part for an engine.  Surely it is not too much to expect that a board with so much of the State's money in this industry would have the necessary standard type engines, or at least if they have to have several types of engines, to standardise a particular type on one part of the coast and to have repair depots with spare parts so that the fishermen can get their engines repaired.  It is because of the lack of such facilities that so many fishermen have run into debt and cannot make their boats pay.  Recently I heard of a man who since last September has been trying to get a new engine for his boat.  It was because of pressure I brought to bear that the engine was obtained.  We want to make sure that this money will be put into the type of development which will help the fishermen.</P>
    <P>Salmon fishing, which represents £1 million of our exports, and herring fishing are not directly concerned with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Every other type of fishing is directly concerned with the board.  The figures I have given for other countries, which are not in as favourable a position as we are, bespeaks the futile effort made here to try to build up our fishing.  When only half of the landings are accepted surely any board or any Fishery Branch cannot feel proud of their efforts in this regard.  I take it those figures which I have given, which were obtained from the Council of Europe, are correct.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara must completely re-examine their efforts because we seem to be completely tied down to the markets within our own country. Deputy Murphy spoke of £1.8 million imports being made up mainly of fish fingers.  The bulk is made up of whiting and such fish which we all too often send to the fish plants.  The balance is made up of canned salmon mainly from Canada and Japan.  It should be possible to can our salmon, if there is a surplus landed when salmon is very cheap.  It should be possible also to produce fish fingers from fish caught around our coast.  In times of heavy <Col N="68" /> landings much of our fish goes to the fish plants.</P>
    <P>Our fishermen are suffering because of the lack of facilities.  The best fishermen are going away from the western areas where they should be employed. Many of our young men, if they saw a genuine effort being made to help them, would take to the sea and make a living out of fishing.  Many of the men in the Dingle and Cahirciveen areas are very anxious to stay.  Sometimes when fish is scarce they get a fair price for the catch but at other times, when there are heavy landings, the fish has to be sold at a give-away price to the fish factories, or sold to merchants who are able to put it into cold storage until such time as they can obtain a high price for it.</P>
    <P>I would ask An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or the Government to set up some form of commission to inquire into the whole fishing industry.  There should be some form of advisory board to advise fishermen on the best method of increasing their landings.  We had some American experts here at one stage but from the information I got these people were not conversant with the methods of fishing here.  They were more concerned with large boats and long distance fishing.  We have plenty of fishing quite near our shores which could be developed with small boats which could land 20 to 30 cran of fish at a time.  I am rather amazed to see that Norway has over 40,000 fishing vessels, the bulk of which are very small.  It has very few big boats but still it is able to land £100 million worth of fish.  We can forget the long distance sea fishing. Some old fishermen in Dingle and Cahirciveen told me there was no necessity for the very big sea-going boats, that we should spend our time with whatever type of naval boats we have trying to stop the big men from coming into our harbours.  These people are trying to come in so why should we get big boats to go out fishing?  This is the standard by which the fishermen measure the value of the big boats.</P>
    <P>There is certainly room for vast expansion of the fishing industry.  This must come because otherwise, with the <Col N="69" /> way things are going at the moment, with our fishermen losing heart for any development and the younger lads leaving, we will find ourselves left with the middle aged and older fishermen and we will not have the problem in ten years time.  The tradition of fishing will have passed on like so many of our other trades along the western seaboard and we will not be able to get the younger lads in the years ahead to reopen this business again.  We need a crash programme now to try to reap this rich harvest to its fullest.  Great progress has been made during the years but, to use a fisherman's phrase, we appear to be resting on our oars and any progress that has been made recently has been in the matter of prices.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words on this very important industry for fishermen.  I welcome the new Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary.  I have always said that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is the most important man in the Government. I wish both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary luck in their new appointments and I hope that when they leave the Department will be better than when they came into it.</P>
      <P>There has not been much of a change as far as environment is concerned because the last Minister fished in the Lagan and his Parliamentary Secretary fished in the Blackwater, and the present Minister fishes on the Nore and his Parliamentary Secretary on the Suir. I suppose they are good fishermen and that when they get into deep water they will be able to acquit themselves very well.  The first thing I should like to deal with is the fishing limit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that because the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was the other Minister until recently he might be able to say a few words on this.  However, I will not pursue it.  Fishing is a most important industry and when we consider the number of people employed in it and the amount of money made from it I do not think we have made much progress during the years.  Going back to my young days I can remember the number of in-shore fishermen on our coast and I am sure they exceed by far the number of men employed in the entire industry today.  The fishing industry at that time was making as much money then as now if you compare the value of money then and now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you see French and Spanish trawlers fishing to within sight of our coast there must be something there. We have around us a great industry if it were handled properly.  As I have said, fishermen come from Spain and France, crossing the roughest seaway, the Bay of Biscay, to get here to fish not only in summer but in the depth of winter.  While they are coming within sight of our coast we are not able to protect our industry.  A few <Col N="71" /> days ago we learned that some effort is being made to provide a vessel for this purpose and I hope that not only one but three or four such vessels will be made available in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy spoke about harbours and piers, another very important aspect of our fishing industry.  If we have not proper accommodation for our fishing boats there is no use sending them out.  It is reasonable to assume that when people brave the seas, when they provide themselves with boats and face the ocean, they should be provided with adequate harbours and piers. More was done 40 years ago in this regard, as anyone can see who goes around the coast.</P>
    <P>I hope money will be provided in the near future for this very important industry.  Especially now, when we face entry to the EEC where there is an excellent market for any fish we can supply, I hope the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary will see to it that bigger and better boats will be provided for our fishermen so that they can fish for longer hours and with greater safety.  A big difficulty for our fishermen has been the fact that their boats were on the small side and that they, therefore, were not able to go out as far, or stay out as long as their competitors from France and Spain.  I hope this will be rectified in the near future.  There appears to be an unlimited market for any fish we can export to Europe and we should exploit this market to the limit.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to refer to the shellfish industry which has increased considerably in recent years. The board should be careful to see that our coasts are not overfished and that the seed is left.  Another point I wish to mention is representation on the board.  I think we should have a bigger percentage of fishermen on the board because they are the people who understand the difficulties of the industry and who would be able to advise the Minister and his officials on them. In the past they had not as much representation as I should like them to have.  It is their industry and they should be represented on the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> I should like to wish the Minister every success in his task.  I have been on a number of boards with the Parliamentary Secretary and have always found him a most hardworking and capable representative.  Both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have a demanding job before them and I wish them every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Before making a few brief comments may I say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I am glad to see you, Sir, back in the House, fit and well.  Last week I was unable to be here for the opening of the debate and I thank Deputy Desmond for standing in for me on that occasion.  Most of the remarks he and Deputy Murphy have made from these benches were points I had intended to deal with myself and, therefore, my job is particularly light today.  However, there are one or two points with which I should like to deal but, as the Chair is keeping a rather tight rein on the debate, I am afraid I may not be allowed the same licence as was permitted earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I received statistics in connection with the fishing industry for 1969 and I also received the report and accounts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the previous year.  A quick look at the figures shows an improvement in both the value and quantity of landings under most headings.  It is to the credit of the board that since their establishment a few short years ago almost without exception the quantity and the value of landings have expanded annually.  A glance at our geographical position by a person not connected with the fishing industry would indicate that Ireland is particularly well suited to take advantage of the fishing potential in this part of the world.  Unfortunately, however, little interest has been taken in the industry by successive administrations.  There was a separate Department of Fisheries in the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government but it was amalgamated with the Department of Lands and later with the Department of Agriculture.  During those years the fishing industry declined throughout this country and it was only in the sixties that we had a welcome return of interest by the present administration in the great <Col N="73" /> potential the industry holds for our country.</P>
    <P>The establishment of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara was a milestone for the industry.  In the 16th and 17th centuries Ireland was one of the leading fishing countries in the world; we exported fish in huge quantities to the continent and this was achieved with boats and gear very different from what are used today.</P>
    <P>The report from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries indicates the vast increase that has taken place in the quantities of landings, particularly in regard to herrings.  If my mathematics are correct, there was an increase of 230,000 cwts in one year and this is, indeed, a most valuable improvement in relation to the fishing industry.  Most of the herring catch is exported to Europe, particularly to France, and the fact that it is sold to one of the EEC countries is especially gratifying.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of shellfish, catches of crab and oysters have shown a dramatic increase in the last year. However, the sharp decline in our catches of plaice and codfish is not welcome.  In the chart for home consumption both plaice and codfish are the most popular and a decrease in the quantity landed means that we must import to satisfy consumer needs.  As a nation we are very conservative and even with the promotional drive by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara there has been little change in our traditional eating habits.  Deputy O'Connor mentioned that there has been an increase in the importation of fish particularly from Britain and this often takes the form of fish fingers.  These are made in Britain and, due to the attractive packaging, they appear to sell reasonably well in this country.  An intensive promotional campaign for this product is carried out through the medium of Independent Television which is viewed by very many people in this country.</P>
    <P>A lot of money is devoted to promoting the sale of fish fingers on the British market.  The promotional efforts seem to be effective on our east coast also and the north-east coast where these programmes are received.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara have used television <Col N="74" /> to promote the sale of fish on the home market.  Obviously they are limited as to the amount of money they can spend because promotion of this type is rather expensive.  They tend to limit their advertising to the one day in the week when most people eat fish, namely, Friday.  I am sure everyone knows the advertisement about sea fresh fish being available.</P>
    <P>I think the board should endeavour to make fish a more saleable product on other days of the week.  It is doubtful if the fast and abstinence rules, which apply only in Ireland, benefit the fishing industry because fish eaten on Friday instead of meat is thought of as a penalty.  Young housewives should be taught all the different methods of preparing fish dishes; they will then find their families will appreciate fish dishes on other days of the week apart from Fridays.  It is a luxury to be able to provide meat two or three times a day at the price it is and I think Bord Iascaigh Mhara could promote the consumption of fish at one meal in the day.  They could perhaps have a promotional drive suggesting a teatime meal of fish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond has dealt with the price of fish, which seems to fluctuate from week to week.  He also dealt with the difference in the price charged for fish at the landing place and later at the shops where it was sold.  Indeed, the price paid for fish landed at Wicklow port, which is not regarded as a fishing port by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, compared with the price quoted for fish per ton at the markets, is very different.  There is a need for an inquiry into the difference between the price of fish at the point where it is landed and at the point of purchase.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would permit me to make some mention of the prospects of our fishing industry under EEC conditions but I imagine this would be outside the limits of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is glad to agree with the Deputy on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I should just like to say there will be <Col N="75" /> great concern for the fishing industry under EEC conditions if the report on fisheries included in the bulletin issued by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, published in April, 1970, is correct.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the fishing industry is high on his list of priorities when negotiations take place so that the present excellent work being done by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara can continue.  If our waters are to be opened to other members of the EEC our fishing industry will be seriously jeopardised.</P>
      <P>The league table for ports shows a welcome improvement for most ports. There was an increase in the value of landings in 25 out of the 34 ports mentioned in the report.  There was a decrease in landings in nine ports but that is an improvement on last year when there was a decrease in 11 out of the 29 ports listed.  I am sorry to see Arklow included in the list of ports which has declined.  A few years ago Arklow was one of the major fishing ports in the country but the amount of fishing now done by Arklow fishermen is very small compared with what was done in the past.</P>
      <P>No doubt the setting up of other industries in the area has resulted in a decline in the number of fishermen. While the setting up of new industries is always to be commended, it does mean a loss to the fishing industry of people with a valuable knowledge of fishing.  The industry cannot afford to lose such people.  The Minister should look into the position at that port to see if something could be done to bring young people back into the area which has always had a great fishing and seafaring tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in my own town who fish on a part-time basis but they are not being given any incentive to continue even in a part-time capacity. Some of the dockers in Wicklow supplement their income by being part-time fishermen when there is not enough dock work for them.  These fishermen have attempted to build a small shelter in which to keep their fishing equipment.  They approached both the Department and An Bord <Col N="76" /> Iascaigh Mhara and they met with no success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I just mentioned it and I hope the Minister will take note of the plight of the fishermen.  I will conclude by pointing out that any increase in the capital investment results in an increase in landings and in the value of those landings.  I hope the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary will devote as much time and energy as possible to the fishing industry because there is scope for improvement and expansion.  Exports help to offset our adverse balance of payments.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to understand why this Second Reading debate is so circumscribed.  Every Deputy who has spoken so far has complained about this.  We are seeking in this Bill to increase the money available to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara by approximately £2 million.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are responsible for the entire sea-fishing industry.  Almost every Deputy who has spoken has felt himself restricted since he was not allowed to deal with the numerous problems confronting the industry for which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is responsible. It is very difficult to have a discussion which is relevant or to contribute anything to this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That has been said by the Chair on several occasions.  I fail to understand why this House should be expected to provide this amount of money and, at the same time, be prohibited from discussing the subject matter for which this money is to be used.  This is all wrong.  The full scope of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be discussed here.  If the Minister's speech is notable for anything it is notable for what it has not given us by way <Col N="77" /> of information.  It consisted of a page and a half of typescript, non-information, looking for an increase of £2 million for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>

      <P>It must have been the shortest Second Reading speech ever in this House.  I am not saying that the Minister should be expert on the fishing industry, but he should be adequately briefed.  This is deplorable. We owe a debt of gratitude to Deputy Donal Creed for the information he has given the House.  He told us something about the up-to-date situation in the fishing industry.  We got absolutely nothing from the Ministry except a page and a half of non-information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has done a great disservice to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in producing that speech. Deputy Donal Creed went to the trouble obviously of asking An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for figures.  They are impressive figures.  Very few industries can claim to have something like a 39 per cent increase in exports and a 24 per cent increase in landings.  This is a very laudable situation.  It is certainly a situation which ought not to compel Deputies to criticise, but Deputies did criticise because they did not have that information made available to them. The Minister should have come in here and told us what the present situation is and what the plans for the future are.  There is nothing like that in this speech.  We are told nothing about the board.  Very few Deputies know anything about the board.  They do not know who the members are. They do not know when they were appointed. They do not know why they were appointed.  Outside the House I hear that such a person was appointed because he is secretary of the Fianna Fáil cumann in Donegal.  The Minister has an obligation to tell the House who the members of the board are and what special qualifications they have for the job.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us nothing about the board.  He told us nothing which would indicate who the people are who will use this money and the way in which they will use it. He told us nothing about the future plans or any extension of the plans. Here we have an extremely valuable industry but responsibility for it is fragmented and because of this it is particularly unfair that we are not allowed to go outside the narrow confines of the Bill in discussing it and that we are not allowed to deal with the problems that affect An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in using that money.  This may look as if it is criticism of the Chair but I am not criticising you, Sir, particularly: I think it is an unfortunate position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is a little book of regulations here, approved by the House, in relation to debates.  There is nothing I can do except carry out those regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>You will admit that there are unusual circumstances here where the Board of Works are responsible for harbours, the Inland Fisheries Trust responsible for some part of the fishing industry, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries responsible for another part and Bord Iascaigh Mhara responsible for yet another part. There is also local authority responsibility in relation to harbours.  It is impossible to have a proper discussion on any aspect of the fishing industry when there is all this fragmentation and when one is not allowed to cover the entire scope of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> Because of this fragmentation at least one member of this board should be from the Board of Works.  I understand there is a member from the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The various groups should be represented on this board.  I understand the fishermen are not represented nor the co-operatives.  Surely this should be rectified.  We want to know whether the people for whom we are providing this money are the best people to give us the responsible board we should have.  The view generally held is that they are not. This board could be added to with considerable advantage.</P>
    <P>Any contact I have had with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara officials impressed me very much.  Certainly, those I met were first class and within the limits imposed on them, they have done an excellent job.  Even one of the Government Deputies, Deputy O'Connor, was very critical of the whole performance of the fishing industry because he compares it with the performance in other countries in Europe.  We must all agree with this.  The main reason why we have not advanced faster is because the Government have failed over the years to provide capital.  An industry that has potential and can show in one year with a very limited amount of capital investment that it can increase its exports by 39 per cent is an industry that deserves the support of the State in a way it is not forthcoming at present.</P>
    <P>A question was asked here as to what will be the position of the industry when we get into the EEC, as we expect.  I hold this is relevant because if we are to buy boats now and put them to sea we must know that the people who get them will be able to pay for them.  Will the present set-up be able to cope with foreign competition? What degree of protection will we have to provide?  We are told that we shall have to defend the territory of the EEC.  Our territorial waters will become EEC territorial, according to the information issued to us and it will be a free-for-all among all EEC countries. This will confront our fishermen with very severe competition and we must <Col N="80" /> ask if they will be able to stand up to it.  At that point of time will we have geared them to the competition they will meet from much more experienced countries and, perhaps, better equipped fishermen?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will deal with this aspect of the matter because it is extremely important to the fishermen who have the courage&mdash;and I mean courage&mdash;to borrow large sums of up to £70,000 at a time.  These men deserve to know what the future holds for them.  So do future borrowers, and I hope we shall have many of them.</P>
    <P>We are all interested in the industry. I should say a real start was made about 1962 when we had the American survey team here.  Deputy O'Connor feels their contribution was not a great one but all the developments that have taken place since have been more or less built around their report and recommendations.  It was an extremely important start and my only criticism is that progress has been far too slow. That has not been the fault of the BIM officials who were at all times restricted by lack of money.  They never had sufficient money.  I doubt seriously if this Bill will provide sufficient money by increasing the capital available to them by £2 million.  Having regard to the size of the industry and its potential, I think we are only playing at it in giving an extra £2 million.  We should instead be providing £10 million if we were serious.  Coupled with this there should be an intensive training scheme for fishermen and an intensive promotional scheme for the industry generally.</P>
    <P>The grant and loan facilities provided in respect of boats cannot be described as anything but generous and, building on this foundation, we could have enormous progress provided the money was being made available. The information one can get is to the effect that this money is not freely available and that boats are not freely available and that training is not taking place as fast as it could and should take place if the industry were to be properly serviced.</P>
    <P>As with every other form of grant and loan there are pitfalls and a notable pitfall encountered by BIM was the <Col N="81" /> two large stern trawlers, the 110-foot vessels.  I should like the Minister to tell the House what finally happened to those trawlers and where they are now.  I think they were described as mid-water trawlers.  What is the prospect, if any, for mid-water fishing in future? I tried to probe this matter when I had some responsibility on these benches for keeping in touch with the industry and, as far as I could gather, this experimental effort with the mid-water trawler failed mainly because we had not the supporting services required.  I do not know if that is correct but I hope the Minister will be able to clarify the position and prospects.</P>
    <P>I am jumping from one thing to another because I have nothing really prepared.  Many speakers referred to imports and the fact that in the past year imports had increased to the tune of £399,000 or some substantial figure like that.  The case made was that we were losing out because we were not getting into the fish finger business.  I do not think this is a business that we should be so concerned about at present. I understand it requires considerable capital to get into that business and that when you have the equipment needed for it you must have a constant supply of fairly cheap fish.  In this country we are in a special position because with a half-hour's steaming at any time we can be fishing and what we should be exploiting is the freshness of Irish fish and our proximity to the British market and some of the continental markets.  Our policy should be high-quality, fresh fish.  The time has not arrived for us to consider seriously spending large amounts of money in the fish finger business.</P>
    <P>Even if we must import fish fingers and if people eat fish fingers, at least this accustoms them to eating fish and we should have nothing to complain about in that regard as long as we are selling our own fish and our exports are increasing as substantially as indicated by the figures released by BIM over the weekend.  It is very understandable that BIM should be concerned about the criticism made and lack of information available to us and that they should produce this document. <Col N="82" /> It gives us an idea of the up-to-date position.</P>
    <P>What also impresses me about the fishing industry is that our landings were less than £3 million, but our exports alone were something over £3½ million.  The calculated value of the industry to the country is £6 million. The added value here is obviously enormous.  It is very difficult to find industries like this.  The Government have overlooked the importance of an industry in which we do not have to import raw materials and in which we have such an amount of employment and added value without input, so to speak.  We have only to reap the harvest. It may be a difficult harvesting operation and certainly is in bad weather and it has to be carried out in all weathers.</P>
    <P>When I had some responsibility for fisheries from these benches I went to the trouble of seeing what trawlermen went through.  It is normal, certainly in Dingle in which Deputy O'Connor is interested, for the men to go out at 5.30 in the morning.  I went out with them at 5.30 in the morning and came back at 5.30 in the evening.  There were five people on board that vessel.  I do not clearly recollect now the actual figures but I know that their income was not by any means enormous.  It was quite a modest income.  It was sufficient to pay the men on board their shares&mdash;and their shares were reasonable enough&mdash;and to enable the captain to be happy about his repayments. It is a hazardous and tough life. It will not be easy to attract people to it unless the rewards are very attractive.  It will not be easy to get people to work those sort of hours. When a man goes out at 5.30 in the morning and comes back at 5.30 in the evening he needs a rest.  He does not feel like doing anything hilarious after that.  Nevertheless, there is an immense attraction in that life and to me it was a most interesting experience. Fishing provides employment for quite a number of people.</P>
    <P>I would have expected the Minister to tell us the progress that was made in the past year or two in the fishing industry.  How many people are employed in the industry at the moment? <Col N="83" /> Where are they employed?  I would have expected him to tell us whether there is a suitable insurance scheme for these men, whether there is a pension scheme for them, how life might be made more comfortable for them when they are out at sea and when they get back into port, and whether there are sufficient facilities available to them to make the most of their catch when it is landed.  I heard complaints in Dingle and elsewhere that when there is a successful landing of fish, when there is a plentiful supply, the price drops and there is a slump price.  It drops because they have not got the proper storage facilities in which to keep the fish until the glut season passes and prices rise again.</P>
    <P>All of us should be concerned to see how the incomes of the people who catch the fish can be improvel.  The disparity between the price the consumer has to pay and the price the fishermen get has been mentioned by more than one speaker.  This is worthy of investigation to see where the difference is, who is reaping the middlemen's reward and if it is excessive. There is a big difference between handing fish over the counter and going out to fish in all weathers.  The largest reward should go to the men who catch the fish and not to the man who passes it on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister how many vessels we have fishing. Deputy O'Connor mentioned the fact that Norway has 40,000 vessels.  How many vessels have we?  How many more did we get in the past year?  What progress is being made in this field and what are the future prospects?  How many vessels do we intend to put afloat in the coming 12 months and in the coming five years?  Have we any targets? What is the training programme for people to man these vessels?  How far have we advanced?  This is all part of the effort for which this money is being provided.  Much more information should be available to us when we are discussing this Bill.</P>
    <P>Members on this side of the House are concerned about the number of people employed in the industry and the type of employment they have.  They <Col N="84" /> are also concerned about how conditions can be improved and how the industry can be made to attract more people into it.  We are also concerned about the constitution of the board. Who are the members of the board? What are they paid?  Can the board be improved?  What are the members doing?  What are they not doing?  What are their plans for the future?  The Minister should have told us these things for this Second Reading debate.</P>
    <P>There is very little more one can say.  We are prevented from talking about the facilities for the boats when they land in the harbours.  We are prevented from talking about the problems of protecting our territorial waters, our fishing waters.  I am impressed with the progress made in the past 12 months.  I do not know enough about the enormous improvement in the herring catches.  I wonder is this an unusual season?  Could we have an exceptionally bad herring catch next year regardless of the number of boats?  An increase in the region of 45 per cent is enormous.  I think the increase in exports was 53 per cent in the case of herrings.  Could the Minister explain this?  Are there exceptional circumstances? Is it due to increased landing power or is it due to weather and other conditions of which most of us here are not aware?</P>
    <P>There has also been an improvement in landings and exports of shell fish.  To what exactly does the Minister attribute all these improvements?  This is a question which is of considerable interest to us all.  This is an industry with enormous potential but the Govvernment have shown their lack of confidence in the industry over the years by their failure to provide sufficient money to do everything that was required: to buy boats and the landing gear, and to provide the training facilities and the repair servicing facilities. Other Deputies have complained that fishermen have to wait for six or eight months for a spare engine or a spare part.  This is incompetence of a very high degree when people are depending on this industry for their livelihood. In many cases they are depending on it not only for their livelihood but also to pay back the money they borrowed. <Col N="85" /> They are working very hard to pay it back.  This industry requires a good deal more attention and a good deal more investment.  Since the Bill before us proposes to make £2 million more available to the industry I certainly am anxious to support it.  The only thing wrong is this £2 million is still quite inadequate if we are to do the job that requires to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading the Minister's speech one comes to the conclusion that this is purely an enabling Bill.  It is welcome news anyway that the Government recognise the fact that we need more capital ploughed into the fishing industry.  We have about 2,000 miles of fishing foreshore in which we have very good fishing.  The proof of that is that we have half of Europe there most of the year round&mdash; certainly whenever the seasonal catches occur.  Some of these foreign vessels have very much better gear than we have been able to provide.  In Bally-cotton, County Cork, a few years ago, I saw a craft that could be described as a floating factory.  How can our fisheries people contend with such competition?  The craft available from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has been such that, when the fish is caught, it must be delivered straight away.  It appears that the principal function of BIM is to lend money to suitable people engaged in fishing so that they may run their business more efficiently and get bigger catches.  My constituency is a maritime one but I have not noticed any great advance in this industry to bring us into line with overseas competitors.</P>
      <P>As mentioned by a previous Deputy, we shall be sharing our territorial waters with other countries in the not too distant future when we come into economic alliance with them.  Unless our fishing industry is greatly advanced and augmented, ours will be the Cinderella of the European fishing fleet.  One cannot describe £2 million as grandiose.  As far as I read the position, the total investment in Irish fishing is £5 million.  It seems to me that the Government are not taking the position seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spend any amount of money setting up non-nationals in industry here <Col N="86" /> and, as often as not, the raw material for these industries is not available in this country.  Here, we have the raw material in abundance around our shores.  Perhaps we are richer in that respect than practically any other country in the world because our waters have not been over-fished.  Even Iceland, right out in the Atlantic, is over-fished.  That country has managed to sustain and support its economy purely from fishing.  I wonder what would happen if, overnight.  we had to fall back on our fishing industry: we should find ourselves in Queer Street straight away.</P>
    <P>A great deal more than £2 million could have been made available without any substantial risk to the Exchequer.  BIM seems to be the be-all and end-all of the fishing industry.  It is unfortunate that all matters appertaining to fisheries seem tied up with four or five different Departments.  We are, therefore, restricted by the rules of the House, which I always observe, so that we are not free to have an open debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill.  Fianna Fáil are rather good at introducing enabling Bills.  It seems their hobby-horse over the past few years.  The Minister did not give us some idea of a plan for the future.  Is he saying to BIM, in effect: &ldquo;You may borrow an extra £2 million: do what you like with it&rdquo;?  The money will be available from the taxpayer's pocket for the servicing of that loan and surely the taxpayers are entitled to a statement on the overall plan?  I have long felt that our fishing industry is not the particular interest of anyone.  That is borne out by the fact that it has been changing about between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Possibly it is more satisfactory to have it tied to the latter Department.  Our major exports of fish are to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I fear that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are not really vitally interested in our fishing industry. This industry is a vital and expandable part of our economy.  Possibly it is capable of more rapid expansion than any other sector of industry coming under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have a forward-looking <Col N="87" /> plan for our fishing industry. If we sign on the dotted line for entry into EEC, we shall have the entire fishing fleets of other countries fishing within our territorial waters and snapping up the catches: to some extent, that is happening even now.  The North Sea has been fished to a standstill with the most up-to-date gear. Even though it is fully protected, there is virtually nothing in the way of fish left there.  The only fruitful fishing grounds left are those around Ireland. Our waters are a source of fish not only for ourselves but for Europe, as well, if we enter the EEC: even at the moment, our fishing grounds seem to be a free-for-all.</P>
    <P>I have seen craft from various countries fishing in our waters and the craft are much more advanced than any we have.  I advise BIM to concentrate on a more up-to-date type of vessel.  For too long, we have put up with craft that can go out only in moderate or good weather.  Such craft take a tremendously long time, relatively speaking, to reach the fishing ground and its productive capacity is probably one-tenth of that which other countries are capable of putting into their fishing waters.</P>
    <P>For too long we have put up with that sort of thing.  For too long we have regarded sea fishing as being a semi-inshore occupation.  To get the big fish one must go out quite a distance and one must have a seaworthy craft.  There is no use going out in small, round tub-nosed craft, such as we have had for fishing.  As soon as there is a force four wind one must run for harbour straight away with that type of vessel.</P>
    <P>We are all very interested in knowing what the position is and what the Minister intends to do and he should give us some idea of what the plans for the future are.  From the little I know of the fishing industry, and I have been interested in the sea all my life, I feel the first thing we should do is double the size of our boats.  Encouragement should be given to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to have boats of the floating factory type which can freeze, cure and finish their product and land it straight <Col N="88" /> away and then go off again and start from the beginning.</P>
    <P>Co-operatives exist in certain parts of the country which are able to deal with the fish.  I understand they are being encouraged by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  We have in my county&mdash; Deputy Browne represents it too; I do not know whether he is interested in fishing, perhaps we will hear him in a few moments&mdash;an extremely up-to-date co-operative society at Kilmore which was started under the greatest difficulties. Every sort of restriction was imposed on the people who started it, not by the Department, but by those who were responsible for transport, when they were arranging to sell that fish at the nearest market.  They are operating successfully.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will, with this money, take a more active interest in the co-operative system.  I gather their function apart from supplying boats to catch the fish is to supply the means and the wherewithal to sell the fish and process it.</P>
    <P>These are some of the things we would like to know.  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, fresh and new to his job, his Parliamentary Secretary sitting beside him straining at the leash as well, will when replying give this House the information he failed to give us in his opening statement.</P>

      <P>If I were to attempt to deal with all the points that have been raised by Deputies of the Opposition parties on this short little Bill we would probably be here for quite a long time.  One has only to recall the last two contributions, from Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Clinton, to contemplate the impossibility of such a task.  While Deputy Clinton was on his feet he must have asked a hundred questions straight off the top of his head about the fishing industry in general. He took me to task for not giving a general survey of the whole fishing industry in my introductory speech on the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was remarkable the discrepancies that were noticeable between the <Col N="89" /> approaches of the various Deputies, especially of Fine Gael, to the same question.  When Deputy Creed was speaking he began by admitting that he did not know a great deal about fisheries.  Perhaps I should emulate him in that regard and say straight away that I do not either.  What he found scarcely credible was that a fisherman can buy a very expensive boat, and is put in the position of being able to buy it by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, a boat that may cost up to £60,000, and pay his crew and also pay off the cost of the boat within seven or eight years, and provide a good living for his crew as well.  Deputy Creed thought this was surprising to the point of being incredible.  Let us contrast that attitude with that of his colleague, Deputy Begley from Kerry. His approach to the general problem was very depressing.  He thinks boats are being given to people who are not fishermen at all and that people who are fishermen have to give up their boats.  He said, for some reason best known to himself, that there are boats rotting away in Arklow.  I should like to say, in this connection, that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not give any assistance to people who are not fishermen themselves and who have not long experience as fishermen and who have not got skippers' tickets.  From Deputy Begley's contribution I got the impression he was under this general impression.</P>
    <P>Something similar to that was said by Deputy Murphy of the Labour Party who painted a peculiar picture of people who stay ashore comfortably while somebody else goes off to fish and face the rigours and dangers of the ocean.  By some strange trick that he did not quite explain, it is the fellows who stay comfortably at home who, as he said, draw the dividends.  While he was speaking I asked him to elaborate on this and to explain to us if he could how this happened but he did not do this.</P>
    <P>To return to the themes of Deputy Begley and Deputy Creed&mdash;one wondering at the profitability of fishing and the other suggesting that fishing is a dead loss and that fishermen had to give up the business of fishing <Col N="90" /> altogether&mdash;Deputy Creed will appreciate that fishing is somewhat like the business of farming.  In fact, it is very like it.  It is largely a question of efficiency and good management and the application of good business practices, a considerable one being of course staying at the job. This is the reason why there has been such remarkable progress in the last few years in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned fish imports and the high figure of £1.8 million for fish imports of one kind or another.  This covers a very wide field &mdash;tinned salmon, sardines, fish fingers and various kinds of ready-to-use foods.  As far as I know, products of that kind are not produced in any quantity at home for the home market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley, too, suggested that the crab industry was being neglected and dying away.  The contrary is the case.  There are several factories in the business of processing this fish at present.  Deputy Murphy had a two-stage speech.  He reported progress the last day we discussed this Bill and he came back renewed and reinvigorated today to resume the discussion. He said a number of comforting things and a number of astonishing things.</P>
    <P>I liked the Deputy's offer to take a paternal interest in myself and in Deputy Fahey, recognising us as neophytes in the business of fishing.  I was very pleased and comforted at that stage feeling I would have the strength and support of an old seadog like Deputy Murphy.  As the Deputy continued he displayed some remarkable gaps in his knowledge.  He said there was no organisation of fishermen.  I was informed that there are about 17 fishermen's co-operatives around the coast.  The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society are always actively trying to organise new ones. I have a suspicion that Deputy Murphy does not like co-operatives.</P>
    <P>We were discussing co-operatives of a different kind a week or two ago at Question Time.  The Deputy seemed to feel that co-operatives can readily be turned into steam-roller combines, as he called them, which would crush out the small man.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> This business of the development of the fishing industry, like the development of co-operatives in agriculture, aims at the support of people engaged in the industry.  If it did not provide an expanding employment and a better chance for the people in the industry it would not be any good. The function of the co-operative, as Deputy Murphy seems to forget, is just that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy became almost lyrical about the conditions which obtained years ago&mdash;I took it to mean that the Deputy was speaking about the conditions decades ago&mdash;when the coasts were surrounded by happy fishermen who were making a very profitable livelihood.  Then An Bord Iascaigh Mhara began to work and poured money into the industry, and now there are fewer people employed in fishing and less fish caught.  All the same, the Deputy would like to see more money put into the fishing industry.  I do not understand this.  I was comforted to hear the Deputy, as he approached the end of his discourse, saying he is in favour of private enterprise and in favour of people who live by the sea investing money in the purchase of fishing boats and in the promotion of the fishing industry generally.  I was in doubt about this when we had the discussion about the people who stay ashore and take it &ldquo;cushy&rdquo; while the fishermen brave the horrors of the Atlantic weather.  When the chips were down, and Deputy Murphy was coming to the end of his discourse, he plumped in favour of private enterprise, like the good socialist he is.</P>

      <P>Deputy Begley suggested that loans were given to people who never fished.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not give grants or loans for boats except to people who have skippers' tickets.  It is no harm to repeat that.  There are certain propaganda noises laid down like a barrage as a background to discussion of this kind.  This is one of the points which come up.  It is said that there are people in the background who seem to pick up this money while the people who do the fishing are deprived of it. If this is so, the statement should be substantiated.  If this is not so, it should not be made.</P>
      <P>More than one Deputy raised the question of the difference between the landed price of fish and the retail price charged.  This is obviously very important to the people who catch the fish and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should, and do, in fact, exercise vigilance in this regard.  It is part of the business of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see that this particular aspect of the fishing industry is kept in control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Clinton who asked a huge number of questions in a short speech&mdash;asked how many fishing vessels were operating at the present time.  The number I have got is 1,820.  The number of <Col N="93" /> men employed solely in fishing is 1,687 and the people who are partially engaged in fishing number 3,756.  The likelihood is that both figures will increase rapidly in the future.  The interest in, and demand for, new boats around the coast is bigger than it ever was.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned the training of skippers.  The position is that a new fishery school at Green-castle should be ready in about a year. There is provision for £80,000 in this year's Estimate for it.</P>
    <P>Fishery protection was mentioned by a few Deputies.  I have conceded on a few occasions that the fishery protection service is inadequate.  We are trying to do something about it.  Fishery protection is a very expensive thing.  If we want to have a really efficient fishery protection service it must be paid for.  In our situation we have to provide this as quickly as we can but in such a manner that it will not compete with other important social aims. A number of Deputies mentioned fisheries in the EEC.  As many of them probably know, the EEC have never themselves produced a fishery policy.</P>
    <P>It should hardly be necessary to assure the House that in any negotiations concerning the EEC, Irish fishing will be regarded as something that must be guarded for the use and benefit of Ireland generally.  I do not think there is any immediate necessity to say anything more about it than that.  We are very conscious of this vital necessity for the future and we propose to guard it vigilantly.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made to the size of fishing vessels.  I gather that the average size of these vessels has been increasing gradually during the years and that many of them are now 75 feet in length.  Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde mentioned the desirability of factory ships and of how useful these would be to our fishing industry.  This is probably so but while our fishing industry is growing rapidly we have not yet, in so far as I know, reached the factory ship stage.  Many points were raised during the debate which, with respect, I consider to be irrelevant to <Col N="94" /> the Bill before the House but I have endeavoured to deal with the relevant points as best I could.</P>

      <P>I move. &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of the Bill is to give formal legal sanction to the &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre at Shanganagh, County Dublin, which was established in August, 1968. It was formerly Coláiste Moibhí and has extensive grounds.  It is used for the accommodation of offenders either from St. Patrick's Institution, North Circular Road, Dublin, or from the prisons who seem likely to benefit from the conditions in operation there and who can thus be helped to become useful members of society.  The whole atmosphere is based on trust.  Movement about the house and grounds is not subject to close supervision.  Games and recreation are adequately provided for.  The youths sleep in unlocked dormitory cubicles.  Letters and parcels are not opened; lengthy, unsupervised visits from parents and relatives are permitted and the staff wear ordinary clothes.  The lack of formal restrictions <Col N="95" /> is designed to foster a sense of responsibility and self-control.  The number of youths in residence at any given time is small enough to make it possible for the staff to develop a reasonably close relationship with them.  A house-mastering system operates under which certain officers accept special responsibility for groups of eight to ten youths.  The object is to produce an atmosphere in which individual youths will be encouraged to discuss their problems with the officer concerned.</P>
    <P>At times there has been difficulty in filling the available accommodation in Shanganagh owing to the lack of reliable material in St. Patrick's and the prisons.  Not every prisoner has the basic stability to allow of his being sent to an open centre like Shanganagh. Careful selection beforehand is necessary in addition to a degree of supervision after arrival.  The number of absconders since the centre was established has been quite low.  Last year, for example, only seven out of 145 who were sent there absconded.</P>
    <P>In the period immediately following the setting up of Shanganagh the main efforts were necessarily devoted to such matters as recruiting suitable staff, developing the necessary administrative facilities, establishing the broad features of the regime, clearing the ground and so on.  Instruction in the three R's is given daily.  A vocational teacher provides instruction in woodwork. An artisan officer is also responsible for this instruction and supervises in the woodworking shop and making of furniture for the centre and the execution of running repairs.  A good deal of reconstruction has been carried out by the detainees.  A painting, decorating and glazing shop has now been established and instruction in car maintenance and car driving will be given in the near future.  Permanent workshops are expected to be erected by early next year.</P>
    <P>A grading system has been introduced to provide incentives for the detainees and to reward their efforts rather than their accomplishments. Under this system marks are awarded at regular staff conferences for good conduct and industry and those who <Col N="96" /> progress to the special grade receive additional privileges, such as extra home visits and attendance at football matches.  The scheme has operated reasonably well so far.  Another innovation has been the grant of a few days pre-discharge leave for longer term inmates.  The leave is given at least a month before discharge to enable them to renew home contacts and to arrange for employment on release.  It is of particular help to youths living outside Dublin.  This concession, incidentally, has never been abused.  Shanganagh is of course still at a developing stage and I shall not hesitate to introduce further departures from normal &ldquo;prison&rdquo; practice in the light of further experience if their adoption would be conducive to rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>It is too early to attempt to assess the success of the Shanganagh experiment. Reconviction rates are being compiled but they will not have any real significance until figures for a minimum &ldquo;follow up&rdquo; period of two or three years become available.  Apart from this, there are always limits to the extent to which reconviction rates can be reliably used to measure the results of particular forms of treatment. An offender who goes straight after release does not necessarily do so because of what happened to him while he was in custody and, on the other hand, just because an offender comes again before the courts it does not follow that he has gained no benefit from his treatment while in detention, especially when the reconviction is for a relatively minor or for an isolated offence.  Moreover, in the case of Shanganagh in particular, it can be said that of necessity the offenders sent there are those who are more likely than the average prisoner to prove susceptible to reformative influences. But clearly the full potentialities of Shanganagh have not yet been realised and I expect to develop them a good deal further during the coming year.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill.  The provisions relating to the setting up of Shanganagh are those in sections 2 to 5.  Section 2 is the enabling section.  It empowers the Minister for Justice to establish places of this kind with the object of <Col N="97" /> promoting the rehabilitation of offenders. I may say that the provision of further places is not contemplated in the immediate future and certainly not an establishment of the size of Shanganagh.  The provision is a very flexible one, however, and could be used for making available, say, a small house in the community where prisoners who had advanced to the stage of daily working release could be accommodated.  A development of this kind was recently inaugurated in Britain on an experimental basis and is being at present assessed.  I shall certainly consider a similar experiment here when the results of the assessment are available.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 5 are consequential provisions and I do not think it necessary on this stage of the Bill to go into detail on them.  Section 6 proposes to reduce the maximum age for persons who are remanded or committed to St. Patrick's Institution from 21 to 19. Under the present law offenders aged between 16 and 21 may be detained in St. Patrick's Institution.  For some time past there has been a feeling that this age group, including as it does both young adolescents and experienced men, is too wide.  As segregation is not possible in St. Patrick's, many of the young offenders are liable to come under the influence of some of these older inmates.  I do not suggest that all inmates in the 19 to 21 group are in this category or, indeed, that the younger inmates are all inexperienced. In fact, some of the older inmates, especially those from country districts, are in many respects less sophisticated than the 16 and 17 year olds, almost all of whom have a number of previous convictions.  Accordingly, though I am proposing that offenders in the 19-21 category who have to be sentenced to detention should now be committed to prison, I think it desirable to retain the power given by section 3 of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, of transferring from prison into St. Patrick's offenders in the 19 to 21 group who might be with advantage detained in St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>Here may I digress for a moment to fill in some of the background to St. Patrick's.  It was formerly a borstal <Col N="98" /> institution to which offenders could be sent for a minimum period of two years, with provision for their earlier release on licence depending on their progress while in detention.  In 1956 the institution was transferred from Clonmel to Dublin, because of the decline in the number of youths receiving borstal-type sentences.  It was located in portion of Mountjoy female prison which was adapted for that purpose. The practice had always been to transfer from prison to the institution suitable offenders under 21 who were serving relatively short sentences, where it was thought that this might be to their advantage.</P>
    <P>After the transfer of the institution to Dublin the number of those transfers increased substantially and the institution took on more and more the character of a centre for the detention of young offenders serving short terms.  This trend was accentuated by the passing of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  That Act empowered the courts to commit offenders in the 16-21 age group directly to St. Patrick's.  The borstal-type sentence of two years then rapidly fell into disuse and the number of direct committals to St. Patrick's of offenders serving varying terms increased consistently until in the last two years or so the institution has often been full to capacity.  The extent of the change is shown by the figures. In 1957 the daily average in St. Patrick's was 58.  Last year it was 195.</P>
    <P>The growing pressure on accommodation made it necessary last year to encroach further on the cell accommodation remaining for the female prison.  With numbers remaining consistently at such high levels, it is difficult to provide adequate space for workshops and other facilities.  Some relief will be obtained when Mountjoy female prison is transferred to premises which it is proposed to erect on the site of the present place of detention at Marlborough House, Glasnevin. Marlborough House is expected to be closed this year on the opening of the new preventive centre at Finglas. The erection of a female prison, which will in any event take some years to complete, will still not leave sufficient space for workshops and other training <Col N="99" /> facilities in St. Patrick's if the present daily averages of 200 or so continue. However, the effect of reducing the maximum age for committal, as proposed in section 6, will be to secure a reduction, in the short term at all events, in the present excessive population. I say &ldquo;in the short term&rdquo; advisedly because, having regard to world trends, it would be unwise to ignore the possibility of a further increase in juvenile crime.  I propose, with this possibility in mind, to continue the search for a large enough site convenient to Dublin, where most of the youths in St. Patrick's reside, and suitable for a modern detention centre for young offenders.  It goes without saying that the cost of such a centre would be extremely high.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, a sustained effort is being made to improve the existing facilities.  I expect to appoint a psychologist shortly, whose main task it will be to prepare and supervise an educational programme geared to the individual needs of each inmate.  The assembly of electric lamps commenced last December.  An additional welfare officer and a clerical assistant are being recruited to the staff of the institution and I expect a considerable improvement in the employment prospects of many of the inmates&mdash;so important for their rehabilitation&mdash;to result.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that provision is made in subsection (1) of section 6 for the section to be brought into operation on a date to be appointed by order of the Minister for Justice. The reason for this is that the proposed reduction in the age of committal to St. Patrick's is likely to lead to an increase of 50 or so in the number of young offenders in Mountjoy. To maintain the requisite degree of segregation between these offenders and the adult prisoners some reconstruction will be required.  It is necessary to defer the coming into operation of this section until the work has been completed, which is expected to be some time next year.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is designed to relieve any overcrowding that may occur from time to time in St. Patrick's.  As I have mentioned, overcrowding first manifested <Col N="100" /> itself two years ago.  Though it was relieved temporarily by the establishment of Shanganagh, the position continued to deteriorate until by early last year the institution was again regularly becoming full to capacity.  It became necessary to release inmates temporarily before their normal date of discharge in order to make room for fresh committals.  The overcrowding could not have been relieved by transferring some of the inmates to prison because, as the law stands, a person sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's cannot be transferred to prison unless he is found by the visiting committee to St. Patrick's to be incorrigible or to be exercising a bad influence on other inmates.  Subsequently, the numbers in St. Patrick's dropped but they have again increased substantially.  Section 7 therefore proposes to empower the Minister for Justice to transfer detainees from St. Patrick's to prison during periods of overcrowding.  Deputies will notice that it is provided that the section shall not operate except during such periods as the Minister, after consultation with the visiting committee, specifies from time to time.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered the main provisions of the Bill but if there are any particular aspects which Deputies would like me to clarify, I shall endeavour to do so when replying.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail myself of the opportunity presented by the introduction of this Bill to review the present position in relation to the treatment of offenders and to look ahead at probable future developments. Before embarking on the review, however, I think I should make a few preliminary points about which I believe there is general agreement. First of all, there is no easy or generalised solution to the problem of rehabilitating offenders.  Many of those committed to prison, even the youngest, come from home or environmental conditions which are themselves conducive to criminal behaviour. Many are of low intelligence and a high proportion are educationally backward.  They are often emotionally disturbed and socially inadequate.  The great majority are sentenced to very short terms.  The average term spent <Col N="101" /> in St. Patrick's, for example, is no more than four months.  The first few weeks are usually spent in &ldquo;settling down&rdquo; and during the last few weeks the offender is naturally inclined to think mainly of his approaching release.  These considerations make it particularly difficult to provide beneficial training in any depth and the position is aggravated by the fact that offenders are committed and discharged on widely different dates. Moreover, the environment of an insitution is basically unsuitable for encouraging individuals to become adequate and responsible members of normal society.  It is an entirely artificial community and the high degree of uniformity which is unavoidable militates against the development of reponsibility and of a person's individual character.</P>
    <P>It is against the background of these practical considerations that one must measure the possibilities of progress. Nonetheless, in the last decade substantial improvements have, in fact, been made.  The Criminal Justice Act of 1960, which authorised the grant of temporary release, is rightly regarded as having initiated a most significant step forward.  Used at the beginning mainly in compassionate cases such as those arising on death or injury of an immediate relative, the temporary release provisions have been increasingly availed of to a highly sophisticated degree to aid rehabilitation by releasing prisoners towards the end of their sentences to take up employment.  The establishment of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders resulted in numerous reforms. The most notable were perhaps the appointment of prison welfare officers and the setting up of the corrective training unit and hostel in Mountjoy.  The particular value of this committee was that it enabled the whole field of prevention of crime and treatment of offenders to be continuously appraised.  It is this kind of continuous appraisal which in my opinion is necessary to keep conditions in this field in line with improving standards and informed opinion both within our our own community and internationally. This unobstrusive and unspectacular, <Col N="102" /> but constant and critical, review has been maintained.  A number of developments in the treatment of offenders in our penal institutions have been completed recently or are projected for completion in the near future and I shall mention the main ones, starting with those which concern the employment of prisoners.</P>
    <P>The provision of suitable employment for persons in custody is, of course, one of special difficulty.  Ideally, they should be given purposeful work suited to their individual capacities in conditions which will approximate to those in ordinary commercial employments. They should earn normal wages and their earnings should be used to maintain their dependants, pay for their own maintenance in prison and provide savings on discharge and, perhaps, a sum to be applied towards restitution in appropriate cases.  For a variety of reasons this ideal situation has not been, and indeed cannot be, attained except, perhaps, in the wealthiest countries and then only with selected prisoners in specialised establishments. Many prisoners are unemployable by any commercial standard. Either they are simply disinclined to work or they have never been in regular employment or, very often, they lack the ability to adapt themselves to different work.  The necessity to maintain security limits the kind of prisoners who can be employed in particular operations and affects also the lay-out of workshops, making it difficult to introduce modern manufacturing methods.  The present gratuity paid to prisoners&mdash;7s a week&mdash;cannot be regarded as anything more than pocket money.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of employment and training as a factor in rehabilitation, special attention has been given to improving the present facilities in Mountjoy.  Within recent months a training class in painting, wallpapering and glazing has been opened in the corrective training unit and is operating satisfactorily.  After a short period of instruction the trainees are given work on the routine maintenance of the prison.  A similar class is being provided in Shanganagh. Instruction in car driving and running <Col N="103" /> repairs, which at present is given only in St. Patrick's, is being extended to Mountjoy and Shanganagh.  Recently two further employments commenced in Mountjoy&mdash;rugmaking from remnants of sheepskins and slippermaking.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most potentially valuable development, however, is likely to result from a series of discussions with AnCO&mdash;the Industrial Training Authority&mdash;regarding the provision in our penal establishments of the most suitable training for industrial employment. At present active consideration is being given to proposals for three training courses.  The first proposal is that training in semi-skilled metal work should be provided initially in Mountjoy and later for the younger offenders in St. Patrick's and Shanganagh though in a more limited way because of safety considerations.  The proposed metal workshop would supply training in engineering skills (turning, milling, welding and grinding) of a semi-skilled nature.  Another proposal is for a training course in site development for Shanganagh.  This would cover such matters as trenching, drainage, surfacing, block laying and elementary building and would enable the boys to acquire a variety of constructional semi-skills in a short time. AnCO have also worked out a course in radio and television installation and the repair of common faults.  The course has been specially designed for boys of low potential.</P>
    <P>These are some of the principal projects in the employment field.  These aspects of prisoner training will be further emphasised with the appointment of the psychologist who will be in a position to advise on the job attitudes of particular prisoners.  The appointment of an additional welfare officer to St. Patrick's and of another to Mountjoy, with the necessary clerical assistance, and the introduction of welfare officers to Shanganagh, Portlaoise and Limerick will further improve the situation.  I expect that the additional welfare officers and clerical assistants will have been recruited by the Civil Service Commissioners by the autumn. Already the contribution made by the present welfare officers is considerable <Col N="104" /> and particularly in the provision of employment for suitable prisoners towards the end of their sentences.  Last year, for example, 46 prisoners in Mountjoy were temporarily released to employment.  The continued willingness of employers to take on prisoners depends to a great extent on the care spent beforehand in training and selecting prisoners who are likely to prove good and trustworthy employees. So far the conduct of prisoners who have been released to employment has, with a few exceptions, been quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>An extensive building and maintenance programme is in operation for the current year.  The exercise yards in Mountjoy have been asphalted.  The reception building there is scheduled for reroofing and for complete renovation this year.  A new building will be needed to house the hospital and psychiatric unit so as to make room for the additional young offenders who, as I mentioned earlier, are likely to be committed to Mountjoy when the age limit to St. Patrick's is reduced under the provisions of section 6 of this Bill.  In Limerick, the female officers' quarters will be demolished and replaced.  In Portlaoise the recreation hall, which was extensively damaged during the rioting on 31st December last, is being restored.  In Shanganagh, training workshops are scheduled for erection this year at the back of the main building.  These will provide facilities for instruction in metal work and plumbing, car maintenance and repair, electronics, building construction and painting, papering and glazing.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the prison diet.  I may say, at the outset, that I am satisfied that the present diet is wholesome and nourishing.  It is of good quality and adequate in quantity.  As Deputy Tunney, who is a member of the Visiting Committee in St. Patrick's Institution, said in this House last December, it is as good as that received by many a breadwinner in our community.  Nonetheless it must be conceded that it is monotonous. The diet has been receiving particular attention in recent times and a number of improvements have been <Col N="105" /> made.  For example, in Mountjoy a bread slicing machine has been installed and heated food trolleys have been provided to keep the mid-day meal warm.  The diet itself has been improved in a number of minor respects.  Financial provision has been made this year for other improvements in the diet and the report of a dietician on the present diet is at present being examined.  The kitchen equipment in all prison establishments during the present year will be extensively improved. In particular deep friers will be installed so that chips can be prepared and fish introduced into the diet.</P>
    <P>The training of prison officers has also been receiving attention.  Recently this training has been integrated with the general scheme for training operated under the supervision of the training officer for the Department of Justice.  So far some 50 prison officers have been included in various courses.  A suitable basic training course for recruit prison officers is being prepared and in this connection I have arranged for this officer to visit Britain to study the training for basic prison staff provided there. A course for the officers in Shanganagh is being arranged with the Department of Psychology, UCD.  It will deal with the particular problems of young offenders.  Other courses of this kind are proposed for officers in St. Patrick's Institution.  I do not exclude the possibility of providing pre-service training for prison officers but normally prison officers are recruited in small numbers at irregular intervals and this makes the organisation of pre-service training impracticable except at extravagant cost.</P>
    <P>Here may I say that the quality of any service is only as good as that of the people who provide it.  The prison service is no exception.  It requires of the staff qualities of sympathy and understanding and, where necessary, firmness and control.  I believe our service has these qualities to a high degree and I shall endeavour to promote training schemes to develop them to the greatest practicable extent.  The loyalty and discipline of the service was impressively shown towards the end of last year when disturbances occurred in Mountjoy and Portlaoise and I am <Col N="106" /> happy to pay tribute here to all the officers concerned some of whom were injured.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the administrative efficiency of the prison service have followed the recent setting up of a working group of governers and headquarters officers.  The group have also the task of modernising the existing rules and regulations relating to prisons and the accounting instructions but, up to the present, they have concentrated mainly on the co-ordination of efforts to improve the functioning of the service in several important and practical respects.</P>
    <P>Last year the Catholic chaplaincy services to the Dublin prisons and institutions was reorganised.  A full-time head chaplain was appointed and also a full-time residential chaplain in Shanganagh.  Last year, too, arrangements were made for clerical students from All Hallows, as part of their pastoral training, to visit Mountjoy regularly and to assist the head chaplain. We also have, of course, part-time Church of Ireland and Presbyterian chaplains.  Whenever we have prisoners of other religions, their spiritual needs are catered for by visits from ministers of the religions concerned.</P>
    <P>So far I have been dealing with institutional forms of treatment of offenders.  The non-institutional forms, of which probation and after-care are the principal ones, have come into greater prominence in recent times, partly because of a feeling that first offenders, particularly in the younger age groups, should not normally be sentenced to detention and partly, perhaps, because the difficulties in the way of rehabilitation by institutional methods have become more widely recognised.</P>
    <P>Last year the existing probation and after-care service was thoroughly investigated. As a result of that investigation I am satisfied that the service is inadequate and that it needs to be expanded considerably and thoroughly reorganised.  The expansion will call for a big increase in the present staff in Dublin and for an extension of the official probation and after-care service to the country generally.  New <Col N="107" /> senior supervisory posts will be created and extra clerical assistance provided to improve the efficiency of the service.</P>
    <P>A substantial increase in the number of welfare officers assigned to the prisons, St. Patrick's and Shanganagh, is also necessary and I have already given details of the additional appointments being made in these establishments. I attach great importance to a recommendation in the report of the investigation that a central headquarters should be provided for the Dublin service which will be reasonably convenient to the courts and have proper equipment and amenities for interviewing clients in private.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that the existing Dublin probation service is understaffed, I would not feel justified in appointing the full total of additional probation officers in Dublin until proper office accommodation has been provided for them.  Arrangements to provide this accommodation are now in train.  In the meantime, the Civil Service Commissioners are being asked to recruit as soon as possible an additional eight welfare officers and four clerical assistants and I am having a senior welfare officer appointed to the Dublin probation service.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that these appointments are being used as an interim measure pending the provision of proper accommodation in Dublin for the probation officers and that I propose that by next year the existing staff of Dublin probation officers will be increased from six to 13, with eight additional officer doing probation and prison welfare work in the provinces. I have strengthened the headquarters staff in my Department to undertake the reorganisation and expansion of the service.</P>
    <P>In the course of reorganising the probation and after-care service, I expect that every effort will be made to utilise voluntary workers to the fullest extent, subject to their being carefully selected and to their working under the supervision of the official welfare officers.  I attach a great deal of importance to the involvement of volunteers in the work of rehabilitating <Col N="108" /> offenders.  Neither now nor in the foreseeable future can the community afford to put on a paid service to the extent that would be utilised if it were there.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from this consideration, it would be unwise not to use the services of dedicated persons in the community who are prepared to devote some of their time and talents to this form of social work.  The value of volunteers has been increasingly recognised by probation officers in Britain and there are now over 1,200 working actively in conjunction with the probation and after-care service.</P>
    <P>An excellent example of voluntary initiative in the field of after-care was the establishment last year of prisoners aid through community effort which is undertaking the running at Coolock, County Dublin, of what is usually described as a half-way house for prisoners who are homeless on discharge. An indication of the State's interest and support for this voluntary project is the provision of £4,000 in the current year's Vote towards the cost of reconstruction and adaptation.</P>
    <P>As part of the reorganisation of the probation and after-care service, therefore, I look forward to a sustained effort to enlist all the resources of voluntary effort in the community in the work of rehabilitation and I propose, in particular, to develop a close liaison between all the various agencies involved.  Already a number of voluntary bodies, but particularly two praesidia of the Legion of Mary in Dublin, are rendering valuable service on the probation side; and the Guild of St. Philip in Dublin and the Conference of St. Dominic in Cork, together with the Protestant Discharged Prisoners Aid Association, are doing equally valuable work in the field of after-care.</P>
    <P>A problem that is occupying the attention of the Minister for Health and myself at present is the provision to be made for mentally disturbed people, particularly adolescents, who have in many cases come into conflict with the law.  Some of them are drug abusers.  The provision of suitable institutional accommodation for them presents serious practical difficulties. <Col N="109" /> There is also the problem, which is the subject of public comment from time to time, of the absence of any arrangements for the detention of known aggressive psychopaths on discharge from prison.  A characteristic of this form of mental illness is that the people concerned are superficially quite normal and may remain so for long periods.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are a number of aspects of the operation of the present law relating to what are called &ldquo;criminal lunatics&rdquo; which appear to be in need of amendment.  Accordingly, discussions are taking place with the Department of Health on the question of setting up a committee, representative of the Government Departments and other authorities concerned, to make an immediate study of these problems and suggest appropriate steps to deal with them.  I expect that an announcement will be made on the matter at an early date.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I hope that what I have said will indicate that within our limited resources we are making a sustained effort to maintain our system for the treatment of offenders in line with acceptable international standards and with what we ourselves regard as consistent with the requirement of upholding each prisoner's dignity as a human person. If the results from time to time appear disappointing and meagre, this is not necessarily due to any fault in our particular methods.  It is the lot of prison administrations everywhere and we can only do our best.</P>
    <P>One thing, however, is clear to me and that is the need for having the maximum co-operation between all community agencies concerned in social work and education so that the conditions which breed crime are alleviated and the problem tackled at the pre-prison stage.  I propose therefore to pay a good deal of attention to improving liaison between Government Departments, local authorities and voluntary organisations operating in this field with a view to ensuring the best use of the resources we have available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House <Col N="110" /> and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate Deputy O'Malley on his elevation to the position of Minister for Justice and to express the hope that his short stay there may be happy and fruitful.  He has taken over this very onerous position at a very critical time in the crime history of the State.</P>
      <P>We have very unsettled conditions, restless conditions: the nation is perturbed by crime of all descriptions, ranging from armed bank robberies resulting in the death of police officers, to what might be regarded as less serious offences, such as sit-in protests, fish-in protests, protests of one sort or another.  I do not intend to dwell on this at any length but I think the toleration of the taking over of public or private buildings, whether as sit-ins under the auspices of cultural or architectural activities or sit-ins in protest against lack of housing or fish-ins as a national protest is nothing short of tolerating anarchy and can lead only to total disrespect for the law and to the common commission of more serious acts of violence.  It is bound to generate disrespect for the law and for public and private property.  I hope that the Minister, in entering his office, will tackle these problems as they should be tackled because they have been overlooked and tolerated for too long.</P>
      <P>The Bill we are dealing with this evening is the Prisons Bill, 1970. Really there are only two provisions in it.  One is for the establishment of places other than prisons to help in the rehabilitation of persons serving prison sentences or sentences of detention in St. Patrick's Institution; the other provision is to reduce the upper age limit qualifying for detention in St. Patrick's Institution from 21 years to 19 years of age.  This is a Bill with which the Minister comes to the House seeking a blank cheque to do certain things, but he does not write into the Bill how he proposes to do them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will be operated by regulations made by the <Col N="111" /> Minister.  I am against that although I will concede that there is a stronger argument for it in a Bill of this kind than there might be in many other Bills.  Nevertheless, I do not think that we can do more than approve of the Bill in principle having listened to the Minister's statement as to what he proposes to do.</P>
    <P>In so far as the provision of accommodation is concerned, it would appear from the Minister's opening remarks that it is not intended to provide any further accommodation at the moment. The idea apparently is to regularise Shanganagh as a place of alternative accommodation.  In principle, I agree with the proposals put forward in the Bill.  I consider it a good idea to reduce the upper age limit in St. Patrick's from 21 to 19 years because by the time young men reach the age of 21 years, particularly in conditions obtaining nowadays, they are far removed from what might be described as people of tender age or amateurs in the context which has brought them into St. Patrick's.</P>
    <P>The Minister justifiably did not have much to say about the provisions of the Bill but dealt with prison conditions, probation and after-care.  We are all agreed that the emphasis nowadays and in the years ahead must be on the effort to rehabilitate rather than to punish.  The old approach of punishing the person as severely as possible in an effort to prevent him from committing further crime should not be used other than as a last resort, if at all.  As the Minister has said, usually most of these young people who actually commit crime do so through no fault of their own.  The offences are committed due to lack of proper family background, because of drunkenness in the home, because of long spells of unemployment or of parental neglect.  Every effort should be made to reform these young people and to direct them on proper lines before we set out to punish them and to treat them as criminals.</P>
    <P>During the years our record on the question of probation and after-care certainly has not been a credit to the country and to successive Governments. <Col N="112" /> The probation system was introduced here by the British Government in 1907 and even at that time they realised that an effort should be made to reform offenders.  However, we are still operating the Probation Act of 1907 without any real modification or any updating.  On the other hand, the probation system in Great Britain was modified in 1948, in 1961 and in 1968 by different Acts of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice told me in February of this year that he had received a report on probation and after-care in July, 1969, and he said that report recommended an extension of those services in addition to the recruitment of probation and prison welfare officers.  However, the former Minister went on to state that there was a considerable financial implication involved and that it required the fullest investigation.  The present Minister seems to be more optimistic regarding the future of the probation system.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that there are only six probation officers for the entire city of Dublin and that is regarded as totally inadequate.  We also have the absurd position that these probation officers are only available to the metropolitan district courts, which courts do not cater for the housing estates built on the outskirts of the city.  Therefore, if a young person from one of those housing estates is unfortunate enough to be brought before the courts on a criminal charge he is not tried in the Children's Court at Dublin Castle but is tried in a court where a probation officer is not available. If the young person concerned lives in the city of Dublin he is tried in Dublin Castle and the district justice can put him on probation, under the care of a probation officer.</P>
    <P>It is long past time that we reviewed the probation system and provided adequate staff.  The Minister has said that even if he had the necessary finance he would not provide the staff because there was not sufficient office accommodation at the moment.  The Minister has said he will not provide the staff until he can provide proper offices near the courts.  I do not think probation officers require large offices <Col N="113" /> in order to deal with their charges; as a matter of fact it would be better if the probation officers visited their charges in their own homes.  I do not see how offices can provide any problem.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the welfare of prisoners and the after-care of prisoners.  Most institutions are completely understaffed so far as welfare officers are concerned.  If my information is correct St. Patrick's which is the institution transferred from Clonmel, catering for young people up to the age of 21&mdash;and when the Bill is passed up to the age of 19&mdash;has one welfare officer and Shanganagh, which was established in recent times to deal with young people about to be released, does not even have one welfare officer. One would think it was imperative to have welfare officers in Shanganagh.  I realise the Minister is not to blame for this because he has only recently taken over his portfolio but I hope he will rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>I think the real reason for this Bill is the overcrowding in St. Patrick's. Certainly, the Minister has been candid about the overcrowding and his information corroborates the information which I have about overcrowding there.  Due to overcrowding many offenders who are released before the expiry of their sentences, even taking account of remission for good conduct, come under Garda notice again.  I concede that even if they had done their full term they may have come under Garda notice, but it is a fair criticism to make that they should not have been let out prematurely just because there was no place to house them until the authorities were satisfied that they were fit to be released.</P>
    <P>I understand a number of youths in St. Patrick's were transferred to the female portion of Mountjoy.  The portion of Mountjoy in which these young offenders are housed is divided from the portion still occupied by female prisoners by a wooden partition or wall which is not soundproof.  There is no need for me to tell the Minister, if that is in fact the situation, that it is undesirable both from the phychological point of view and from a moral point of view.  I do not know whether or not the Minister admits that is the <Col N="114" /> position but that is my information.  In fairness to the Minister I should say that he has dealt with most of the points which need to be tackled and I hope he will do something about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has conceded that the training given to prison officers is inadequate.  He has told us, if I understood him correctly, that he proposes sending some new recruits to Great Britain for training.  In Britain a new recruit to the prison service is fully trained before he is regarded as a prison officer.  He is given a month's trial first of all to assess his suitability for the position; he is assessed by psychologists in order to see if he is temperamentally suitable for the position.  That is very necessary for this sort of work because it requires great patience, great humanity, great tolerance and a generally suitable make-up.</P>
    <P>Having gone through that assessment he is sent to a training centre for three months; after the three months training he is returned to the prison proper for a further two months training there; and he then goes back to the training centre for a final month's training.  I understand they are not satisfied with that position. They also have refresher courses for prison officers.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think because of the small number taken in that it would be either a waste of money or extravagant, but I think it is absolutely essential that our prison personnel should be properly trained and not merely regarded as jailers or people whose duty it is to keep in the people sent to them.  We are asking too much of our prison officers.  My understanding of the situation here is that prison officers do an examination of primary school certificate standard and they are recruited on the strength of that.  They are immediately given a uniform, they are interviewed by the governor, they are then given a list of rules&mdash;I hope I will be pardoned for being crude&mdash;and a bunch of keys and they are then regarded as being prison officers.  It is unreasonable to expect people with that limited amount of training to discharge difficult duties. I suppose the mystery of it is that they <Col N="115" /> do so well and that we have so few disturbances in our prisons.  No doubt, that is a reflection of the Irish temperament and the quality of the people who have been recruited but in this day and age when the emphasis should be on reform and rehabilitation these officers should get a far more extensive training.</P>
    <P>When we talk about after-care we seem to refer to it in relation to the city of Dublin.  I imagine there are more offenders in built-up areas than in country areas but let us take the case of a young man who comes before the district court on a few occasions and is given the Probation Act. Up till recently I had as much experience in these rural district courts as most people in my profession and most of the district justices operated the probation system well without probation officers.  Certainly, they were not slow to give the Probation Act and give it again and again&mdash;they probably overworked the Act a bit&mdash;but when a young fellow gets the Probation Act a few times and then gets six months, what future is there for him in a rural town?  After he is released, I am afraid his chances of getting employment are very, very slender.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that private employers are slow to employ such a man and very, very often he takes the boat, crosses the water, and either makes good, if he is lucky, or embarks on major crime, if he is not lucky.  We should have an after-care service to deal with these people in their own localities.  The only way in which to reform someone who has fallen foul of the law and has spent six months in prison is by convincing him that he is still a member of society and that there is a place for him in society. He must be convinced that he is not something for the scrapheap, something unemployable, and the only way in which to convince him of that is by providing him with employment in his own locality.  Most people will agree with me when I say that these unfortunate people find it very difficult, if not impossible, to get employment in provincial towns and in rural areas. <Col N="116" /> I throw out once again the suggestion that the State and local authorities have an obligation to these people. Between them they form the biggest employers of labour in the country. They spend our rates and our taxes. I believe they could employ these people under proper supervision and that would be one way of convincing them that there is a place for them in our society and that they are not utter rejects.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned PACE.  I should like to join with him in complimenting this voluntary organisation &mdash;Prisoners Aid through Community Effort&mdash;and I believe it was because of lack of professional assistance for prisoners that this body was established. Those who have taken an interest in this very worthwhile and charitable work are to be congratulated. They deserve the thanks of all of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the drug problem in a rather passing way.  One of the major defects so far as drug addiction is concerned is the absence of an adequate institution in which to treat drug addicts.  Most of these people are young and they are not fit subjects for a mental hospital. Neither are they fit subjects for a prison.  The young drug addict is a very sick person.  He really cannot help himself.  His craving for drugs must be met and the only way to cure him is by treating him in some institution specially designed for that purpose. If the young drug addict finds himself in a mental institution when he comes to he will immediately rebel. He will be equally angry if he finds himself in Mountjoy or St. Patrick's. Those who take drugs are more to be pitied than abused.  Through no fault of their own they start on this habit-forming practice.  The Minister has power under this Bill to establish an institution, other than a prison or mental hospital, in which to treat drug addicts.  Such an institution should be divorced entirely from prison.  It should be a small medical unit.</P>
    <P>Drug addiction is not yet a major problem but it is a bigger problem than the ex-Minister's predecessor thought it was two or three years ago.  If there <Col N="117" /> was a small institution in which drug addicts could be treated and reformed that would be a very good thing.  They could either go there voluntarily or they could be committed for treatment. The problem must be tackled. It cannot be put on the long finger.  The facilities must be provided at once.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is an enabling Bill except for the section reducing the age from 21 to 19.  I trust the Minister agrees by and large with the views I have expressed on the Bill. There is just one thought that strikes me: has Mountjoy outlived its usefulness? Is it out of date?  The area it covers is pretty extensive and as a site it must be exceedingly valuable. Perhaps the time has come when we should consider the establishment of a modern prison on the outskirts of the city or in one of the neighbouring counties.  Apparently there is an argument for having a prison near the capital city.  I do not know what it would cost but I should say the amount of money that could be obtained for the site would go a long way towards the provision of a modern place of detention.  I agree with this Bill in principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Fitzpatrick in congratulating the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Justice.  I wish him well in this post.  While I congratulate him I feel like commiserating with him at the same time because he is going into the Department at a time when very frightening responsibilities will be his and when, I do not think it is an exaggeration to say, a wrong decision by him could lead to dreadful consequences throughout the country. For that reason he will need a great deal of luck and I wish him that luck in his task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without at all wishing to be taken as being personally opposed to his predecessor as an individual I must confess to being glad that he is no longer Minister for Justice because I think his approach to these matters&mdash; I do not propose to pursue the topic&mdash; was certainly not one with which I could have much sympathy.  I wonder to what extent the opening speech <Col N="118" /> was the Minister's predecessor's and to what extent he himself made his own imprint on it.  I am in no way denigrating the present Minister or seeking to do so.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know whether there has been any fundamental change in the Department of Justice in regard to its attitude to criminality, criminology or penology and the approach to the youth prisons in our society.  Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that it would be desirable to get rid of Mountjoy Prison and sell the site.  He has a good point there because no matter who tries to do anything with Mountjoy, like so many of these old institutions such as county homes and mental hospitals, he cannot hope to succeed.  No laws we pass here, even with the best will in the world on the part of the personnel involved, would change those dreadful places to anything other than what they were intended to be, punitive, soul-destroying, demoralising institutions intended to humiliate and degrade anybody going into them.  I think the only solution to Mountjoy is to give the Minister a present of a fleet of bulldozers to get rid of it and start from the ground up.</P>
    <P>Even before one tries to do that one must come back to the question of the basic attitude to criminality.  Whether one looks at the so-called criminal as a person who must be punished or a person who must be rehabilitated is a vital consideration and I think the present Minister appears to lean towards the generally-held thesis in more advanced and sophisticated societies and communities now that punitive treatment of the prisoner is virtually a complete waste of money, even if it were not in conflict, as I believe, with many of our basic Christian professions about the wrong-doer.  The last thing that seems to enter into the considerations of the judiciary or the Department of Justice in charge of prisons is the concept embodied in the exhortation: &ldquo;He who amongst you is without sin, let him cast the first stone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Most of those people who end up in our prisons are people who are unhappy and unfortunate and suffering from personality disorders, emotionally-disturbed people.  They end up in that <Col N="119" /> condition largely because of certain environmental factors over which they have little or no control.</P>
    <P>Strangely, we accept without question that the good home and good family environment are likely to produce the well-integrated and balanced end product, the young adult, in later life.  We expect a good environment to turn out a good end product but we do not quite so readily accept the fact that the converse, the disturbed or broken home, drunken parents, divorced parents, the institutional life, illegitimacy, desertion are virtually insuperable obstacles to the creation of a balanced individual in society.  The likelihood of such a person ending up in a jail of one kind or another is infinitely greater than in the case of a child fortunate enough to be brought up in a stable environment.</P>
    <P>Because that is fairly well established now and generally accepted by psychologists and psychiatrists I find it impossible to take anything but a compassionate approach to the so-called criminal.  It is so easy for those of us who were fortunate enough to grow up in reasonably stable surroundings that it is no credit to us that we became reasonably stable adults.  These others are people who are punished by society largely because of defects in their environment which were nearly always adult-created.  The broken home, the quarrelling, the drunkenness, the institutional life, the divorce, the illegitimacy or desertion are all factors which are adult-created and which, acting on the infant or young person, result in their being so disturbed as to eventually come into conflict with society and conflict with society leads to prison.</P>
    <P>What I should like to see would be a complete change in the attitude of our Department of Justice, on the part of the judiciary, the Garda and all those concerned with this whole problem of criminality in society.  I am not suggesting for one moment that it is possible to ignore the fact that there are people who, because of many factors&mdash;the ones I have mentioned are only some of them; others are genetic predisposition, chromosomal characteristics, <Col N="120" /> various changes which one can see in electro encephalograms and so on, all the factors over which the individual has no control but all producing the him&mdash;act in a deviant way, an anti-social manner.  I am not suggesting that one can allow those persons free in society.  Society also has rights and we have got to preserve and protect them.</P>
    <P>I am simply suggesting that, where it is decided to isolate the individual for the sake of the preservation of society and the furtherance of its welfare, this shall not be done at all in a punitive way but in the same way as a sick person is put into hospital and treated and cared for until he is well again.  I know that is asking a lot because, strangely enough, we believe in a punitive approach to the obtaining of conformism in our society and in establishing what we call discipline and maintaining discipline.  It is one of the examples of dual thinking there is in our society.</P>
    <P>The two dynamics for changing an individual are to me punishment or love and understanding and tolerance. The one used predominantly here, the one most of us believe in, is the punitive one.  It is the one most of us suffered under in our schools and colleges and yet the one which the Christian church professes is the dynamic of love.  It is not seen practically anywhere in the whole fabric of our culture here in Ireland.  In our dealings with one another we are very aggressive, very punitive, very oppressive, very authoritarian.  There is a basic conflict.  I know I am in a minority in holding my views on that but I am in a minority again, as happened so frequently before here, in Ireland only. In most of the more advanced societies, in the Scandinavian society, Holland and so on, in parts of the United States and some of the Communist countries, there is this rather more understanding approach to the whole psychodynamics of crime and the criminal.</P>
    <P>As long as that conflict is there naturally it will determine the decision of the Minister in his approach to this complicated problem.  For a very short time I had control of a prison.  As Minister for Health, peculiarly enough, <Col N="121" /> I had control of Dundrum Criminal Lunatic Asylum as it was known at the time.  One of the first things I had great pleasure in doing was to change that to the Central Mental Hospital.  I then changed many of the provisions relating to prison clothes, recreation and films.  I altered the whole approach to the place as best I could in the very short time I was there.  This was 20 years ago.  I suppose it shows I had not started really thinking about these things at that time but I have thought about this problem for a very long time.</P>
    <P>This is completely non-political and therefore I am sure the Minister will appreciate that I am putting forward these suggestions so that he will give them some thought.  I know that all our backgrounds&mdash;his background, my background and the background of the people on the Fine Gael benches&mdash; are identical.  We all come from a culture which, despite its Christian professions, believes in the old Judaic or biblical eye for an eye philosophy in our approach to the treatment of criminals.  Incidentally, I think it is wrong of me to say that it is the old Judaic law.  It was never, in fact, implemented. My Jewish friends tell me the approach to the treatment and care of the criminal according to the old Jewish code was always the principle of compensation.  The criminal had to compensate for whatever crime he committed.  That we have, to a certain extent of course, in the fines system.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the attitude of the average judge lecturing the average unfortunate person in the box is that he has committed a crime and he must pay the penalty for that crime.  Only someone in a position as powerful and influential as the Minister's can bring about new thinking or a new approach to this whole question of the treatment of prisoners.  One of the things that always surprised me&mdash;I suppose I am continually being surprised&mdash;was that this Dáil had a series of Ministers who were what you might call distinguished jail birds in their time&mdash;and I do not mean that at all disrespectfully; quite the contrary&mdash;men who for very good reason had spent a long time in jail and very honourably in jail but few <Col N="122" /> of them, who must have known what the inside of a jail was like as few of us do, took up the matter when they got into power and became Ministers. I am referring to both sides of the House.  Few of them applied their own personal inside knowledge and showed the House how stupid and futile and degrading is the whole principle of locking up people and how utterly sterile it is and unproductive of any change.  It is quite valueless from the point of view of the individual and from the point of view of society. Few of them took the opportunity to introduce changes which were needed.</P>
    <P>I know Portlaoise jail.  I was down there many years ago.  Unless it has changed, it is a dreadful place.  It is just a series of cages.  It is an appalling sight to see people there.  It represents degradation to everybody concerned.  I have been in Mountjoy Prison visiting friends who found their way in there in one way or another.  It too is a dreadful place.  I do not think any Bill in this House would change it in a fundamental way.  The general thesis seems to be to lock the person up in a blind futile sort of way, a blind angry sort of way, without making any attempt to find out why that person found his way there.  Why him and not me?  It could so easily be.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of the aggressive psychopath, I trust the Minister will discuss with the Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, the appointment of a director of forensic psychiatry.  Such an appointment is very necessary.  The Minister may not know that a very distinguished Irishman who has been away from this country for a long time might come back to Ireland; he is one of the great authorities on this question.  There are some silly bureaucratic administrative difficulties&mdash;something to do with British superannuation being taken up and accepted here, and so on.  Anyhow, the difficulties are not sufficiently important to deny this country the invaluable services of this man, and the opportunity of having access to one of the finest minds on this subject, so far as the organisation of a modern forensic psychiatric service is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the particular problem with <Col N="123" /> which the Minister is largely dealing in this Bill&mdash;the St. Patrick's aspect of it, in any event&mdash;it is a fact that the care of the psychopath is particularly difficult.  Virtually nobody has the answer.  There are people who find it very difficult to work with a psychopath patient.  Psychopaths are a particularly unrewarding sector of society. Nobody has yet found a solution to their problem.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister deals with the aggressive psychopath and the provision of the St. Patrick's type of accommodation for that patient.  A recent paper by Dr. Stewart Whitley, a very experienced psychiatrist working in this specialty&mdash;he worked at a very famous place called the Henderson Institute outside London at which this other Irish doctor has been for the past 15 to 20 years&mdash;points out that the aggressive psychopath is the person who gets the least benefit from the stimulating permissive type of institution which I think the Minister has in mind in the Shanganagh institution or St. Patrick's.  The aggressive psychopath is very nearly an impossible case altogether.  The kind of person with whom I think the Minister is probably more concerned is the creative psychopath who responds to this kind of stimulating and permissive environment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, before the Minister progresses very much farther with his plans, it would be worth his while to look into the whole matter of the structure of any environment he has in mind for the treatment of these kinds of patients.  There are three different kinds of psychopath&mdash;the inadequate psychopath, the aggressive psychopath and the creative psychopath.  The milieu in which each of these is treated is completely useless to the other type of patient.  I trust the Minister will give the matter very much more thought.  I hope he will have the advantage of the expert advice to which I have referred, and in relation to which the Minister for Health may help him, before he comes to formulate any final plans for St. Patrick's or Shanganagh House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> I get the impression that what has happened in relation to Shanganagh is that we have this extraordinary overcrowding in St. Patrick's&mdash; the figures 58, 57 to 195, nearly 200: an astonishing increase in the occupancy in St. Patrick's.  If the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran, were introducing this Bill I might be inclined to say that what happened was that they got so overcrowded there that they are reducing the age limit to 19 and using Shanganagh as an overflow for St. Patrick's.  I should like to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and to accept that he is intent upon and is trying to make some serious contribution to this problem. <i>Prima facie,</i> I get the impression that Shanganagh came in handy and it was decided to transfer some of these people from St. Patrick's there. Everybody will be relieved to know that the Minister is interested in this problem&mdash;the judiciary, the Garda, probation officers.  All the psychiatric institutions will be more than delighted that some attempt is being made to deal with this very difficult and intractable problem in the only kind of environment in which it can be handled.  Except in certain custodian prisons or mental hospitals, these patients are virtually impossible to deal with.  Therefore, we certainly welcome the proposals.</P>
    <P>I am glad that something is to be done in regard to the probation service. Some people think that all that happens when a person gets off on probation is that he gets a warning from the judge or the justice and is then let off scot free.  That is not true, of course.  What happens is the probation officer must try to establish some sort of relationship with the individual. There is usually a suspended sentence given and the probation officer&mdash;of which there are only three or four in the city of Dublin&mdash;is then given the responsibility of trying to establish some sort of relationship with the young person or adult as the case may be.  It is a very enlightened and civilised way of dealing with some people who offend against the social mores in our society&mdash;the young offender, the juvenile or, in some cases, the adult first offender.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> I have the greatest sympathy for a number of the probation officers whom I know because of the completely heart-breaking conditions under which they have been forced to work for many years, not only physically, as the Minister now recognises, but also because of the accommodation they have, the lack of any kind of support services at all and, above all, because they have found themselves without any professional help.  One finds them frequently coming to mental hospitals begging us to take somebody in and quite often in a humanitarian way to try to prevent a youngster going to prison.  Of course, we on our side do not particularly want to deal with this kind of person because the psychiatric hospitals are not designed for them and so they are left with the person on their hands without any support from any of us.  I am glad to hear there is an attempt to be made to increase the staff of the probation officers and to provide them with proper support, care and help.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention, in relation to Shanganagh, why it is that there appears to be no psychiatric supervision of the institution.  It follows from my concept of crime that in some cases the person's, let us call them, criminal tendencies may be ameliorated, may be helped.  In some cases nothing can be done.  Whitley refers to something like 40 per cent of these people who did not come back to the Henderson Institution but it is a very difficult problem to assess. One does not really talk about cure rates.  No reconviction two, three, four or five years after discharge is about the only way one can broadly go on.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that careful selection beforehand is necessary in addition to a degree of supervision after arrival and the number of absconders since the centre was established has been quite low.  I wonder what he means by &ldquo;quite low&rdquo;?  It is yet a bit early for him to say whether their being in Shanganagh has made any difference to them.  More important still, what system of selection has been established and what specialist advice did he have in making this system of selection?  This is a particularly intricate <Col N="126" /> problem as I have just said.  The type of person he is talking about, the aggressive psychopath, should not really be sent to Shanganagh according to pretty expert findings on this.  Who made the selection of these people who went from St. Patrick's to Shanganagh and on what grounds did they make their particular selection?  In this kind of institution there should be not only psychiatrists but also psychologists and probation officers as a liaison with the Garda as well as the various forms of training facilities, job placement officers and then the different outlets for these individuals in the particular institution.  If the Minister is serious about this problem he will have to see that the institution is properly staffed because he is dealing with a particularly dangerous problem and it cannot be done except by people who have a very long training in this whole specialty.</P>
    <P>If one accepts that the role of a probation officer is a particularly important one then we come to a problem in our Irish courts in which the information about the individual is only made available to the justice after conviction. The justice in any case at present is in an almost impossible position.  It is the crudest form of justice imaginable, that which is available to us in our courts, if one takes as one's yardstick the approach in, say, Holland where there is an assessment by probation officers of the environmental conditions of the person appearing before the court&mdash;that is the upbringing, family background, schooling, economic circumstances, job opportunities, training, skill and the whole environment which created this particular person and led him to find himself in court.</P>
    <P>That information is simply the case history any conscientious psychiatrist must have before he can give any evaluation at all of the severity of a particular emotional disturbance and, what is more important, before he can give any vague&mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;vague&rdquo;&mdash;idea as to how long it will take to help this particular person in a therapeutic way, to make him well again.  More often than not it is impossible to say.  The justice sees a boy <Col N="127" /> or girl in the dock and is told by a garda that he or she was found doing something and he then has to say to himself: &ldquo;What sentence should I give this young person?&rdquo; Then it is three months, six months or nine months in St. Patrick's.  It is more than likely he knows very little about St. Patrick's or the conditions to which he is sending that boy.  I do not wish him any disrespect. I do not know if many of them know of the conditions under which people are treated.</P>
    <P>I am talking from the therapeutic point of view.  I am not being critical of the place at all.  I am asking whether there will be the kind of care which the justice thinks could help this particular individual.  How many justices approach cases in that way?  Surely it should be their primary function to try to decide: &ldquo;How do I help this person not to appear before me any more?&rdquo;. It is a question of the most extraordinary complexity.  Even if the justice had a psychiatrist sitting on each side of him and had all the information which I talked about from the probation officer, who finds out the history of the person and how he got to the court, it would be extraordinarily difficult for any human being to say that a person should have three months, six months or nine months in a particular milieu and that this would lead to this person's never coming back into court, or unlikely to come back into court again.</P>
    <P>There is no attempt to approach the problem of crime in Ireland for the young adolescent, male or female, in this way.  Even with a detailed history, with psychological assessment, personality assessment, vocational guidance and all the information which social workers can put at our disposal in dealing with this type of adolescent delinquent or personality problem, it is virtually impossible for even the most experienced psychiatrist to say: &ldquo;This person will benefit from this particular treatment and will be a better person at the end of it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One can see the appalling cruelty of the whole judicial system in relation to criminality generally.  Our attitudes have changed over the years.  They <Col N="128" /> have changed very slowly and minimally. Our attitude to the alcoholic has changed.  We now understand he is a sick person and he is quite rightly accepted as sick.  On the whole, our attitude to the drug addict is almost reasonably civilised.  Our general attitude to drug addicts is that they are unhappy, unfortunate people who are emotionally disturbed and that there should be no question of punishing them at all.  Perhaps they should be isolated from society, if this has to be done, in the interests of society and in their own interests, but this should not be done in a punitive way.</P>
    <P>We have accepted that capital punishment was not a deterrent and we have a reasonably civilised approach to capital punishment.  Our attitude is not ideal but it is reasonably good. I remember when people who attempted to commit suicide had to appear in the witness box and explain why they had decided to take their lives.  Such people do not appear in court now. They are treated for their emotional disturbances.  I would like to see that general approach in relation to the understanding of emotional behaviour problems translated into reality in enactments such as this which relate to crime and to the so-called criminal. I may be moving a little bit too fast, but Deputy O'Malley is a young man and, as Minister for Justice, I am sure he has a reasonably open mind.  The Minister need not take my views as those of a crank in our particular culture or society.  These views are held by many distinguished criminologists and penologists, admittedly in the Scandinavian countries, Denmark and Holland, and are being researched and experimented with.</P>
    <P>The function of the probation officer should really be to carry out an examination in depth of the individual's life history as an aid to the justice and to the Garda and, then, after a decision has been taken, the probation officer is responsible for supervision and help in the after-care period.  The difficulty arises with us in that it is considered improper for the justice to have any information in advance of making up his mind.  In certain circumstances it could be damaging to the person in the <Col N="129" /> dock, but to the justice with the correct approach to the problem such information could only be of help to him in making up his mind.  The high incidence of recidivism in the people who spend many years in punitive-type prisons is in itself a fairly good rationalisation of the rejection by many of us that punitive-type isolation, such as imprisonment, is of any value at all beyond satisfying our wish to hurt the person and punish him for whatever he has done.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that Marlborough House is to be closed and that we will have a new preventive centre at Finglas.  I would be interested to hear what kind of centre this will be and what the Minister has in mind in relation to it.  How does the Minister propose to staff it?  How many people will be there?  What type of person will it care for?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions the business of short-stay treatment in St. Patrick's. There is a problem with regard to short-stay treatment at St. Patrick's. By the time the patients have settled down they are ready for discharge.  This really brings me back to the point I was making about the difficulty of justices in deciding on the optimum time for isolating an individual because of the way he has offended against society.  Would the Minister consider the idea of the probation officer helping the justice by finding out as much as he can in advance from psychiatrists' reports, psychologists' reports, social workers' reports and from reports on the general background of the individual in order to help the justice to make up his mind as to the type of institution to which the person should be sent and for how long he should be sent?</P>
    <P>In deciding on the duration it is practically impossible to say, no matter how expert one is, whether five months and not seven months is the correct time, or 11 months and not 12.  In some places in the United States they have the system of from one to five years, one to six months, six months to two years, two years to ten years&mdash;in some way allowing some expert body from time to time to review the sentence and to <Col N="130" /> decide, and to have the right from the courts to decide, that the person can be discharged from prison when he is accepted as being well.</P>
    <P>There is a great need in our prisons generally for segregation, classification and serious retraining.  As I have said, segregation and classification in relation to psychopaths is very important in the approach to their treatment and care and similarly in the case of the first offender and the recidivist all of whom should be kept apart for obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>The latest report I have is the 1966 prison report.  From that report it seemed clear that the retraining facilities consisted of baking, weaving, laundry and the general maintenance of the institution.  There was also the extraordinary one of learning how to drive a car which the Minister keeps on mentioning.  It seems a little bizarre to have that particular one.</P>

From reading the report I got the impression that these forms of retraining were designed to keep Mountjoy moving as it were because clothes were being washed, bread was being baked and uniforms were woven.  I believe the latter has now been discontinued.  That system would seem to incorporate cheap labour.  It was also practised in the mental hospitals. It was a very bad system, being the old workhouse system translated into mental hospitals and then into prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister is now talking about light metalwork and so <Col N="131" /> on in this context but I would like these ideas to be closer to the establishment of a vocational section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that in so far as our mental hospitals are concerned, the health authorities are linked with vocational schools so that it is possible to provide instruction in the hospitals in domestic economy, carpentry, engineering, light metalwork, secretarial work, printing and so on.  I know that we come up against a trade union problem but it would indicate a more realistic and serious intent on the part of the Department if a much more flexible and versatile scheme of retraining were made available for young people.</P>
      <P>The Dutch have the closed prisons, the semi-open prison and the open prison.  My experience of prisons here is limited to visiting people and talking to them but it seems to me that the attempt to break off the emotional and physical links which the individual has with his family and friends is particularly brutal.  It is sadistic and thoughtless and must be demoralising for the individual.  The Minister mentioned the terrible problem of the institutionalisation of the individual in these places and the reluctance on the part of the individual to leave prison if he has been there for some time.  This is a common phenomenon in our mental hospitals. It is probably the biggest problem we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any one of us were to be sent to one of these places we simply would not want to leave after a certain point of time because we would no longer have our individual personality. We would have been drained of any initiative or of any wish to accept responsibility.  Therefore, we destroy these people morally by this very thoughtless and cruel approach to them in so far as we deprive them of their liberty and that is an appalling thing to do to any person.  Neither human being nor animal should be caged.  We deprive them of the consolation of friendships and of family <Col N="132" /> links.  Their facilities for writing are restricted.  I cannot understand why they should not be permitted and, indeed, encouraged to write as many letters as they wish because when a person is sent to prison, two parties suffer.  As well as the imprisoned person suffering, his unfortunate wife and family, brothers and sisters, also suffer.</P>
    <P>Without any great difficulty our prisons could be run on lines that would involve a great deal less suffering for those people whom we decide must be isolated from the community. We should encourage the retention of family links and we should also encourage the individual to retain his links with the outside world.  If one talks to somebody who has been in prison for any length of time, he will discover that that person has great difficulty in re-establishing his association with the outside world.</P>
    <P>Other countries are able to overcome this problem.  The problem is not a financial one but, rather, an attitude of mind on the part of prison authorities.  In Holland, for instance, frequent visits are encouraged and these visits are not very closely supervised. I remember visiting an old friend of mine, a former Deputy of this House, in Mountjoy.  During the visit we sat with a table between us and the unfortunate man was attired in an appalling prison uniform while an unfortunate warder sat beside us. I am sure the warder must have disliked the situation as much as anybody else.  That brings me to another factor that should be taken into consideration. Not only must it be demoralising for the prisoner to have this sort of supervision but it must also be demoralising for the people who have to work there.</P>
    <P>When open prisons were first introduced in Britain, in the United States, in Holland and in Sweden the staff were frightened and worried.  They found it difficult to cope but after a while the loss of the primary custodian functions and the introduction of a therapeutic approach, an understanding and a compassionate approach, not only made things better for the prisoner and helped the prisoner but also made <Col N="133" /> life very much less tense and less exacting for the people who were working there.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have any open prisons at all.  I know the Department of Justice attempt to allow the prisoner freedom in the last five or six months of his sentence but a geieral belief now is that these people should be transferred to a semi-open or open prison, particularly in the last five or six months, where there are no security precautions at all, where they can travel to work and back and where they are given graded amounts of responsibility so that eventually they are able to take on the job of leading a full life after their discharge.  I do not know, but I hope Deputy Tunney is wrong and that there are not people in our society, breadwinners as he called them, living on the slop which is widely known to be served to prisoners, particularly in Mountjoy.  I always feel, as regards the people who say that, that I would like to set them down at a table and tell them to eat the stuff, and, if they got up satisfied, then I would be impressed.</P>
    <P>I am not really sure what was the Minister's <i>rationale</i> for the reduction from 21 to 19 years.  Is it that he is so pushed for space that he must get rid of them from St. Patrick's?  He must explain to us why he thinks St. Patrick's and Shanganagh are all right at 19 but not at 20 or 21, and, further, why the ordinary prison is not all right at 19 but is all right at 21.  For many years we have believed that for St. Patrick's 19 to 21 were the correct ages.  On what medical, psychological or scientific grounds are we making this decision (a) to restrict the age to 19 in relation to St. Patrick's and (b) to reduce the age at which people go into ordinary prisons?</P>
    <P>I am not really impressed by the case the Minister has made because talking about the age of an individual, whether it is 19, 20 or 21, leaves out of consideration altogether the whole psychodynamics of the process of maturation, the fact that you can get a person of 40 who is very immature and a person of 19 who is very mature. Therefore the ages of 19, 20 and 21 have no scientific meaning.  They are arbitrary figures.  The Minister may <Col N="134" /> have good reason for the decision but I can see no reason for it.</P>
    <P>Reducing the age limit by two years seems very much more likely to be motivated by a wish to reduce the pressure on St. Patrick's by transferring people to our ordinary prisons. The Minister must agree it is a retro grade step to transfer younger people into these dreadful, very backward prisons in which we now carry our adult prison population.  I should like to have a very much better reason than the reasons so far given before I would accept that it is a desirable thing to do.  Establish a separate institution, if you want to, for the 19-21s and then another one for the over 21s, to the extent that that is of any value at all, and then up to 19.  However, as things are, it is a retrograde decision. Equally I think the decision to give the Minister power under section 7 to transfer people from St. Patrick's to prison because of overcrowding is a very dangerous provision indeed.</P>
    <P>If we believe that separate, specialist institutions such as St. Patrick's and Shanganagh should be established in the interest of these young people, then we cannot be justified&mdash;that is our own fault again, a failure of adult society&mdash; in putting these people into the very traumatic and infectious environment of an adult-type prison simply on the grounds of the convenience of the prison authority.  The obvious reply is, if we have to, to provide more accommodation rather than this makeshift arrangement of using what we know is substandard accommodation.</P>
    <P>Supposing this principle were accepted in medicine, that a patient required some specialist care and the hospital decided they could not give him that care, and we said: &ldquo;We shall make legal provision for the treatment of this person in one of the substandard institutions in which he may suffer permanent disability or lose his life because it is substandard, because it is not designed for that purpose&rdquo;. Nobody would tolerate that at all. This Bill asks us to do precisely that with the emotional health of a young person in our society, and for that reason it is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill are minimal. <Col N="135" /> They are, I am afraid, only the least the Minister can do.  The curious thing is that the only worthwhile proposals mentioned by the Minister are not included in the Bill at all.  This is a retrograde step.  The proposals referred to in his opening speech are, unfortunately, only proposals which may or may not be implemented. Those are the only things which will add anything at all worthwhile to the betterment of our penal system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very happy to be disappointed in my prophecy. Meanwhile I shall proceed to say that in so far as it indicates to me a step forward I welcome this Bill.  There are <Col N="136" /> many things about our prison institutions, and indeed about St. Patrick's, that I would criticise and have criticised before.  Perhaps I should mention here the point mentioned by Deputy Dr. Browne that he is at a loss to know why I should speak in any favourable terms about the food available in St. Patrick's Institution.  He is at a loss to know why I could say there were some wage earners in the country who did not enjoy better diet.  I say that having eaten the food there.  If Deputy Dr. Noel Browne can, having eaten the food, inform me to the contrary then I shall accept his criticism but as I am not aware that Deputy Dr. Browne has visited St. Patrick's Institution I cannot accept it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy would be very welcome to visit the institution and sit down there with the boys and share their meals with them.  While it is not of hotel standard it is in my opinion&mdash; and I claim to know the wage earners of this country&mdash;comparable with the diet of some of our wage earners.  I should be happy to see the diet of those wage earners improve but in a situation in which they are subsidising and paying in taxation for the diet of the young offenders in St. Patrick's it would be rather unjust and unfair to those wage earners that we should require them to provide for juvenile offenders a diet which they cannot afford to give to their wives and children, all of whom are law-abiding citizens.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's was undoubtedly overcrowded. Some of the offenders have been removed to Shanganagh to relieve the pressure in St. Patrick's.  My real concern here is that this will give relief to the staff of St. Patrick's.  We are inclined to think too much of the offender and too little of the staff.  We must remember the staff of St. Patrick's are not working in the best of environments. They are handling young boys who are not unfortunately the best of company and a thought should be spared for the staff as well as for the offenders.  I must admit, having said that, that my first concern is for the offender and that, within reason, anything we can do for those offenders should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said during the Estimate debate <Col N="137" /> that I would like to see some variation in the diet in St. Patrick's.  I said as the bulk of the offenders are Dublin boys who have been accustomed to fish and chips that I saw no reason why fish and chips should not be available to them.  Others, such as professional people and dieticians, might perhaps join issue with me and say that this is not very nutritional.  However, in so far as it would be attractive to the inmates then the meals presented to them at the moment should include fish and chips.</P>
    <P>I welcome the segregation which is envisaged here.  There is no doubt that the situation which allowed a young offender, who was in there for breaking into a shop and stealing a packet of cigarettes or a pound note, to work in the same shop and fraternise with somebody, who was in there on a much more serious charge, was not desirable. One concern I would have in the matter of a person who might be removed to Mountjoy is whether he will enjoy any segregation there or whether the offender, who from the point of view of age may not be a criminal as such, when removed from St. Patrick's to Mountjoy with a view to making space available would find himself listening to, talking to and working with criminals who may be in on very serious offences.</P>
    <P>I am not happy, when talking about providing training for those boys, that there is being provided at the moment any worthwhile instruction.  I am thinking particularly of the mat shop in St. Patrick's.  Boys are employed there and, as somebody said, most of them do not enjoy the same stability as the rest of us.  I guarantee that if any person healthy in mind and body is obliged to go in there to do a spell of two days in that mat shop he will not feel the better for it.  A situation where you have boys who are not so well balanced and who are obliged to spend day after day going through the process of making mats is undesirable.  It is undesirable also that, having acquired a certain skill in the mat shop, on leaving St. Patrick's there is not any place in Dublin or in Ireland where a boy can obtain employment of that nature.</P>
    <P>During the early days of my membership <Col N="138" /> of the St. Patrick's visiting committee I advocated the appointment of a teacher to those boys in some subjects which might benefit them.  Some of the boys might not benefit because of their short stay.  I have in mind a subject such as English. Deputy Browne spoke about the fact that those boys are not allowed to write to or to receive letters from relatives as frequently as they might like. It might be no harm to remember that some of the boys in St. Patrick's would not be able to write even the simplest letter.  That is why I suggest that while they are there instruction might be given to them.  Apart from the fact that it would enable them to communicate with their people outside if they so wished, it would enable them to leave the institution with a certain indebtedness to it and to society which enabled them to benefit to the extent that they are able to write letters, something they were not able to do when they entered.</P>
    <P>In Shanganagh we are to instruct the boys in woodwork but I do not think the nature of the woodwork instruction will enable any boy, having left, to engage in any worthwhile woodwork activities outside.  Any boy who hopes to pursue woodwork as a trade is required to have a group certificate awarded to him after an attendance of two years, sometimes three, at a post-primary school.  Unless he has already been engaged in that type of study I cannot see that, having spent six months in Shanganagh and been engaged in woodwork there, he is guaranteed any type of employment outside.  He might be able to get some casual work and perhaps through negotiation between AnCO and the trade unions it might be possible to make arrangements whereby he could be slotted in after leaving Shanganagh, but I am inclined to agree with Deputy Browne that perhaps his availability in Shanganagh is a temptation to us to have him engage in the making of furniture which can be of use to us.</P>
    <P>This is a measure on which we hear an amount of talk about psychiatric treatment.  I should not like to make little of any professional examination, of any professional qualification in this field.  On the other hand, there are <Col N="139" /> certain matters which might present themselves to anybody visiting those institutions, looking around them and finding out how come, why the boys find themselves where they are.  Anybody who does that will discover that 90 per cent of those young offenders come from broken, disturbed homes. They are sons of fathers who know them not.  If during their lives they have obtained any consideration or any consolation from any person it has been from a lady.  Those children in their earlier years invariably have been close to a mother.  They find themselves, then, after a first offence as a juvenile, sent down to Galway or Kerry, to an institution staffed by Christian brothers, staffed by men.</P>
    <P>They come back to Dublin, or to wherever they live, and get into some botheration and find themselves within the grey walls of St. Patrick's, a place, again, staffed by men in black, big men in black.  They do not feel like chatting to those men because now they realise that the misfortune that is theirs was caused originally by a man. They do not see in the men, no matter how considerate these men may be towards them, the consolation or the comfort which they need.</P>
    <P>I have said it before and I repeat it, not as a professional but as a man who feels himself blessed with common sense, that it is highly desirable, indeed essential, that we should have in St. Patrick's a lady or ladies.  I can appreciate that those of us who would be concerned for the well-being of ladies can very readily come up with some objection to having a lady within those walls.  On the other hand, I can say I am aware that it would not be too much trouble to have in St. Patrick's a matron and an assistant matron and, if possible, a third matron. If those ladies were there we would get that communication from the inmates which I feel we shall never get from the majority of the boys in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>When criticising the prisons, the situation that exists there, and when talking about our approach to punitive measures, we should bear in mind that the prisons are the inheritors of botherations <Col N="140" /> which were not of our own creation.  Perhaps we should go outside the prisons and concern ourselves more with the situation and circumstances which give rise to having inmates in St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne visualises a situation whereby offenders who are in St. Patrick's Institution and in Mountjoy would have more attention and better care than people outside.  It is no pleasure to me, and I am sure the same applies to everybody in this House, to think that we are causing pain to any person.  On the other hand, I accept the present position as being perhaps the best we can have.  When a Deputy advocates a system which would give an offender a higher standard of living than it would to the offended, he is obliged to show how that fits into the whole pattern of society.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that when somebody commits an offence, if we are to discourage this practice, there must be some form of punishment.  I should welcome the opportunity of asking Deputy Browne if he has a solution.  If the Deputy visualises young boys living in an institution having the best facilities available in the matter of education and general living standards, how does he relate that to the law-abiding boy outside who is required to do a hard day's work and who gets little thanks from society?  We must accept the situation that it is impossible to organise any society in the manner suggested by Deputy Browne.</P>
    <P>What would be the attitude of Deputy Browne in a situation where, for instance, 20 boys on parole from Shanganagh might decide to go on a housebreaking tour of Leeson Street, Baggot Street or Fitzwilliam Square? What would his attitude be if they visited his constituents and took jewellery and money from them? Would the Deputy then criticise the Minister for Justice for allowing boys who were before the courts a short time previously and were convicted of housebreaking to roam the streets of Dublin?  I do not know; perhaps the Deputy's approach would be that that is the fashion in which he sees this problem corrected.  Perhaps he has the <Col N="141" /> ability to convince the people in those areas that what was happening was in their best interests but personally I would not be prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>I understand there is one teacher in St. Patrick's Institution who is qualified to teach English and arithmetic.  I am given to believe that an occasion may arise when he may be called upon to perform other duties; it does not arise frequently but it may.  I would ask the Minister to make sure that there is a full-time teacher available to instruct the boys in the fundamentals of English.</P>

I would also appeal to him to make arrangements to have books available for the boys in St. Patrick's; the books might perhaps deal with football, motor-car racing and so on.  In this matter we should compliment the city librarian who has made books available to the boys.  I may mention that, as a member of the committee, I was very pleased that Independent Newspapers agreed to forward to the institution copies of their paper, free of charge.  I am hopeful that other newspapers, who would have us believe they are concerned with this problem, would follow the example of the <i>Irish Independent</i> in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt the Deputy's tone was rather partisan.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that we might set the interests of the community at large against those of the prisoners, and the interests of the staff against those of the prisoners.  There is always the temptation to create divisions of interest between the community as a whole and the prisoners, and between the staff and the prisoners.  This is generally unnecessary and not beneficial. We should, above all, seek to eliminate from our approach to penal policies the idea of revenge by the community or the offended on the offender for what he has done.  We do not usually specifically call it revenge but behind a lot of the fine rationalisations the idea of revenge creeps in.  We should avoid this, not only on the grounds of Christian charity, but on the grounds of simple practicality, because it does not achieve anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prisons must be used as a deterrent to further crime and also for the confinement of people dangerous to the community.  However, it is not absolutely proven that a spell in prison is, in fact, a deterrent to further crime. It does mean a confined person cannot commit another crime while he is in prison but it has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the prospect of a spell in prison deters <Col N="143" /> people from crime.  This is open to argument but I do not think we should be too dogmatic about it.</P>
    <P>I do not think the community should carp about improvements in prison conditions and better food.  I think we should have the courage to improve conditions and show the community that this is part of the process of rehabilitation which will be of benefit to the community as a whole as well as to the prisoners by leading to a fall in the crime rate.  We should not, as Deputy Tunney seemed to do, expect the worst from the prisoners in Shanganagh.  When deciding what to do with them we should not conjure up pictures of prisoners breaking their parole and going off and robbing houses all over Dublin south east.  I think the idea of looking at the worst possible eventuality in relation to what we are doing in our prisons should not become the determining factor in our policy formation.  I have sufficient confidence in the community to believe that, if we avoid giving such considerations great prominence in the formation of penal policy, the Christian charity of the people will follow us in these matters; they will not seek excessive confinement even if it does involve taking certain risks.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I also welcome the Minister's opening speech, which dealt not only with many practical reforms but also with his general attitude towards the treatment of crime in which he sees the criminal as somebody to be treated and helped rather than somebody just to be punished. While we can attribute some of this improvement to the new Minister for Justice it would be unfair not to give credit to his predecessor Deputy Moran.  I know that Deputy Moran came into conflict with this House, and indeed with my party, on many occasions but he always showed a genuine concern for prison reform. I think this Bill and the new Minister's speech are a credit to him as well.</P>
    <P>In facing the problem of rising crime we must not look simply at the basic crude figures for the crime rate which are certainly rising.  We must <Col N="144" /> look behind these figures to see the type of people committing the crime and see what is motivating them.  If we do this we will find there is a heavy concentration of crime in certain age groups, in certain social classes and in certain localities.  On the basis of British figures, which I am sure apply here, a person living in the north dock of Dublin is about eight times more likely to become a criminal than a person living in a comfortable suburb in the southern part of this city.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of figures indicating this specific relationship to Dublin but certainly figures available in Britain indicate that criminal tendencies are not something which come purely from the individual; they also come from the social environment.  People living in a deprived environment are more likely to have criminal tendencies; likewise, younger people, particularly those under the age of 23, have a much greater tendency to be involved in crime.  I think 50 per cent of the indictable offences in Britain are committed by people under 23.  This fact must also influence our approach to prison policy.  Some localities even in the same social groupings have a higher tendency to crime.  I understand the north dock area of Dublin is particularly bad whereas other areas with more or less the same standard of living have not the same crime rate. If we can find out why this is we might be able to draw some useful conclusions.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a very great increase in the amount of juvenile crime.  This is something which must cause serious concern.  In reply to a question, which I put to the Minister today, he told me that the increase in prison sentences between 1962 and 1969 in the case of people under 21 was 43 per cent.  This is an increase of almost one-half again in six or seven years.  This is a matter of considerable concern.  We have, too, the problem of recidivism, of people returning again and again to prison.  There has not been quite such a dramatic increase in recent years in recidivism but the fact is we have not made any <Col N="145" /> serious impact from the point of view of solving the problem.  In 1962 the figure was 66 per cent; in 1969 it was 70 per cent.  During the entire decade it was always somewhere in the region of 66 to 70 per cent.  We are not curing recidivists.  We are not ensuring that they do not commit further crimes.  In fact, the indications are that the problem is getting worse.</P>
    <P>A common factor in the prison population is the very low level of intelligence and of educational attainments. This was clearly borne out by the survey done by the social science department of UCD in St. Patrick's.  I am sure the same generalisation would apply, with some modification perhaps, to the prisoners in Mountjoy and in adult prisons generally.  In St. Patrick's 50 per cent were only semi-literate and 4 per cent were classified as illiterate. The most common factor in the backgrounds of these boys was the high degree of truancy from school. This indicated not just a lack of intelligence but the possibility that these boys felt uncomfortable in the school environment.  In shaping educational policy, therefore, we should examine the problems of children who mitch from school.  That may not be due merely to lack of application but to some psychological factor which makes these children fear being in class for a whole day.  It was also clear that the average intelligence quotient was very low in St. Patrick's.  It was only 84.  Some 3 per cent were classified as mentally defective.  The most remarkable figure of all, some 30 per cent&mdash;almost one-third&mdash;were classified as borderline mental defectives; in all, one-third were mentally defective.</P>

      <P>I am sure this survey is available to the Minister's Department. That is a survey carried out a few years ago by social science students in UCD on the boys in St. Patrick's.  I am surprised the Minister is not aware of it.  I hope that does not suggest the figures are invalid.  We must not look on those who engage in criminal activities as evil people.  We must <Col N="146" /> realise that society is as much, if not more, to blame for their criminal activities as they are themselves.  I have remarked a slight defect in the approach of the Department to some penal policies.  They seem to be afraid to experiment.  The experiments on the whole seem to savour of token experiments, a little bit of this sort of reform and a little bit of that sort of reform. The numbers affected by these reforms are minimal.  Until these new methods are brought to some degree of perfection we cannot, I suppose, involve too many prisoners in them.  At the same time we must avoid letting this natural fear of untried methods excuse us from using a sufficient number of prisoners in these schemes.</P>
      <P>An important scheme in preventing crime is the juvenile liaison scheme recently introduced.  The Garda officers visit people who have mild criminal records or who may have no criminal records at all but may show a tendency to criminal involvement.  There are certain defects in the service.  The officer involved is paid 10s a week. That is quite inadequate.  The work is spread all over the city.  The travelling expenses are geared to the officer using a bicycle for getting around from one place to another.  In fact most of them provide a car at their own expense. If this service is to be carried out effectively there must be adequate travelling expenses related to modern transport methods.  The men must be provided with cars and not given expenses appropriate to the use of a push-bicycle.</P>
      <P>There was a scheme under which the boys had a summer holiday extending over two weeks in Ballinakill Salesian College in Laois.  As far as I know that scheme has been discontinued.  I hope this is temporary.  We should avoid any question of departmental restriction. The travelling expenses and the removal of the summer holiday seem indicative of certain restrictions by the Department on what was a very good scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to those involved in crime.  The first question that arises is in regard to the sentence imposed. There should not be wide discrepancies in sentences as between one district <Col N="147" /> justice and another.  The Minister is, I know, concerned about this.  Wide discrepancies can have a very serious effect on the goodwill with which prisoners accept their sentences and hence on their prospects of reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue it but I wanted to make that point which I felt to be important.  We need more specialised institutions to deal with our criminal population.  There is possibly a need for special institutions such as <Col N="148" /> exist in England for first offenders, special institutions for certain types of offenders, petty thieves or violent criminals.  This is certainly the case in England in relation to younger offenders.  They have a wide spectrum of institutions among which those whose job it is to dispose of those sentenced, can choose, so as to ensure that the offenders are put into the institutions best suited to their criminal dispositions and capabilities for rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>There is a certain danger in this Bill.  From an age point of view there is a strong argument for having a third type of institution.  At present we have two.  We are now to have an institution for those aged between 16 and 19 and other institutions, the prisons, for those from 19 onwards. Those between 19 and 21 or 22 have special characteristics which would warrant the provision of a third type of institution to cater for their particular needs.  The figure given here, which indicates that at least 50 per cent of criminal offences are committed by people under 23, suggests that people in this age group have special problems not shared by those in older groups for whom, perhaps, the normal prison routine would be more appropriate. We should consider an extra institution for those between 19 and 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many of our institutions there has developed an introvert atmosphere. The main aim is to fit people to live in the community as normal law-abiding members.  Our institutions are dealing with people who, up to this, have not been able to cope with conditions as they exist in the community. The solution in many of our institutions is to take them further away from the community and the problems with which they were not able to cope as normal members of the community. They are put into a totally artificial atmosphere in the prisons.  The staff live in and they are absorbed into this artificial atmosphere also.  They do not live among the community.  Visits are restricted so that whatever the inmates learn in prison cannot be related to what would apply in the community. This is a very serious matter.  We must seek to ensure that people confined in <Col N="149" /> the prisons can apply what they learn in the community.  By bringing them further into a more artificial atmosphere we are achieving the reverse of this.</P>
    <P>In this context we should take a keen look at the present regulations restricting correspondence and visits from members of the family.  Such visits can maintain a sense of continuity and help to ensure that what is learned in the prison can be applied in the community. There can be a continuing process whereby the end is kept in sight. To avoid this introvert atmosphere we should ensure that there would be visits to prisoners by voluntary workers from outside.  People with particular aptitudes who could help prisoners in particular ways should be encouraged to visit them.  A particular voluntary worker could be assigned to a particular prisoner with whom he would have contact in the prison and outside afterwards.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important thing is the concept of day release instituted in the 1960 Criminal Justice Bill.  Particularly in the closing stages of prisoners' sentences it is very desirable that they should be able gradually to adapt themselves from the prison environment to the external environment so that they would be working while still under supervision and not suddenly projected from one atmosphere to the other.  The idea of day release greatly improves their prospects of staying in a steady job afterwards because probably the biggest problem for many of them is to stay at the job for the first few days, to become accustomed to working at a job.  Possibly many of them have not had a job before and if the crucial period in the job can be undertaken while still in institutional care the prospects of permanence in a steady job are greatly enhanced.</P>
    <P>While this is a good idea which has been lauded by many people there is evidence that it is not being applied with sufficient vigour.  In 1966, I understand that 42 prisoners were sent out on day release for employment.  In 1969, the figure was 44.  This represents an increase but when one considers that the daily average prison population between 1966 and 1969 rose from 169 <Col N="150" /> to 195 one can see that the proportion of prisoners on day release for employment has, in fact, decreased in the case of St. Patrick's Institution.  If day release is such a good idea&mdash;I believe it is and I think the Minister does&mdash; surely the proportion of prisoners availing of it should not have fallen between 1966 and 1969 as was the case?  I think the same applies in regard to day release from Mountjoy.  I am not sure if I have the actual figures but I do not think there has been a very significant increase between 1968 and 1969.  More prisoners should be involved.</P>
    <P>It is also important to try to ensure that prisoners develop a sense of responsibility in prison.  We are very often putting them into an atmosphere in which they have to accept less responsibility for their actions than they had when they were outside.  Everything is done for them.  The lights are turned off.  The doors are shut.  They are fed.  They have to do very little for themselves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps part of their problems was to acquire a sense of responsibility and an ability to accept responsibility. Perhaps not having this ability to accept responsibility was a big causative factor in their going in for criminal activities.  Therefore, it is very unfortunate that the prison machine should be such that it lessens the area of responsibility which prisoners have. We should consider the possibility of involving prisoners in some way in the daily running of the prisons.  I know this is a proposal which could very easily be misinterpreted but prisoners should be involved in some way in the running of the prison, in certain daily routine matters.  There should be some consultation and they should be given the running of certain matters.</P>
    <P>We should also encourage the idea of having discussion groups amongst prisoners guided by people who are competent in the subjects to be discussed. These discussions groups need not necessarily confine themselves to matters of immediate prison interest but should cover matters of general interest. Even political matters could usefully be discussed among the prisoners.  This would help to develop their sense of responsibility about what <Col N="151" /> is going on in the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we look after the health of the prisoners.  I questioned the former Minister for Justice at some length about the food in Mountjoy or in the prisons in general. I did not get a fully satisfactory answer from him as to whether or not there was sufficient protein in the food. I think he took me up wrongly.  He was not quite sure when I was asking and he thought I asked him was there enough starch in it.  I have not as yet got a clear answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that in some prisons throughout the world the prisoners do not maintain a reasonable standard of physical fitness, that they become flabby and are not fit.  I do not know if this applies to our prisons but I would welcome an assurance on this matter.  We should also ensure that the food is nutritious. In relation to the food there is a remarkable sameness in the reports of the visiting committees.  The same phraseology is used every year in the part of the report of the visiting committees which is quoted in the annual report on prisons.  I have not got the actual quotation here but it looks as if the inspection of the food is of a rather routine character when the same phraseology is repeated every year in describing the quality of the food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of training facilities in St. Patrick's Institution and Mountjoy.  The big problem with many criminals is that they have not the training to enable them to fit into a niche in the community and as a result they turn to crime.  We should do all we can to remedy this.  In relation to St. Patrick's Institution an objection which was made to extending the training facilities was that the average stay in that institution is four months only.  This is a very valid objection but, of course, there are a substantial number of prisoners who stay for much <Col N="152" /> longer than four months.  We should have special concern for the training of these people.</P>
    <P>While the average stay of prisoners might be only four months, many of them return again for another four months, and perhaps another four months.  There is a possibility that the training which had been initiated in the first four months could be continued although this, of course, has certain dangerous possibilities.  It might encourage them to come back.  We should not consider this figure of the average stay being four months as a restrictive factor.  There are many people who stay much longer.  There should be training facilities for them to ensure that they get full and proper training, training which can secure recognition.  A problem in relation to the trade unions giving recognition to the training given in St. Patrick's Institution was mentioned.  This should certainly be looked into particularly by members of the Labour Party who have an influence in this field.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how much time per day is spent by the average prisoner in being trained.  It is all right to say: &ldquo;The prisoners are trained daily in the following matters,&rdquo; but if they are being trained for one hour only every day, or perhaps half an hour every day, this is not adequate. We should ensure that as much time as possible is spent in useful and reformative activities and not mere drudgery which has no permanent value.  I should like some more concrete indication from the Minister as to the amount of time spent in training and as to the level of ability which is acquired by these people as a result of that training.  I should like some more definite information in this field and not just an enumeration of the subjects taught.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of remedial treatment for people whose education has been inadequate.  I understand from Deputy Tunney's contribution that there is a teacher in St. Patrick's Institution.  I was not aware of this.  I would be interested to know what are the qualifications of this person.  I would also be interested to know how much of the time of these <Col N="153" /> people who are in need of such remedial education is spent on learning to read and write.  Is it just a token half an hour every day, or are they given four or five hours tuition?</P>
    <P>I also notice that the Minister is again talking about hoping to appoint an educational psychologist in the near future.  We have been hoping to appoint an educational psychologist in the near future for the past two years, but he has not yet been appointed. I wonder why.  I already mentioned the people who are mentally defective.  What facilities are there for those people in the prisons?  It is one thing to talk about remedial education for people who are reasonably intelligent but who have not reached a certain standard but it is another thing to talk about people who are mentally incapacitated: What special <Col N="154" /> facilities are there for those people to enable them to adapt?</P>
    <P>We must divide these two problems. They need different forms of treatment. I should like some specific information from the Minister indicating the level of improvement reached in respect of these people, the amount of time spent on them and the number of personnel involved.  We need much more information.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a very useful feature of the recent reforms in this field has been the appointment of welfare officers who involve themselves in this work of placement of prisoners in jobs in the community.</P>

      <P>There are serious practical difficulties in providing pre-service training for prison officers.  Normally these officers are recruited at such irregular intervals and in such small numbers that pre-service training would be impracticable.</P>
      <P>While I do not entirely exclude the possibility of pre-service training on exceptional occasions when a large number are recruited simultaneously, I consider that the intensification of in-service training for recruit officers which I propose to bring about offers the best prospect of using our training resources most efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice why the annual reports on prisons for 1967, 1968 and 1969 have not yet been published; and if a similar delay can be anticipated in respect of the report for 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to a combination of unusual factors, including staff shortages and consideration of an alteration in the format of the annual prison reports, printing of the 1967 and 1968 reports has, unfortunately, been unduly delayed.  It is expected however that both reports can be published together very shortly, probably next week.</P>
      <P>The 1969 report has been sent for printing and is expected to be available in about a months time.  Having regard to the need to compile the various statistics and other material and to normal printing delays, it is not practicable to publish a report much earlier than the middle of the following year.  This target publication date will be met this year and I likewise expect to have the report for 1970 published by the following June.</P>

      <P>All the information requested by the Deputies is not, I regret, available.  Selection of centres for inclusion in the five year extended rural kiosk programme is being based mainly on the extent to which the call office telephone is used in the local post office.  This use is growing rapidly in some areas and decreasing in others and it would be premature to decide several years in advance the order in which the rural kiosks will be provided. Accordingly, at this stage, a firm programme has been settled only for the year from 1st April, 1970.</P>
