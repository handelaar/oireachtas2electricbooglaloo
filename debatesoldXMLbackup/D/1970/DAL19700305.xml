    <Title>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 1969: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>For once, I was glad to be on the same foot as the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night.  I am sure the Minister did not particularly mind, but at least I was able to make the point that if you invest £6 million in something and you cut imports by £6 million without increasing prices at home, this in itself is a tremendous advantage to the economy.  My criticism of the Verolme dockyard was of a different sort, entirely on a different basis, and was justified in my opinion.</P>
      <P>About Nítrigin Éireann, however, the year after it was established&mdash;I was never in it although I have passed by it on several occasions&mdash;I was told by a man with a considerable scientific background who has a successful agricultural business in this city, that he was astounded this company was so successful.  I was not a bit astounded at their success.  I supported the idea in the other House and naturally when one supports something at its birth it gives one pleasure to see it doing well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2147" /> Perhaps I should say a word of commendation about the management of the company.  I shall not mention names although names have been mentioned in connection with this company. The company have turned the town of Arklow into a boom town.  It is a town that I go through fairly frequently. Were it not for the establishment of this company we would inevitably be brought back to the stage where the international fertiliser cartel could do what they liked to us.  I have heard it said, I do not know with what truth, that the company have come to terms with the cartel.  I do not think it matters particularly whether it has or not so long as our farmers get their fertilisers at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan raised the point about the State guarantees for borrowings by the company and said that the statutory limit had already been exceeded. The reason these companies are given State guarantees is because the rate of interest on an overdraft, if there is a State guarantee, is 1 per cent under the normal overdraft rate. I think the Minister was correct in putting the figure of £2 million into the Bill in place of the £1 million which was previously there because the company has an overdraft of £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>Comment has been made about the £100 ordinary capital which companies like this have.  I was around when that figure was decided on by senior officials in the Department of Finance. I could never understand why we could not have £10 ordinary capital.  I know that a minimum of seven shares were necessary and then a few more shares were always added on in case it was necessary ever to prise out a director who had a share, so the figure of £100 was agreed upon.  The odd position about this company is that the capital is now £4,712,100; it would not matter if it was £4,712,101, but it would look neater if it was a round figure.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Minister's brief which I did not understand was the end of paragraph 17 where he said: &ldquo;...and leaves all options open in the future&rdquo;.  I do not understand the significance of keeping all options open in the future.  The reason for doing so is <Col N="2148" /> rather unusual.  The Minister said earlier in that paragraph:</P>
    <P>Under the 1963 provision, the Schedule to the 1963 Act, which in effect provides the machinery for the State's control of the company, operates as long as the Minister for Finance holds any shares in the company or any money is due to him by the company.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the owner of the ordinary share capital of the company, as long as he is the majority shareholder, controls the company although he may only be able to exercise that control at the annual general meeting.  It has taken a good deal of trouble to do this job.  If I cast my mind back I would suggest that the reason is because the Department of Industry and Commerce is as overstaffed as it ever was, which gives them a lot of time to consider things which do not matter a fiddle-de-dee.  There is nothing wrong with letting the interest accumulate in advance and dealing with it in this way.  I have not the slightest doubt that this company will, in due course, give a return on the new capital belonging to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister makes an apology about a certain statement he made on the accounts of the company. It was good of the Minister to give this explanation about the way things have turned out but I do not regard it as a matter of great importance.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the House that this is a reasonable way of restructuring the company's capital and of meeting the undertakings that have been given in respect of the original advances and the interest on them.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be first to admit it could have been done in other reasonable ways, but I will not quarrel with him about the way he has done it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Donegan and Deputy Dr. O'Donovan for their approach to this Bill.  It is quite clear, if there was any doubt about this company before, that it now has the support of all sides of the House, both the practical support involved in enacting this legislation <Col N="2149" /> and also the very important moral support for its operations.  This support is by no means misplaced.  I think the performance of the company has indicated this.</P>
      <P>I drew attention in my opening speech to a particular fact which I feel I should underline again, because it appears that I may not have made it quite clear.  Deputy Donegan made the point when he said that the £6 million capital originally provided was not enough.  There is a misunderstanding here.  I want to draw the attention of the House again to the fact that the £6 million was provided for the original plant which was to produce nitrogenous fertilisers but, since the plant went into operation, in addition to the original plant, the company has installed and successfully operated the necessary plant for the production of concentrated complete fertilisers which is a very substantial item of CAN.</P>
      <P>It has increased by three times its nitric acid capacity.  It produces liquid carbon dioxide and supplies most of the market here for that and it supplies all the market for dry ice.  These activities which took place after the company went into operation were not scheduled in the original estimation of £6 million.  The company has managed to do this without a further advance from the State other than the fact that, as I have explained, some of the repayments which might have been expected were not, in fact, exacted from the company.  I have also indicated that, in my view, this was the right course. I think the taxpayer has got excellent value for his money in the investment in this company.</P>
      <P>As I tried to make clear, too, the financial gearing of this company was just not satisfactory.  It was totally dependent on loan capital rather than investment capital and the proposals in this Bill, I think, produce a reasonable gearing which should enable the company to operate satisfactorily and, at the same time, to remunerate the capital involved to the State in the same way as any private enterprise commercial operation would be expected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan also referred to the <Col N="2150" /> rationalisation of the marketing operations of NET and the private enterprise sector and the close co-operation between them.  This is true.  However, I should like to make it clear, lest there be any doubt about it, that I have issued a directive to the company that, while I am glad to see the savings which are being effected as a result of this, the company is not to engage in activities which could be deemed to be the formation of a cartel or a monopoly with the private enterprise sector.  This is not something that I want to see the company doing.  The balance between rationalisation and a monopoly position is perhaps sometimes difficult to realise, but I am quite certain that no State company should lend itself to a cartel or monopoly situation in the market here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has his price control mechanism anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there are other factors in it besides price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ways of getting around price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to point out, in case it might not be quite clear, that the original £6 million which was advanced to NET was given in several different instalments over the period from 1962 to 1965 and, as a particular instalment was paid, it became subject to the then prevailing rate of interest.  These advances of money were at an interest rate of either six or 6¼ per cent.  After the enactment of this Bill, interest at the rate of 6¼ per cent will be payable by NET to the Minister for Finance on the residue of £2½ million from the original £6 million advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the investment in this, I should like to reiterate what Deputy O'Donovan said, that is, that we have here a company with a high degree of technology.  Indeed, to appreciate just how high that degree of technology is, one would really want to visit the plant.  It is quite an impressive operation.  It is provided by Irish people and it is providing 700 jobs, I think virtually all male employment, and it is saving us very substantial <Col N="2151" /> sums in imports.  It is also achieving a reasonable amount of exports. On any test it has been a very worthwhile operation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to argue with the figure quoted by Deputy Donegan.  A lot depends on how you approach this question.  It can be argued that, on the enactment of this Bill, the only investment, as such, by the State will amount to £4,712,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would lose that argument with any businessman in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This depends on whether you will have your advances repaid and your capital remunerated, does it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances the Minister would lose that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis the investment per worker would be £6,731, that is per job.  I do not want to argue with Deputy Donegan but even if one accepts the figure which he arrived at, as he said, in this day and age it is not excessive for this kind of industry. The fact that it is an Irish Industry, Irish controlled, with Irish management and workers is a plus as far as all of us are concerned.  I did not misunderstand Deputy Donegan.  He was not complaining about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He was simply underlining this as a fact.  Deputy O'Donovan referred to something I said in my opening statement.  He was not making a major point of it and I will not make a major point of replying to it except to say that I endeavoured to explain what was being done here, which has been done in the case of other State companies.  The existing legal provision is that as long as there is any share held by or any money due to the Minister for Finance, then State control over the company operates.  The amendment as proposed in this Bill has the effect of saying that that control operates only in relation to the majority control of the <Col N="2152" /> shares or where there is any money due to the State.</P>
      <P>This is largely academic because, as I pointed out, for quite a considerable time to come there will be money due to the State.  Even if it came to the question of the shares, obviously the Minister for Finance, whoever he might be at any particular stage, would think carefully before he would dispose of shares and leave himself with either no shares or in a minority shareholding position.  He would be in a position to impose such terms and conditions as would be necessary before he would be prepared to part with any shares if he decided so to do, or if the Government of the day decided so to do because that, in effect, is what would be involved.  Therefore, it is, as I say, an academic question at the moment but it leaves open options in the future to the Government of the day as to whether they wish to maintain full State control, or partial State control and partial private investment, or full private investment.  I think it is an advantage that these options should be left open to the Government of the day.  I thank the House for the reception given to this Bill and I look forward to its enactment quite soon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>(1) Section 7 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1) after &ldquo;and the payment of the interest&rdquo; of &ldquo;or the due payment by the Company of instalments of moneys outstanding under a contract entered into by the Company or the interest on any such moneys outstanding or both the payment of such instalments and such interest.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(2) In section 7 (4) (c) of the Principal Act and section 6 of this Act &ldquo;principal&rdquo; shall be construed as including moneys outstanding under a contract entered into by the Company, and in sections 9 (b) and 9 (c) of the Principal Act &ldquo;moneys borrowed&rdquo; shall be construed as including moneys outstanding under a contract entered into by the Company.</P>
      <P>I am proposing this amendment because of terms now offered by plant suppliers to the company on a current purchase.  The plant is offered on advantageous terms to be paid for by instalments over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2155" /> The suppliers, or their bankers, want the arrangement guaranteed by me as if the capital sum were being borrowed by the company.  The wording of the section dealing with guarantees in the 1963 Act does not cover a transaction of this kind, although there is no great difference of substance, and it is now proposed to make this provision to cover the case.  The total sums that may be guaranteed in this way or by direct borrowing will remain within the overall limit of £2 million.  Particulars of these guarantees, in whatever form, will be laid annually before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the new section is required to expand the meaning of the words &ldquo;principal&rdquo; and &ldquo;moneys borrowed&rdquo; where used in connection with guarantees, so as to cover transactions of this kind.  I think this is of benefit to the company and creates no additional danger as far as the investment of the State is concerned.</P>

    <P>Under Vote 27 the main items comprising the Supplementary Estimates are £100,000 for voluntary youth organisations, £64,000 for primary school transport, and £20,000 for the training of physical education teachers.</P>
    <P>In his financial statement last year, the Minister for Finance announced the Government's intention to give a new and forceful impetus to the provision of sporting and recreational facilities and that £100,000 would be provided in the current financial year to enable a commencement to be made.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the debt the nation owes to the many movements and associations which organise physical recreation facilities for our young people and they are fully committed to helping them continue their good work and to broaden the spectrum of recreational opportunity.</P>
    <P>Now is the opportune time to plan ahead so that the enthusiasms of youth can be channelled into activities that are exciting and challenging and which also contribute towards the development of responsible citizens.</P>
    <P>At the older level, it is important for the general morale of the country that our athletes perform creditably in international competition.  To do this they must be given better training and <Col N="2157" /> coaching facilities than existed heretofore.</P>
    <P>National youth and sporting organisations were invited recently to contact my Department.  Those that replied have received a detailed questionnaire and the completed replies are being processed.  When the processing is completed we will have a comprehensive picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the present provision and we can assess where immediate assistance is needed most.</P>
    <P>Due to the increased rate of school amalgamations and the reduction of the qualifying age for transport from five to four years the primary school transport services have so expanded that an additional £64,000 will be required to finance them.</P>
    <P>As no provision existed here for the training of men teachers of physical education it was decided to send a number of men abroad to be trained at Strawberry Hill, London.  It is the intention to provide a men's training college here.</P>
    <P>A provision of £5,000 is being made under subhead H.14 for the purpose of a grant-in-aid to An Grianán, Termonfeckin, County Louth.  Deputies are aware of the very valuable work being done at An Grianán and this grant is intended in particular as aid of the expenditure on fees for lecturers and teachers engaged on the adult education courses.  It may also be used towards meeting expenditure arising in connection with the administration of the Irish Countrywomen's Association centre in Termonfeckin.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made at subhead H.15 of the Vote for payment of a grant to the Union of Students in Ireland towards the cost of the reconstruction of its premises in Harcourt Street, Dublin.  I consider that the USI, as representative of students in third level education in Ireland, deserves this support in the matter of the provision of suitable office premises for its educational activities.  The grant is, of course, related to this particular purpose and the question of a recurring grant in this connection does not arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> Savings of £56,000 on other subheads of the Vote reduce the amount of the Supplementary Estimates required from £211,000 to £155,000.</P>
    <P>Under Vote 28 there are two items requiring additional expenditure&mdash; training colleges: £107,000; teachers' salaries: £1,300,000.  Rising costs are in the main responsible for the additional requirements of the training colleges.  Extern students have for the first time been taken into these colleges this year at a cost of £25,000.  The implementation of the 11th round salary award and the Ryan Tribunal award in respect of qualifications are the principal reasons for the increased provision required for teachers' salaries.</P>
    <P>As regards Vote 29, the supplementary estimate is required to meet the additional expenditure arising in subheads A.1 and B.  The payment of the balance of the salary increases resulting from the agreement of March, 1969, necessitates a further expenditure of £900,000.  Because of the very large increase in pupil numbers an additional £130,000 is needed for capitation grants.</P>
    <P>For Vote 30 the sum of £1,454,000 is required to enable the committees to cater for the growth in services in the current year and to meet increases in teachers' remuneration.</P>
    <P>A sum of £40,000 is required to meet the cost of increased maintenance allowances of trainees on the Department's training courses for teachers.</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £70,000 is required for the running costs of the regional technical colleges, most of which will go towards the purchase of additional scientific equipment.</P>
    <P>In the matter of capital costs an additional sum of £460,000 is required for building work on the regional technical colleges in the present financial year.  The bulk of the additional expenditure in question is due to the work on the colleges having proceeded more rapidly than anticipated.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £81,000 under Vote 31&mdash;reformatory and industrial schools&mdash;results from a decision to double the maintenance grants for children committed to these schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2159" /> The increase which was awarded with effect from 1st August, 1969, will enable a higher all-round standard of care and amenities to be provided for the children in the schools in question.</P>
    <P>In the case of Vote 32 a net additional amount of £848,000 is being provided for the universities and colleges. These additional grants are in respect of both current and capital expenditure.  The additional amount for current expenditure is £506,000. In the case of capital expenditure an additional amount of £442,000 on subheads C.2 (a) and L is offset to the extent of a saving of £100,000 on subhead D.2 (a).</P>
    <P>The additional current grants are being provided for University College, Dublin, University College, Cork, University College, Galway, Trinity College, Dublin and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  Increased expenditure arising from the provision of additional staff and equipment and adjustments in salaries has resulted in deficits in the college accounts.  I consider that the additional grants being made available through this supplementary estimate should put the colleges in a position to make suitable arrangements to balance annual expenditure and income as from the beginning of the financial year 1970-71.</P>
    <P>An additional capital grant of £400,000 is being provided for University College, Cork, to meet the expenditure arising in connection with the erection of the new science building. The progress of the work has been greater than anticipated at the time of the preparation of the original estimate.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be in a position to inform the Dáil that a site has been acquired for the new Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  The purchase price is £70,000 and £40,000 of this amount is payable before 31st March, 1970.  The balance will be provided in the Estimate for 1970-71. The site is on the banks of the Shannon between Plassey Bridge and Plassey Falls, about 2½ miles to the east of the centre of Limerick city and about 400 yards off the main Dublin/Limerick <Col N="2160" /> road.  I should wish to take this opportunity to thank the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of the Limerick, Clare and Tipperary (NR) Regional Development Organisation for their report on various sites which they inspected and considered for the purpose of location of the institute. The committee regarded the Plassey site as the most suitable for this purpose and the necessary steps have already been taken for its acquisition.</P>

      <P>At this stage perhaps I should point out that the debate on the Supplementary Estimate is confined to the various subheads in the Estimate and the general debate on education will come up on the token Supplementary Estimate, No. 27, which has been referred back at the end of the list of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Even before knowing your ruling I had intended to confine myself to the matters raised in this Supplementary Estimate.  In view of the imminence of the general education debate it would be a pity if we duplicated everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the matters covered by these Supplementary Estimates to which I should like to refer in some detail because it is a matter of current controversy and of great difficulty and one which I think ought <Col N="2161" /> to be discussed in view of the dangerous situation which has arisen.  I refer to the problem of teachers' salaries.  However, before coming to that I wish to deal briefly with one or two of the other matters referred to in the Minister's speech and covered by these Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>I welcome as a step in the right direction the £100,000 provided for voluntary youth organisations.  I am glad that something is at last being done in this area.  However, I would ask the Minister to what extent has this money been spent in the current year.  Are we talking only of a token or has the Minister, in pursuance of the policy previously announced, been able to get something done?  Will we find ourselves at the end of the financial year with some or a large part of this money unspent?  Is it merely a gesture?  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us in reply that, in fact, the money will have been spent and that our youth organisations will have benefited from this provision during the current year.</P>
    <P>The need for something of the kind has been evident for a long time past. Indeed, those of us who recently had occasion to spend more time than we normally would in areas like Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Walkinstown and Drimnagh are, perhaps, more than ordinarily conscious of this need.  This is an area where remarkable work is being done by the youth clubs that exist, but as the candidate of our party in the campaign had occasion to remark more than once, as a youth leader in that area he found that most of his time was taken up trying to raise funds, instead of carrying out the functions of a youth leader, trying to help the young people in the area to develop themselves and benefit from the opportunities such councils provide.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister in replying will tell us that this money has been spent. I hope that, given the intention to provide this money and the fact that today the Dáil will pass this Supplementary Estimate, plans have been made to ensure that these youth organisations benefit immediately.  This sum, even spread over the large number of youth organisations existing, could make <Col N="2162" /> quite an impact because many of them operate on a shoestring.  I know some clubs operate on such very small sums of money because of the immense amount of voluntary help given but a cash sum even of some hundreds of pounds, and certainly of several thousand pounds, would make an extraordinary difference to them and would enable them to raise their sights and take their minds off fund-raising problems and get down to the job they are supposed to do.</P>
    <P>The need for this cannot be emphasised sufficiently.  The problems of juvenile delinquency in the areas I have mentioned and other areas are not the sole reason for doing something of this kind: that is a negative reason.  Nor is the absence of youth clubs the sole reason for juvenile delinquency but none of us can doubt the immense value rapid expansion of youth organisations could have in such areas.</P>
    <P>When in France several years ago in the summer I was impressed to find how well organised youth clubs were there.  When we arrived at a seaside resort there was there a Maison des Jeunes, part of a network of such clubs throughout the country.  For the payment of about 10/- any young person could become a member of this and all other such clubs.  The club in this village, because it was a small place recently developed, was not particularly well-equipped.  The building was old and the facilities meagre and it was unrepresentative, I gathered, of the majority of these clubs, many of which are very well equipped in very modern buildings.  There was a building there and when young people arrived they were not left to hang around cafés on their own and get into trouble.  There was somewhere they could go to meet other young people in an atmosphere that had some kind of leadership and some opportunities to do something constructive.  There was the possibility of playing various indoor games if it rained as it does, even on the Continent in the month of August.  One could develop one's artistic abilities in painting classes.  There was a photographic studio where you could develop your own photographs.  There were a number of features like this and also <Col N="2163" /> dances and so on that provided a centre for young people.  Most of those coming there were members of Maison des Jeunes in their own local areas.  They had a network of clubs.</P>
    <P>It seems we should be thinking in these terms and looking forward to the time in this country when, as people move from place to place and young people move from country to city or, hopefully, from one city to another as we achieve better mobility of labour, and as people go on holiday to the seaside, they will automatically go to the local club to which they will be affiliated through membership of the club in their own area and in this way we will help to ensure more constructive development of youth than has been possible hitherto.</P>
    <P>I also hope that in these clubs the present segregation of the sexes will be limited.  Segregation is not always imposed from above.  In a case I know the problem of eliminating segregation arose from the fact that it was a boys' club and the boys showed marked reluctance to allow in girls. Eventually, they agreed to do so on certain week nights only, when boys would not be there and ultimately they agreed to have debates occasionally between the two groups.  There was no question of any clerical hand imposing segregation: it was a self-operating process.  Youth clubs could provide a healthy environment for contact between the opposite sexes which at present is minimal, thereby leading to the development of attitudes which are dangerous for the ultimate stability of married life by creating a kind of male-dominated environment, male orientation which is anti-pathetic to family life later or, alternatively, perhaps young people come together in circumstances which are unsatisfactory and likely to lead to difficulties.  Unsegregated youth clubs seem to be the right answer.</P>
    <P>The main thing is that money is being provided.  I hope it will be spent. I have always a fear when a sum like this is provided that the administrative process of clearing the sums to be allocated is such that the amount of money actually reaching people is very <Col N="2164" /> small.  The concern for accountability, which is part of our administrative system and which has played a great part in ensuring continued respect for the integrity of the public service, has the disadvantage when a new scheme comes in that it is very difficult to get the money out.</P>
    <P>We all recall the export grant scheme arising out of the British import levies when, for many months, no money was paid out under that scheme because of extremely stringent control leading to utter frustration on the part of the industrialists and, I feel, of the Minister who introduced the scheme. In this instance I hope there will not be too many formalities and that if a genuine club comes along with responsible people in charge who say, &ldquo;We need some money for this purpose or that&rdquo; the money will be given without having to fill up too many forms or explain what they are doing in great detail and without having to go up to every level in the public service and down again.</P>
    <P>Not totally unconnected with this in a way is the provision for the Union of Students in Ireland.  I welcome the provision of a grant for the reconstruction of the premises in Harcourt Street. This is a concrete recognition by the Government of the role of students and their organisations.  It will not come amiss to say that I also welcome the decision of the Government to appoint the current president of the Students Representative Council in UCD to the governing body.  Within the present rigid framework of the charter of NUI and its colleges that was all the Government could do to ensure a measure of student representation. While the immediate reaction of some of the students was not very encouraging this is in part due to misunderstandings. The Government did what they could in the circumstances and acted properly and wisely.  This further recognition of student organisations in this Supplementary Estimate is welcome.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extra provision for training colleges and the reference to the fact that extern students may be taken into these colleges for the first time.  It always struck me as extraordinary <Col N="2165" /> that our system of education for primary teachers required us to lock them up in institutions.  They were for many years virtually locked up on very stringent terms as if they were children of 14 in a boarding school. It seemed we could not train primary teachers without locking them up in this way whereas other kinds of teachers attended university courses in the ordinary way as young adults. This distinction seemed totally inappropriate. It has come out of another era and how it survived into the twentieth century, never mind into the final third of that century, I cannot understand.  Residential education is desirable; I am not suggesting otherwise. On the contrary I should like to see a great extension of it and see the Government helping, perhaps by Government guarantees of money raised from outside sources, the universities to establish residences for their students on the campus.</P>
    <P>The fact that they do not have any residential element on the campus of colleges of the NUI is a great weakness of the NUI colleges and an aspect of our system where Trinity College has a clear advantage in that they have residences for some of the students on the campus some of the time.  There have been efforts to fill this gap by providing residences near the existing site of the old college in Dublin and also I think in other university centres. This is not the same thing.  University residences should be on the campus, part of the university, run by it and managed by the staff and students themselves as a genuine integral part of university life.  I am all for this.  I am not suggesting that it is undesirable as an element of primary teacher training.  On the contrary it is very desirable that it should be extended but what I think is undesirable is the system under which you must go into residence in the case of primary teaching and you cannot go into residence in the case of the universities.  This is irrational.  To say they may not attend the course unless they attend in a residential way under the sorts of conditions that did prevail when they were literally locked up and were not allowed out is undesirable and could hardly <Col N="2166" /> contribute to the maturity of the teachers emerging from it.</P>
    <P>I am glad this is being changed and that the system is now more open.  I hope that most primary teachers will continue to benefit from the residential arrangements.  In fact it is enormously costly to provide these facilities.  The system of entry and the various provisions governing entry and the residential requirement were all factors which combined to create a situation in which the great bulk of the students came from rural areas and indeed from particular counties in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This had very undesirable consequences and you had this extraordinary skewed sample of people in primary teaching.  It meant that in a city like Dublin the proportion of teachers from Dublin in primary schools was small. The very marked differences in cultural environment between Dublin and Cork and other major cities in the country has meant there has been a real difficulty because, as a result of this extraordinary selection of primary teachers, pupils in Dublin schools have not had the benefit of being taught by people having a similar background.  The system of primary education in Dublin has been almost colonial in character, with people from a different cultural environment teaching and the pupils having no opportunity even of aspiring to enter the primary teaching profession because of cultural and financial barriers and because of the Irish language requirement, which is a big factor for those coming from a background where the language does not play a very big part.  Therefore, because of all these things they felt they had not an opportunity of getting into the primary teaching profession.</P>
    <P>There was, therefore, a cultural barrier created and this has contributed, among other things, to the maintenance of a class barrier in Dublin. The fact that extern students are being taken in helps to open up primary teaching to Dublin people, and I think this is a good thing.  At the same time, I hope the residential facility will continue and that the Minister will see his way to assist the universities to develop residential accommodation.  This may not necessarily require a Government <Col N="2167" /> grant.  It may be possible to raise money for this facility from abroad, to use these residences in the summer period for tourist purposes and recover part of the cost so that the university subsidy might not have to be very great.  The possibility of a Government guarantee for any money raised might reduce the cost and help the universities to get ahead with this task.  The Minister and the Higher Education Authority should direct their attention to this aspect as university life is impoverished because this facility is not available.  This is a matter on which one would not require Dublin students to become involved as most of them live in their own homes.</P>
    <P>On the question of the provision for regional technical colleges, I shall come back to this in the main debate.  I merely want to say there is concern as to whether these regional technical colleges are developing in the way it was intended.  There have been reports that they are not attracting the kind and level of students which was expected and that they are moving out of their intended operational sphere to compete with secondary schools in the area. This is something about which one should be concerned.  We want to open up for students the different streams of education and to get rid of any barrier between the vocational and secondary sides, which is something we are all keen on, although in regard to woodwork and metalwork teachers the Minister's Department has not been helping much by its lack of arrangements for this kind of teaching in secondary schools.  We are all in favour of this integration but it does not mean that if you establish higher colleges of technology to provide technician courses you help the situation by then turning them into secondary schools. The Minister should tell us something about development in this area, the number of pupils in the technical colleges and the courses they are following and he could relate this back to public statements of the intention in regard to these technical colleges.  It would be interesting to see if what is happening corresponds to the intention.</P>
    <P>The doubling of the maintenance <Col N="2168" /> grant for the reformatory and industrial schools is overdue.  The very fact that the grant has been increased by such an amount reflects the extraordinary inadequacy of this grant.  The fact is that the State has been appallingly neglectful in this area: the circumstances in which these schools have to be run on the kind of money provided have made it impossible for those running them to create the proper environment that might help the young people to benefit.  In many cases, they have suffered by being in those schools.  It is hopeless to expect people to run an institution of this kind on the kind of money being provided and create the proper conditions required to rehabilitate and develop the young people who have got into difficulties, where there is parental inadequacy or where there is a problem of home environment.  The doubling of the grant is not adequate, but it is a recognition and a confession of past inadequacy and I am glad that we have at least reached that point.  I do not think anyone in this House would demur at a further increase in this grant in the near future, bearing in mind how inadequate it has been up to now.</P>
    <P>On universities and colleges, again I do not wish to widen the debate, but the provisions made in the Supplementary Estimates enable us to say a few words on this subject.  In his concluding sentence about the university colleges in general the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I consider that the additional grants being made available through this Supplementary Estimate should put the colleges in a position to make suitable arrangements to balance annual expenditure and income as from the beginning of the financial year 1970-71.</P>
    <P>I hope that is the case, but I very much doubt it.  The history of the financial relationship between the university colleges and the Department of Education, if published, would not reflect credit on the Department of Education.  The university colleges have been conned by the Department more than once, the juggling of finances that goes on is designed to <Col N="2169" /> cover up the inadequacy of the provision, and at times one finds that what is given with one hand is taken away with the other.  However, it is done with such skill and sleight-of-hand even the academics find it difficult to discover precisely what has happened and how the money they thought they get has disappeared so quickly.</P>
    <P>The whole question of university finances needs to be put on a proper footing.  The Government have to decide as a matter of policy, advised by the HEA, what scale of university education they want, and they must make the provision required to enable that scale of university education to be provided in conditions that will enable our colleges to maintain their standards <i>vis-á-vis</i> those of other countries.  Hitherto, there has been a policy lacuna between the colleges in the the Government.  The colleges in the past tended to think, on the one hand, that it was their duty to take in all those who applied, at a very low standard of entry&mdash;the pass leaving certificate&mdash;and, on the other hand, if they performed what they regarded as their national duty they thought the Government would be forced to provide for the students they had taken in.  The colleges believed that there was an accepted national policy providing university education for those who qualified for it.  I think they were wrong in having such a low entry standard and were right to raise it, although I do not agree with their method.  However, the colleges were under the impression that the Government approved this policy.  They believed that, if they took in people at this low standard, the Government had a duty to and would make provision for these students.  I am afraid the faith of the universities in the Government lasted too long.  They went on year after year hoping that if they took in students and if there was temporary overcrowding, the Government would see there was money available to provide adequate buildings and staff.  They took a long time to wake up to the fact that the Government had no such intention and that the Government's only policy was to minimise the provision of university education and let the <Col N="2170" /> universities bear the brunt of any overcrowding that followed.  Invariably tensions were created in many cases and universities now have to face this.</P>
    <P>In the years ahead the Minister will not find universities willing to continue with an open-ended policy of this kind unless the Government are prepared to make the necessary financial provision. It is not the intention of any of our colleges, when they get all the new buildings so long overdue, to continue in the overcrowded conditions in which they are in the buildings they will be leaving.  The Minister will have to face it: if he does not make provision for accommodation, to start with, to cater for the additional students, the universities will have to control the growth of their entry, either by raising standards on the one hand&mdash;there is, I think, still room for that, although the type of entry qualification required might be modified; the idea of two honours is something which is bad because it encourages specialisation&mdash;or they will have to control entry into particular faculties numerically or through the medium of competition.  None of these things is desirable, but the Government have to bear the responsibility of deciding whether they want such a restricted policy or whether they want an open-ended policy.</P>
    <P>The Government are entitled to a big voice in this and the universities are not attempting to deny the Government's voice in this.  If, at some point, the Government are prepared to provide for X thousand students in a year then the university will take steps&mdash;the best steps they can take&mdash;to give effect to that Government policy.  The universities may feel that some particular Government policy is too restrictive and they will argue against it, but they will work within it.  In the past they have accepted the Government policy to be that they should take in everybody who was qualified and cater for them and the Government will then make provision.  The universities now know that their faith was ill-founded and that there existed no such Government policy except a policy of drift and, as a result, through the 1950s and 1960s the position deteriorated and overcrowding became unbearable as <Col N="2171" /> students packed into the college buildings.</P>
    <P>Year by year the staff/student ratio has been disimproving.  In many cases it is between half and one-third only of the staff/student ratios of the universities in Britain and Northern Ireland with whose graduates our graduates have to compete.  This situation will not be allowed to continue.  The Government, any Government, have a duty to make their policy clear and we would hope that the Government, in consultation with the Higher Education Authority, would decide how many students they want to cater for or, alternatively, what policy should be applied in relation to entry.  If the Government say they are prepared to cater for as many students as come forward with an entry standard of two honours in leaving certificate, or something of that kind, the university will go ahead and cater for that number and the Government will supply the money.  If the Government will do that and make a statement saying they will cater for 24,000 students in the year 1975 and will provide money for staff and buildings to cater for these numbers the universities will plan accordingly and make whatever arrangements they can make, in consultation with the Department of Education, for entry arrangements and standards to control numbers to that level. We simply cannot have a continuation of the situation in which the universities adopt one policy and the Government another, the Government policy being not to provide any more money, or so little that it does not cater for half the students coming in.  The time has come for an end to that.</P>
    <P>The extent of the deterioration of conditions in universities is not something fully appreciated outside.  For this the universities must take some of the blame.  If any section finds itself, through neglect on the part of the Government, or through bad Government policy, in a situation in which its position deteriorates rapidly it is up to that section to make its voice heard.  I am not saying the university personnel have not made many speeches on the subject, but they did not seem to convince or get the message across.  There may have <Col N="2172" /> been poor public relations and various other reasons, but the universities clearly did not succeed in conveying to the Government or to the public just how bad the position was.  More imagination might, perhaps, have been used in putting the case across.</P>
    <P>I remember looking at the position over a period of eight years in the 1950s and 1960s and, in that short period, the position as regards financing per student has deteriorated <i>vis-àvis</i> Queen's to such an extent that it was twice as bad at the end of the eight years as it was at the beginning, or half as good, whichever you prefer. The different treatment here led to a deterioration of the order of 2:1 within that short period, and that continued for some years.  It has been less rapid recently because the Government have made some additional provision, but the universities are still in the position in which they cannot get money for extra staff.  Money is provided for buildings, which will be just about adequate for the numbers coming forward when the buildings are opened.  There may be some leeway for a year or two thereafter, but no more.</P>
    <P>The Government should not feel they are putting an end to the problem. It is merely bringing the building programme up to date and, from then on, expansion will be needed if the Government continue to favour the growth in numbers in universities. What the Government have not done is to make any provision for additional staff and, from my limited knowledge, their treatment of this matter has been frivolous.  That is the only word I can use to describe it.  I am sure the other colleges have put forward their needs for additional funds in the years ahead. They state the position that X is required in relation to salary increases, all of which are approved by the Minister and his Department, and that they need then additional sums for certain other purposes, including money for so many extra staff.  The additional number of staff they have stated in terms of moving towards the target proposed by the Commission on Higher Education, which target is to be achieved by 1975.  The Department have paid no attention whatsoever to <Col N="2173" /> this.  The grants they have given have, in fact, shown an increase representing only a fraction of the total required and they do not even indicate whether the money they are not giving is, in fact, money required for increased salaries, money for additional staff or money to meet normal increases in cost.  They stated that money has been provided for these things.  But it is like the three card trick.  They are all approved, but the total sum represents only half the total sum required and one cannot find out which it is the Government feel one should not be doing because the Government do not want to say that they are keeping down the staff/student ratio and, though improving the salaries, one must not pay them, and they do not say that you must not cater for additional students. They like to tell the public they are in favour of more students and in favour of increased salaries and in favour of improving the staff/student ratio, but the money provided represents only a fraction of the total sum needed.</P>
    <P>This three card trick approach has gone one year after year.  It is time to put the whole matter on a proper footing. The universities must submit a statement showing why they need more money and the Government must decide to give it, or not give it, and, if they do not give it, they must state what they are not giving it for and come out into the open.  Because additional salaries have to be paid and because extra students have to be catered for, the Government do not want to close off and what happens is the staff proposals are cut and, far from any improvement in the staff/ student ratios, which are so much worse than in Britain and Northern Ireland, the situation becomes worse.  The staff/student ratio has, in fact, deteriorated.  It has not improved.  It could not do otherwise than deteriorate because one has to increase the salaries of the staff in line with the general increase in salaries&mdash;this is approved by the Department&mdash;and one has to cater for the extra students, and the only thing one can do, when one's money requirement is cut in half, is not to employ the extra staff, the extra staff of which in theory the Government are in favour.  But the Government <Col N="2174" /> will not provide the money and so the staff/student ratio, far from improving, as it should have done, has, in fact, deteriorated.  It is Government policy that it should deteriorate.  The time has come for this to be put on a clear, clean footing and for submissions on current requirements channelled through the Higher Education Authority to be decided upon by the Government with a clear statement as to what they are approving and what they are not approving.  The Government must make up their mind as to what expansion in staffs they are prepared to cater for, what staff/student ratio they favour and, if they favour the Higher Education Commission's, then they must state that they are prepared to and have decided to provide money for these things.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of principle is that there is no link at Government level between the medium-term planning in the Second and Third Programmes and the Government's broad educational policy and the current short-term planning in the Budget.  The Government would favour moving towards an improvement in the student/staff ratio but in practice they do not provide the money.  It is this total inconsistency which provides one of the greatest defects of the whole educational system in this country, and it particularly applies to the universities.</P>
    <P>The situation is made much worse by the fact that the Government, arbitrarily, put a ceiling on university fees. On this side of the House, we feel university fees should be abolished, but so long as they exist, paid by students, universities should be put in a position, if they cannot get additional money from the Government and they feel it necessary and desirable to improve their student/staff ratio, to increase their fees.  They should not be put in the straitjacket they now are in by the Government.</P>
    <P>The position we favour is that the universities would charge the full cost in a fee which would be re-imbursed to the student directly so that the student, if he wanted to study science in UCD at the full cost to the undergraduate per annum of £300, would have that £300 re-imbursed to him, and having <Col N="2175" /> decided to do science, and £300 being the cost of the science course, he would be able to choose to which college he would apply the £300.  This would prevent any danger of interference with the autonomy of the colleges and, at the same time, the fees paid would reflect the full cost of education; and the universities, if they found they needed more money, could raise their fees and the Government grant would have to be increased accordingly.</P>
    <P>At present we have a situation, as I mentioned at the outset, where you have conflicting policies pursued by the universities and by the Government, leading to this appalling inadequacy of finances and of staff in the universities.  I will return more fully to this question later when we come to the full debate on the main Education Estimate.</P>
    <P>At the moment, however, I wish to comment briefly on the statement made by the Minister today that he considered that the additional grants being made available in this Supplementary Estimate should put the colleges in a position to make suitable arrangements to balance annual expenditure and income as from the beginning of the financial year 1970-71. I should like the Minister to tell us in reply if he meant by that that the sums he has provided here and intends to provide in the year ahead will be such as to enable the universities to cover their current costs taking into consideration the normal increase in student numbers, taking into consideration the required increase in staff to cope with this increased student intake and, at the same time, taking into consideration an improvement in the student/staff ratio to bring it to the recommended 12 to 1.</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's intention that this provision will do that or does the Minister mean to suggest that it will enable the universities to balance their accounts if they do not take in more students, if they do not take in more staff and if they do not improve the student/staff ratio?  What does he mean by this most inexplicit statement? Does he mean to move towards the required improvements in student/staff <Col N="2176" /> ratio and to pay the additional salaries necessary?  If that is what he means, we welcome the move.  It will be the first of its sort in 20 years and it will be a complete departure from the confidence trick practised by the Government on the universities to provide only half the sum required but pretend it covered all the items.  I would welcome clarification of what the Minister means.</P>
    <P>I wish to come back to one important issue.  It is a delicate one, on which all of us would wish to tread carefully.  I do not wish to exacerbate the situation when I speak of teachers' salaries and I think there are things which usefully can be said and I hope what I say will be accepted in good faith not only by the Minister but by the teachers' organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>First of all, most people agree on the desirability of a common basic scale for teachers in our schools.  This was accepted in principle by the ASTI.  Critics of the ASTI claimed that was only paying lip-service to the principle but I think that is unfair. If one discusses it with the ASTI representatives it becomes clear that the principle was accepted subject to certain conditions which, I think, in principle are reasonable although naturally other teachers may not agree with the particular application of these principles proposed by the ASTI.</P>
    <P>However, the whole position has become very tangled because of the unfortunate way it has been handled. When it was decided to try to proceed towards a common basic scale, the Minister's predecessor appointed a tribunal out of which we had the Ryan recommendation.  I will criticise that recommendation but I wish to point out that I have no intention of reflecting on Dr. Ryan, a man for whom I have enormous respect.  My criticism is of the way the matter has been handled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, it seems to me that this recommendation is open to criticism.  The fact is that the task was an extremely delicate one. Differentials did exist and if one tries to eliminate them, it must be done on terms of sufficient generosity so that those teachers who were better off before will find it possible to accept elimination of this differential, and this is difficult for any group to accept.</P>
      <P>In fact, the terms offered were singularly ungenerous, the maximum of which was less than the maximum enjoyed by some of the teachers included within it.  I realise that the personal position of the teachers may have been safeguarded, but there was downgrading. This exercise should not have been attempted unless it was clear at the outset that it would be possible financially to arrive at a common basic scale of such an amount that nobody, individually or collectively, would be worse off or have the position of their colleagues worsened.  Secondly, the provision for degree allowances seems to me to have been extremely inadequate. I am surprised, indeed, that a university professor did not place more value on a degree.</P>
      <P>Because of these two factors&mdash;there are others&mdash;the Ryan proposal was not accepted by the secondary teachers.  It was not one which one could expect people to accept.  If it had been appreciated this was all that would come out of it, it would have been much better if the tribunal had never been set up.  If you are to eliminate differentials you must do it in such a generous manner that even the best-off are attracted to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every country the teachers have been underpaid.  In the process of trying to solve this problem of a common basic scale, the Ryan Tribunal had an opportunity to consider the solution of the problem of the underpayment of teachers.  A generous award here could, <Col N="2178" /> perhaps, fill the gap.  However, the mistake was made.</P>
    <P>Then came the secondary teachers' dispute and its settlement.  The terms of that settlement have given rise to our present difficulties.  It is the responsibility of the Minister and of his Department to find a way out: it is not the teachers' problem.  The Minister and his Department produced a settlement at variance with the findings of the Ryan Tribunal and the principle of common basic pay.  If they are right in that, then the common basic scale goes by the board.  It is a possible solution but a defeatist one.  If they were wrong in that award, then full responsibility for solving the problem now rests on them.</P>
    <P>They have sought to solve the problem at the expense of the secondary teachers by breaking the agreement with them and taking away from them this money and using it to create posts of real responsibility which in many cases will mean additional payment for the headmasters and vice-principals of schools.  Most of this money will not find its way into the pockets of lay-teachers. The percentage increase is being taken from the secondary teachers and is being used for the benefit of some secondary teachers only&mdash; the ones to benefit being mainly clerical.  I cannot imagine anything more calculated to create unrest in industry. Just imagine what the Labour Court would say to an employer who was attempting that kind of exercise &mdash;settling a dispute by giving more money and then refusing to give it to the ordinary categories and applying it, instead, to certain staff which are non-union: in fairness to the clerics. I must say they are not members of ASTI.  Faced with that kind of dispute the Labour Court could do nothing on earth but agree that the employer in question was a lunatic and was asking for trouble.</P>
    <P>The situation was created by lack of generosity in the findings of the original Ryan Tribunal, aggravated by incredible meanness by the Department in trying to provide allowances between principals and vice-principals out of the percentage increases which secondary teachers should get in the ordinary way.  Having reached this <Col N="2179" /> agreement, good, bad or indifferent, the Department broke it unilaterally. It was aggravated by a situation outside everybody's control, though, perhaps, it should have been foreseen by the Department, namely, that the sum of money for alleged posts of responsibility in the agreement last year was a fixed sum to be distributed between the teachers.  There was a big flow from primary teaching into secondary teaching and there were, therefore, more teachers, sharing an unchanged sum rather than increasing it <i>pro rata</i> with the increased number of teachers.  Throughout, there has been fumbling and lack of generosity in the Department in the approach to this complex problem.  I am not saying it is easily solved.  I almost despair of a solution at this stage.</P>
    <P>To solve the problem, the Minister and the Department will have to abandon the lot.  They will have to forget everything that has happened and go back to first base.  They will have to start from the beginning and try to lay down certain principles which is what the Ryan Tribunal should have done.  Then they will have to argue these out on a rational basis with the people concerned.  If that is done, reason will eventually prevail.  There are certain hopeful factors.  The ASTI did accept the principle of a common basic scale.  Some other teachers may suspect they were not wholehearted in it but the fact that they accepted it was at great breakthrough.  Furthermore, it is self-evident that teachers teaching at a higher level, or who have responsibility for running things in a school, should be paid something extra. The common basic scale is one thing. These allowances are another thing.</P>
    <P>I regard the common basic scale as of great importance.  Mobility within the teaching profession is vital. I believe that similar training should be given to all teachers.  Particularly in view of his profession, I would hope to convert the Minister to the view that, like other teachers, primary teachers should have university education concurrent with their training in the theory and practice of education. Similarly, a secondary teacher should, if he wishes, be enabled to take up <Col N="2180" /> primary teaching.  There should be interchangeability within the profession through a system of short courses to cover the differences between the different levels of education.</P>
    <P>If a teacher wished to change from secondary to primary teaching he ought to be able to do this without loss of income on a common basic scale.  If a primary teacher wanted to become a secondary teacher he ought to be able to achieve this by a conversion course.  It is all wrong that teachers are tied up in boxes and divided up, particularly at a time when the scale of education is changing so rapidly and even relationships between the different levels are changing so rapidly.  I have always felt that the division between primary and secondary teaching is a mistake.  There is a point where a student acquires mastery of the three Rs and history and geography and is capable of taking on additional languages and a wider education.  In all the countries of Europe this comes between 10 and 12 years.  Only in Ireland was 14 years regarded as the age for the termination of primary education.  A direct reflection of that fact is that, in recent decades, the primary education system in this country has retarded our children by amounts ranging from 18 months to three years depending upon how it is calculated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am sorry if I appear to be doing so.  I am merely trying to emphasise my acceptance of the common basic scale and how important it is to ensure the mobility of teachers.  I want to make it clear from the start that in tackling this the common basic scale is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the dividing age between primary and secondary education is changing rapidly, and that primary education will terminate at 12 instead of 14 as we get over the problem of retardation and improve the higher education system by reducing the time given to Irish which seems to me to be the main problem.  As we move the <Col N="2181" /> age downwards we will reduce the total amount of teaching at primary level.  More pupils will be in secondary school at 12 instead of 14 which means there will be a shift in the requirements of teachers.  It is vital that primary teachers should be able to change over to secondary schools, otherwise they will be confined to teaching children up to the age of 12. If they had this common basic education they would be able to move into the secondary stage easily, and the common basic scale would therefore make a great contribution.  That is the point I am trying to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the Deputy confines his remarks to that, so that the debate is not enlarged into a general debate on education, which will come later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I appear to be deviating it is only to establish the genuineness of my position on the common basic scale.  The principle of the common basic scale was accepted by the ASTI and that is our starting point.  When one goes beyond that it becomes clear that as the children's age increases specialised teachers are required.  These teachers may not require greater skill in teaching techniques. In fact it may be argued that they require less, judging by the fact that university teachers do not get any training in teaching.  There seems to be a belief somewhere that one needs less skill in teaching techniques as one goes up.  I do not know whether that is right or wrong, but that implication may be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think greater skills in teaching techniques are required as one goes higher up because as the pupil becomes more mature he becomes more able to learn even from a bad teacher. He is able to use his own mind on the material; the teacher is guiding his reading rather than being his sole source of information.  The case can be made that higher skills are not required for teaching at a higher level but that teachers require more specialised skill in subjects.  These specialised skills go ultimately to university level where one can specialise in a small part of a subject but at secondary <Col N="2182" /> school level specialisation tends to be specialisation in a particular subject, although under our present system specialisation tends to be in more than one subject.</P>
    <P>If teachers specialise in a subject and acquire a particular mastery of it &mdash;and this becomes necessary when teaching at the higher level&mdash;it seems to me proper that they should receive some extra remuneration, because if they do not there will be no incentive for them to specialise.  That does not mean to say that a maths teacher in sixth year needs to be better at teaching than an arithmetic teacher of the fourth class in a national school.  He may not even need the same skills but he does need to be a mathematician, whereas a teacher teaching arithmetic in the fourth class in a national school does not need to be a mathematician but has to be a good teacher.</P>
    <P>Although the INTO resisted specialised teachers being paid more, I do not think their resistance is fundamental. First of all, we have a points system which reflects in a broad sense that with the increase in age of the pupil a degree of specialisation is required and teachers who do specialise should get some reward for doing so. I am not convinced that the points system is the right system&mdash;in fact, I am almost certain it is not.  The system is there and there is no proposal by the INTO to abolish it.  If the issue were put in terms of teaching a specialised subject at honours level I do not think the INTO would stand against it.  The solution to the problem lies in the common basic scale as a principle with additional allowances being given to those teaching at a higher level and in a more specialised way provided allowances for genuine posts of responsibility are built in.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to do what I tried to press him to do at Question Time the other day&mdash;the Minister was most careful not to commit himself as to whether or not he had even discussed the matter and by bringing it up now I do not wish to trap him in any way&mdash;he would go back to the secondary school managements on the question of posts of responsibility, whether or not he has had fruitless discussions <Col N="2183" /> in the past.  I think the time has come to have further discussions because secondary school managers realise now better than they did last year or the year before how dangerous the position is for their schools as a result of this dispute.  I feel sure the Minister would find them more receptive to proposals such as proposals that one of the posts of vice-principal should go to a layman. If this problem is not tackled successfully we will never get lay masters in secondary schools to agree that the money which should come to them should be diverted for this purpose with the idea that some of them would be promoted to posts of vice-principal which the vast majority have no hope of attaining.  The Minister should be more generous and offer other posts of responsibility in large schools whether there are several teachers for each subject where posts of genuine responsibility could be created, such as games masterships and career masterships.  There is a whole series of duties which teachers perform for which they could be additionally remunerated.  If this could be done generously and if it could be ensured that a fair proportion of these posts would go to lay masters then many of the obstacles which stand in the way of a solution at the moment would be removed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should change his mind on one thing.  It was a mistake for the Department to say that the 4 and 3 per cent must not be given to the teachers but must be used to create these allowances.  The Minister should provide the funds for these allowances separately and let the teachers get their 4 and 3 per cent.  I think the ASTI would be prepared to go into this common scheme at that point and make a fresh start.  I think the present system including the points system, needs to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>A very skilled mediator is needed here to go to each of these bodies and start from first principles, taking the kind of line I am proposing here, getting agreement on the common basic scale and agreement for real responsibility for teaching a higher age and more particularly extra remuneration <Col N="2184" /> for teaching a specialised subject, and having obtained these agreements the Department could then build up a structure.  This sort of structure is going to cost the Government money.  The Government will not settle this dispute by saying here is a certain amount of money which can be divided this way so that these get more and those get less, or that way, so that those get more and these get less.  The dispute will only be settled when enough money is given so that nobody gets less.  That is a basic principle of industrial relations and I cannot understand how the Department of Education have not learned it.  I would hope that the Department of Labour might drop them a few hints on this subject.  As long as the Department take that view, the dispute will not be settled.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I want to say at this point.  I want to do nothing to aggravate the dispute.  I want to help towards its solution.  I want to encourage the Minister to have an open and a generous attitude to it.  I think it possibly can be solved along these lines. I know it cannot be solved unless people are prepared to change entrenched positions.  That is probably true of everybody in the dispute.  It is true above all of the Department because, more than in most cases, the Department are responsible for the solution.  They appointed the Ryan Tribunal.  They accepted its recommendations despite their inadequacy.  They settled the secondary teachers strike on a basis that cut across the Ryan Tribunal decision.  They then tried to get out of that by breaking the agreement with the secondary teachers and they did it in a way that meant that the secondary teachers would not get the ordinary salary increase.  They have made every mistake in the game.</P>
    <P>To retrieve such a series of blunders will be costly and the taxpayer will have to pay.  I do not think the taxpayer will resent having to pay even for the mistakes of the Department of Education in this instance.  If we get a solution and if it involves paying teachers more, I think that in this country people are prepared to accept that.  There is a recognition of the unique role of teacher and a willingness <Col N="2185" /> to see that teachers in Ireland have an honoured position, reflected among other things&mdash;and it is only part of the whole situation of course&mdash;in their salaries.  Even if it is costly it is worth paying the price to get the dispute settled.  If we can have a genuine single teaching profession in the future with free mobility between the different parts of it, this will help us to solve many of the problems of change that lie ahead of us, change in the whole relationship between different levels of education, change between primary and secondary, and change between senior and junior&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>It should be borne in mind that the Irish people, the taxpayers, a very large number of whom are wage and salary earners, are paying £64 million for a system of education which is neither free, nor tax free, nor free in any general conception.  An Estimate like that should put some of the more supercilious Party propagandists in their place.  I do not think that whoever coined the phrase &ldquo;free education&rdquo; had in mind the correct and rightful explosion in expenditure and educational development which <Col N="2186" /> occurred particularly in the post-primary sphere in the past half-decade. It should be kept in perspective in the context of increased expenditure being very necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comment on the £100,000 which is to be provided in the current financial year to enable a commencement to be made with the provision of sporting and recreational facilities for voluntary youth organisations.  Like Deputy FitzGerald I would urge that this money should be spent as quickly as possible.  In the years ahead, the Minister should consider doubling, trebling or even quadrupling this figure because I am sure no one would in any way object to at least £500,000 a year being provided to assist in the work being done by voluntary youth organisations.</P>
    <P>I was a little concerned when I read in the Minister's statement that the sporting organisations received a detailed questionnaire, that replies are being processed and that, when the processing has been completed, we will have a comprehensive picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the present provisions and the areas where immediate assistance is most needed.  I do not want to sound unduly critical but I do not regard the Department as having any unique or special expertise in the allocation of money for voluntary youth organisations.  I am well aware of the swimming ability of the Parliamentary Secretary and I have no doubt that he is quite competent in the field of assessment in some areas, but I suggest that the allocation of money of this nature is a highly expert function. I do not think it requires any great ability on the part of the Department to allocate £100,000 at this point of time but, as this figure increases, there will have to be a well-known and well-publicised criterion on which organisations will get this money.  Offhand, I can name organisations in areas in the constituency I represent, Shankill, Monkstown and Stillorgan, which could well avail of these grants but were rather confused and did not know how to go about getting them.  Therefore I urge the Minister to expendite the Departmental arrangements.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the additional <Col N="2187" /> £64,000 being provided in the Supplementary Estimate for primary school transport service.  Nevertheless, it should be pointed out to the taxpayer &mdash;and I do not think the Minister will regard this as carping&mdash;that this brings the transport subsidy up to £2.4 million per year.  In any country the size of this country the expenditure on a primary school transport service of almost £2½ million a year would be very substantial.  This service is essential in the rural areas and in many of the urban areas.  The taxpayer should be told: &ldquo;You are, in fact, paying £2½ million a year for this service.&rdquo;  In any parliamentary democracy the cost of administering and running such a service should be made known to the taxpayers.  This is essential.  I am not carping about the extra £64,000 required but I am just pointing out that it is costing £2½ million a year.  I am saying that not in any critical sense but as a fact which the Minister might stress in a statement of this nature.</P>
    <P>I have one criticism to make in respect of the school transport service. I have had a number of complaints about the general meanness of CIE in relation to some of the payments they make to the part-time drivers who have the heavy responsibility of looking after a bus throughout the week, and the heavy responsibility of bringing a large number of students to and from school.  Very often they are doing this work for extremely low wages, in the region of £10, £11 or £12 a week. This is not adequate for the long distances driven, the constant waiting, the early morning and late afternoon work, the caring of buses, and so on. The Minister should try to exert some departmental control.  Admittedly it would involve more money but the Minister might check this matter and make some observations to CIE on some of the wages they are offering to such drivers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being very circumspect because I want to reserve my main comments on education for <Col N="2188" /> the main Estimate and therefore I will be even briefer than I intended to be.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provision of an extra £107,000 for training colleges.  I would agree with the criticism of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald that there is need for a greater number of students entering the training colleges from the urban areas.  This would give a cross-fertilisation of family, cultural, social and economic backgrounds.  I should like to see more trainee teachers coming from Dublin City and Cork City. Excellent work is being done by the training colleges, for example, St. Patrick's College.  The professional staffs of these colleges deserve from the House the highest regard for the tremendously difficult work they are doing.  I would go so far as to say that in many respects they are somewhat ahead of Departmental expertise, Departmental ability and sense of innovation.  The Minister might consider a greater devolution of authority to the teacher training colleges and their professional staffs than exists at present.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the increased expenditure under Vote 31 of £81,000 for reformatory and industrial schools and the doubling of maintenance grants for children committed to these schools. The Minister has taken his courage in his hand in doubling the maintenance grants as already strongly pressed to do. It is not particularly to the credit of any political party that for so long we have acted in a casual manner towards reformatory and industrial schools without providing the skilled and dedicated staffs running these schools with the necessary funds towards providing amenities for the children there.  As regards the whole function and purpose of reformatory and industrial schools I shall certainly have something very critical to say when the main Estimate comes before us.  However, we have given them so little in the past that we can hardly begrudge them the £81,000 provided here which they well deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to additional grants in Vote 32 for universities and colleges, I would again point out&mdash;and the Minister might have included some reference to it in his statement&mdash;the fact that <Col N="2189" /> universities are now getting some £6,500,000 a year and with this Vote they will be getting up to £7 million a year&mdash;if one includes the other colleges the provision runs well over £7 million &mdash;of State funds in order to run the universities.  I do not propose to speak for the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Dr. Thornley, in respect of university financing or to impinge on the professional interest of Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, but I do feel strongly that the Minister should set about the very delicate and difficult task of recasting the whole system of financing university education.  I am referring to current and capital expenditure as distinct from maintenance grants and so on.  It is rather anomalous that one can hand £7 million of State money to university authorities without the same extent of public accountability as one would demand from any State-sponsored body in any other sector.  The system so far has been unduly pragmatic, resulting in successive Ministers for Education responding to political and university pressures and outcries from distraught professors from various colleges by giving an extra £500,000 here and there for general administrative expenditure. I am not one of those who suffer from this amazing academic isolationism of many university authorities who simply believe because they get taxpayers' money and are not necessarily accountable for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With the growth of university expenditure, particularly capital expenditure, I have come to the belief, even though it sounds perhaps somewhat authoritarian and may be regarded as an incursion into the realms of academic freedom and the more private enterprise aspects of education, if one wants to be crude about it, that a sharp examination of the system is essential.  The Minister has my sympathy and support in the setting up of some more detailed surveillance or supervision of university expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an additional capital grant <Col N="2190" /> of £400,000 to the UCC science building. The engineering and science faculties of UCC have a unique and distinctive contribution to make to the academic world.  I have reservations about some of the other faculties. Nevertheless, in terms of medicine and engineering science I think Cork deserves the extra subvention made available by the Minister and I am glad to know that the erection of the new science building has gone well ahead of schedule and will be completed in time.</P>
    <P>Of the two remaining aspects of the Minister's statement, that relating to teachers' salaries and that relating to expenditure for Limerick, I shall deal with Limerick first.  I congratulate the Minister on the progress reported by him in respect of the new Institute of Higher Education there.  Successive Ministers showed considerable moral courage in facing up to the very difficult and explosive situation in Limerick.  I cannot regard myself as having been one of those involved in what I would describe as relatively short-term and narrow educational criteria in the advocacy of a different form of higher education in Limerick. particularly the educational shibboleths that surrounded the calls of a somewhat superficial nature for a university in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister did not lose his head.  Had we a different situation and had there not been a rapid succession of Ministers in this Department, another Minister in the past might well have lost his head but competent resistance of some of the more vociferous demands, I think, has had the result that Limerick gets what Limerick most urgently needs and must have: a new Institute of Higher Education.  I have no doubt that institute will, in time, make a very distinctive and unique contribution to higher education in the Shannon region.  I urge the Minister to light a fire under developments in that area, particularly in the case of the new institute.  I know the Minister will provide the balance of cash in the Estimate for 1970-71 but there is need to get this essential development under way and to exercise even greater care in regard to the local politics of the situation <Col N="2191" /> which are still quite difficult.  Having said that, I support the allocation of money by the Minister for this matter.</P>
    <P>As regard teachers' salaries, I propose to be as circumspect as Deputy FitzGerald because, as a trade union officer, I can appreciate the tremendous difficulties in the current dispute.  On many occasions in the past I regarded the House when outside it as having more bedevilled and frustrated settlements than having made any particular contribution to them.  However, one must put on record that there appears to be unanimity in the House&mdash;and I am glad to note it&mdash;that it is essential there should be acceptance throughout the country of the fundamental principle of a common basic salary scale for all teachers. Whatever criticism may be levelled at the Ryan Report at least it had inherent logic, an inherent attitude of objectivity.  It is not particularly to the credit of previous Ministers for Education that they did not have the moral courage to say what was contained in the broadest principle in the Ryan Report.  I assure the Minister that on that basic principle he has my support.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record that I exempt Deputy Faulkner, the present Minister for Education, from responsibility for what happened up to the time he took office.  I exclude him from what I would regard as rare displays of ministerial &ldquo;fixing&rdquo;, to use the term of a former Minister, and I excuse him from the very sorry display of industrial relations within the Department.  At times it was difficult to distinguish whether it was a response to the purely political aspect of the situation, with a general election intervening last year and so on, or whether it was collective Cabinet bungling or incompetence on the part of senior staff of the Department.  One way or another, it must be accepted that rarely in the history of the State has a Minister for Education been faced with the situation where the morale of the teaching profession was at such a low ebb.  It is not unfair to say that the regard the teaching organisations have for the departmental negotiators has suffered.  As public <Col N="2192" /> servants they are in a very difficult position because they are carrying out ministerial and Cabinet decisions. What they might do or feel in a personal capacity is something that must be sharply distinguished from their public functions.  The Government, as an employer, have not displayed any sense of imagination in resolving the question.  In any case, the teaching profession now is in many respects demoralised by the amazing gyrations of previous Ministers for Education and there is general lack of confidence in the Department's ability to resolve the issue.</P>
    <P>I accept also&mdash;and this should go on record in fairness to the Minister and the inherent aspects of the dispute &mdash;that there has been and is within the teaching profession within the context of trade union organisation, within the tripartite system of professional representation, certain intransigence which is not very edifying and in some respects is to be deplored.  There has been a cat-and-mouse game going on between the teaching professions or the organisations representing them which has not brought much credit to themselves.  What is more important is that an opportunity to indulge in that rare exhibition of internecine warfare in the teaching profession should not have been presented by the Department.  In the best interests of the country that situation should not have been, one might say, provoked by some of the departmental attitudes adopted.</P>
    <P>It is time we got rid of the political opportunism of this dispute now that everybody has undergone considerable traumatic experience in a very difficult industrial dispute situation.  To repeat Deputy FitzGerald's statement, I think it is time we made a plea to the Minister to wipe the slate clean in many respects and start afresh.</P>
    <P>While there are undoubted difficulties in respect of the payment of allowances and very considerable difficulties facing the Department in relation to job evaluation, if the Minister can reopen the discussions on a wide basis I do not think he need unduly worry about the money end of it preventing a solution of the <Col N="2193" /> problem.  I have found throughout the country that there is not any reluctance on the part of the Irish people to pay more money to our teachers if it will solve what looks like an impossible situation.  I shall not say much more about this.  I do not wish to play politics in this matter.  It would be quite improper for me because of my relations and associations with some of the organisations, both in the past and currently, to intervene beyond that point, except to hope that this problem will be resolved and to hope that the Minister will devote his considerable energy and talent to the more constructive and essential developments in the field of education in the future.</P>
    <P>I hope that the problem will be resolved before the Budget and that the teaching organisations will once again normalise the relations between them. These are my comments to the Minister: we will have plenty to say later on the Estimate for Education itself. I have no doubt that this House will fully support the increased expenditure proposed by the Minister in the Supplementary Estimate.  Whether it is in the next Budget or any other Budget, I do not think the taxpayers will object to meeting the cost of essential education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have an opportunity later of discussing Education in a more comprehensive manner but I wish to say a few words on this Supplementary Estimate.  I wish to welcome the £100,000 provided for the voluntary youth organisations.  It is not a great amount but it is recognition by the Government of the excellent work done by the various youth organisations throughout the country.  The question of educational value where youth is concerned, of meeting the financial training and organisational needs of youth clubs, depends on an assessment of their social and educational worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youth clubs came into existence to supplement family and school education and they are more necessary today in view of the increased leisure time available to the youth and the shorter hours for those at work.  The increased pocket money, easier travel and earlier independence of today's young people add up to a great need for adult support <Col N="2194" /> and guidance.  The club environment provides for a desirable relationship between adults and adolescents; it affords young people the opportunity to develop their interests and talents and provides for self-expression and guided discussion on friendship, civics, religion and so on.</P>
    <P>Clubs also provide, especially for early school-leavers, a continuation of their education but this calls for interests and projects with more imaginative presentation.  There is a greater realisation now of the work done by and the social education aspect of youth clubs.  I know the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary have a specific interest in this and more emphasis must be placed on the work of youth organisations.  I should like to compliment the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on making this allocation of £100,000 which although it is small, is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief remarks on a number of subheads covered in this Supplementary Estimate.  First, in regard to primary school transport, the whole idea behind the introduction of the free transport scheme was a very good one. However, it has had certain undesirable effects and the position as regards the transport of a large minority of the children has worsened as a result of the introduction of the scheme.  I am speaking of people who are, say, 1¾ miles away from the school and whose children were previously able to get lifts to school.  They were able to get lifts from parents of children who are now outside the limit and who are entitled to free transport and, consequently, the children inside the limit have been deprived of the lifts they previously got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to see a solution to this problem but greater flexibility at local level should be allowed as regards transport arrangements, and where a bus is passing by with a considerable number of vacant seats, sanction should be given to those operating the bus to pick up children who are inside the limit and who do not qualify.  They should be transported to school free of <Col N="2195" /> charge or, if necessary, a small nominal sum could be charged.  I understand this is being done in some cases but I have heard of instances where it has not been done and I would be grateful if this could be reviewed to ensure that all seats are occupied on the buses.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong argument for abolishing the age limits in regard to school transport.  I know this would increase the expenditure to some extent but it is fairly arguable that a child of 10½ years needs transport as much as a child of 9½ years.  I do not know how much this would cost and until I hear this I would not like to make a firm recommendation but the matter of the age limit should be carefully considered, and all children should be provided with free school transport as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Under subhead H. 15 there is a payment towards the Union of Students of Ireland.  This body deserves financial support.  This is not a matter for the Minister, but I would hope that in the years ahead the USI will become a little more representative of the broad mass of students.  Reading reports of their conferences, it appears to be at the moment representative of a minority of those students who are politically active and, in their political activities, significantly to the left of centre.  It is inevitable that political activists will come to the fore.  It is equally inevitable, I suppose, that the USI will never be fully representative of the broad mass of apathetic students who do not take an interest in political matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no responsibility in this matter and I do not see how we can debate it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just hope that the USI will become representative of all students and not just of a minority of political activists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the additional sum of £81,000 for reformatory and industrial schools.  There is a school of thought which would maintain that we are spending too much on reformatories and that we should not spend money on bad children; we should spend it <Col N="2196" /> on good children.  That is a foolish view because these children are not only maladjusted but they transgress in most cases through no fault of their own and money spent at an early stage on directing these children away from the paths of criminality is money well spent since it will save a great deal of money later on in crime prevention.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the money provided for universities and colleges.  The Minister's decision to appoint the president of the Students Representative Council to the governing body of UCD is most welcome.  I hope this will be the prelude to greater representation for students on the governing body.  If we expect students to behave in a responsible manner then we should treat them as responsible people and the best way to do that is by giving them some say in controlling their university environment.  This can be done by giving students representation on governing bodies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for a new institute of higher education in Limerick.  I wonder are there other areas which have an even greater need of facilities of this kind.  I am thinking of the north west which has been neglected by both the Government in Dublin and the Government in Belfast. Would it be possible, in co-operation with the Government of Northern Ireland, to set up some kind of institute of higher education in Sligo, Enniskillen, or elsewhere, to cover Donegal, Fermanagh, Derry and the other northwestern counties?  Students in these areas have to travel long distances to avail of the existing facilities.  I hope the Minister will consult with his opposite number in Northern Ireland with a view to providing some facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if I will ever again in my life feel more kindly disposed towards the Minister than I do now when I see this sum of £80,000 for reformatory and industrial schools.  I remember many years ago when the capitation grant was 12s 6d a week&mdash;it is now 45s a week&mdash;and I remember trying to get it improved; I was told those concerned could live off the land, the 150 acres down in <Col N="2197" /> Daingean.  The idea was more or less to treat them tough, as Deputy Bruton said.  You can treat people tough if you feed them well and clothe them properly.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister.  He may not have the money now but he could make a suggestion to the school authorities.  Boys and girls leaving these schools are not given any money.  They should be given some small sum.  The Minister will appreciate why I make this suggestion; it is one that should be put to the authorities.  These boys and girls run into difficulties because they have no money.  That is something that could be avoided.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Garret FitzGerald that every primary teacher should be sent to university. More than that, I believe the training colleges should be abolished.  What could one do with them?  The slick, quick answer is use them as hostels for students.  An Arts degree is of vital importance to teachers in the world in which we find ourselves today.  That should be followed with one year of technological training.  I do not agree with Deputy FitzGerald that, during those three years, they would get a specialised education.  Let them do general subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to talk now about universities and colleges.  I have no mandate from anybody to make the remarks I am going to make; they are my own and I am making them on my own responsibility. I do not understand how the Department of Education have the impertinence to come forward with a grant of £1,800,000 for the general expenses of the 10,000 students in University College, Dublin, and give £2,800,000 to the three other university colleges.  There was at one time an answer to this.  In a place like Galway, with 1,000 students, there was a certain basic cost.  That day has gone.  The present system is quite improper and I shall deal with it in some detail.  I cast my mind back to the days when Mr. Patrick McGilligan was Minister for Finance in the first inter-Party Government; he gave extra moneys to University College, Dublin.  I was at a dinner <Col N="2198" /> subsequently and one of our light entertainers sang a song, two lines of which ran:</P>
    <P>UCD Belfield has got</P>
    <P>And Trinity can go to Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>It stuck in my mind.  It was all right at the time, but let us take the realities. There are only two faculties in UCD which are properly financed.  They are financed out of the Agricultural Vote because the Civil Service have a method of looking after their own.  The cost per student doing veterinary medicine in UCD is £1,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Let me take some figures, and I will be as pedestrian about the figures as any Fianna Fáil Deputy was about housing in the city of Dublin.  I will not do it often but I feel very strongly about this.  In the original Estimate this year the general grant to UCD, where there are 10,000 students, was increased by £35,000.  The general grant to UCC was increased by £135,000, to UCG the increase was £85,000 and the general grant to Trinity, where there are only 4,000 students, was increased by £214,000.  Now, in the Supplementary Estimate before us we get the same kind of racket, but carried further&mdash; the same dirty racket.  I will not mince words about it because if I see something I object to I call a spade a spade. We have the same thing again this time.  The figure added for UCD is £200,000 giving an average grant of £200 per student; the amount for UCC is £50,000, giving an average grant of £300; it is very interesting and strange to find that in Galway the average grant per student also is £300 and that in Trinity it is £300.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how the Department of Education justify this dirty discrimination.  I was glad to hear a few weeks ago that Trinity are getting £2½ million for building.  Now, when I say this I am not thinking of myself for one moment, but one result of this discrimination is that for some years the full professor's salary has been 10 per cent higher in Cork and Galway, where the cost of living is cheaper than in UCD.  I must emphasise here that no professor in UCD asked me to raise this here: I wish to assure the Minister and the House about that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2199" /> Is it not a disgraceful situation?  We go from one extreme, where agriculture is concerned, where you have in veterinary medicine a student-staff ratio of one to five and in the faculty of agriculture one to six, to the other where the situation is vastly different. For many years I have done work and I still do some work among the day and night commerce students in UCD. I have seldom had better relations than with the second year commerce night students.  Indeed, we are the only faculty that have given a full degree throughout the years.  I understand Trinity are going back to night courses, but when they gave them up some years ago one of their Englishmen said they lowered standards and he said people in UCD agreed with him.  I certainly do not, and I have lectured to hundreds of students at night.  Indeed there is no more enjoyable experience than to lecture to third year students at night. There are no abler students in any university anywhere in the world, and my evidence is the kind of things that happen.  Only two days ago a happy married lady met me in the restaurant here and said to me: &ldquo;I suppose you do not remember me.  I was in class 1959 and some of the men have done terribly well in life.&rdquo;  Why should they not?  They get no help at all and there is nothing so good as to let people fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>But let me come back to the lack of finance for UCD.  I will quote some figures from the report of the President of UCD.  The BA general degree by tradition in western Europe has been given to students who attend universities for three years.  I am all for western European tradition.  What was the result last June in the BA general degree in UCD?  There were 733 examined and 347 passed.  What does one think of that kind of thing?  At one end of it you have students' grants at a figure of £1,000 per student and at the other end the figure is £200.</P>
    <P>I do not mind putting my head on a block but I do not agree with either Deputy FitzGerald or Deputy Desmond that you can get away with what the Ryan Tribunal recommended in respect of teachers, secondary teachers in particular. <Col N="2200" /> Nobody can get away with it. I had five tough years in industrial relations.  I was chairman of the ESB Tribunal, and I can tell the House there was not a tougher spot.  I understand the problem.  I assure the Chair that I will not dilate on this subject but I submit that the only result of this report will be that every young secondary teacher will vamoose to Canada.  They are going already.  I will leave my detailed comments for the debate on the main Estimate.  Here I will stick close to the figures in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>To return to the universities, I am glad to see Galway being brought up to the level of Trinity.  I am also glad to see Cork being upgraded.  What surprises me is the position in regard to UCD where, among a group of 10,000 students, you have two of the most expensive faculties in any country in the world.  I am one of those who do not accept discrimination between faculties.  Let Oxford spend as much as they like on classical education and let the scientists complain like mischief about it, but in UCD you have the only faculties of architecture and of engineering in the country.  You have a science faculty in which there are people who behave like greedy pigs, if you will pardon the expression, when it comes to grabbing money.</P>
    <P>A degree is really a reward for having attended a university and got through general reading.  When this kind of thing happens, if there was not this gross discrimination, one could say it could be due to one of three possible things&mdash;(1) the lectures are bad; (2) the papers are too hard or (3) the students do not work.  In UCD, the real reason is the ludicrous staff/ student ratio.  In the Faculty of Commerce in University College it is one head of staff for each 60 students as against one head of staff for each six students in the Faculty of Agriculture. It is nearly as bad in the Faculty of Arts where it is probably one for each 35 students.  That is why you get this kind of result.  On one occasion when I started to discuss this at an official meeting I was promised that we would have different results when the students would have two honours subjects when <Col N="2201" /> coming into University College.  It did improve Commerce.  However, take First Arts, where 700 out of 1,300 passed in the June examination.  Do not forget that this was when the standard of admission had been improved.</P>
    <P>There is a most serious problem in University College at present where 1,200 Commerce students are in a building which was designed for 5,000 students.  Imagine the overheads that gives rise to.  As a result, there is less money for the Faculty of Arts.  It is all right if you are feeding out of the trough of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries as are Veterinary Medicine and the Faculty of Agriculture. I made a shot, with a Minister for Industry and Commerce on one occasion, who said I raised the matter at the wrong time of the year, at getting the Faculty of Commerce transferred to the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I know what the result would be.  It has eased the position somewhat that the Diploma in Public Administration is now provided by the Institute of Public Administration.  However, the Faculty of Commerce is subsidising UCD in a big way&mdash;a most improper and outrageous situation.  Apart from the parents paying, many of the students in the Faculty of Commerce are able to earn during the day, and pay income tax on their earnings and pay their fees.  This country is full of these anomalies.</P>
    <P>There was a tradition in UCD that it was not necessary to have Latin to do Commerce.  I was extremely interested in this problem of the number of students and the fees they paid.  There was a subsidy of about £20 per student from each student in the Faculty of Commerce towards these moneys. There are no more narrow-minded people than academics.  About two years ago, I asked the Second Commerce class&mdash;about 200 students&mdash; about this belief that people do Commerce because they did not get Latin in their matriculation.  This used to be true when girls came from small secondary schools in the country where Latin was not taught.  When I asked the students how many of them had Latin in their matriculation a forest of hands <Col N="2202" /> went up: 98 per cent of the class had Latin in their matriculation.  Yet this rubbish still goes on among academics that people do Commerce because they cannot pass Latin in their matriculation. I hope this extraordinary anomaly will be knocked on the head.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Universities and Colleges left the Department of Finance in 1955 because a particular Minister for Finance had done something which he thought would be attacked.  Strictly speaking, it should not be in the Department of Education.  It should be where it was&mdash;in the Department of Finance&mdash;and if it had been left there I do not believe this would have happened. I do not understand the reasoning whereby money for a college running the expensive faculties in this country&mdash;Architecture and the main Engineering Faculty which, in spite of anything one can do, will cost money&mdash; is cut.  I approve of what the Department have done for the past six or eight years to bring up the grant per student in UCC and UCG to the level of the TCD grant.  I do not profess to know if the grant to these other colleges is adequate but I profess to understand discrimination when I see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall submit to the judgment of the Chair as I go along. We should have a long hard look at the whole question of the teachers' salary position at this stage and in order to do that it would be necessary to go back to the situation in 1959 and 1960.  At that time a committee was set up by the Taoiseach to examine and report on principles which might guide the Minister for Education in determining the relationship between the remuneration payable to trained national teachers, recognised secondary teachers and permanent whole-time vocational teachers respectively.  Without going into the details of their study, suffice it to say that their main problem in discussing this matter was to make a decision as to whether their recommendations would be based on a basic personal scale or a basic school scale.  As we know they came out in favour of the latter.  Their general recommendation was that secondary teachers should proceed to higher maxima than vocational teachers and that vocational teachers should proceed to higher maxima than national teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their report was presented to the Government but it does not appear that the principles were accepted by the Government because in 1966 the Minister for Education, the late Deputy O'Malley, set up another commission which was asked to work to the following terms of reference: (a) to recommend a common basic scale of salary for teachers in national, secondary and vocational schools; and, (b) to recommend what appropriate additions might <Col N="2206" /> be made to the basic scale in respect of qualifications, length of training, nature of duties, etc.  If the terms of reference which I have quoted are corrent the addition of the word &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; seems to me to be a very unwise thing, because anything can be argued into the word &ldquo;etc.&rdquo;.  I think terms of reference should be specific with no open-ended &ldquo;<i>et ceteras</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Ryan Tribunal came out in favour of a common basic scale with additions for qualifications, which at the time were for a Higher Diploma in Education Pass, £25, ranging up to a Doctor's degree, £200.  These figures were later increased but the point is that they ranged from £25 to £200.  In addition it was recommended that allowances should be paid for the posts of principal and vice-principal and that graded pensionable allowances should be payable to principals and vice-principals in all schools in addition to the common scale salary.  It was also recommended that posts of responsibility would be created and that the size of these graded allowances would depend on the points rating of the school.</P>
    <P>This is important because the points rating which he suggested was that for a pupil under the age of nine years one point would be given, between nine years and 13 years, two points, between 13 years and 15 years, three points, between 15 years and 16 years, four points, between 16 years and 17 years, five points, and 17 years and over, six points This suggestion of a points system, to my knowledge, was first put to the Department of Education about eight or nine years ago.  The people who put it to them had studied the Northern Ireland situation where a pupil at the higher age is given a points rating of ten.</P>
    <P>We know that last year the secondary teaching profession felt they were unable to accept the Ryan Tribunal decision in this regard.  One of the difficulties for the secondary teachers was that the top salary offered for a married secondary teacher on the basic scale was less than that which he was then earning when the school salary and the Department's increment were taken together.  That was not the main difficulty <Col N="2207" /> because the Department had made provision for the payment of extra moneys to compensate them.  The main difficulty was that the Ryan Tribunal system of posts of responsibility could be applied to secondary schools in this country only with great difficulty.  It is very easy to bring in a report of this type and say this will be the system, but we have to look at the situation as it is.</P>
    <P>The situation is that the great majority of our secondary schools are owned and staffed to a large extent by religious.  Therefore, lay people working in these schools cannot look forward with any hope to achieving the position of principal or, in many cases, the position of vice-principal.  The amount of money thrown up at the secondary end for the allowances for principal, vice-principal and graded posts was roughly £650,000.  As a result of the withdrawal of services last year, this £650,000 was given to the secondary teachers, religious and lay, above a certain point in the scale in amounts varying from £100 to £300 for special definable functions.</P>
    <P>An <i>ad hoc</i> committee was set up to discuss how definable functions to be given to those in receipt of these allowances might be worked out.  It was also stated as a result of this March, 1969 agreement that, in the event of any future general salary increases in the public sector expressed in percentages, the allowances provided in the conciliation report No. 1, 1969 would attract the same percentages as provided for in relation to the basic scale.  We know what happened then.  This was an honourable compromise.  The secondary teaching profession were reasonably happy until Professor Ryan, who had drawn up the original report, was asked to come in again because certain people were dissatisfied with this.</P>
    <P>He reported in what I shall call Ryan No. 2.  He stated that the INTO, which is the National Teachers' Organisation, had accepted the broad principles of the tribunal's report, that they attached particular importance to the use of a common basis for calculating the sums available for principals, <Col N="2208" /> vice-principals and posts of special responsibility, and identical allowances being paid in schools with the same points rating whether national, vocational or secondary.</P>
    <P>The Ryan Tribunal goes on to say that the agreement between the Department of Education and the ASTI, which is the secondary teachers' body, retained the common basis for calculating the sum available for the allowances set out in the tribunal's report but allocated this sum among secondary teachers on a different basis from that recommended by the tribunal.  The question arises here as to what right any profession or any other group of people have to state how the secondary teaching profession shall have money allocated to posts of responsibility in their profession.</P>
    <P>I am suspicious that the whole thinking behind this Ryan Tribunal is not to achieve a unified profession because the question of the unity of the national and vocational teaching professions was not given to the Ryan Tribunal in its terms of reference.  It was asked to recommend a common basic scale of salary.  There is a difference between a common basic scale of salary and unification of a profession.  We must remember that the secondary teachers never accepted the findings of the Ryan Tribunal but the findings of the Ryan Tribunal are now being put forward as sacrosanct.  These have been rejected by them.  Why was not that sacrosanctity given to the previous committee which sat in 1958 to 1960?</P>
    <P>Professor Ryan in his No. 2 document said that it is quite impossible to resolve the impasse&mdash;he did not use those words; he said it was quite impossible to resolve it&mdash;the salary question&mdash;without reference to a common system for all teachers such as that set out in the tribunal's report which all teachers were prepared to accept.  In this statement the secondary teachers find full justification for their rejection of the original and for the belief that they are fully entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>It is also stated that over the next three or four years an attempt should be made to give substance to the concept of a single profession of teaching <Col N="2209" /> as spelled out in the report of the tribunal on teachers' salaries.  I repeat that Professor Ryan was asked to recommend a common basic scale of salary and not to create a single profession of teaching.  To secondary teachers such a concept can be based only on equality of qualifications, length of training and level of work.</P>
    <P>What do we find at present?  We find that last September, the 16th I think it was, the Minister came forward with a new proposal which, in effect, would mean that these posts of responsibility or posts of definable function, with sums ranging from £100 to £300, would be gradually eroded.  Under pressure from some quarter, or perhaps not under pressure at all, it was decided that these were subterfuges for increases of salary.  I reject the proposition that these are increases of salary solely.  They were given in the first instance for definable functions and a committee was set up to define these functions.  The secondary teaching profession went along to this committee and were prepared to discuss this matter with the managers and with the Minister's advisers but, for some reason, this committee ceased to function in the middle of last year.  Therefore, let nobody say that this is money for jam or money for nothing.  If it is, it is because the <i>ad hoc</i> committee set up to discuss this matter of the giving of defined functions did not continue in being.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment is that the Minister' advisers are offering to secondary teachers a situation in which, if they opt to go in under the Ryan system, they will get four per cent up to £1,800, and three per cent thereafter but, if they do not, they face the possibility of having their basic school salary plus their allowances for the definable function eroded gradually over the next few wage rounds.  To quote from Professor Ryan's No. 2 document:</P>
    <P>Over the next 3 or 4 years an attempt should be made to give substance to the concept of a single profession of teaching, as spelt out in the Report of the Tribunal on Teachers' Salaries.  In recent months, <i>ad hoc</i> decisions have seriously breached the Tribunal's framework. <Col N="2210" /> The approximate position now reached is that all teachers are on a common salary scale and have identical allowances for qualifications and period of training.  In secondary schools, there are no allowances for principals and vice-principals, but all teachers ... hold posts of responsibility and receive annual payments ranging from £100 to £300 for carrying out the &ldquo;definable special functions&rdquo; delegated to them.  In vocational and national schools, if the following recommendations are accepted, there will be allowances for principals, vice-principals and posts of special responsibility along the lines set out in the Tribunal's Report.  The Tribunal's framework could be restored if, in the course of the extension to teachers of the second half of the 11th round adjustment in civil service salaries, and in the 12th and if necessary 13th rounds of general increases in wages and salaries the sums available to national and vocational teachers ... were applied wholly or mainly to the progressive introduction into the salary scale of the &ldquo;seniority&rdquo; responsibility allowances which the secondary teachers now enjoy, and if the sums available to secondary teachers ... were applied wholly or mainly to introducing principal's and vice-principal's allowances and &ldquo;merit&rdquo; posts of responsibility on the lines of those being paid to vocational and national teachers.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, something in the region of 1,793 ordinary graded posts are being offered to secondary teachers; 588 vice-principal posts are being offered; and the emoluments for vice-principals will be £103 to £465 and the graded posts range from £103 to £412.  If we assume that each secondary teacher got a vice-principalship, which is a very large assumption, these 1,793 posts would have to be, in all equity, divided between the lay and the religious.  Would this give a post to each person who is enjoying the £100 to £300 allowance?</P>
    <P>The Minister is faced with a very difficult problem and in making these remarks I make them with a full <Col N="2211" /> awareness of his difficulties.  However, nothing will be gained by not facing the facts and the facts are that on this question of salary there is tremendous unrest in the secondary teaching profession, an unrest which is leading to a special convention to be held this weekend.  The Minister in answer to supplementary questions from me has said in effect: &ldquo;Let the secondary teachers come into the common conciliation scheme and everything will be well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the secondary teachers were to accept the proposal that they should go into the common scheme to talk their differences out, they would be going in from a position where they have not yet received the balance of the 11th round and would be talking with two other groups who have.  I have no mandate to speak for anybody on this matter, but I would suggest that if there is to be any hope whatsoever of getting the secondary teachers to go in and talk with their colleagues in the other groups, with the Minister's advisers and with the managers, then the Minister's advisers will have to concede the remainder of the 11th round.</P>
    <P>The House will be interested to note that there is a refusal to give the percentage increase for the allowances of £100 to £300 and that these increases amount to £3, £6 and £9.  In terms of achieving harmony in a profession this is a very minimal sum.  Remember that in the document which I quoted it was stated that: &ldquo;In the event of any future general salary increases in the public sector expressed in percentages the allowances provided in this report shall attract the same percentages as provided for in relation to the basic scale.&rdquo;  By the way, this agreement of March, 1969, was not, as it is sometimes said to be, subject to review as if that were meant to convey that it could be scrapped, because it says that &ldquo;subject to the agreement of the managerial authorities the number, nature and amount of pensionable allowances be reviewed in the light of the finances which would be available as a result of the operation of a points system related to the level of enrolment on 1st February, 1969, and subsequent years and that any revision of the arrangement <Col N="2212" /> become operative from the following 1st August.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That any revision of the arrangement become operative from the following 1st August&rdquo;&mdash;it seems to me that clearly implies that this scheme was destined to continue and to be put into operation every 1st August and not to be scrapped by a simple stroke of the Minister's pen.  As I say, we shall not get anywhere by closing our eyes to these facts.</P>
    <P>I should also like to kill another suggestion which is given a lot of airing from time to time and it is that secondary teachers are anxious to preserve a differential between themselves and others.  This is not so.  The secondary teaching profession is anxious to ensure that the biggest single graduate profession and probably the most able profession in the country, when you take overall qualifications, must be paid allowances and emoluments worthy of that profession.  I have quotes here from John Vaizey, <i>The Economics of Education</i>.  He points out in reference to the salaries of American teachers that in absolute terms, after allowing for rising taxes, teachers' salaries had improved but that relatively, <i>vis-à-vis</i> other professions such as physicians, professors and others they had fallen behind.</P>
    <P>In the original Ryan scheme there was provision for really worthwhile allowances for principals and vice-principals. In some cases in very large schools I believe a principal would have got in excess of £1,000; a vice-principal would have got a large amount too; but now a ceiling has been imposed.  The ostensible reason for this is that putting a ceiling on the allowances will allow more money to be spread out to create newer posts.  This may very well be so, but some people are bold enough to suggest that, perhaps, the reason for this ceiling was that it would be a shocking thing if a headmaster of a secondary school or any secondary teacher were to receive total emoluments greater than that of a CEO or an inspector of the Department or some other Government employee. I should like to ask the Minister if this is the motivation for putting the ceiling on these allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be.  I have my suspicions but we shall allow the Minister to answer that one.  What will be gained by forcing the secondary teaching profession into this straitjacket which they do not want?  If the secondary schools were State-owned, then the problem would be a small one. Let us face the fact that the majority of these schools are privately-owned. They are owned by religious people of various denominations, who for reasons best known to themselves wish to retain control.  What future is there for the lay secondary teacher?</P>
      <P>The secondary teacher's salary was always regarded as being on a par with a junior executive officer.  A junior executive officer, after eight years or so, could look forward to some kind of promotion.  The secondary teacher went into teaching at 23 or 24 and was there until 65 and got no promotion. Is this the way to treat ability?  I do not think so. Is there any good reason why the honourable compromise solution of March, 1969, worked out between the managerial bodies, the Minister's Department and the secondary teachers, cannot continue?  Some people may criticise it on the basis that it is a reward for growing old, an allowance for seniority, but anybody with experience knows that when a teacher has ten years experience he is in most cases a better man.  I admit that certain young teachers of uncommon ability should be given recognition but, taking the common good of the overall group, what is there against continuing the system of allowances and increasing them according to the terms of the conciliation report, whenever percentages are increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand some of the difficulties encountered in this arise as follows. According to circular M/44/66 primary teachers could transfer to the secondary teaching side and get recognition on the secondary teachers' scale for their years of service as national teachers.  This is fine, but there is no mobility the other way.  Take the position where a large number of primary teachers whose experience is from the <Col N="2214" /> tenth year onwards go across to the secondary teaching side.  It follows that there are more people there on the senior level than there is money to provide them with these allowances according to the Ryan Tribunal scale of points.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulties and accept that he has a very difficult problem but I appeal to him, first, to grant the balance of the eleventh round to registered secondary teachers.  One cannot guarantee that if this were done they would then go into the common conciliation council but we can guarantee that if they do not get it they will not go in.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this common conciliation council.  Secondary teachers have had experience of this sort of common machinery.  There was the comparability committee which functioned until recently.  It met, but settled nothing that I could see.  People are entitled to be suspicious of this common conciliation council.  What is the situation in England where all teachers are on a common basic scale and have the Burnham Committee?  First, graduate teachers form an association of their own.  Then, every so often they go out on protracted strikes which can only be settled by the intervention of a Minister.</P>
    <P>In this connection, may I commend the example of Mr. Edward Shortt to our present Minister?  If the situation here is to be got moving our Minister must intervene so as to prevent one group being coerced by the other two. He must not lightly accept the facile statement that definable functions allowances are concealed salary.  They are not.  If they were these allowances would be regarded as pensionable when a man retired at 65.  They are averaged over three years; the Minister knows what I am getting at.</P>
    <P>This difficult situation will not be retrieved by forcing a large group of graduates, over 6,000 of them, to accept something against their will.  I suggest that, as a step to retrieve some part of the situation, the Minister, as a gesture, might give the balance of the eleventh round to this group.  There is no reason in equity why they should not get it.  I have here the statement <Col N="2215" /> of the public bodies' note of the recommendations of the working party on public service pay, 1969.  Why should one branch of the teaching profession be denied this right?  As Deputy Dr. O'Donovan rightly put it, the time is coming when the teaching profession will not be able to attract men of ability.  He said they would go to Canada.</P>
    <P>I want the House to realise that the secondary teaching profession has decided to fight hard on this issue because they believe in the justice of their case.  Last year, it was thought that they would not go on strike.  They did.  Let nobody in the House or outside underestimate their determination. If the Minister can take something from what I have said and make some move to get us out of this impasse I shall be delighted, but let him not be overinfluenced by threats from any group as to what they will do in the event of a settlement, an attempt to meet the secondary teachers' point.  The last thing that will make the secondary teachers change their mind is a display of naked power from any group.  This is not the time for such displays.  It is a time for facing facts, making reasonable compromises and holding to reasonable agreements.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by asking the Minister what was wrong in February and March, 1969, when representatives of the Department of Finance, of the teachers' side, and the managerial bodies worked out this arrangement which I say was an honourable compromise? Let us work on it and give the balance of the eleventh round to the secondary teachers.  Let us give the percentage increases as per article 4; let us give these percentages on the allowances to religious and lay teachers and make an attempt to attract people of ability into the profession.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed in reading the report of the Commission on the Universities recently to see where it was suggested that the new colleges would be a suitable place in which to train secondary teachers.  I say they are not.  A secondary teacher should have a full university degree because if the country is to progress it needs people of talent who <Col N="2216" /> can only be trained by people of talent, of high ability and of idealism. Do not tell me idealism is enough; it it not.  What do you say in the case of a teacher of foreign languages, for example, who because of inadequate salary is unable to visit European countries on holidays to perfect his knowledge of the language?</P>
    <P>Idealism alone will not get us very far.  We must remember that comparability of status with other graduate professions is very important.  I remember once listening to a very eminent engineer who said publicly that neither his son nor any of his friends' sons would ever go into secondary teaching because of its status <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other professions.  I echo the words of Deputy Dr. O'Donovan: if something is not done to remedy this situation you will not have people of ability going into the profession.  They will go elsewhere. Why should the educational authorities in the North of Ireland be able to give reasonable allowances, based on 10 points for a senior pupil, while we on this side of the Border can only give six points?  Are we going to reward level of work, difficulty of examination, amount of preparation and so on?  The secondary teaching profession has no quarrel with the basic scale and is prepared to accept remuneration which would comprehend a basic scale but that scale must have in addition allowances for qualifications and responsibility and a recognition of the high level of work.</P>
    <P>In this instance I have confined myself specifically to one aspect of the educational system because, in April, by agreement among the Whips, we will have a chance of speaking about the whole Estimate.  I repeat to all Members of the House and to all concerned that difficulties are going to arise if somebody does not take the initiative in this matter.  This document of March, 1969, was an honourable compromise in the situation in which the schools are not owned by the State. Give the allowances according to the March, 1969, scheme and there will not be any further trouble but stick in your heels and there will be trouble.  I say to the Minister that if I have spoken in this way it is not to make his situation more difficult but to make <Col N="2217" /> it clear to him that nothing will be gained by hiding from the facts and I hope to hear in his reply of some moves he is going to make towards the solution of this problem.</P>

      <P>Ba maith liom i dtosach buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht faoi chúrsaí oideachais.

      <P>Most of the Deputies referred to the fact that they were going to deal simply with the matters that were contained in the Supplementary Estimates and I will deal with those matters in my reply.  The large amount of money made available in the Supplementary Estimates pinpoints the Government's concern to develop our educational system and shows an acceleration of what is already a high rate of progress. It should be noted that much of this money is required because of the fact that more students are availing themselves of our educational facilities, with a consequent increase in the numbers of teachers and the facilities being made available generally. It is also worth noting that a considerable amount of the capital is required because of the fact that our regional technical colleges are being built more rapidly than was originally estimated.  We should be proud of this fact as very often we have complaints when the opposite is the case and it is felt that progress is not sufficiently rapid.  This also applies to the money available for the science building at Cork which is being built ahead of schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the transport system.  They were all pleased with the extra money being made available because this denotes a further improvement in the transport system.  I am sure Deputies will agree that great credit is due to all those concerned in getting this service off the ground with the speed and efficiency <Col N="2218" /> they displayed.  We should remember it is only two or three years ago since we were transporting only 6,000 students to schools; at the present time that number has risen to 100,000 and I am sure everybody will realise the difficulties and problems that arise in starting a scheme like this and in developing it.  I know there are minor irritants in regard to this transport system but whatever system we evolve it will not be perfect and there will always be some complaints about the manner in which it is being operated. We must also take the cost into consideration. The transport system is at present costing us more than £2,500,000 and to reduce the limit of three miles to two miles, as was suggested by Deputy Bruton, would cost at least another £1 million.</P>
    <P>Generally Deputies welcomed the provision of money for recreational facilities and this is only what I would expect as we all recognise the excellent work being done by various youth clubs and sporting organisations throughout the country.  Because of the money now being made available I am sure these organisations will be able to do better work in the future.  It is important that we should concern ourselves about our young people and I would mention here the fact that in making this money available there are three main areas concerned.</P>
    <P>First of all, we have youth clubs that fall into four categories: the National Federation of Catholic Youth Clubs that govern the activities of most Catholic clubs outside the Dublin diocese and operate through diocesan councils.  For the last few years they have had a grant of £2,000.  They are becoming better organised and are making courses available for adult leaders.  There is the Catholic Youth Council which is concerned with the Dublin diocese and they also had a grant.  There are smaller groups such as the Church of Ireland Clubs in some areas and there are clubs not affiliated to any particular organisation. The National Youth Council coordinates the activities of the various bodies, including other bodies not in receipt of any financial assistance at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2219" /> The second main category is sport. We intend at the moment to confine ourselves to sports that have a large participation but a small spectator content. Submissions have and are being made by the controlling organisations; questionnaires were sent to them and I think the bulk of these questionnaires have been returned.  I was asked if the money would be spent this year and Deputies may take it that it will be spent.  These questionnaires are being processed and they will give us an idea of the strength of each organisation throughout the country, what its priorities are and how it intends to develop. We intend that the individual clubs will be helped through their national organisation; where there happen to be two organisations we will give them <i>de facto</i> recognition but we will try so far as possible to promote co-operation between them.  The principal aid that will be available in this sphere will be for coaching and for the minimum facilities.</P>
    <P>With regard to community centres, we are aware of the activities of committees in various towns and cities directed towards establishing major recreational facilities, mainly facilities for indoor games and social activities.  This, of course, involves pretty heavy capital expenditure.  We cannot give financial help towards this expenditure but we do intend to assist in the provision of equipment and facilities.  As I said earlier, I am very pleased that Deputies have accepted this new venture in the spirit in which they did.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that student teachers come mainly from the rural areas.  That was the situation which prevailed originally when the preparatory colleges were in operation. If it is a fact that most of the students still come from the rural areas, then this is so simply because students in Dublin do not apparently apply for admission to the college since entrance at the moment is by way of open competition. The £25,000 required here is because we now have extern students attending the training colleges for the first time.  This is very welcome.  Last autumn we took in 150 extra students to training.  This means that we will <Col N="2220" /> have a considerably increased number of teachers in June, 1971, which is in line with our policy of progressively improving the teacher/pupil ratio.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Donovan referred to the money made available for reformatory and industrial schools. Reference was made to bad boys in some particular context.  When I became Minister one of the first duties I undertook was to have a look at the situation in these particular schools. I spent a day in Daingean and I should like to tell the House that, when one goes to Daingean and looks at all the boys gathered together, one does not see bad boys; one sees boys. One's reaction is to ask oneself what one can do to improve the lot of these young people in order to fit them for life after they leave the reformatory. I shall deal further with this on the main Estimate.</P>
    <P>Someone asked as to whether the regional technical colleges were being operated as originally intended.  We have started this year with second level post-primary classes.  It was, of course, always intended that we should have a Technical Leaving Certificate and further courses are being developed in these regional technical colleges. The further courses are at present being developed.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the provision of residential accommodation for universities.  We would welcome a certain amount of residential accommodation but we believe that, to a very considerable extent at any rate, this is a matter for private enterprise. If the universities concerned would make sites available for hostels I am sure private enterprise would be willing to go into providing this particular type of accommodation.  There have, in fact, been a number of tentative proposals in regard to this but it is not possible at this stage to say what the outcome may be.</P>
    <P>With regard to a point made by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, the setting up of the Higher Education Authority on a formal statutory basis would enable an objective appraisal of all institutions of higher education to be made.  Such a review would take cognisance not only of the requirements of the universities <Col N="2221" /> but also of the nation.  We cannot go on producing more and more graduates in some form of vacuum. Not only must the numbers be taken into consideration but also the type of graduate produced; in other words, if we go on spending more and more money on higher education, we must ensure that we secure the maximum benefit for the nation from the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the university situation was also raised here regarding the possibility of the universities being able to operate on the money made available to them.  The Supplementary Estimate represents only a part of the moneys being provided.  With the provision for 1970-71 which will appear in the main Estimate reasonable amounts will be provided for growth, student numbers and staff/student ratio.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Donovan referred to the amounts made available per student in the various universities.  From his remarks one could conclude that he is an advocate of rationalisation.  Any university, whether big or small, has to provide certain basic facilities and the larger the institute the less the average cost per student.</P>

      <P>The problem of old people in mental hospitals who do not require full hospital facilities was discussed with managers and resident medical superintendents in April last year.

      <P>One 100-bed unit at Our Lady's Hospital, Cork, has been withdrawn in this way for geriatric patients and is now being staffed by non-psychiatric personnel.  I am anxious that the authority should proceed with further developments of this kind, so as to bring about the segregation of patients suggested last April by my Department. I am also anxious that the authority should develop its active treatment facilities at Our Lady's Hospital and St. Stephen's Hospital as an important step in reducing in-patient numbers, relieving overcrowding and helping in the segregation of geriatric patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been investigated by the Commissioner.  I already informed the House of that. The chief complainant has been written to.  I quote from a paragraph of a letter which I have written on this saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Several of the statements which were forwarded single out for special mention an alleged assault on one named person&mdash;a girl&mdash;but there was neither a statement from the girl herself nor any explanation for the omission.  The Minister is informed that the girl concerned has told the gardaí she has no complaint to make and that she apologised to them for what occurred on that occasion&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information I have is that this particular group, who had been removed <Col N="2228" /> at the request of the local hotel owner, were disowned by the other protesters who carried out a peaceful protest, and that they were responsible for throwing bottles and using vile, obscene language to the gardaí concerned and that the gardaí behaved with great restraint in having them removed with no more force than was necessary.  I do not propose to take any further action in this matter.  I might mention that the gentleman who complained has intimated that he is going to take legal proceedings and I invite him to go ahead with them.</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to the Deputy's question on the same subject on 19th February, the figures which I then gave are the only ones available.  They are the result of a special inquiry.  These figures should be sufficient to enable the Deputy to evaluate the problems involved.  The assembly of statistics to provide answers to the several questions here put would take up an enormous amount of police time which, in my view, is better spent on the prevention and detection of crime, which is the primary police function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The very full reply which I gave to the Deputy on 19th February as to the numbers of persons on bail who committed further crimes stated specifically that the Garda were satisfied as to the identity of the culprits. They rely on confessions, or admissions by associate criminals, or on evidence such as fingerprints, or on actual apprehensions at the scene of the crime.  For technical legal reasons, it is not infrequent for offenders not to be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fresh offences committed by persons while on bail may not come before the court for a considerable time but nonetheless the Garda are entitled to say, without awaiting the actual conviction, that they are satisfied as to the identity <Col N="2230" /> of the offenders.  I have every confidence in the integrity of the Garda in this respect.</P>

    <P>N.B.: The offences of (1) burglary and (2) housebreaking are separate and it is necessary to differentiate between them.  In the case of burglary, the time must be the night i.e. from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., the place must be a dwelling-house and there must be breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony.  Housebreaking is (1) breaking and entering a dwelling-house, shop, warehouse, etc., and committing a felony there or (2) entering a dwelling-house in the night or breaking and entering a dwelling-house, shop, warehouse, etc., with intent to commit a felony.</P>

      <P>I should like very briefly to refer to a matter which was raised here by various Deputies, that is, teachers' salaries.  Deputies spoke on the teachers' salaries problem and they gave their various views.  This, of course, was their right but as Minister for Education I am in an entirely different position.  I must take cognisance of the fact that delicate negotiations dealing with a delicate situation are at present taking place. I have already made two statements in the Dáil on the subject of teachers' salaries and I will now confine myself to saying that I met representatives of the secondary school managers and of the ASTI recently and had a discussion with them.  The chairman of the Conciliation Council is having informal talks with all three teacher groups, including the ASTI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this very complex situation it <Col N="2240" /> must be clear to all concerned that the only possible solution for the present and past must come from an agreement to which the three teaching bodies are parties.  All of them have their problems and their difficulties.  Each group must try to recognise and show sympathy for the problems of the others and attempt to meet them.  In the process no group should claim an absolute right to hold strongly to its own position.</P>
    <P>I may say finally that I discussed this problem with a number of highly skilled and experienced negotiators and they all regard this as one of the thorniest problems they ever encountered. However, I feel that with sufficient goodwill on all sides it should be possible to reach a solution in relation to this particular matter.</P>

      <P>Nearly every Member of the House has contributed something to this debate.  The Department of Local Government is a very important Department.  I would say that <Col N="2242" /> the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; is a misnomer.  As far as the Department and the Government are concerned they are grasping slowly every facet of local administration. They are taking over completely the work that was done by the local authorities.  I regret that this is taking place.  Local authorities have contributed much over the years.  It is with regret also I say that relations between the Department, the Minister and the local authorities are gradually getting worse.  The General Council of County Councils, which has been in existence for over a hundred years, has contributed much to the work of local government. They have always done their best to co-operate with the Minister, no matter what Government were in control. It is with regret I say as chairman of that body that the Minister has not met us once since this Government came into office.  I take this opportunity of inviting the Minister and his principal officers to meetings of the general council so that we can discuss with him various problems we have.  I hope when the Minister is replying that he will assure us that he is prepared to work with the General Council of County Councils.  There are many questions which can be solved by having dialogue between the Department, the Minister and the general council.  I am very glad that the Minister is here today.  I saw him out in Walkinstown yesterday with a grand smile.</P>

      <P>I wish he would have that smile in this House and that we could act as Irishmen.  If we <Col N="2243" /> differ in politics, what about it?  We are prepared to discuss our problems. I am sure the Minister will, in the near future, change his attitude towards members of local authorities.  I am saying that without any feeling of bitterness.  I would like to see better relations between the Minister and the local authorities and the officers of his Department.  I would ask him also to be very slow to take away powers that the local authorities have had for many years.  They have done a magnificent job.  I have been a member of a local authority for the past 20 years and I can say that all members of Cork County Council work together and they forget politics when they go into the council.  They have done a very good job for the county and the ratepayers of Cork.  I hope the Minister will accept my invitation to visit the general council in the very near future and I can assure him of a very hearty welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see I have changed the Minister's outlook. His smile is as good as it was yesterday. We will be great friends before I finish.</P>
      <P>There is one problem in Cork and in all the maritime counties that has not been mentioned in this debate.  It is, of course, erosion.  In the County of Cork with many miles of seafront the position is so serious that the Department urgently requested the Cork County Council five or six years ago to get their engineers to prepare a scheme or schemes of coast protection for the villages, towns, houses and tourist resorts.  This was considered very urgent by the Minister at the time.  Cork County Council directed its engineers, who were busily engaged on other business, to prepare schemes.  These were supposed to get very big Government grants.  That is five years ago.  We sent up 20 or 30 schemes and we got back the usual letter telling us to make out our priorities.  We did that and reduced the number to four very important schemes as far as my memory goes now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> However, Youghal was No. 1 and very little has been done there.  As a matter of fact, I think it started only this year.  The amount of money given was very small and it will take a good few years before even Youghal is completed. There are other places such as Union Hall, a village which was nearly wiped out during a heavy storm three or four years ago.  This was No. 2 on the priority list but nothing has been done since.  Two other places on the coast, Courtmacsherry and Roscarberry had schemes but we have heard nothing about them since.  The Department knew that this was very urgent five or six years ago but still nothing has been done.  This is very important for Cork county with a long seaboard.  The tremendous damage done during storms could be avoided if a very small amount of money was spent on work on this seaboard.  If the Department of Local Government gave small grants for this work we would be able to fight this coast erosion in County Cork.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that in other parts of the world they take steps to avoid coast erosion and that the army has been used in some countries to combat coast erosion.  I would ask the Minister to have Army engineers and personnel employed, except when an emergency arises, on this work of preventing coast erosion.  They have done this in other countries and I would suggest to the Minister that he would discuss the matter with his colleague in the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>Every local authority in the country at this time are having their estimates meetings.  As the Minister is aware, it is compulsory for them to have their estimates in before 1st April.  During the last few years we have had to wait for the Department to send us down details of the road grants for each county and we have never had this information before the estimates meeting. We are therefore compelled to strike the rate for the county at a time when we have not before us the amount of road grants we are getting from the Department.  It is complete guesswork with the county manager and his staff until they know what grants the Department are giving.  I <Col N="2245" /> would ask the Minister to consider sending to each council before the estimates meeting the amount of road grants they will get.  It is only right that they should have that information before the meeting.</P>
    <P>This grant has gradually been reduced over a number of years.  As everybody is aware, the amount of money we will receive this year will not do the work that an equivalent amount of money did a number of years ago.  In the meantime wages have gone up, the cost of materials has gone up, all costs have gone up, but the amount of money we are getting by way of road grants would not do half the work the same amount of money did three or four years ago.  When the Minister is giving us the grant for next year he should consider increasing it considerably to meet the difference between the cost of wages, materials and other costs.  If the amount is not increased it will not be possible to do all the work that should be done to keep our roads up to standard.  The grant must be increased instead of being reduced.</P>
    <P>Another problem I wish to deal with is the delay in sanctioning housing schemes and housing grants.  Every Deputy, no matter to what party he belongs, finds it difficult to get building programmes sanctioned by the Department. There is a regular shuttle service up and down with documents going from the councils to the Department; some of them are stamped front and back they have been travelling up and down so often.  It is about time the Minister sanctioned the building of those houses.  Last year, when we sent up from West Cork a number of schemes for sanction, we found they had gone up and down at least three or four times and in the meantime the cost of those houses increased month after month.  If we got the sanction we looked for a year ago we would have saved between £300 and £400.  Therefore, as well as the delay, there are increased costs.</P>
    <P>This is becoming a serious problem for local authorities in their efforts to house the people who are badly in need of housing throughout the country. I hope the Minister will, as far as <Col N="2246" /> he possibly can, give us sanction for those works when we send for it.  I do not see the point of sending these schemes up for sanction when we have engineers in our county who are just as good as the men in the Department. They could easily carry out this work and do the job just as efficiently.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Murphy, referred to the water schemes when he was speaking on this Estimate.  We were very disappointed when the Minister refused to allow his inspectors even to attend meetings of local authorities in County Cork.  These inspectors should be there to consult with local authorities about water schemes problems.  Those schemes are all delayed by the Department. I am a member of the West Cork Council for a number of years and I know there are a number of group water schemes awaiting sanction or awaiting completion for a very long time.  There is one scheme in Adrigole on the Berehaven Peninsula where the money has been collected for two to three years, but nothing has been done since.  The people have written to the local authority that they want their money back, saying they would try to do something for themselves.  Those are the problems we are facing in regard to water schemes.</P>
    <P>The western committee of Cork County Council sent a request to the Department to give the village of Shannon Vale a water supply from the Clonakilty regional scheme.  The village is only about a quarter of a mile from the headworks of the Clonakilty regional scheme.  In the village there are 14 or 15 houses and the people in them have not got even backyards and they need this water urgently. I ask the Minister to sanction the scheme as quickly as possible so that the people of that village will have water in the near future.</P>
    <P>In Cork, like every other area, we have planning problems but our problems are bigger because, the people there being especially interested in tourism, want to build chalets and houses for visitors.  The planning authority have a big job to do because a year or two ago when we adopted the new planning system, plans for a <Col N="2247" /> period of over ten or 15 years were released and suddenly there was an avalanche of applications.  The staff to deal with them is small and it will take some time to get decisions on them.  A number of applications went to the Minister for final decision and on the whole I wish to express thanks for the manner in which they have been met by the Department.  The biggest grievance is the delay between the time the application is made and the time it returns from the Department. I wish to avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister and his officials to expedite decisions on these applications.</P>
    <P>A scheme of great benefit to rural communities was the rural improvements scheme.  It was operated from Dublin by the Special Employment Schemes Office for a number of years and a tremendous amount of work was done on small roads throughout rural Ireland.  Suddenly, a year or two ago, the number of uncompleted applications built up and the Department said they would transfer the schemes to the county councils.  This was a wise decision because councils can get through the preliminary work more quickly. However, as far as my memory serves me, the backlog which came down to Cork County Council consisted of 215 applications which had not been dealt with by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Our people have been working on this backlog but we have not got it finished.  Indeed at the last meeting we had to decide to tell people that we would not accept further applications until the backlog had been cleared.  In order to help us to do this, I appeal earnestly to the Minister to be more generous with us in regard to these schemes in the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>Schemes which have not been in operation during the past few years are those which used to be carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Schemes under this Act saved a lot of money to county councils because streams close to roads were cleared and villages which had been flooded for years were saved.  Then, this Government were returned to office and the schemes were discontinued.  I <Col N="2248" /> ask the Minister to include provision in the coming year to resume these schemes.</P>
    <P>In the area which I represent a lot of money is required for tourist development. Many people depend a lot more on tourism as time goes on but the number and the amount of grants going to Cork under this heading is very small.  For instance, County Clare got £187,000 for Kilkee.  This, for one small area, is more than Cork has been given for the entire county during several years.  We particularly require money to provide and to improve rural amenities because we cannot expect visitors to come if the amenities are not there.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his officials will consider the various points I have made.  At the end, as at the beginning, I invite the Minister and his top advisers to attend the next meeting of the General Council of County Councils. He will get a great welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because there is very little new that can be said, so many Deputies have spoken already.  There is no doubt from the number of contributions to the debate on this Supplementary Estimate of the interest Deputies take in this sector of Government administration, particularly those Members who are also members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I consider this Supplementary Estimate important from the point of view that the Department of Local Government are in no small way responsible for planning the Ireland of the future because of their activities in housing, water and sewerage schemes, and particularly in planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister's opening speech was rather complacent. Does he appreciate that there are still people in this country living under appalling housing conditions?  Does he appreciate the misery of two and maybe more families living in the one house? I am familiar with the housing situation in my constituency and in the county of Cork generally.  My constituency borders the city of Cork where we have a considerable waiting list for houses.  Quite recently, the southern housing committee of Cork County <Col N="2249" /> Council advertised a scheme of 28 houses for letting in the Douglas area. After a process of elimination we had approximately 70 applicants.  We must provide proper housing for all of those people who cannot afford to provide it for themselves.</P>
    <P>With the advent of more foreign industries here there will be a greater demand for houses for workers in those industries.  A foreign industrialist does not come to this country just for the love of the people here.  Anybody who will provide jobs here is welcome but it is a fact that these people come here primarily to make money.  There is an obligation on them to provide assistance towards housing the workers in their factories.  It is a strain on local authorities to provide houses for those people.  It is unfair to ask our taxpayers and our ratepaying public to continue indefinitely to provide houses for workers in such industries.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling situation that two, three and maybe more families may have to live in the one house in overcrowded conditions.  This has serious repercussions.  I suppose that nothing short of a crash programme would solve the problem.  Unsatisfactory housing conditions and an unsatisfactory environment have an injurious effect on children and, in due time, will throw an extra burden on our ratepayers and taxpayers.  Housing is one of the most important functions of the Department of Local Government. The Minister cannot be complacent about the present housing situation.</P>
    <P>The system of providing houses is most cumbersome and leaves a lot to be desired.  The local authority, with all their technical advisers and with all their engineers, and so on, should be in a position to provide houses without having to get prior sanction from the Department of Local Government. Unnecessary and protracted delays occur under the present system and these delays could be cut out if full powers were given to local authorities to provide their own houses.  The extraordinary part of it all is that the unfortunate people who are awaiting proper housing tend to place the blame for the housing delay on the local authority.  Surely the present system <Col N="2250" /> could at least be improved and streamlined?</P>
    <P>Planning is very necessary and very desirable.  I often wonder if the Planning Act was introduced in time.  Our country has many places of great scenic beauty and many natural amenities.  That is especially so along our coastline.  Unfortunately, some foreigners have already bought up land adjacent to beauty spots and natural amenities.  It is imperative to restrict development in such areas.  That has happened in the case of some of our beauty spots in the south.  We must preserve all our beauty spots.  I could mention several instances of planning permission which was refused by the Cork planning office.  Nevertheless, in some cases people who have been refused planning permission by the Cork planning office on appeal to the Minister for Local Government have had planning permission granted.</P>
    <P>A person who feels aggrieved about a decision should have some one to appeal to.  I know of one case where a planning applicant, who was refused planning permission in Cork, obtained planning permission from the Minister three days before the general election. If the Minister doubts that statement I can give him all the necessary information because I do not make false or wild charges.  Planning appeals should be taken out of the hands of the Minister completely.</P>
    <P>There are great changes occurring in the Department of Local Government. I can see the Department gradually usurping the powers of local authorities and I think the day that local authorities fade out will be a bad day for the country because the members elected to local authorities have a grass roots understanding of the people's problems.  A move is being made to take over our main roads and classify them as national primary and national secondary roads.  In relation to our health system&mdash;I know this is not the Minister for Local Government's responsibility&mdash;regional boards are being set up.  We are moving too fast towards centralisation and a situation where people are becoming just numbers. Instead of taking powers away from local authorities it is necessary to <Col N="2251" /> give them additional powers in relation to matters like housing and water and sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>Time and time again I have made representations to the Department of Local Government about the delays which occur in the payment of grants. I am convinced that there is a deliberate go-slow policy in the Department about the payment of grants.  I think it should be possible to pay a grant, whether it is a reconstruction grant, a new house grant or a water and sewerage grant, within one month of the date of completion of the scheme being certified as being in accordance with the Department's requirements and sent to the Department of Local Government. I have seen cases where people were waiting six months, nine months and even a year for payment. What happens is that people who are trying to reconstruct their own houses, not having the necessary money themselves, have to wait until the grant is paid before contractors can complete work.  I urge the Minister to expedite the payment of grants.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council, like every other local authority, has a housing list.  There are a number of applicants on our list who have been waiting several years for a house.  It would help to solve the problem if interest-free loans were available to those people who qualify for rehousing under the local authority survey.  This would encourage people to build their own houses, if the necessary finance was available.  What generally happens is that people living on £10 or £13 a week are reluctant to avail of SDA loans because they are afraid of the repayments.  The interest rate is crippling this scheme.  If it were not possible to provide an interest-free loan it should be possible to provide a subsidised loan.  I am satisfied that such a scheme would encourage people, who are on a waiting list for so long, to build their own houses.  Cork County Council sent a resolution suggesting such a scheme to the Minister for Local Government a number of years ago but it fell by the wayside.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for Cork County Council is severely restricted <Col N="2252" /> as far as regional water schemes are concerned.  People who are on the list for a regional water supply will remain on it for years because the money is not there to provide a scheme.  There is now a general awareness of the necessity to have a supply of running water in every house.</P>
    <P>The group scheme is a very commendable scheme which could be operated in areas not reached by local authorities.  There is, however, a lack of co-operation, and this has been referred to already in this House, between the local authorities and the Department as far as group schemes are concerned. The officials operating the group schemes in Cork are excellent men.  I have seen them in my own area long after working hours organising group schemes and pointing out the advantages in order to try to get the co-operation which is necessary to get a scheme off the ground.  Group schemes are no good except when they are taken over by the local authority.  The Minister for Local Government has refused to allow his inspectors to discuss the water schemes both regional and group in that area, and we are now faced with the position where the county engineer has stated that the scheme will not be taken over because it does not reach the standard required by Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>I know of a case where a group of nine houses was built adjacent to the town because building in the town is restricted, and where the council insisted on three inch main and the Department of Local Government insisted on one inch main.  Unfortunately, the local authority was right because we have not the water to supply the new houses. It is a bad thing that we cannot have the Minister's officials in at our meetings at least to discuss a uniform standard.  I would like the Minister to comment on that in his reply.</P>
    <P>Unless the local authorities take them over, schemes will not serve the purposes which the people believed they would.  Where there are electric pumps and booster pumps supplying groups, if anything happens, you must get the full co-operation of the group.  There is the electricity bill and there are day-to-day breakdowns.  Unless the local authorities <Col N="2253" /> take over, the schemes are not as laudable as they are supposed to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something that should be dealt with.  Recently people have become very conscious of the dangers of pollution.  Plans are well advanced for the siting of a smelter factory in Cork.  This is giving rise to concern and anxiety in relation to pollution. I have not met anybody who is anti-smelter but I have met a number of people who are concerned about pollution.  This can develop into a big industrial complex in Little Island in County Cork.  I want to pay tribute to the <i>Cork Examiner</i> which carried out a survey on this and sent people abroad to report on similar factories on the Continent and the pollution which occurred in the areas.  The agricultural <Col N="2255" /> community in Cork are very concerned about this.  I want to quote from the leading article in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Monday, 2nd March, 1970, which sums up the situation:</P>
      <P>What did emerge very clearly from this investigation was the fact that pollution was possible, though not inevitable&mdash;the distinction is important&mdash;given proper safeguards, and at this stage this is perhaps the most vital issue for this country as whole, and for Cork in particular. It has long been known that our anti-pollution laws are not at all as stringent as they might be, and some may even aver that they are so ineffective as to be almost nonexistent. This being so, the case cannot be too strongly made now for a complete reappraisal of the entire situation, and for the establishment of the sort of legislation that would prove an effective barrier against pollution of any sort.</P>
      <P>I can see and understand the concern and anxiety expressed by a number of people in that area of Little Island. There are questions that are not answered.  This project is at the initial stages and the Minister should make a statement about it to clear the air and assure the people that, if legislation is necessary it will be introduced, and if our anti-pollution laws are obsolete, this will be rectified.  This is what the people want.  As I said, they are not anti-smelter but they are concerned about the repercussions which may come from the smelter factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also know that a certain study group in Cork have studied this problem at great length.  They sent representatives abroad and they issued a report.  The farming community, the residents in the area, and a great number of people in Cork are most concerned about it and I would appeal to the Minister to deal with it when he is replying.  There is atmospheric pollution and there is water pollution. They are equally important.  In my area there is a certain concern which has a mechanical container.  It is the first of its kind to be seen in this country.  It is a sludge collector.  I <Col N="2256" /> understand from inquiries I have made that it collects the effluent and sludge from cess-pits, sewers and factories. This is dumped into streams, rivers and waste land.  Sludge collectors should be under licence and there should be some control over them.  It is very easy to pollute a public water supply and it is a great danger.</P>
    <P>Last year the road grant to Cork County Council was reduced by £128,000.  This is a pretty sizeable sum, and it is against a background of increasing costs, wages and so on.  To date we have not heard from the Minister what the grant will be for the coming year and we are now facing our estimates meeting.  It is mandatory on the council to strike the rate before a certain date and the Cork County Council will refuse to do it&mdash; and let the Minister take the same action as he took against the Dublin Corporation&mdash;unless we are notified what the grant will be.  I cannot see why the Minister cannot make known in time to the Cork County Council the amount of the road grant.  In that county there are many dangerous roads, dangerous bends on which work needs to be done and the only reason we cannot do it is the lack of the necessary finance.  I would appeal to the Minister to increase the road grant for Cork County Council for this year and to make it available in good time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the points I wish to make have been made already by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Creed, both of whom represent rural areas like myself.  In regard to the local improvements scheme, the grant we are receiving from the Department is not sufficient to take the place of the work which was previously done by the Board of Works.  There is no way of doing the work except through the local improvements scheme or a councillor's notice of motion, and the money from the latter is so small as to be insignificant.  The local improvements scheme is a good one and I would appeal to the Minister to increase the Department's contribution to Galway by at least 50 per cent this year and every year hereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 18 months ago I put down a question asking the Minister if it would <Col N="2257" /> be possible to change the percentage the local people have to pay for these local improvements schemes.  If your valuation is under £5 you get a free scheme.  It is on a scale after that: between £5 and under £7 10s you pay 2½ per cent or 5 per cent, and it goes up by 2½ per cent and 5 per cent thereafter. I gave a chart to the Minister indicating that the contribution from the local people was a little high.  At that time he rejected it, but would he look at it again and maybe on this occasion accept it?  There are many sand roads servicing little villages and houses and it would be a great help to the people living there if these roads were black-topped, if possible in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Creed I could deal with the regional water schemes and the fact that there is such a small number of them being done, but I am very much in favour of the group water schemes.  There is a motion on the Order Paper&mdash;to be taken in Private Members' Time at some time in the future&mdash;which was put down by a number of Deputies from that side of the House, incidentally, asking that the contribution of any of these people taking part in the group schemes should be no more than £40 per individual. This is something with which I fully agree.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister set up an advisory service whereby applicants who wish to take part in group water schemes may be told exactly what they have to do?  The people in rural areas know of the existence of these water schemes but an advisory service is badly needed.  It should be possible for an officer from the Department to give advice to people on how to go about preparing a group water scheme or how to go about making application for planning permission.  If a person wants to build a house at the moment he must go to his local TD or county councillor for information.  A certain section of the Department should be set aside as an advisory service for people wishing to make application for any of these schemes I have mentioned, local improvement schemes, the building of new houses, the reconstruction of houses and so forth. It should not be necessary for people <Col N="2258" /> to go begging to one public representative or another for this information.  It makes them feel they are under a compliment when they should be under no compliment whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Planning is a good thing but I should like to see the planning laws universally applied.  I have a feeling they are not.  I know of houses that were built in Galway city and extensions added to them without planning permission.  If they had applied for planning permission they would have been refused but they added extensions to these houses and, for one reason or other, no action was taken.</P>
    <P>Planning as a whole should be taken from the hands of the Minister.  I am not expressing my view of the Minister as an individual but we should not have one individual with so much power in his hands that he can say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to anybody in the country who applies for planning permission. This power should be transferred to an impartial group who could decide without reference to the applicant or to his political standing.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a new classification of the road network into national, regional and county roads.  I wrote to the Department about this matter some time ago.  The main Galway-Sligo road traditionally passed through Tuam, Dunmore, Cloonfad, Ballyhaunis and Charlestown.  It has now been decided, and the Minister apparently accepts, that the national road should go from Tuam to Claremorris through Knock and Kilkelly and into Charlestown.  Without criticising those who drew up these plans, whatever it might cost to bring the road up to the proper standard between Tuam and Knock, it would cost all the money in the world to do this through Kilkelly.  I have travelled that road and I can see no reason why it was declared to be a national primary road. To get from Knock to Charlestown through Kilkelly would cost, in my opinion, £1 million a mile.  It is going through as rough country as one ever travelled.  The national primary road should have gone along the traditional route.</P>
    <P>In Dunmore we set up a committee <Col N="2259" /> to petition Galway County Council and the Minister in this matter.  In fact, the county council have no power at all.  Many local bodies think they have power but in fact their meetings consist of a lot of hot air of which little notice is taken.  We petitioned with a view to getting this Galway-Sligo road through Dunmore and Ballyhaunis.  That has gone by the board but the Minister indicated in his reply that the road <i>via</i> Dunmore and Ballyhaunis to link with Charlestown would be classified as a regional road and the necessary improvements to bring it up to that standard would be made.  I appeal to the Minister to make available the capital necessary to do this at the earliest opporunity.  I cannot help referring to this road which is in a terrible condition between Dunmore and Tuam and Dunmore and Ballyhaunis.  It is important that we should get the capital necessary to improve this road.  Its present condition is deplorable due to bad bends and surface and it is very dangerous.</P>
    <P>I put down a fair number of questions during the year to the Minister for Local Government and I recently asked a question about housing at the Children's Home, Tuam.  As usual, the Minister, wishing to prove, I suppose, his ability, replied: &ldquo;Did you see that I wrote to one of your colleagues and it appeared in the local paper last week?&rdquo; I also wrote to the Minister's Department regarding these houses and I got a reply saying that they received my letter on 12th instant.  Actually, I wrote two letters but they did not refer to the first one.  They said the housing authority layout for the first 18 houses on the former site had been approved subject to one amendment; that the council have been told that they might seek tenders for the work. This letter was posted to me on 25th February, 1970.  I have here also the paper, the <i>Tuam Herald</i>.  The dates in this matter are very important.  This paper went to press on 24th February so that at 12 o'clock on 24th, if you had any matter that you wanted printed, it was too late for publication.</P>
    <P>The letter I got from the Minister regarding these houses was posted on <Col N="2260" /> 25th, which was Wednesday.  But I see in this paper, which had to go to press on Tuesday, 24th, a copy of a letter similar to mine which was sent, as it said, to Deputy M.F. Kitt and Deputy Thomas Hussey.  I want to know from the Minister how it is that when three Deputies from the same constituency write to him regarding a certain problem, as happened in this case&mdash;all separate letters, I suppose&mdash;he happened to reply to two of them a couple of days, at least, before replying to the other?  He must admit that by doing this he is using his office as Minister for Local Government for political purposes. Has the Minister anything to say to that?  I do not mind what he says; he is well aware of what he has done.  What he has done in this regard is similar to what many other Departments have done and are doing in this line.  If the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Local Government resorts to these tactics all the time&mdash;and this is a glaring example&mdash;I am sure if he got sufficient power and, as he said earlier in interruption, if he got the Constitution in his hands, he would make a fine job of it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to be impartial in his ministerial decisions.  I have many examples to the contrary. That is not why he was appointed to that office.  I hope the Minister will take note of the points I have made and put some of them into operation in the coming year.</P>

      <P>I shall be brief because anything I might say now would only be repetition of what has already been said.  A debate on an Estimate for Local Government brings one into a very wide field and gives opportunities to Deputies to speak on various matters.  Many Deputies have chosen to be critical of the Minister's housing programme but have avoided being complimentary on the efforts of the Minister to solve this great problem.  I do not think anyone is more aware of the housing needs than the present Minister for Local Government.  He has done an excellent job in maintaining housebuilding at its present rate.  Whenever the standard of living improves it is natural to expect an increased demand for improved housing <Col N="2261" /> and, to my mind, this is the answer to all the criticism we have heard.  There is an improved standard of living in this country and that is creating a demand on local authorities for better housing.  This is the way it should be and every effort should be made by the Department to meet this demand.</P>
      <P>Cork city has achieved much in local authority housebuilding and we are in the happy position today of keeping pace with the demand for houses. It is estimated that from 1972 onwards we will need an output of about 300 houses per annum&mdash;which I think is a conservative figure.  The population of Cork city is increasing, we are becoming highly industrialised and this will create greater demands on Cork Corporation so far as housing is concerned. We welcome all kinds of industry to our city because it strengthens our economy and an improved economy means more money for financing our housing programme.  Private house building in Cork city has reached a significant figure.  In 1968-69 the number of houses built in Cork was 554, which is an all-round record figure.  This kind of building must be encouraged and it can only be done when houses are available at reasonable cost.  I sometimes think that more increased grants at times only encourage an increase in the cost of private housebuilding which cannot be regarded as a satisfactory development.</P>
      <P>A point I should like the Minister to look at is the hold-up of three large private housebuilding schemes in Cork, the number of houses involved being as great as 400.  We have been inquiring from the local authority the reason for the hold-up and, perhaps, the Minister might inquire into the matter to ensure that private house building will not be held up without a very good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of houses for old people, every local authority should apportion part of their building schemes for old people.  This aspect has been neglected by local authorities for many years.  By providing houses for old people within a housing scheme this ensures that those people are not isolated from the rest of the community. A report issued last week regarding the aged laid specific emphasis <Col N="2262" /> on this and I know the Minister has a particular interest in providing such houses.</P>
    <P>Another problem in Cork at the moment is our fire brigade station. The existing station is not suitable and we are anxious to provide the most modern equipment for the brigade.  Our plans are with the Minister and I would appreciate if he would expedite this matter because there is an urgent need for a modern fire-fighting service in Cork.</P>
    <P>In regard to the purchase of old houses, I think local authorities should make available loans to young married couples who may wish to purchase those houses.  For some reason local authorities seem to discourage this and I have heard of cases in my city where good old houses could have been purchased for sums varying from £800 to £1,200 but the potential purchasers were refused loans.  It is a pity to see a good old house falling into a derelict state when it might have been purchased and maintained in good order and I do not know why local authorities are discouraging this practice. Building in Cork is at its maximum at the moment and we have not sufficient tradesmen to do all the necessary work. Recently one of our larger businesses had to bring from England 40 carpenters in an effort to keep abreast of the demands made by the local authority on them.  This is a good feature and I am sure Cork will enjoy many long years of full employment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>We are living in a time when people want to purchase their own homes. County Managers should prepare some scheme whereby local authority tenants could purchase their homes but when they are preparing such a scheme let it be within the financial reach of the tenants.  There is no point in local authorities spending weeks drawing up some scheme and then finding it is beyond the capacity of the tenants to purchase the houses.  Much money could also be saved by local authorities as far as maintenance of houses are concerned but the schemes on hand at the moment are completely beyond the capacity of tenants to purchase their own homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2263" /> Another point which I mentioned some time ago is that many of our local authority houses have large gardens both at the front and the rear and in some cases it is a burden on tenants to maintain them in good order.  I sometimes wonder if we should have gardens only at the back rather than at the front of the house. Space is an important factor where housebuilding is concerned, especially in Cork where ground is not easily available, and when schemes are being prepared we should have another look at this aspect of our housebuilding.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, I think, done an excellent job so far in keeping abreast of the demand and we, in Cork, are in the very happy position, for the first time in the history of our house building activity, in which our tenants actually have a choice of house and I know that in the years ahead Cork will go on keeping abreast of the demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to make a few general observations about the activity and the responsibilities of the Department before I go on to deal with specific matters in more detail.  One of the most contentious matters arising on this Supplementary Estimate is that of rates.  In general, one would have no objection at all to the idea of a property tax.  No tax is ever welcome and I think property should be taxed just as much as income is taxed.  However, our present rating system is a very old-fashioned and archaic one.  In most cases valuations are out-of-date and bear little or no relation to the actual earning capacity of the property on which the valuation is made.  There is a great need for a re-valuation of all property for rating purposes.  If one has a property tax it is questionable whether the financing of certain specific services should be by way of property tax.  It is arguable that the revenue from such a tax should go into a general fund so that no particular tax, be it a tax on property or a tax on income, would rise too quickly relative to the other.  A particular example in my own constituency is that of malicious damage.  Last year there was <Col N="2264" /> an outbreak of malicious damage and it is most unfair that the rates in one year should be suddenly jumped up because of this increase in malicious damage, which is something over which the vast majority of ratepayers have no control whatsoever.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech the Minister took considerable credit for the increase in housebuilding over the last few years.  Far be it from me to deny credit where credit is due, but it is undeniably a statistical fact that more houses have been built in the last few years than in the preceding years, though the rate of progress has not equalled that achieved during the last inter-Party Government.  What has been happening is that the Minister has been trying to catch up on the backlog left by his predecessor.  In response to severe public pressure he is now stepping up activity in housing.  I welcome this activity and I welcome his responsiveness to public pressure, but it must not be forgotten that the backlog was allowed to develop and the Minister is now feverishly trying to catch up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made during the debate to the type of house being built. So far as I can see there is a shift away from local authority housing to grant-aided housing.  This shift has been faster than would be warranted by the increase in the standard of living, which would naturally lead to people building their own homes rather than going into local authority housing. The shift away has been too fast, even in the light of the improvement in the standard of living, and it is now fairly evident that Government policy is directed towards a move away from providing houses for the less well-off sections of the community, namely, those who normally come in under the heading of local authority tenants. The Government are now moving towards the provision of houses for the middle income group.  The shift may not be as great as other speakers have argued, but there is undeniably a shift and the less well-off sections are not getting the service they should be getting from the Government in respect of house building.  I hope that in future the Minister will give greater emphasis to the building of local <Col N="2265" /> authority housing because lack of housing is felt most by those who have the smallest incomes.  They are the people most concerned in getting local authority housing.  If the Minister is going to step up housing he should concentrate as far as possible on local authority housing which will cater for those who really need houses.</P>
    <P>One result of the shift is that the State contribution is somewhat lower than it would be if it were local authority housing which was being erected. The Minister is succeeding to some extent in producing statistics to prove more houses are built without, in fact, increasing the State contribution.  For political purposes this may be producing a very useful statistic but the figures do not indicate a commensurate increase in Government activity in housing when the statistic is accompanied by a shift away from local authority housing to grant-aided housing in respect of which the State contribution is less.  I would not deny the Minister credit for improving the housing situation over the past few years, but there are certain deficiencies.  There is definitely need for greater concentration than there is at present on local authority housing, the housing which serves the needs of the poorest sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise is the delay encountered by local authorities in respect of schemes they submit to the Department.  There may be certain staffing difficulties in the Department but some of the delays cannot be excused on that ground alone. These delays have been taking place for quite a long period and, if there were staffing difficulties, surely these could have been overcome and the position improved in the light of past experience.  Surely staffing arrangements could have been made to meet the anticipated demands in respect of schemes sent in for sanction.  A great deal can be done in the Department to ensure that schemes are dealt with more quickly than they have been heretofore.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the role of local government in the promotion of a more democratic community. While many people have been thinking of the introduction of democratisation <Col N="2266" /> in the field of industry and in the vocational areas&mdash;a development I welcome&mdash;local government as a field for improvement from the point of view of participation by ordinary citizens in the shaping of their environment has been neglected to some extent.  Local councils are in danger of becoming mere rubber stamps for decisions taken elsewhere. In some cases the local authorities are too big to provide the ordinary citizen with any sense of participation in their activities.  An ordinary citizen in the city of Dublin can feel no sense of participation in the decisions taken by his representatives in City Hall, if these representatives are allowed to function, which they are not at the present time.</P>
    <P>In small councils there may be greater personal contact between the electorate and the elected representatives. There are many areas where citizens can feel no sense of participation in the decisions taken on their behalf.</P>
    <P>There is need to review the whole field of local government to allow greater participation by the citizens. There is need for official recognition of the activities of development and residents' associations.  They should be incorporated in the process of local government on a more formal basis than heretofore.  This would help the ordinary citizen to participate through them in local government decisions to a greater degree.  Elective councils are needed at a lower level than the county.  In Meath there is a definite case for elective councils in electoral areas as well as at county levels.  The electoral area councils could act as consultative councils in respect of local authority decisions being taken about their functional area, and also could be conferred with a power similar to the power of a Parliamentary Question such as we have in this House.  They might not have responsibility for the actual decisions but they would be in a position to call before them an official who took a decision and make him explain his decision in public. This whole question of giving local councils the power to ask questions, even if they have not power over the officials answering such questions, is <Col N="2267" /> important.  They would have the power to elicit information as to the rationale behind the decision and to expose the decision to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that the right to ask questions could be conferred on the councils not only in respect of those spheres of activity which are within the sphere of the Department of Local Government, such as housing, health and sanitary services, but also in regard to any decision taken by any Government Department in respect of their area.  This would ensure that citizens would feel they had some influence on the decisions taken on their behalf. They would be able to ensure that no decisions inimical to their interests are taken.</P>
    <P>On the 25th February, 1970, I asked the Minister for Local Government a question.  The implications of this question are of interest.  They may be of a rather more detailed nature than the matters with which I have been dealing up to now.  I asked the Minister for Local Government the number of inspectors from his Department at present inspecting new houses for grant purposes in each county and the number of applications for new house grants in each county in 1969.  I was very gratified by the helpful way in which the information was presented to me in reply to that question.  The Minister's officials went to great lengths to provide me with this information in as useful a form as possible.  The reply was in the form of a tabular statement which showed the number of new houses for grant purposes, the number of inspections in each county, and the number of actual allocations of grants in each county during 1969. I was able to work out the average number of allocations per inspector, thereby finding out that certain inspectors in some counties have a high work load while others in other counties have a low work load.</P>
    <P>The figures are indicative of the fact that there is a great need for more inspectors in some areas where they have a great number of inspections whereas in other areas the need is not so great.  This would explain the imbalance between areas in regard to <Col N="2268" /> the number of inspections.  It would explain why it is difficult to get an inspection carried out in some areas. I know of two cases in my own constituency where a house was ready for inspection in July, 1969, but was not inspected until last month, a time lag of six months.  I made representations to have the inspection carried out. Otherwise the delay might have been longer.  A time lag of six months between completion of a house and inspection, for grant purposes, is too long.  People are kept out of their money.  Often they need that money to pay the contractor who is pressing them.  They may not be able to pay the money until they have been paid the grant.</P>
    <P>Four inspectors are now engaged in new house grant inspection work in Dublin.  Four are employed on this work in Cork-Kerry, two in Mayo, two in Galway and Tipperary (North Riding) together, and one in each other county.  Some time is also spent on this work by the six supervisory inspectors. By taking the figures for the number of house allocations in each county and the number of inspectors operating in those counties I was able to work out whether the inspectors were above or below the average in regard to the work load imposed on them.  There were 9,888 house allocations in 1969 and 32 inspectors.  The national average of allocations per inspector was 309.  In Carlow there were 66 allocations&mdash;substantially below the average.  The inspector was not overworked. In Cavan there were 101 allocations&mdash;the inspector's load was also below average.  In Clare there were 385 allocations but only one inspector which put him substantially above the average as regards the number of allocations.</P>
    <P>This is particularly aggravated by the fact that Clare is a large and widespread county with great distances between one house and another which the inspector might have to inspect. One inspector for the whole county is very unfair.  They have very many housing allocations coming up and they have only one inspector to carry out the inspections.  I am sure there must be a considerable delay in this field in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> Taking Cork and Kerry and the borough of Cork together I find that the average, with four inspectors, is 373 which is also substantially above the average for the country of 309. There is, therefore, a fair case for saying there is a need for increasing the number of inspectors in the Cork-Kerry area.  Donegal is about average at 295.  Dublin with four inspectors is away above average with 884.  This I suppose is understandable in view of the fact that the inspectors do not have long distances to cover and also because there tends to be large schemes of houses coming up for grant and I suppose if the inspector approves of one he will approve of the lot.  While I could not be sure that there is a need for an increased number of inspectors in Dublin I would imagine that there probably is.  Galway and Tipperary (North Riding) are below average at 270.  Kildare, one of the counties I represent, is well above average at 354.  Like Clare it is a dispersed county in which the distances to be covered are quite lengthy and a county in which there would not be large schemes of houses to be inspected and approved <i>en bloc</i>.  It would appear to me, therefore, there is a need also for an increased number of inspectors in Kildare.  I suggest that Meath and Kildare could be combined and given an extra inspector because Meath also is well above average in this respect in that there were 323 allocations there.</P>
    <P>Another place which is well above average is County Limerick where the figure is 470.  There is definitely an argument for combining Limerick with Clare and giving them one or two extra inspectors to ensure that delays would not be as severe as they probably have been.  Another place which was above average was the county and city of Waterford at 366.  I would say there was also a fair case for having an extra inspector there.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on this point, I should like to sum up.  The places which I think require an extra number of inspectors are the counties of Clare, the region Cork-Kerry, possibly Dublin, County Kildare and County Meath, Louth&mdash;which I omitted and the average for which is 389&mdash;Waterford and <Col N="2270" /> Limerick.  The Minister may draw my attention to the fact that a proportion of the time of the six supervising inspectors is also occupied on this work and it is therefore possible that these supervisory inspectors could move into the areas in which there is the greatest backlog and relieve the inspectors who, on my average, would appear to be overworked.  However, this is probably a haphazard way of meeting the difficulties as the supervisory inspectors have other work to do and it is probably not an adequate way of dealing with it.  I would ask the Minister to consider increasing the inspection staff as the need to do so would appear to arise from the figures kindly supplied by the Department.</P>
    <P>As I was saying when I started my contribution, a considerable number of local authorities have experienced severe delay in respect of schemes submitted by them for approval by the Department.  In some cases this may have been not so much because the Department had any real objection to the scheme but because they did not have the money to finance it.  In order to avoid having to admit bluntly that they had not the money they said they objected to it on technical grounds and by spreading out the coming and going of memoranda about technical difficulties they succeeded in deferring having to pay for the scheme for some time until they had the money or until local feeling had built up to such an extent that they had to give in.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to some schemes in my own constituency.  I know that in the past there have been very great delays in connection with some schemes from County Meath but at present there are not that many schemes with the Department which are experiencing delay. This is only the case because of the hard work done by my colleague, Deputy Tully, in harrying the Department into giving approval for these schemes.  He has been particularly active in this regard and there are many schemes which would still be resting on some shelf in the Department of Local Government if it had not been for Deputy Tully who kept after the Department.  There was a scheme for tender for 36 isolated cottages <Col N="2271" /> and we have an example here of what happened, the sort of delaying tactics undertaken by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government were very magnanimous.  In September, 1969, they gave approval to the county council to allow them to accept the tender for these 36 isolated cottages but&mdash;a rather important point &mdash;they did not give approval until February, 1970, for the council to undertake a loan to finance the erection of these cottages.  Therefore, the granting of approval of acceptance of the tender in 1969 was virtually meaningless because they did not grant them until February, 1970, the necessary sanction for getting the loan to finance the scheme.  This is an example of the sort of thing I have been talking about, where the Department is trying to hold on to the money and is going through a sort of charade of giving approval and not really giving approval in order to avoid having to pay up the money. In regard to housing the severest delay and probably the most culpable is not so much encountered in respect of approval of the initial drawings of houses but in regard to the approval of the acceptance of tenders.  I can readily concede that where initial drawings are being sent in, where the question of a contractor has not arisen, where the plans of the houses have been submitted to the Department, there may be great delay and reasonable delay here.  There are bound to be a great number of technical difficulties in studying drawings for a housing scheme.  I would mention that the average time spent in regard to initial drawings of housing schemes in Meath has been about nine months in the Department.  This has been the general experience in respect of schemes in Ashbourne, Dunshaughlin, Slane, Athboy, Enfield and Dunderry but these, thanks to a great extent to the work of my colleague Deputy Tully, have now been approved.  The big difficulty in the past has arisen not in respect of approval of initial drawings but when the drawing has been approved, tenders are invited by the local authority.  The tenders are sent in and the local authority send in a recommendation to the <Col N="2272" /> Department of Local Government as to which tender they believe should be accepted.  A great delay occurs in this area where the Department does not sanction inspection of the tender without very considerable delay in many cases.  I feel that this is much more culpable than the delay in respect of initial drawings because there are no great technical questions arising here. The questions posed to departmental officials are quite simple: &ldquo;Is the contractor competent?  Is the price right?&rdquo; These are relatively simple questions on which there does not have to be a great amount of technical debate or memoranda going hither and thither. The fact that there has been delay here is really culpable.</P>
    <P>In respect of schemes in Meath which will be submitted in the near future, particularly the Dunshaughlin scheme which has probably now gone to the Department, it is vital that there should be no delay in regard to acceptance of tenders.  There is no real justification for this delay.  It is particularly awkward in view of the fact that people see the advertisements in the newspapers inviting tenders for the erection of houses.  Then the big delay occurs in regard to the acceptance of tenders and, as a result, people become despondent.</P>
    <P>I want to make one point about grant inspections.  There is one reason why there is a particular need to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that inspections of new houses for grant purposes take place quickly and that no inspector is overloaded in respect of this work.  The reason is that in many cases the people who build houses rely on the inspector to act, to some extent, as their architect because many of them cannot afford to avail of the services of an architect. If the inspector is rushed, if he has got an excessive work load, he will not be able to give them that high quality of inspection of the plan of the house which will help people and ensure that no mistakes are made in respect of the erection of the house.  If the inspector is overloaded he will not be able to do the job properly.  It is vital that wherever there is an inspector who is overloaded with work the necessary <Col N="2273" /> steps are taken to ensure that he is given assistance.</P>
    <P>I should like now to pass to the question of the efficiency of county councils.  There is possibly an argument for having some form of training, perhaps institutional or perhaps in the form of evening courses or something like that, for new councillors every time there are local elections.  Many councillors have found that it takes them quite a long time to come to grips with the technicalities of local government, with all the various regulations and so on with which they have to cope.  I feel that many of them, probably for the first year or two on a local authority, are not able to make the contribution which they should be able to make, that they are not able to stand up as well as they would like to for those who elected them, because they simply do <Col N="2274" /> not have a full knowledge of all the regulations and all the complexities of local authority questions.  If these courses were provided it could mean really effective councillors right from the start.  I hope that the Minister, in co-operation with the Institute of Public Administration, will take the necessary steps to ensure that there are courses held in Dublin, although I far as I know, there are some such courses held in Dublin, although I am not sure about this, but I feel they should be provided in each county for new councillors.  This is probably not a matter for which the Minister has a particular responsibility, but I feel there is need for councillors to specialise in particular areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the amount of pension which would have been paid to each of the retired forestry workers referred to in a reply to Question 27 of today if the pension scheme for un-established State employees offered to the trade unions in November, 1969, had been in operation, expressing the pension payable as a percentage of the actual retiring wage on which the gratuity, in each case, was calculated.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy would involve a substantial <Col N="2239" /> amount of nugatory work on purely hypothetical calculations and the expenditure of official time involved in making such calculations would not be justified.</P>
