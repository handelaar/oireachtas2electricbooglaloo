      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was speaking about events in the north and I tried to show our abhorrence of certain recent happenings there.  We must deplore the action of some people who would place a bomb in the home of a Protestant clergyman, endangering not only his life but the lives of his family, or the action of those people who would try to blow up a publichouse because its owner was a Catholic.  The vast majority have no time for the actions of these extremist groups and therefore we must show our abhorrence by condemning such actions.  I said last night also that Britain was the evil influence behind Partition; however I am glad to see that in recent times there has been a change and the British Government did discuss with the Government here questions affecting the north.  Up to recently they had persisted in the rather stupid attitude that this was a matter for the two Governments while by every possible means they were perpetuating this unnatural division of the country and hence an unnatural division among the people.</P>
      <P>Our sympathies lie with the people in the north and when I say &ldquo;the people&rdquo; I mean those of all shades of opinion and of all religious sects.  The ruling class in the north have exploited the wage earner and the unemployed, whether he be Protestant or Catholic, because they want to maintain the <i>status quo</i> which suited them.  We here must do some soul searching in order to show what we can offer the people of the north in a united Ireland.  Both here and in the north we have been accused of always mixing religion with politics, but I do not know how you can keep them apart since they are two such very important factors in our lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That great man Mahatma Gandhi, who could never be accused of being a bigot but a man with a tremendous love for his fellowman whatever his <Col N="2311" /> creed or colour, on one occasion said: &ldquo;Most religious men I have met are politicians in disguise.  I, however, who wear the guise of a politician am at heart a religious man.&rdquo;  The point I am making is we should not try to separate religion from politics.  That has happened in other places and we have seen as a result the creation of a sick society.</P>
    <P>When I hear people in the south talking about the changes that must be made in the Constitution in order to make life here attractive for the people in the north when we are united, I think that surely we must very often insult the Protestant conscience by suggesting that, were we to have a more permissive society, this would attract the people in the north.  Let us pay tribute to the staunch Protestant churchgoers in the north.  The vast majority of them have a very strict code of conscience and morals and would not be attracted by some of the things which have been suggested and which it is said would be attractive to them.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Constitution must be amended should we go into the EEC.  I know that is true. Article 44 is invariably trotted out as the No. 1 amendment.  Comments from all sources on this particular Article really make it irrelevant.  It does not mean a thing and I do not know that its removal would impress our Protestant brethren in the north.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not agree with the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  The Article is irrelevant.  All sides have said it does not matter and, if it does not matter, I cannot see any trouble about removing it.  Other amendments of the Constitution may not be so simple.  I am sure we will have to do a great deal of thinking and a great deal of hard work before the referendum is ready to go before the people.  It will be the people who will decide, not the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to hold up as a model some kind of sick society to our people in the north.  We want to show them that, as a community north and south, we can make a society here which will ensure a decent living for <Col N="2312" /> all our people, with complete freedom of thought and complete freedom of religion.  We want to show them that we can create conditions far superior to those now existing in the north. There has been a great deal of discrimination in the north&mdash;no one can deny that&mdash;and we welcome the start at least of some reforms which will make things easier and better for every man, woman and child in the north irrespective of persuasion.  We know the bitterness created in the hearts of the people there.  We hear constant references to the &ldquo;Catholic area&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Protestant area&rdquo;.  This is really tragic and one of the reforms that could do much to remove this kind of stupid labelling would be if houses were allocated not on the basis of religion or politics but on the basis of need. Whether a man lives in Ballymurphy or in the Shankill Road he should be there because he needed a new dwelling and has been given it.</P>
    <P>Housing is a basic problem north and south of the Border.  Last night I paid tribute to Belfast Corporation and the Northern Ireland Housing Trust for doing some tremendous work about housing there.  We have been criticised for our housing drive.  Let us take stock of what we have done and what still remains to be done.  Bad housing is the root cause of many of our social problems. I do not know how one could expect a family badly housed, or not housed at all perhaps, to respect our institutions and our way of life when they lack the basic requirement of a proper house in which to rear a family. People regard a system which fails to provide these essentials with a good deal of suspicion.  Let us rejoice that in both Belfast and Dublin, and throughout the country as a whole, there are people of all persuasions who see the housing shortage as a grave social problem and who are trying, despite many difficulties, to solve it.  When we have reduced the housing problem to a minimum we will have laid the foundations of a better society.</P>
    <P>I am no economist and I do not propose to say much about inflation. Inflation is a world-wide problem.  We must solve our own inflationary problem. We are told that wage increases are the cause of inflation.  One cannot <Col N="2313" /> isolate wage increases from all the other contributory factors and say that wages alone are to blame.  There are other factors involved, factors over which we have no control.  The price of imported materials is one.  We have no control over it.  It sends prices up.  If we are to provide full employment for all our people we must tackle our costings.  If we do not export or if we do not maintain or increase the existing potential we cannot provide employment. Whether it is the economist or the sociologist who will solve this problem there is a grave duty on all of us to bend our efforts to bringing under control the inflationary tendencies. Invariably these tendencies hit hardest the weaker sections of the community. I cannot offer any solution but we must tackle the problem to the best of our ability.  Inflation is not new and it should not be difficult, therefore, to find a cure for it.  I will leave the cure to the economists and the financial experts.</P>
    <P>Our bad history in industrial relations was mentioned yesterday.  Strikes, official and unofficial, are to be deplored.  It is easy to talk but it is not easy to offer any constructive suggestion as to how to avoid strikes.  If men decide to strike who will stop them? Their cause may be just, or it may be unjust, but that is not really the point at issue.  I applaud the efforts of the Congress of Trade Unions in their new plan about picketing.  I believe the problem of industrial relations will be solved not by the Government but by the trade unions and the employers.  It is they who must examine the problem of why we have one of the worst records in Europe where industrial relations are concerned.  It may be argued that we are an intensely individualistic people and we do not like to be driven.  That may be so, but we must face the fact that all of us have got to serve the common good and any action taken by a worker or an employer must be examined from the point of view of whether or not it is contributing to the common good.  The solution of this problem may require great sacrifices but if we can bring it home to the workers that these sacrifices were asked for in the light of the <Col N="2314" /> wealth, or the lack of it, on the part of individuals some progress might be made.  We must bring it home that we have a just system here and that everybody counts, be he rich or poor, working on the factory floor or in the executive suite.  When people talk of an incomes policy I always have the feeling that we do not get across that what we mean by this is not just control of wages but control of incomes too, irrespective of their source.</P>
    <P>We must get it across to the people that an incomes policy is a fair system that will ensure a man will have sufficient wages to rear his family in suitable conditions.  I do not know of any country that has got a really effective incomes policy.  We are told that Sweden has the almost perfect system but this is not true.  It is not possible to devise the perfect system but we must try to plan it as best we can.</P>
    <P>When Captain O'Neill was Premier in the north, on one occasion he asked the people what kind of Ulster they wanted and we should now ask ourselves what kind of Ireland we want. If we are to be reunited it will call for new thinking and for sacrifices on our part.  Basically we are at one with the minority in this country.  The Orangemen and the Apprentice Boys have a certain idealism and they are convinced that by holding their parades they are safeguarding their heritage and traditions.  Although we may consider they are confused in their thinking, we must respect their beliefs and it is our task to show them that in a republican State or in a federal State their religious beliefs will be respected. If they want to celebrate the Battle of the Boyne&mdash;which to our mind is irrelevant&mdash;let them do so as long as they do not deny others the right to hold differing views.  The basic problem in the north is that some people think they have a monopoly of wisdom and patriotism.  However, a change in this attitude is now apparent and I shall welcome the day when the parade on the 12th July and the 12th August can take place and be regarded merely as another procession.  However, I would stress these parades should only be allowed when they do not infringe on basic rights of others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2315" /> In the past year there have been many protest marches in this city.  Although we all agree that it is a fundamental right to protest against some grievance, we know of many instances where a protest that was worthy at the beginning ended up being quite the reverse. There have been some demands that the Government should restore the dissolved Dublin City Council and it was stated that it was the negation of democracy to remove elected representatives from their posts.  I recall the time over a year ago when the city council was in existence a group were allegedly protesting about the shortage of houses.  However, their method of protest at the City Hall was not to impress on the city fathers the need for more houses but to beat up members of the city council who were giving unpaid services and doing their best to solve the housing needs of this city. Since then I have had my suspicions about some of those protests.</P>
    <P>When the civil rights movement started in the north it did much good work and it would be tragic if it became the plaything of extremists.  I look to the good sense of those at the head of that movement to ensure that their protests will be in support of worthy causes and to make certain that elements of any political persuasion do not use the movement for their own ends.  It is inevitable, I suppose, that efforts will be made by unscrupulous people to use protest marches for their own ends and to cause trouble.</P>
    <P>The Government have intimated they will bring in new legislation to prevent squatting in houses.  Already there have been adverse comments that this legislation will penalise some of our citizens who have no houses.  I would cite one occasion where Dublin Corporation welfare officers investigated the case of a blind man living in a scheme of old-type flats.  They promised him he would get the first new suitable flat that became available.  Eventually they obtained a suitable flat and when they took the blind person to it they found that some thugs had broken into the premises and taken possession.  It was not a man with a young family who <Col N="2316" /> was responsible but it was grown-up individuals who deprived this blind person of a suitable home.  If the new legislation will prevent occurrences like this it will certainly have my support.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will also prevent groups from encouraging homeless people to take over premises.  In many instances these groups could not care less about the people they are purporting to help and, far from helping the housing programme, they are impeding it.  This is one of the reasons the Government have prepared anti-squatting laws.  They will not be used against the man with a young family&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that this matter has been discussed in the Housing Bill which is coming back to this House with amendments from the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated that law and order are in danger of being overthrown by extremist forces.  I do not accept this view because, despite the troubles we have been experiencing, we have no more difficulties than any comparable country in the world.  We must ensure that any laws enforced in this country will ensure that the weakest section of our people will be guaranteed full fundamental rights.  In times of strife, as indeed always, it is the weaker sections of the people who will suffer.  I mention this because of a reference last night from the Opposition benches to jobbery and victimisation not on a religious basis but on a political basis.  It was stated that one had to be a member of Fianna Fáil before one would get promotion in various fields.</P>

Until we have full employment, we shall be accused of putting party members into jobs. I suppose this thing has built up over many years&mdash;not proof but a belief is built up.  It is perhaps indicative of the frustration being endured by the Opposition that in effect they say: &ldquo;Here is a party in power.  It can dole out jobs to its own supporters.&rdquo;  I certainly would not support any such scheme.  I believe a man should be appointed on his ability provided he <Col N="2318" /> has been given the opportunity of qualifying for the job.  When every citizen will have equal educational opportunity, as a start, we shall be able to pick the best qualified man because he has proved himself.  That is the precept of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash;that we pick the best man, taking the broad view of the person involved. I deny emphatically that there is any such great plan in the Fianna Fáil Party for placing its own men.</P>

      <P>The kind of Ireland we want is one where there exists complete opportunity for people irrespective of religion or politics.  We in the south have set an example of non-discrimination.

Our best endeavours should go forth from here to remove their fears&mdash;and some people in the north have genuine fears in regard to various matters.  Our whole desire should be to show these people that they have nothing to fear as regards their right whether it is a religious right or whether it is a right to work or a right to live in peace.</P>
      <P>Much play has been made about the alleged split in the Fianna Fáil Party. One has heard this for so long here that certainly we do not treat it with any great thought nowadays.</P>

      <P>I cannot but notice how touchy Fine Gael and Labour are about the word &ldquo;expulsion&rdquo;.  They did quite a lot in their time.  The Fianna Fáil Government are in office by the will of the people.  I am sure that the Labour Party and Fine Gael must know in their hearts that if the Government went to the country again they would be returned by the people once more.  The people who say that there are troubles in the Fianna Fáil Party or that something is wrong with the Fianna Fáil Party are not damaging Fianna Fáil but certainly they are damaging democracy.</P>
      <P>History will show that the greatest political party that ever existed in this State is the party which forms the Government today.  When people talk about splits in the party and make sarcastic remarks about individuals, they achieve nothing.  The people outside do not accept it, and the members of the party do not accept it.  It is unnecessary for me to stress that point any longer.  The Opposition parties should stop their wishful thinking that there will be some kind of a split. They said that many times before but it just does not happen.  We are quite content to let the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party go on with their wishful thinking and to enjoy a moral victory occasionally.  They are welcome to their moral victories, but we draw the line at letting them gain more seats in this House.  It must be very frustrating for Opposition Deputies to go on year after year in the hope that something will happen to bring down the Government.  Of course, that has not happened and will not happen.  The Opposition must look to the future because it is an essential part of any democracy to have a good Opposition. So far we have carried on without this, but I should not like to see that situation perpetuated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of our entering the EEC has been supported by the vast majority of Members of this House, with the exception of the Labour Party.  On reading the speeches of <Col N="2321" /> some members of that party I found that they were not totally against it. There may be a change of heart by the Labour Party on this issue.  It is only right that somebody should put forward the opposite case as an exercise, but I suggest it is wrong for some speakers in the Labour Party&mdash;and I should like to remind them of the fat boy in Dickens&mdash;to try to make our flesh creep with horrible stories about what could happen if we entered the EEC.</P>
    <P>We believe that if we are to have a better Europe, which will not go on repeating its history of having a war roughly every 20 or 30 years, it is essential that we should go in and make our voice heard in the councils of Europe.  Outside we can do nothing. Inside our voice may be small, but at least we will have a voice there. To stay out would be to act in the same way as the American isolationists during the First World War.  They said that anything that happened outside America was none of their business. One can only regret that such a shortsighted attitude was adopted by American statesmen at that time.  Had they come into a world organisation and tried to build a better world, they might well have prevented the Second World War with all the misery it involved for the world.</P>
    <P>One can say that things may be tough should we go into Europe and I believe this, but they will be much less difficult than they would be if we stayed out in isolation and let the rest of Europe pass by.  Assuredly they will pass us by unless we are in there to show them we are willing to play our part and that we are quite ready to make sacrifices so that this great ambition may be realised.  It is said that if we enter Europe we will lose some of our sovereignty.  I do not accept this.  Once you live in any community you must sacrifice certain freedoms. There are things that you cannot do because if you do them, you will injure somebody else.  Therefore you accept this limitation of your freedoms. It is the same in Europe.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered first of all that it is only a sovereign State that <Col N="2322" /> can decide to apply for membership of the EEC.  Here we differ from our people in the Six Counties who declare that we do not recognise them.  They are not a sovereign State.  They cannot make application for entry into Europe. If Britain goes in they will go in, but it will be on the application of the United Kingdom.  We, as a sovereign State, can decide whether we should go in.  We do not sacrifice our sovereignty by this.  We merely use our sovereignty to decide whether to apply.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there are many defects in our social system.  Nobody will deny this, but I would suggest that, in our efforts to improve social welfare benefits, we are achieving a great degree of success.  We should all like to see this rate of progress speeded up.  We have to see where we are not doing enough to remedy our problems, whether they be in housing, or social welfare, or the care of the aged.  Indeed, it is most heartening to read in some EEC publications that care of the aged is one of the more important aspects of their work.  This is good, because any civilisation which looks after its old people is a good civilisation.  As I said, it is heartening to think that what has been described as a kind of tycoon's dream of a united Europe takes account of such things as the care of the aged.  We will be able to play our part in creating a much better system so that the aged will have a proper place in the scheme of things and will be able to lead the fullest possible life.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possible amendment of our Constitution, I would be opposed to certain things which are being held out as a kind of bait to the minority of the people of the country. Before anything is done, I hope we will stop this stupid thinking about holding up such things as a more permissive society as being acceptable to certain people.  I want to pay tribute to the conscience of the people in the north, whether they be Orange or Green, because of the fact that both sides have held on tenaciously to the beliefs they hold.  It is our task to show that we can cherish all the people of the nation, whether or not there are some who <Col N="2323" /> differ on fundamentals from the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the people of the north&mdash;and I refer to the Protestant section in the north&mdash;that when they come in with us we are in honour bound to ensure that they will not suffer the least infringement of any of their rights.  We say in all sincerity that we deplore the attacks made as mentioned earlier on the home of a Protestant minister and on the home of a Catholic republican.  The vast majority of people north and south deplore these.  I certainly deplore them.  There is a call for unity here among the great majority of the people that we should isolate people who try to achieve their aims, whatever these may be, by injuring their fellowmen.  A united Ireland can be a very peaceful Ireland and all we ask is the opportunity to prove this.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in the opening part of his statement yesterday said that the greatest immediate problem facing this nation was inflation.  He also said that this greatest immediate problem had been going on for more than 30 years.  One could not help wondering, as one listened to the speech, who had been in power for 24 out of those 30 years during which this greatest immediate problem was developed, who had been in power during all of the last 13 years and who was in power now.  This opening part of the Taoiseach's statement echoed the introductory matter to the Budget speech this year but not the Budget itself which was not an anti-inflation Budget.  The Taoiseach described it himself rather kindly as a budget of social concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government really regard this problem as the greatest immediate problem, taking precedence over all the other great problems which we <Col N="2324" /> undoubtedly have, some of which seem to many of us very immediate, including the problem of the north, surely the Government should, in this Dáil, have introduced measures to deal with that?  Is that not the Government's responsibility?  It did this neither in its Budget nor now.</P>
    <P>What is significant about this lecture and lament now on the eve of the recess is that the Government are shedding their responsibilities, using the Dáil for this purpose rather than for the purposes for which it was elected.  There is a pattern here of manipulation of the Dáil and the Oireachtas for narrow party purposes and of subordinating the Dáil to the service of party interests.</P>
    <P>In the year of existence of the present Dáil, the year during which the present Taoiseach's two Governments have held office, we have witnessed a significant erosion of democratic standards. The Government are not responsible for all that erosion but must take a considerable part of the responsibility for it.  We have a larger number of illegal and violent organisations than we had a year ago and these organisations, or some of them, are engaged in a wider range of terrorist activities than was previously the case.  Much of the activity has taken place in the north.  There have been more than 70 deliberately caused explosions there since the beginning of the year and there have been similar activities here as one would expect there would be. The exact degree of responsibility of one of the Taoiseach's Governments for this state of affairs remains to be determined.  It is generally believed, however, that that Government through their relations with members of such organisations and by their covert encouragement of certain favoured kinds of illegal activity helped to fan and spread violence in this island, and sectarian violence in particular.</P>
    <P>I am referring to the first Government of the Taoiseach during this Dáil. All of us on this side of the House welcome unequivocally the Taoiseach's repudiations of violence and his increasingly clear and insistent emphasis, especially in recent months, on the <Col N="2325" /> necessity for a purely peaceful approach to the problem.  Unfortunately, these statements cannot undo all the damage done by the earlier months of ambiguity and muffled threats from members of the Government including, on occasion, even the Taoiseach.  Some people in the north undoubtedly believe that there are powerful people in the Taoiseach's party who are not fully committed to a peaceful approach and who in certain circumstances may be heard from again and with effect.  I do not know if that belief is wellfounded. I do not know, for example, whether the repeated tributes by the Minister for External Affairs to the ex-Minister for Finance are prompted by sentiment, by ebullience or by calculation.  I do not know what the significance may be of the large vote received by the ex-Minister for Finance for vice-presidency of the Government party.  I do not know what shadows these may cast on future developments in policy but I know that the belief exists in certain circles in the north, and not just on one side only, that the Taoiseach's peaceful statements, however sincere they may be as coming from him, are not really to be taken as representing the settled conviction of the Fianna Fáil Party as a whole or as covering adequately the full range of future options of a Fianna Fáil Government.  While that belief exists the atmosphere remains to that extent more explosive, charged with dangerous hopes&mdash;because hopes can be dangerous in this situation&mdash;and with dangerous fears that are the obverse of those hopes.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest here that the atmosphere of fear and suspicion which pervades the north is wholly or mainly due to anything done or said here but I say that things done, said or suggested here in the past have their effects on what happens there and can help to develop that extraordinarily rapid oscillation of fear and hope which can happen in Belfast or Derry from weekend to weekend and plays its part in creating that climate of violence which is not, of course, contained in Northern Ireland but inevitably spreads throughout the island. As a result of the courses pursued by <Col N="2326" /> the Taoiseach's first Government in the Dáil, almost every institution of the State became in some degree contaminated or at least exposed to serious danger of contamination.  By contamination I mean a process of ceasing to be responsible, ceasing to answer to the democratic helm or where people were obliged, if they wished to do that, to enter into at least unusual courses.  Senior civil servants have had to face painful and difficult choices.  So have members of the armed forces and of the police.  We now know that even the judiciary have not remained unaffected.  The President of the High Court publicly speaks of reluctance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should now like to read Articles of the Constitution.  I think it is always a desirable and interesting exercise and is relevant to what the Taoiseach has called a very wide-ranging debate and to the aspects of the Taoiseach's statement which I have been discussing.  It is particularly relevant to my suggestion that all the organs of the State have been to some extent affected and adversely affected <Col N="2327" /> by what has been going on, what went on in particular under the Taoiseach's first Government.  We are not yet done, by any means, with the consequences of the practices of the Taoiseach's first Government in this Dáil, and I think we have a right to discuss these as continuing and baneful influences in our society.  Article 34.5.1 reads:</P>
      <P>Every person appointed a judge under this Constitution shall make and subscribe the following declaration:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the presence of Almighty God I do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and power execute the office of Chief Justice <i>(or as the case may be)</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>I suppose that would include the President of the High Court</P>
      <P>&mdash;without fear or favour, affection or ill-will towards any man, and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws.  May God direct and sustain me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 35.2 reads:</P>
      <P>All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions subject only to this Constitution and the law.</P>
      <P>Article 34.5.1 reads:</P>
      <P>1º  A judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann calling for his removal.</P>
      <P>2º  The Taoiseach shall duly notify the President of any such resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann, and shall send him a copy of every such resolution certified by the Chairman of the House of the Oireachtas by which it shall have been passed.</P>
      <P>3º  Upon receipt of such notification and of copies of such resolutions, the President shall forthwith, by an order under his hand and Seal, remove from office the judge to whom they relate.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I can only persevere.  In one of this morning's papers there is a report of a statement which is very strictly pertinent to that part of the Taoiseach's remarks which dealt with Northern Ireland, with better relations, more trust and confidence between the majority in this part of the country and the majority there. The statement was one made by Captain John Brooke, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Captain John Brooke, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Stormont Prime Minister, said last night in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, that he wondered what the liberal press in Britain would have said if any judge in Northern Ireland &ldquo;had seen fit to make the extraordinary remarks recently uttered in Dublin&rdquo;. He was referring to the remarks by Mr. Justice O'Keeffe about the &ldquo;reluctance&rdquo; of judges to conduct the trial of Charles Haughey and three other people on charges of conspiring to transport arms.</P>
      <P>Captain Brooke attacked speakers at a meeting in Carrickmore, County Tyrone, on Monday night in support of Miss Bernadette Devlin for their &ldquo;effrontery&rdquo; in attributing bias to judges of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Here in Ulster,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is nothing to show that our judges do not know and understand what it means to do their duty without fear or favour.  They have tried cases ranging from Dr. Paisley, on the one hand, to Bernadette Delvin on the other.  They have applied the law, and law breakers without distinction of religion or politics have been made amenable to these penalties.  This is as it should be.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what Captain Brooke said and we must realise the relevance of this and that it would be wrong to exclude <Col N="2329" /> such matters from the course of a substantive and serious debate on the issues raised by the Taoiseach's statement.</P>

      <P>I shall respect your ruling but you will appreciate it is difficult to comply if Deputies on that side pursue the matter.  The Civil Service, the armed forces, the police and the judiciary are all to some extent shaken by the events of the past 12 months and the courses of action pursued by Governments and in particular the first one over which the present Taoiseach has presided.  The institutions that have been worst affected are undoubtedly those of responsible Government and of Parliament. Responsible Government suffered when the principle of collective responsibility <Col N="2330" /> was jettisoned less than three months ago.  At that time the Taoiseach revealed that he was not sure what certain key members of his Government might have been up to and that there were grounds for suspicion that some of them had engaged or might have engaged in illegal activities. He then dismissed two members of his Government, including the Minister for Finance in the middle of the Budget debate, a somewhat unusual event in any democracy, accepted the resignation of a third on what were later, though not at the time, stated to be health grounds, and the resignation of a fourth who proceeded to make various accusations against the Taoiseach himself.</P>
      <P>Under the doctrine of collective responsibility, the Taoiseach on whose recommendation the Dáil appointed all these Ministers, shared responsibility before the Dáil and the country for whatever his Ministers may have been engaged in and for his apparent lack of certainty as to what his Ministers were engaged in and any suspicions that rested on those three Ministers rested on the Taoiseach's Government as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This principle was tacitly repudiated. The Taoiseach continued to hold office behaving as if he had no responsibility for the Ministers he had recommended to the Dáil and subsequently dismissed.  More and more under Deputy Lynch as Taoiseach we have moved towards government by a personality working through the media, working very effectively through the media, and away from the idea of government responsibility to Parliament. Admittedly, that is a tendency which exists generally in the democratic world and which is natural enough in the marked current and marked recent development of the media but elsewhere it is compensated, wherever democracy is in a healthy state, by a certain minimum of respect for deliberative process and Parliamentary institutions. It is true, of course, that under American conditions&mdash;and American practice has, naturally enough, a good deal of influence on us&mdash;this development of the head of the Government, who is also head of the State, talking <Col N="2331" /> directly to the nation and taking them into his confidence, or at least appearing to do so, is now rather long established, since at least the time of President Roosevelt's fireside chats.  That development, however, is compensated for by the doctrine and the practice of the separation of powers, by the fact that the head of the Government who is talking directly to the people has no real control over the deliberative organs, the legislative organs of Congress. They remain free from his effective control so that the head of the Government is both talking to the country and being effectively criticised in the Congress.</P>
    <P>That is a rather healthier state of affairs than we have.  What we have is essentially the theory which grew up out of the British Constitution of Cabinet responsibility to Parliament plus the reality of this more or less plebiscitary link of the head of the Government with the public and the media.  The Government have, as we know, a very large say in what can be discussed here at any time both in an acknowledged way and in ways that are less acknowledged.  I might be treated as out of order if I attempted to discuss them.  That is to say, there has crept into the handling of Parliament by our Government an element of sham.  The Parliament is felt to be something of a facade and the realities are felt to be the governing party and their relation with the public through the media.</P>
    <P>What does it mean to the public when the Taoiseach talks directly to them on television on a matter of vital national importance which he has just refused to discuss in Parliament?  That happened very recently.  It happened in relation to the question of Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach did not want to have that discussed in Parliament during the period before 12th July, the period of those two terrible weekends in Belfast, as a result of which the nation was extremely anxious on this subject and the Opposition rightly demanded that the Dáil should discuss this question.  The Taoiseach, however, did not wish the Dáil to discuss it and for that reason alone the Dáil did not <Col N="2332" /> discuss it.  The Dáil was effectively gagged during this critical period.  It was not that the Taoiseach did not think it was not worth discussing.  He did but he wanted to be the only person&mdash;he and one or two Ministers &mdash;to discuss it and to use the media to discuss it and not the Parliament. What can the people understand from that?  The Taoiseach talks on television about a subject which he refused to have discussed in Parliament.  What can it mean except that the Taoiseach is telling the people that the Parliament is not to be trusted to discuss this question of vital national importance? The people are then forced to ask, if they think at all: &ldquo;What good is a Parliament that the Taoiseach does not trust to discuss a matter of vital, national importance, a Parliament that has to be by-passed in the national interest?&rdquo; as the Taoiseach says.  In effect, the Taoiseach is here asking for a personal popular vote of confidence at the expense of Parliament and his close associates are encouraged to proceed in the same way.</P>
    <P>For example, the Minister for External Affairs has said much more of substance on this subject on the British television programme &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; than he has deigned to say in the Dáil.  If we want to find out what he said he thinks on this question we must either have had the opportunity of seeing that programme or of getting a transcript of what he said. It is a very serious thing and will prove serious in the long term that the Taoiseach should undermine the institutions of Parliament in that way.  It is worse, however, in the context of the inter-relation which has developed between our State, our institutions, our lives and a situation in the north to which I shall return in a moment, which is already violent and which contains within it the threat of further violence, contains threats which we all hope will never come to anything, which may not come to anything, but which may do so and which have already emerged in a certain degree of violence, including a number of deaths.</P>
    <P>Against that background and against the Taoiseach's first Government and the background of what happened to <Col N="2333" /> the still unresolved anxieties and questions in the public mind about the first Government and the members of it&mdash;matters that we may not even discuss with any forthrightness, and that, again, is a shadow over our discussions here&mdash;we have to pick our way carefully through this subject.  We were invited to have a far-ranging debate. We should be having a free debate but, in fact, the shadow of these unresolved questions is over the debate.  There is reason here for vigilance and challenge. We may agree that there is reason for an effort to make democracy more effective.  There are certain ways of looking at Parliament which may be pedantic, superficial forms of defence of what we call &ldquo;our privileges&rdquo;&mdash;in itself an outmoded term&mdash;but there is a substantial question, the defence of the relevance and of the functions of Parliament and there is a duty upon us to debate our parliamentary usages in such a way as to show that our work is relevant.  That is among our responsibilities here.  What I am suggesting is that the actions of the Taoiseach's two Governments have been such as to reinforce a tendency already existing in our people towards a generalised blanket cynicism about both parliament and politicians.  This is a dangerous development. It is one which has in other countries prepared the way to the death of democracy.  Those who despise the elected representatives of the people as a totality will also come to despise the people as a totality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore said some very interesting things.  I think he, too, is conscious of this kind of danger, but he put the blame for it on those who criticise the governing party; he thinks criticism of the Government party is of itself of a nature to bring democracy into disrepute.  I would agree with that if what we had to consider here was that kind of violent, savage abuse which has distinguished public life in certain countries at certain times&mdash;in France between the wars, for example. We have nothing of that kind here and we should have nothing of that kind here.  The criticisms of the Government which have been made in this and other debates have been expressed without personalities and without scurrilities. <Col N="2334" /> I think we have a right to make these criticisms and it is when such criticisms cease, not when they continue, that one can rightly say it is a dangerous situation for democracy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's actions and omissions, and those of his colleagues, during this very extraordinary year &mdash;we are, perhaps, in some danger of forgetting, or being encouraged to forget, how very extraordinary it has been&mdash;have not only damaged and undermined parliamentary democracy but have also disguised the damage done.  The Taoiseach has by his pleasant manner, which is natural to him, reassured the people.  It is a good thing that within limits the people should be reassured.  He has, however, spread an atmosphere of what Warren Gamaliel Harding called `normalcy' in a situation which is still very far from normal.  This confidence-winning television manner of the Taoiseach has encouraged the people to swallow, or to think they are swallowing, policies which have been, in fact, widely divergent and largely incompatible.  They have reacted in much the same way&mdash; that is to say, by way of approval&mdash; to the Taoiseach's &ldquo;We cannot stand idly by&rdquo; and then to the Taoiseach standing idly by.  This is something he does in rather good style.  I do not wish to discuss the Taoiseach's talents for this form of activity or inactivity; it is enough to say that he has them and that they have succeeded in disguising from us a situation which remains very serious.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his remarks here yesterday spoke &mdash;I think rather casually&mdash;of the situation in the north as having improved in the last three weeks, as if it were the kind of situation which clears up like that instead of being what it really is, a situation of very long standing and very dangerous continuing tension.  No one knows the future explosive possibilities of the situation.  To suggest, because one particular day, the 13th July, passed off more quietly than we feared it might, that now it is going to be all right, or to encourage people to think so, is a mistaken course of action.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say something about the Taoiseach's very important <Col N="2335" /> television address on 11th July.  We, on these benches, welcome the Taoiseach's words and the general tone of those words.  We welcome, too, the fact that the Taoiseach had spoken them. That was important.  No Taoiseach before spoke as plainly or as well indeed on this subject as the Taoiseach did on 11th July.  It is only fair to note that before we go on to criticise what he said.  Having said that, one is then obliged to remark that the competition from previous Taoisigh on this subject was not very intense because what they said when they were addressing themselves to this subject was often deceptive and often consisted of old slogans which had not been re-examined. Nonetheless, this statement of the Taoiseach's as a statement is to be welcomed in its general tenor.  What we on these benches question, what we would like to be reassured on, is whether the Taoiseach is fully committed to what he said, whether his party is committed to what he said and whether he and his party will follow those words through even in circumstances in which they may become unpopular.  Will they follow them through in those circumstances or will there be a return to something like the &ldquo;cannot stand idly by&rdquo; position of last summer?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach began that statement by quoting from the poet, John Montague.  That may be a precedent too.  I do not know that any Taoiseach ever before in a public address quoted a living Irish poet.  If it is a precedent it is a good precedent to set.  Having quoted what John Montague said about &ldquo;old moulds are broken down in the north&rdquo; the Taoiseach then said that we stand on the brink of a great achievement.  I am not quite sure what he meant by that and I notice that, when he spoke here yesterday, he did not refer to it.  One would think that a man conscious of standing on the brink of a great achievement, or perhaps having gone over it, would remain conscious of that situation when speaking subsequently.  But we heard nothing about this yesterday.  There was a certain air of the north returning to a routine relation rather than being <Col N="2336" /> on the brink of a great achievement and that second attitude may in some ways be more realistic&mdash;I think it is more realistic&mdash;because I do not think we are on the brink of a great achievement. I think we are in the middle of a process which will take a very long time to evolve.  I also think that it is not wise for a Taoiseach here in Dublin in a statement which will be heard throughout the north to speak of standing on the brink of a great achievement now.</P>
    <P>In that extremely tense and dangerous atmosphere anything that sharply tends to raise the hopes of one section will, to an equal degree, raise the fears of the other section.  It is this interplay of hope and fear that produces the outbreaks of violence.  This particular phrase in an otherwise generally helpful statement is not the kind of phrase that is useful now.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said: &ldquo;We must not now or ever in the future show anything to each other except tolerance, forbearance and neighbourly love.&rdquo;  I should like to comment on this phrase because, although these are very fine words, unless the record of practice behind them is clean in relation to them they are hollow words.  I am afraid in this context they are hollow words because they do not reflect the practices of the Taoiseach's party or of the Taoiseach himself.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is a very successful politician and a politician should be careful about the abandon with which he preaches tolerance, forbearance and neighbourly love.  It is not usually by the exercise of these virtues that politicians acquire power.  They may have love of these virtues in their hearts but they are likely to have found themselves playing it fairly rough at some stage in their careers and they may do so again.  The Taoiseach and his party have behaved in their political practices when it suited them with a complete absence of tolerance, forbearance and neighbourly love&mdash;an absence quite as marked as has distinguished the present leaders of the Unionist Party. They have exploited similar forces when it has paid them to do so and they have done this in a cold-blooded way.  This fact is realised in the north.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2337" /> It is true that in this part of the country generally, and with the marginal exceptions I shall mention later, there is no percentage in the exploitation of direct religious bigotry, in the incitement of Protestant against Catholic and <i>vice versa.</i>  That has never been in the traditions of the larger part of this island where the numbers of the two religious communities are not near to parity.  There is nothing here corresponding directly to the idea of the orange smear whereby a man like Dick Ferguson, whom I shall take as an example, can be hounded out of public life because he is &ldquo;soft on Popery&rdquo;.  I should like the Taoiseach to reply to the following question because I think it is a serious point: is it unknown in the political life of the Twenty-six Counties to play on people's religious fears for political advantage?  One does not say here that X is soft on Popery: it would not be of any use to exploit religious fears in that way; but it is possible to suggest to simple and unworldly people that X is anti-Catholic, X is a communist.  Fears can be aroused in this way and fundamentally they are of the sectarian nature which the Orange Order and the Unionists exploit in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That was done here last summer in the general election when the Taoiseach was stumping the convent parlours and other relevant areas of the terrain. What he was saying then had not a great deal to do with tolerance, forbearance and neighbourly love.  It was a campaign of calumny that was quite successful in certain areas.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider the implications of this and to consider the fact that people in the north know about it.  He should not only be concerned about the north because the movement for decency in our public life or the removal of calumny from it should be quite independent of whether we want the north to come in, although it has a bearing on that point.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the use by the Taoiseach's party of the red smear for the purpose of exploiting sectarian fears in our society.  However, much more directly, his party had evidence and the Taoiseach had evidence that exactly the same kind of sectarian <Col N="2338" /> abuse and exploitation of fear that is practised in the north was practised by his party.  That evidence was produced by Deputy Billy Fox&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the course of discussing what the Taoiseach meant by tolerance, forbearance and neighbourly love we have provoked quite a good exhibition of what his party habitually mean by those virtues. Before I was interrupted I had referred to the more direct forms of exploitation of which that party were guilty. Deputy Billy Fox produced in this House evidence of that in the form of a placard describing him, because he is a Protestant, as a B Special.  He produced that evidence here.  He held it up before the Taoiseach who looked at it in stony silence.  Another member of the party of tolerance, forbearance and neighbourly love&mdash;Deputy Desmond O'Malley&mdash;suggested that Deputy Fox had manufactured this evidence himself.  In his reply to that debate, the Taoiseach, who had sat through all this, made no reference whatever to that incident.  I think that an incident like that is more revealing about the existence and practice of these very laudable and fine qualities of which the Taoiseach was speaking than any general declaration about these matters.</P>
      <P>To go on from that, the Taoiseach said&mdash;and it was perhaps the best thing in a speech which contained, as I have said, many good things&mdash;&ldquo;This whole unhappy situation is an Irish quarrel&rdquo;. I think that is on the whole a new emphasis for Fianna Fáil and I think it is one to be welcomed.  Unless one can see it as an Irish quarrel, it is not possible to bring about an Irish solution for it or even to begin moving towards that.  It is much more a question of moving towards it than of securing a distinctive solution now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice, however&mdash;and I think this applies generally to other aspects of the speech&mdash;that whereas these things are said they do not seem to penetrate somehow down through the ranks of that party.  Deputy Seán Moore, speaking just before me in this debate, did <Col N="2340" /> not say &ldquo;This is an Irish quarrel which we must settle among us&rdquo;; he said that Britain is the evil influence.  That is different.  I would suggest that if the Taoiseach wishes the doctrine of his speech of 11th July, 1970, to be sustained, to be credible and accepted he will have to hold a seminar in his own party and explain these concepts to them because I think there is a good deal of evidence that they do not understand it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said: &ldquo;Let us not appeal to past gods as if past generations had said the last word about Ireland&rdquo;: that is addressed to the Irish people of the majority tradition here.  I do not know if the Taoiseach would care to develop it&mdash; what &ldquo;past gods&rdquo; he is talking about and whether appeals to them are to cease altogether.</P>
    <P>There is, however, this, in relation to things that we accept and praise in the Taoiseach's speech of 11th July, 1970: we have to see this against an immediate background of the governmental activity which immediately preceded it, that is to say, the visit by the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, to the Falls Road, Belfast, and his subsequent &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; interview on BBC television.  This, of course, was a combined operation.  I think possibly the intervention of the Minister for External Affairs enabled the Taoiseach to put a certain emphasis which he might otherwise have felt he could not do.  We cannot assess from outside the inner dynamics of all these activities.  However, just looking on it for the moment&mdash;I am tempted to look on it from the point of view of a rather suspicious northerner&mdash;I think that the statements of the Minister for External Affairs and the statements made about him, the circumstances of his visit, and so on, did a lot, unfortunately, to deprive the Taoiseach's subsequent statement of its credibility.  That is something we must all regret.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for External Affairs visited the Falls Road, Belfast, Mr. Eddie McAteer in Derry cabled to the Minister his congratulations for asserting the principle&mdash;there <Col N="2341" /> was a principle at stake&mdash;that an Irishman should be able to walk in any part of Ireland without seeking the permission of any Englishman.  Well, now, that is certainly a curious principle to be asserting when, simultaneously, one is calling on an English Government to prohibit or re-route a march of Irish Orangemen or Irish Apprentice Boys through Irish cities.  It may be a good principle or not&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but it is not a principle I should have thought to be asserted at that precise time.</P>
    <P>That is not just a debating point, I think, because it is an illustration of the elements of incoherence and instability which continue to pervade the Government attitude on this matter. One can hear various voices struggling to get out and sometimes getting out and they reflect a different kind of thinking.  This is transitional.  I am not saying it is extraordinary or peculiar to that party but it is an element in the situation that has to be watched.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the fact that the first and, as far as I know, the only visit of a Minister for External Affairs to the north&mdash;this Minister anyway&mdash;should be to the Falls Road is, perhaps, inevitable in the circumstances of the time but it does, of course, seal together the idea generally held in the north that the southern Government&mdash;&ldquo;the Free State Government,&rdquo; as they still call it&mdash;are interested really only in the Catholics in the north.  The Taoiseach's statement sought to get rid of that idea but his statement carries less weight than an act, even a symbolic act like a walk down a street.</P>
    <P>Similarly the Minister for External Affairs appealed to the British Government to disarm everybody in the north, both Protestant and Catholic; then the British Army could get out and we, among Irishmen, could negotiate a peaceful solution.  That might look all right to us here but, from the point of view of the people whose suspicions and fears we must disarm before we must disarm them, it looks quite different. What we appear to be saying is &ldquo;Let the British take your arms away and then we, who retain our Army, will negotiate with you and we shall <Col N="2342" /> try to be reasonable but, in the last resort, we are the majority and we are the only armed people.&rdquo;  That, from a Minister for External Affairs of Ireland is a statement which cannot have any good effect on majority opinion there. On the contrary, it makes it much more difficult to begin to advance towards a solution.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke&mdash;I mentioned this earlier during his absence from the House&mdash;of our being on the brink of a great achievement.  He did not specify, though he may have implied, what the &ldquo;great achievement&rdquo; was or how it was to be won.  I would hope that he would, for a change, tell us something in this House before he tells it to the television audience.  I would hope that he would tell us here in this debate just what he means by &ldquo;the brink of a great achievement&rdquo; and how he thinks it will be won. The impression has been created that &ldquo;the great achievement&rdquo; will in some way be won through our entry into the EEC and that, in some way, this will mean or herald the end of Partition. This was expressed this year in June at Bodenstown.  Before the Taoiseach made the remark about appealing to the gods of the past he went to Bodenstown. The Fianna Fáil speaker was Senator Keery I think.  He spoke of our proposed entry into the Common Market as presenting what he called an extraordinary parallel with Wolfe Tone's appeal to France to break the connection with England.</P>
    <P>Now, from Bodenstown to Luxembourg is quite a long way.  It is a long way in terms of geography and also in terms of ideology.  In Luxembourg on 30th June of this year, the Minister for External Affairs had occasion to talk about this matter of our entry into the Common Market in terms appropriate to the realities of the situation, and that is not at all the rhetoric of Bodenstown.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the consideration of the transitional arrangements, an important factor which clearly will have to be taken into account is Ireland's special trading relationship with the United Kingdom.  Member States will appreciate the fundamental importance <Col N="2343" /> to the Irish economy of our trade with the United Kingdom which is the market of over 70 per cent of total Irish exports and supplies over 50 per cent of our imports. Traditionally, Ireland has received preferential treatment in the British market for her products and the United Kingdom in turn has had a special position in our market. Trading arrangements between the two countries are governed by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement of 1965, which provides for free trade between the two countries and for special arrangements for Irish agricultural exports to the United Kingdom.  Ireland's treaty obligation to accord free trade treatment to British industrial goods is being implemented over a nine-year period ending in mid-1975.  This progressive dismantlement of industrial protection has also served to prepare Irish industry for the more comprehensive obligations and challenges which membership of the Community will entail.</P>
    <P>Because of its importance to the Irish economy, it is essential that agricultural and industrial trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom during the transitional period should continue with the least possible disturbance, due regard being had to the special arrangements which already exist under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and subject, of course, to the obligations which both countries will be assuming on entry to the Communities. In other words, movement of the two countries to a wider European common market should advance from the present position which already involves some elements of a common market between them.</P>
    <P>That is quite defensible on certain terms, but the point I am making here is that it is dishonest to market that proposition, of which the reality is there enshrined in the Luxembourg document, and sell it to the Irish people in terms of Bodenstown and breaking the connection with England.  That is flatly dishonest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2344" /> This will not weaken the connection with England.  On the contrary, it is quite clear from the Minister's remarks that economic and other relations with England will be drawn closer under the Common Market, and that the Common Market is asked to accept this special relationship, what the Minister called Ireland's special trading relationship with the United Kingdom.  The idea that this breaks up or is destroyed in some wider synthesis simply does not hold together.  It was always possible, of course, to end Partition by re-joining the United Kingdom and, in so far as the Common Market policy has relevance to ending Partition&mdash;and I do not believe that in reality it has&mdash; it is only in that sense that it has it. It provides a presentable facade for a policy of, in fact, drawing even closer our special trading relationship and other relationships to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I should like to ask the Taoiseach to reconsider certain words he spoke during the last debate we had on the north.  He referred to this debate when he was questioned yesterday about this matter.  He said we had a debate on Northern Ireland.  The debate we had was in October of last year when we resumed, having failed to discuss the matter in the Dáil during the critical period last year, just as we failed during the most critical period this year.  In that debate the Taoiseach rejected at the end&mdash;he brushed it aside in a rather lofty way&mdash;any idea that this should be treated or attempt to be treated on an all party basis.  He spoke of Fianna Fáil as being the party of re-unification.  He was flanked on those benches by Deputy Haughey, Deputy Boland, Deputy Blaney, Deputy Ó Moráin and Deputy Paudge Brennan, all leading pillars of the party of re-unification at that time.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to believe that the Taoiseach has probably learned a lot both about the north and about other things since that time.  What I am wondering is, in the light of his televised statement and his statement here yesterday, and the number of enlightened things which, after all, he has said on the subject, whether he would now seriously claim the title, <Col N="2345" />&ldquo;the party of re-unification&rdquo;, for a party which represents just under half the electorate of the Twenty-six Counties, which has no organisation, or no avowed organisation, or no organisation of the whole party north of the Border, and no support whatever among what the Taoiseach calls the other great tradition, the majority in the north.  I wonder would he now drop his claim.  I wonder if he would have the magnanimity to do that, the magnanimity of which there are so many traces in recent utterances by the Taoiseach, the magnanimity to agree that the destinies of this island are not to be determined solely by those who call themselves the soldiers of destiny.</P>
    <P>Unless he drops this claim about the party of re-unification, the language of his televised address on 11th July is without meaning, because it is without meaning to tell the Unionists that they ought to join Fianna Fáil.  I do not think the Taoiseach would stoop to that.  When he does not, he should drop this language.  Long ago Mr. de Valera proclaimed the principle, which has been quoted again in the Dáil, that the only way in the long term to make serious progress on this issue, is to make our society here more attractive in every way, socially, economically and in terms of making it clear that our society is one in which we genuinely desire both traditions to take part. There are certain provisos in the Constitution which run counter to that. More important&mdash;and it is not a question of paper documents as we sometimes like to think but of our actual practice&mdash;our actual political practices tend to run counter to that also.  This is where our main emphasis must lie in setting our own house in order.</P>
    <P>Again and again there have been references to this idea.  Everyone approves of it, but we tend always to go back to the idea that, in some other way, the problem will be transcended, that there is a gimmick by which you can re-unite.  Some people see it as through the process of splitting the Unionist Party or causing trouble in the north.  Others see it, as I think the Taoiseach and his party and, perhaps, others in this House tend to see it, as coming through transcending it through the wider synthesis of the Common <Col N="2346" /> Market.  We on these benches hold that the idea that the Common Market will solve all this is an illusion.  The quarrel, as the Taoiseach said in the wisest words of his address, is among Irishmen and it will not be ended by submerging in a wider unity.  Particularly it will not end if, while we do so, we pretend that the process happens in some way other than it does.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed in relation to this yesterday when the Minister for External Affairs was asked if he recognised Northern Ireland.  He properly enough sidestepped that and said, as I have heard Deputy FitzGerald say equally rightly on television, that we are not called on to recognise Northern Ireland as it is not a state.  I then asked him a question: does the Government recognise the entity known as the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland whereupon he sat, unusually for him, mute.  He said nothing.  I think it is a question to which he should be able to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  While he fails to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; something is being concealed.  The failure to educate our people on this matter is continuing. There has been a great failure in the past and we are all paying the price, north and south, for the propagation of myths which is still going on and continues to have an influence on the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into the Common Market debate again; we had it rather fully a little while ago.  The only point I wish to stress is that to suggest that the Common Market will in some way take this out of our hands and end it, is simply a way of stopping thinking about the subject.  If that is what the Taoiseach means by being on the brink of a great achievement, we are not on the brink of anything of the sort.  What we say, what our Government say to the north and about the north is important.  There is a highly significant improvement both in the content of what is being said and in the way it is said.  We do not want to minimise this.  But we shall not make real progress in this matter until what we do matches up what we say.  I have suggested in part of my remarks, before the Taoiseach came in, that there is a big credibility gap.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2347" /> The Taoiseach appeals to tolerance and neighbourly love while addressing the people of the north and he says these things should exist among Irishmen but in practice he and his party have been willing to tap, in the way relevant to our politics by the use of the red smear and in other ways, the forces of sectarian fear, essentially and fundamentally the same as those on which the Orange Order draw.  We must drop those practices.  The Taoiseach and the Government must drop them before his remarks can become fully credible.  What we do must match what we say.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in his speech opening this debate said that he would deal with three main themes, inflation, industrial relations and the north.  I think he was right to select these three items.  They are, in fact, crucial at this time.  I propose to dwell on two of them.  I claim no expertise in the field of industrial relations and, therefore, I shall pass over it on this occasion.  I propose to deal with a problem which is not unconnected, as the Taoiseach said, with industrial relations, the problem of an incomes policy and with the whole question of the north which has been debated fully in the last couple of days.  I think it is worth commenting that in the debate as I have heard or read it so far the contributions on the subject that have come from both parties on this side of the House have been throughout constructive and in the fullest support of the spirit of everything that the Taoiseach said when he spoke on July 11th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only discordant note struck so far&mdash;there may be others; I am speaking of up to this&mdash;was a minor one and it was in Deputy Moore's speech, much of which contained sensible things about Northern Ireland.  But he did strike a note very discordant to that of the Taoiseach when he began blaming everything on Britain and developed that theme for about ten minutes before moving to another aspect of the problem and coming more into line with the Taoiseach's views.  Otherwise, there has been a <Col N="2348" /> unity of approach in this debate in support of the attitude of the Taoiseach as expressed on 11th July, which I think is heartening.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the north, I should like to deal with the question of the economic situation with particular reference to an incomes policy.  I shall not dwell on the economic situation of the country in any detail at this point.  We are at the stage where the disruption of our economy by the cement strike and, perhaps, also by the bank strike has changed the situation which is, on the one hand, difficult to assess due to lack of adequate statistics to tell us what is happening and which, on the other hand, does show some signs of a temporary halt in the growth of demand pressures due to these special factors.  In these circumstances the Government can, I think, legitimately postpone further action to cut back demand until they are a little surer of what is actually happening and the situation becomes clearer in the autumn.  But the fact that there is a momentary halt in the growth of the pressure of demand and that this may make it possible to avoid action to cut back demand at this point in time does not minimise the seriousness of the underlying situation which the Taoiseach outlined very correctly in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>The real seriousness of the position we now face should be evident and if it helps to make it evident for people on this side of the House to echo what the Taoiseach said and support it, I think it is our job to do so.  In doing so, I shall have criticisms to make about the way the Government have handled the position to date but the Taoiseach's analysis of the situation, his clear desire to put across the gravity of it, is something that, I think, we must applaud.  The position we now face is unlike anything we have faced before.  This is the point that must be stressed.  There is no precedent in the history of this State as an independent State for the development of incomes and costs in a manner so out of line with the development of incomes and costs in the neighbouring island of Britain to which, for good or ill, we are so closely linked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2349" /> It is true that at certain times there has emerged temporarily for brief periods a disparity between the growth of incomes and costs here and in Britain but these disparities have been visibly temporary in character and they have arisen in the past over short periods of time from the fact that we have tended to have wage rounds occurring at intervals of two or 2½ years, whereas in Britain the increases in salaries, incomes and wages have tended to be more gradual.  We have moved in steps while they have moved upwards in a continuous curve. Naturally, there are moments in that process when we are temporarily out of line and then we fall back into line and we pause for a couple of years before our next major wage round&mdash; not that within that couple of years there were not many individual wage and salary increases but there was a slowing down in the tempo of these between wage rounds.</P>
    <P>There have been times when temporarily a disparity of, perhaps, up to 5 per cent has emerged between the labour costs in this country and in Britain but because it has been clearly temporary and because one could see that of its nature it was something that would resolve itself and because it did so with great rapidity it was not a problem of real gravity.  I would not wish to minimise the inflationary pressure in the last ten years.  It is a fact that both the Irish and British £s became so devalued by the growth of costs that they both had to be devalued.  Devaluation of them had to be recognised formally.  That, I think, was unfortunate, but at least over that period, although our inflation was bad, it was no worse than that in Britain.  The devaluation of our £ was submerged in and hidden in a sense by the devaluation of the £ sterling and the economic relationship which we have with Britain was not seriously disturbed and that relationship, in terms of the value of our currency, is one which it is important to retain for trade purposes, especially as we stand at the moment outside the EEC and in isolation in this relationship with Britain. We cannot afford a position in which the Irish £ would be devalued not only <i>vis-à-vis</i> the currencies of other countries&mdash;we <Col N="2350" /> have withstood that in the past&mdash;but <i>vis-à-vis</i> the £ sterling.  Yet that is the danger that faces us.  It is one we are loath to make explicit and one of the problems of the present situation is that one faces a dilemma between failing to emphasise sufficiently the gravity of the situation and consequently failing to get across the urgency of something being done and, on the other hand, the danger that if we overemphasise the gravity of the situation we might, by so doing, worsen it.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for either the Government or the Opposition to choose the words and presentation that would be most constructive and most helpful to the interests of this country but at this time we must perhaps take the risk of stressing the gravity of the situation. Unless we make explicit the dangers that face us it is possible that people will fail to realise these dangers and will fail to react in the unaccustomed manner in which they must react if these dangers are to be averted.  It is necessary to make explicit that the present trend&mdash;and there is no sign that that trend will do other than continue &mdash;will bring us quite quickly in the course of the next 12 or 18 months into a position we cannot sustain. Already labour costs in this country, as the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition have pointed out in their opening statements, have got out of line with those in Britain by the significant margin over the last couple of years of something between 5 and 8 percentage points.  As I have said about this once or twice, there have been occasions when divergences between labour costs in the two countries have come close to that but clearly temporarily and one could see the situation remedying itself in a matter of months.  We are not in that position now.  There was a time when the disparity created temporarily by the granting of a wage round disappeared within the following year or 18 months as we held wages fairly steady.  If further wage claims are granted on anything approaching the scale of the last occasion it will bring that disparity to 10 per cent or 11 per cent, pushing it to a level beyond anything experienced in the past which would <Col N="2351" /> begin seriously to affect the competitiveness of our goods at home and abroad.  I have understated the problem there.  It would not just begin to do that&mdash;it has begun to happen already&mdash;but it would bring us to the point which might be irretrievable.  Unless we can get across to people that this is something new and dangerous and that their jobs and the purchasing power of their incomes are at stake, it is difficult to see how we can avoid the situation.</P>
    <P>Our problem is to communicate.  We have cried &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; so often in the past when there was less danger that it is difficult to see how conviction can be carried.  Eleven years ago I criticised the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, for his unmeasured denunciation of a modest wage increase of 7 or 8 per cent in the spring of 1959 which went so far beyond anything that was proper that it devalued the currency of words. Since then it has been a trap people have fallen into.  I am open to being told I may have done so myself at times.  I have always tried, when speaking of the economic situation, to avoid speaking in terms that exaggerate the danger, because when the dangers fail to materialise, either because they were exaggerated or because suitable action was taken to deal with the problem people will think there was no danger there at all and that when these warnings are given from the Government or Opposition benches, by the Central Bank or anyone else, they can be safely disregarded.  That is not the case today.  That needs to be said and we on this side of the House have a duty to support what the Taoiseach has said in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is also our duty to criticise the manner in which the Government have allowed this situation to emerge, and I feel we are in a particularly good position to make this criticism.  An Opposition always find it easy to criticise the Government.  They do not always criticise the Government fairly&mdash;it would be surprising if they did&mdash;but on this matter the Opposition in this House can stand on their record in criticising the Government's inaction. <Col N="2352" /> This whole problem first came up in the policies of my party before the 1965 general election.  Proposals were put forward, which were merely generalised proposals, but which contained specific remedies to deal with the problem of incomes and prices, specific proposals to tackle that most difficult of all problems, the problem of controlling non-wage-and-salary incomes in such a way as to give confidence to working people that if they agree to restraint in the growth of their incomes the benefits of that restraint will not accrue to those in receipt of dividends but will accrue to the nation as a whole, themselves included.</P>
    <P>We put forward concrete proposals and one of those proposals was taken up by or incorporated in a NIEC report which came out in November, 1965, a report that had laid down the basic principles of an incomes policy, a report that was a massive step forward because management and union representatives signed the document in which they each agreed on the principles that should be followed to achieve an incomes policy, both making great sacrifices in their traditional thinking.  On the union side, for example, they accepted that profit control would not be helpful.  It was not easy for the trade unions to agree to that but they signed the statement.  On the management side there was agreement that more information must be given on profits, about which private companies are traditionally cautious.  In these and other ways both sides gave ground.</P>
    <P>This was a great step forward or would have been if anything had been done about it.  Admittedly on both sides of industry there was a tendency to step back from what had been signed.  I think the Government could easily argue that it was a situation to be handled carefully, that, in view of the first reactions of industry and trade unions to this document, it would not have been possible to move in and get an incomes policy off the ground immediately.  Some caution was needed, but caution went far beyond what was needed.  The reaction of the Government Departments and the Civil Service was negative.  The reactions that came to the NIEC from <Col N="2353" /> Civil Service sources were so negative that had they been published they would seriously have damaged any possibility of an incomes policy.  I agree that it might not have been appropriate for the Government and the Department to launch into an incomes policy then, but the negative reactions from the Government Departments encouraged the more reactionary forces on both sides of industry to dig in their heels and try to forget what they had signed.</P>
    <P>The matter was left for some years. It was taken up again early last year by the NIEC and from then on the position has deteriorated.  Instead of grappling with this matter firmly, instead of reaching concrete conclusions as to how to apply the principles laid down in that first document, the council waffled on for over a year and finally produced the watered-down proposals which the Government Departments concerned had in mind at the beginning.  Indeed if the NIEC had not spent a year producing this document the watered-down proposals would have come from the Government Departments a year earlier.</P>
    <P>I do not think that on this occasion the NIEC distinguished themselves.  I do not think the management and labour representatives distinguished themselves particularly by the tendency to hold back, and I do not think the Government distinguished themselves particularly by putting forward such watered-down proposals, and the time lost was pretty disastrous. It would have been possible, if there had been a completely different and more dynamic approach early last year to tackling this problem, to have achieved something.  There was to be detected on the trade union side from the beginning of last year a recognition and a fear of the consequences of the trends then developing.  The maintenance strike alerted people to a very serious situation and this was to be seen on the trade union side.  If the Government's servants dealing with this matter had been sufficiently alert to the signs of concern on the side of the trade unions, as on the side of management, if they had grasped the opportunity thus provided, if an imaginative <Col N="2354" /> approach had been made at the beginning of last year, particularly in the first three months or immediately after the maintenance strike, we could have been much further on towards an incomes policy now.  There was, however, a failure of nerve, of imagination and of Government at this point and, as a result, we let things drift on right through the period after the maintenance strike up to the present time, right up to the brink and we are standing on that brink now.</P>
    <P>The blame for that is shared not only by the trade unions, to which I do not attribute as much blame as many would, it also is shared by management which in its caution, without any idea of anything being done to control in any way non-wage and salary incomes, has held up progress, and above all, by the Government which missed the opportunity last year and drifted into the present state of affairs.  I should like to illustrate very simply with six figures the gravity of the situation and the reality of the kind of wage cost inflation we are having.  Economists can and do argue about how much of the present inflation is due to pressures on the wage side and how much is due to pressures on the demand side.  The two are so closely inter-related that it is difficult to disentangle them.  It would be difficult to argue that if the wage developments, if the accelerated growth of wages and salaries had not occurred, we would still face a very serious inflationary situation. It is also difficult to argue, indeed, impossible, that if wages and salaries had not risen by the amount they have risen workers would as a result of restraint be worse off.  I do not think that would have happened given the strength of the trade union movement and its ability to safeguard the workers but the facts and figures are quite simple.  If we divide the last 11 years of economic growth, from the spring of 1959 to date, into three periods which are determined by the extent and rate of wage and salary increases, let us see what we get.  In the first period the relatively modest wage and salary increases of the 1950s continued for, perhaps, the first 2½ years up to the autumn of 1961.  The wage rounds at two-year intervals of about 7 per cent <Col N="2355" /> or 8 per cent which characterised the fifties continued.  There was one at the very beginning of this period of economic growth and then there was a levelling off afterwards and that brought us to the autumn of 1961 when we moved to a different level.  In the 2½ year period from the spring of 1959 to the autumn of 1961 the average annual rate of wage increases in industry was 6 per cent.  The average annual increase in the cost of living was 1 per cent and the average annual improvement in workers' living standards was 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those are the relevant figures.  Then in the autumn of that year, and for this the Taoiseach bears considerable responsibility, there was the settlement of the ESB workers' strike in which he intervened not once but on several occasions at a level far beyond anything previously awarded and this led to and was immediately followed by a general round involving a 12 per cent increase, which was significantly higher than anything ever granted in the 1950s.  The pattern was then set for the round in the spring of 1964 for a similar amount of subsequent increases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach intervened as Minister for Industry and Commerce on a number of occasions and as a consequence the ESB increased their offer I think on four occasions until the strike was finally settled for a 17 per cent increase.  It is always a matter of opinion whether an intervention in a situation like this is the cause of a particular result in the form of an increase eventually awarded.  But to my recollection this seemed to be the case: the Taoiseach intervened repeatedly and did contribute to higher offers by the ESB which eventually went to a level far beyond anything given previously and which set the pattern at a somewhat lower level, 12 per cent rather than 17 per cent for the wage round that followed. There are arguments against ministerial <Col N="2356" /> intervention but I know that on occasion we on this side of the House have recently favoured it.  It can work well or it can work ill.  On that occasion I think it was a mistake.  I am sure the Taoiseach would disagree with me.</P>
      <P>However, the facts are that from then on there occurred wage rounds of the order of 12 per cent at intervals of approximately two years.  If one takes the period from the autumn of 1961 to the autumn of 1967 one finds that the average annual rate of wage increases was 8 per cent, the average annual increase in prices was 4 per cent and workers during that period secured an annual average improvement in living standards of 4 per cent. I make no distinction between the 4 per cent and the 5 per cent because I have rounded these figures off in any event.  We then come to the third period, the period of the 2½ years, since the autumn of 1967.  In this period we have seen another escalation to another level of wage and salary increases, to the 20 per cent level.  This has led to an average annual increase of 12 per cent in wages and an average rate of increase in prices of 7 per cent and of a 5 per cent increase in workers' living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out that there being no significant difference between 4 and 5 per cent the picture that emerges is that whatever rate of wage or salary increase one has, workers' living standards improve by the same amount. Workers can have higher living standards at the rate of 4 to 5 per cent per annum because the productivity of industry, and, indeed, of the economy, increases by something around that level.  The figures I have given are actually for industry where the increase in productivity is somewhat higher and for the nation as a whole it would be somewhat lower but not much.  The basic fact is that in this economy we produce per worker something like 4 per cent more per annum and in industry, perhaps, nearer to 5 per cent. With a well organised trade union movement and a reasonably competitive system the benefits of this are passed on to workers.  They are passed on to the workers whatever the rate of wage increase may be and the trade unions <Col N="2357" /> have the choice and they have to face it on their side that they can have their 4 or 5 per cent annual improvement in living standards at any price increase they like.  If they want it at the 1 per cent price increase, right, let us get back to where we were in the late 50s and early 60s and have an average annual increase in wages of 6 per cent. If they want it, as they are getting now, at a 7 per cent price increase per annum, then let us have a 12 per cent annual wage increase.</P>
    <P>Whatever way it is done you are not going to get a different improvement in living standards, with one qualification, and that is that if this process is pushed too far it can and will have such effects upon the economy and disrupt the economy to such an extent that workers will no longer achieve these increases because the competitiveness of industry will diminish to the point where neither at home nor abroad will we be able to sell our goods in competition with those of other countries and where, as a result, output of industry will lag and as growth of industrial output slows down so will productivity and so will the growth of real earnings because real earnings, the increase in the purchasing power of the worker, are directly related and are, in fact, a direct consequence of the increase in productivity. It can be said, therefore, that over quite a wide range, the people can have an increase in their living standards of something like 4 to 5 per cent per annum, depending on whether they are in industry or other sectors.</P>
    <P>They can have that at any price increase they like&mdash;a 1 per cent annual price increase as in the late 50s and early 60s, and a 4 per cent increase from 1961 to 1967, or the 7 per cent increase we have at present, with one qualification that, once you get up to that level, once it pushes much over 4 per cent and rises as high as 7 per cent, you reach the point at which you undermine the competitiveness of our whole industrial system and growth slows down and disruption of the economy leads to a fall in this process of 4 to 5 per cent improvement in living standards.  But, within these limits, as to what the <Col N="2358" /> price increase will be rests primarily with those who determine increases in wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>Import prices affect things too.  Import prices have not risen significantly though it is true to say that they have risen very sharply indeed in the last couple of years.  That increase is largely, as to, perhaps, two-thirds, the consequence of our and Britain's inflation of costs in the past which forced us both to devalue our £s and thereby increased the amount we had to pay for imports.  If we can restrain our growth of costs to perhaps something like the 4 or 5 per cent per annum, which is a comparable figure to that of other neighbouring countries, we can avoid the need at any stage to devalue our currency, either with or without Britain, and we can avoid therefore the putting up of import prices.  Import prices left to themselves, if one maintains the value of one's currency, rise more slowly than internal costs and there will, therefore, be no push from that side. In those circumstances the only factor ultimately which influences the level of price increase is the trend of wages and salaries.  Other factors are so subordinate as to be inconsequential.  I over-simplify but I do not over-simplify to the extent that I cannot stand over what I say and demonstrate it to be basically correct.</P>
    <P>It can be said, I think, that the increase in prices is the consequence of and is, as to much the greater part, directly related to increase in wages and salaries.  The relationship is a causative one very largely.  It is a twoway process because, when prices go up, workers look for increases and you get this vicious spiral.  It is this we now face.  Let us be clear how dangerous it is because, if one gets into the position in which one's costs go up very rapidly, they push up prices and workers look for bigger increases and you get into the kind of spiral which destroys any prospect of economic growth as, indeed, has happened in South America.  There are countries rich in natural resources, though not perhaps in expertise, which have got into such a vicious spiral of inflation that the economic growth has come to <Col N="2359" /> a halt and prices increased sometimes by 100 per cent per annum, or more. That kind of situation existed in Germany after the First World War. We are not immune to this danger and we are, indeed, moving rapidly towards the brink of having to face this danger. Unless we can pull back, the consequences may be far graver than anybody at this stage imagines.  If we are to pull back it is necessary that we put forward policies which will carry conviction with the ordinary workers and the trade unions and convince them that it will be possible to ensure that their restraint in regard to wages and salaries will not be exploited by others and, if they hold back, their holding back will not be followed by a growth in profits and more particularly and more important, in dividends, thereby diverting income from those who need it most to those who in general&mdash;there are exceptions&mdash;need it least.</P>
    <P>This is what we have failed to do and here I ask the Taoiseach very seriously to look at this matter again with a fresh mind and some imagination. Let him not be inhibited from looking at the Fine Gael proposal of five years ago just because Fine Gael put it forward.  Why has there been no study of this proposal, a proposal endorsed by the NIEC?  Why has it never been examined?  Why?  Our proposal was one which endeavoured to get around the difficulty of controlling profits and individual dividends. The NIEC was very clear about it in 1965 and so were the trade union representatives who signed the NIEC report.  Control of profits gets you nowhere.  It may be necessary in the short term for a brief period to achieve equilibrium in a disastrous situation, but it is a short term answer only.</P>
    <P>If you start controlling the growth of profits then you are in the position in which efficient industries are held back to the level of the inefficient and in which the funds required for future investment are no longer available. Those who will suffer most, and that in a very short time, will be the workers, the maintenance of whose jobs will become impossible, as will <Col N="2360" /> the creation of new jobs, because of lack of investment.  Control may be all right for six months to meet a critical situation.  As a long-term solution it is not &ldquo;on&rdquo; and this is recognised clearly by everybody, including the trade union representatives who signed the NIEC report.  If you control dividends and say that none may rise by more than 7 per cent you penalise the people who invest intelligently in firms that are efficient.  You prevent them from getting any benefit from intelligent investment and you bring them down to the level of those who invest stupidly.  Anything that encourages investment in less efficient firms is not to the ultimate benefit of the workers.  Dividend control is not the answer.  It may be desirable for six months or so.  It is vital that workers be given an assurance that, if they restrain themselves as regards wage claims made and insisted upon, the benefits of this will not accrue to other better off income groups.</P>
    <P>The solution suggested by Fine Gael to that problem, and endorsed by the NIEC, was one first mooted to my knowledge in <i>The Economist</i> of September, 1963: dividend equalisation tax, under which we would not restrain the growth of individual dividends but tax away, perhaps temporarily, any increase in total dividend income in excess of the increase in total wage and salary income so that wage and salary earners would be assured that those who live on dividends would not become wealthier than they were, the relative shares of the two in the resources of the country were maintained and their restraint was not leading to a situation in which those in receipt of dividends were gaining.  Such a dividend equalisation tax would in the long run involve very little in the long term itself because, so far as we can judge in this country, the growth of dividends over the long term tends to be the same as the growth in wages.  But workers will not be content with a generalisation of that kind.  They want an assurance that a dividend equalisation tax would control the amount of income of those in control of dividends and we could then repay that money if dividends rose less rapidly than <Col N="2361" /> wages.  Such a system would ensure equity and convince workers that an incomes policy was not directed against them while, at the same time, in no way interfering with the allocation of resources.  It would have none of the disadvantages of dividend control or profit control which could freeze the existing structure of the economy, discourage efficiency and encourage inefficiency.</P>
    <P>There may be difficulties about this proposal but I submit that, when such a proposal is put forward seriously by the Fine Gael Party, and endorsed by the NIEC, and the Government fail to examine it, comment on it, or do anything about it, and talk year after year vaguely, ineffectively and unconvincingly about the need to have an incomes policy, without looking at the technical means of implementing such a policy, then the Government have failed in their duty.  It is time for that failure to be remedied.  It is time for the Government to look at this proposal, produce a White Paper, tell us whether it is feasible or not and if not, why.</P>
    <P>For several years we have had talk about an incomes policy embracing all incomes, but the nearest we have got is the same useless negative approach of a purely short-term character.  That might help us to halt the present inflation.  But it is not an incomes policy.  Unless some solution is found during that temporary pause, either on the lines we have suggested or on some other lines, to meet the requirements of assuring workers that they will not lose through restraint and, at the same time, not distorting the pattern of savings investment, we will not resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>The first duty of the Government is to examine this proposal and then to tell us what they propose to do and how they propose to formulate an incomes policy.  The neglect of the Government in this field is something that is difficult to forgive because it was unnecessary.  Governments are under many pressures.  It is easy in Opposition to criticise the Government for not doing things which for various internal reasons they may not be able to do. But there is no reason why a Government <Col N="2362" /> with imagination could not have tackled this problem of an incomes policy some years ago.  There is no reason why the goodwill of the ordinary workers could not have been mobilised in defence of reasonable price stability and in defence of their employment now threatened by the inflation caused by the failure of the Government to tackle the problem.  While we give the fullest support to the Taoiseach in his statement regarding the gravity of the situation, we cannot give similar support to the Government in their failure to tackle the problem in the last few years.</P>
    <P>During this period of inflation we have seen the growth of all kinds of factors threatening social cohesion.  We have seen the rich getting richer while the poor become poorer; we have seen a diminution of social cohesion; we have seen the growth of materialism, a disregard on the part of the affluent for the impact their ostentatious living has upon the society in which they live. We have seen a corrosion of the confidence of the people in the last ten years.  It was inevitable that we should face a problem in this respect because the achievement of economic growth at the end of the 1950s was bound to create tensions.  However, we could have tackled the problem in a more satisfactory way.  We could have done something to restrain conspicuous consumption and to ensure that the lot of those suffering from poverty would be eased.  Instead of crowding our roads with large, expensive cars we should have concentrated on lining our streets with modest, suitable houses for the homeless.</P>
    <P>We should not be in the position now where I could bring a Member of this House 300 yards from here and show him a family of half a dozen people living in a small room, having to share with six other families a communal lavatory.  Yet, outside this House there are many large expensive cars.  What kind of reaction can one expect from people in the face of that situation?  The astonishing thing is not that there is unrest in this country but that our people have accepted this with resignation and so few have reacted violently.  If anyone in this House has <Col N="2363" /> the imagination to put himself in the position of a person who has to live in such appalling conditions, in what way would he regard the large cars parked outside in the street?  Can we blame people if they react vigorously to such a society and can we say that we would not react in a similar way?</P>
    <P>Yet we go on our way, creating this kind of society, aggravating the tensions and increasing the divisions in our society.  I am afraid the party opposite have done their share of this. The example given by some of the Ministers opposite in their ostentatious way of life and in their attitude to wealth and prosperity has not helped the moral tone of our society and has not helped to preserve social cohesion in our society.  The entire blame cannot be placed on the party opposite but responsibility rests on the Government to show by example that they really care.  There are many thousands of people in this country who feel nobody cares for them and who are living in conditions that do not encourage them to feel otherwise.  That situation has been aggravated seriously in the last ten years.  It makes it difficult now to secure agreement on an incomes policy, especially if concrete proposals are put forward to ensure that restraint on the part of workers will not lead to the rich becoming richer.</P>
    <P>That is the situation we face and it gives rise to serious dangers in our society.  We see all around the growth of unrest among the oppressed.  We can see a multiplication of the forces of those who want to encourage that unrest.  We have created a situation in which it is becoming increasingly easy for those who want to destroy our society to secure the support of the ordinary people.  We have not reacted very intelligently to this problem.  The reaction of the other side of the House and the reaction of those outside this House also, to the tensions created is often repressive in character.  The first instinct of people faced with unrest, ultimately caused by the conditions in which people live and exploited by those who want to use them for their own ends, is a repressive one.  Their solution is not to remedy these evils <Col N="2364" /> but rather to repress&mdash;a repression not necessarily directed solely against the revolutionaries who may have tried to exploit the situation but against the poor.</P>
    <P>We have had this year the reaction of the Government to the Criminal Justice Bill proposals.  In other areas there has been a growth in the attitude of repression which finds expression in tolerance of the activities of private police forces, as we saw recently in Hume Street, and in the reaction of the Government to the evils of squatting which their neglect has created. This reaction is not to strengthen the rights of property owners to deal with squatting, which needs to be done, but of trying to introduce legislation to put people in jail.  If a man after years on a housing waiting list is finally driven in desperation to find a home for his family, the reaction is to seek to put him in jail.  That does not seem to me to be an intelligent reaction.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years the Government have failed to tackle armed violence.  They have allowed people to parade publicly with arms and, even when prodded from this side of the House, they refused to take action. However, the Government have reacted against unarmed people demonstrating for their rights.  Therefore, it has had the effect of encouraging violence and discouraging peaceful protest.  This is not the action of a wise Government and those responsible should examine their consciences.  We must tackle the social evils that give rise to the threat of violence, we must deprive those who wish to exploit poverty of the chance to exploit it for revolutionary purposes.</P>
    <P>We must choose carefully the means of dealing with social problems so that, while we ensure that law and order, in their true sense, are preserved, these rather fine concepts, in their true sense, are not used by us as an excuse for repression, that we do not fall into an all too easy attitude which would tend to aggravate tensions.  It should be our task to ease tensions.  This distinction is not always easy to make but it is a distinction we have to make if we are going to retain any type of cohesion in our society.  Can we do <Col N="2365" /> this?  Can we show real dedication to social justice, to liberal policies, to reforms where needed, to the control of speculative and materialistic forces undermining our society from above as well as revolutionary forces undermining it from below?  Can we show a real concern for the conservation of our natural resources&mdash;not just falling in with the National Conservation Year and towing a caravan from Leinster House throughout the country for this purpose but actually doing something about protecting our people from the effects of pollution, protecting the people of the State from the appalling stench from some factories which Deputies in this House would not tolerate for five minutes if they had to live in those conditions?  Are we able to show the imagination and dedication to tackle these problems? I doubt it so far as the present Government are concerned.  I think that, opposite me, we have men, the survivors, who have been a long time in office; and new men, perhaps, a long time waiting for office, but men who are tired men, unimaginative men, some of whom are trying to find the right thing to do but, even when they find the words, they cannot invest these words with the significance they should have because they are, perhaps, too tired at this stage to do so.</P>
    <P>I doubt if a Government with the record of this Government&mdash;a record that includes economic achievement over some of this period but includes also neglect of social evils and a failure to grapple with the real problems of our society&mdash;can pull us out of the difficulties we are now in.  I cannot see this Government mobilising support for an incomes policy.  I cannot see this Government treading this path carefully on this whole issue of maintaining law and order while maintaining liberty.  This Government have not shown any sureness of touch in the past few years.  It does not seem to me that, even with the new men in it &mdash;half-purged as it is&mdash;it has the imagination in respect of many members of experience to do this.</P>
    <P>In suggesting it is time for a change in this House I am propounding more than a cliché expected from the Opposition: I am propounding something that <Col N="2366" /> is self-evident to a very large proportion of our people today.</P>
    <P>There is also another reason why we must be concerned with the maintenance in office of this Government.  It has been touched on by other speakers including Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien. This is a Government which depends for its life and which will depend for its life in this House tomorrow night upon the support of men dedicated to bringing it down; men who make no bones about this; men who sit, day after day, at their extended table in the restaurant, plotting together; men who plot together in corners of this House; men who approach other Members of the Government party and try to suborn their colleagues from allegiance to their leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is <i>sub judice</i>? I am not referring to any case in the courts.  I am talking about internal conflicts in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should not dream of talking about any case in the courts.  I am entitled to refer to the divisions in the party opposite and the dangers these divisions constitute for the country because the divisions of the party opposite involve a small group of men dedicated to pursuing policies which could destroy this country; men determined to achieve power in Fianna Fáil and plotting to do so.  Can a Government depend on these men for its support and life as a Government?  Nobody could have confidence in such a Government.  It is not just on this side of the House that there is a lack of confidence in this Government: there is a lack of confidence also in this Government amongst Fianna Fáil supporters throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangers here are very real.  I do not think public opinion has grasped them sufficiently.  People in a crisis, people facing a danger, grasp at straws. I should not like to suggest the Taoiseach is a straw man but he is certainly not a strong man within his party at this time.  I am afraid that people, seeing the threat posed to the country by those who have broken away from Fianna Fáil&mdash;within the party in most cases; outside it, in one case&mdash;seeing <Col N="2367" /> that the Taoiseach cannot iron out what has been done, with courage, it must be said, may not realise the danger of keeping in power a man, whatever his goodwill and concern to do the right thing, who, whenever he speaks, is in a position that he may not be able to do the right thing without bringing down not only himself but perhaps more than himself and his Government with him.  A Government in that situation is not a kind of Government a country in our position needs at this time.</P>
    <P>In referring to this matter I want to refer to the north which has been spoken of from this side of the House in entirely constructive terms.  The opening speech from this side of the House by the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, brought to the attention of the House and of the people some facts about our Constitution which are perhaps overlooked: the fact that sectarianism in our Constitution was an import of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1937.  This country had a Constitution which no doubt had defects.  In certain respects it contained the vestiges of an imperial form of rule which, rightly, both parties in time succeeded in eliminating.  It was a Constitution which, nevertheless, partly because of pressure from the British Government when the State was founded, contained no references to sectarianism and contained nothing that was objected to by any of the minority in this country who were perhaps more powerful and influential then than they are today.  That Constitution was replaced by Fianna Fáil by a new Constitution which has many good features&mdash;many of whose provisions I have had occasion to praise&mdash; but unfortunately it introduced into the Constitution of our country provisions which are not regarded by the minority in this country as ones they can readily accept.</P>
    <P>We had also speeches from Deputy Cooney and Deputy Harte and latterly Deputy Cruise-O'Brien dealing with the north in terms, I think, that gave the fullest support to what the Taoiseach was trying to do even if at times they were doubtful of the Taoiseach and <Col N="2368" /> his colleagues living up to the standards they are trying to set for themselves. Any fears expressed in this House or elsewhere that we could not debate the north in this House without saying things that might do damage have been demonstrated to be without foundation so far as the Opposition in this House are concerned.  Perhaps there is foundation for such fears from the other side of the House.  Perhaps speeches may be made later in this debate by Members of the Taoiseach's party which could do damage.  Perhaps he may be able to restrain them or they may be able to restrain themselves.</P>
    <P>In this debate, as in the debate last October, nothing has been said that is not constructive or helpful to the re-unification of minds and hearts which we seek.  I think that, over the past year, we have all learned a lot. It would be quite wrong for anybody, speaking on this matter, to suggest that all truth lies with one side of the House and none on the other; that all the mistakes are made from one side of the House and none from the other side of the House.  We have all made mistakes in the past.  We have all lived and thought in Partitionist terms.  Even those of us who try, consciously, to get out of this mould and to think in all-Ireland terms and to consider and react towards the minority in the north as if they were an integral part, onequarter of our people, all of us have at times fallen short of the standards we have tried to set ourselves.  The blame for this rests on all of us in the way we have organised our affairs in the past half-century.  It is the product of ignorance and neglect on our part.</P>
    <P>It is ironical to recall, but it is worth recalling, that barely a year ago, after the first troubles in Derry, before Burntollet, a public opinion poll was carried out in this country of an extensive character and, as public opinion polls go, a very real one, in which people were asked what they thought were the major national issues.  They were given a list, if I recall correctly, of possible issues to comment on, of what they thought were the major national issues of our time.  One per cent referred to Northern Ireland.  That was the measure of interest in or consiv <Col N="2369" /> cern for Northern Ireland in this country barely a year ago, even after the troubles had started.</P>
    <P>Is it surprising, faced with that public ignorance or public lack of interest, that when the crisis broke last August foolish things were said? It is not surprising.  It is perhaps not so easy to forgive it in a Government or the leader of a Government.  It is easy to forgive it in the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party, my party and the Labour Party, and the people of the country as a whole, given that we were brought up to ignore the north and that, as long as we said our little bit of patter about being against Partition, we need not think about the north or visit it or know the people. Given that that is the background, it is not surprising that mistakes were made and foolish things said.  This does not exonerate the Taoiseach or the Government from their actions at that time. It does exonerate many others in Fianna Fáil and elsewhere for foolish things that may have been said at first.</P>
    <P>In the past year we have learned a great deal.  For the first time in half a century we have begun to think about the north.  For the first time we have begun really to consider it as potentially a part of our country.  We have begun to examine our attitudes, a healthy but painful process.  Many people, in Fianna Fáil and outside it, have found it difficult to readjust their attitudes, to face up to the fact that their stereotyped picture of the north is not, in fact, what the north is like.  The biggest shock of all was the shock provided to so many people when the British Army was welcomed by the Catholics in Belfast and Derry in August last year.  The traumatic effect of that shock took weeks and months to overcome.</P>
    <P>The first stage in the process of national re-evaluation began, and I think this can be traced meticulously from the record, with the publication of the Fine Gael policy on this subject in September of last year.  When one contrasts the speech made by the Taoiseach on 29th August with his Tralee speech at the end of September, one can see the profound effect the Fine Gael policy statement had.  For the <Col N="2370" /> first time a party had the courage to say truthfully what the position was in the north and to approach it in a generous spirit, not in a spirit of reconquest but in a spirit of reconcilia-tion. It must be said that this approach on the part of the Fine Gael Party struck a responsive chord at once in the Taoiseach who that very same day welcomed it and went on in his Tralee speech to spell out in more detailed terms his support for the proposals put forward by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Since then we had the October debate last year which helped public opinion to evolve.  Since then we had many articles and many speeches and a general painful process of rethinking of attitudes, although they still have not penetrated to all recesses in the Fianna Fáil Party.  We still have people like Deputy Moore who either have not listened, heard, understood or accepted what the Taoiseach had to say on the subject on 11th July and who still blame it all on Britain.  We will have people who say it is all the fault of Partition, as if Partition were a cause and not an effect.</P>
    <P>Partition is the reflection of a division within the Irish people, a division whose origins lie back in history, the blame for which may fairly be attributed to Britain in the early 17th century, or perhaps a bit later, but which for centuries past has been, as the Taoiseach so rightly said, an Irish problem to be solved only by Irishmen.  Certainly its solution will be facilitated by British goodwill.  It could be impeded by other attitudes on the part of Britain.  For a long time past the British have had goodwill.  The British have, perhaps, been bemused as to how to tackle the problem.  They have done foolish and stupid things at times, not because they wanted to make a mess of things, not because they wanted for some purposes of their own to create disorder or difficulties here, but because they did not understand the problem. With our help they can be brought to understand it.  They are coming to understand it.</P>
    <P>I do not think Britain is an obstacle to the solution of this problem.  If we could solve it, if we could create a union of hearts and minds among our <Col N="2371" /> own people, on Britain's side there would be nothing more than a sigh of relief.  If we could solve our problems together, the British would be very happy indeed to withdraw their troops and get out of the situation they are now in.  They are faced with the danger of having to introduce conscription or cut their commitments elsewhere in the world because of their involvement in Northern Ireland.  Whatever strategic reasons Britain may have had in the past for hanging on to Northern Ireland &mdash;that is an old Irish story&mdash;they exist no longer.  Britain's strategic interests require her to cut her military commitments in the north as much and as soon as possible.  Her interests and ours coincide.  For Deputy Moore to talk of Britain today as the obstacle is to talk in terms, perhaps, of what he was taught at school in a distorted history book and not in the terms of current reaction.</P>
    <P>This union of hearts and minds will not be achieved by concentrating on each other's defects.  I was depressed in this respect by the Taoiseach's speech.  As Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien and other speakers said, there has been an uncertainty of touch on the part of the leaders of Fianna Fáil in handling this problem.  One can see over the past year that they have learned to face the problem and try to apply goodwill, intelligence and some imagination to it.  One can see the development of their thought, but very easily they fall back into the old ways.</P>
    <P>We had the foolish statement by the Taoiseach, in his otherwise excellent speech of July 11th, that we are on the brink of a great achievement, a meaningless phrase to us but perhaps a threatening one to one million people in the north.  We had the most unfortunate defensive reference by the Minister for External Affairs to the arms in the Falls Road, dismissing them as if they were a few water pistols, a partisan attitude which I thought he had gone beyond and yet which, perhaps in a moment of pressure, he was betrayed into.</P>
    <P>We had from the Taoiseach yesterday again, unfortunately, a lecture to the <Col N="2372" /> Unionists in Northern Ireland about the reforms they had introduced and the reforms they should introduce.  It is fair for all of us to comment from time to time upon the progress or lack of progress made there, but any such comments must be made in the full and open knowledge and acceptance that there are motes and beams here.  I would not claim that the defects in our society match in scale and magnitude or importance and gravity those in the society of Northern Ireland, but there are defects in our society which are, in many cases, all too closely parallel to those in Northern Ireland.  For us to condemn aspects of society in Northern Ireland and to speak about reforms there in a patronising way, when we are not prepared to introduce similar reforms here or when we have offended against the principles involved in those reforms, is not to forward the cause of Irish unity.</P>
    <P>Let us be critical of what is wrong in Northern Ireland, but with due humility and due regard for the fact that we have our faults too.  No consciousness of this emerged from the Taoiseach's address yesterday.  There was no evidence that when he spoke of some of the reforms in Northern Ireland there was a case for doing something about reforms here too.  Let me list some of these.  The Taoiseach spoke about the reform in the discriminatory voting system in Northern Ireland.  Of course we have not got this discriminatory voting system in the Republic.  We have one man one vote, but one man's vote has not got the same value as another's as a result of the gerrymander by that former member of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Kevin Boland.</P>
    <P>A Taoiseach who stood over that gerrymander, who supported it and led his party through the House in support of it when this country was carved up in such a way as to give Fianna Fáil five seats they would not otherwise have got to get the dishonest majority he got in the last election, a Taoiseach who led his party to try to demolish our fair system of PR in favour of a system which would have been unfair in this country, is not a man who can talk patronisingly about voting discrimination in Northern Ireland and <Col N="2373" /> get away with it.  He has laid himself open to some remarks from Mr. Faulkner who is the expert in this field.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also spoke about housing in Northern Ireland.  He said rightly that the housing allocation system has not been implemented, that the central housing authority has not yet been set up.  That is something which needs to be said much more frequently in the British Parliament because it seems to me that there are too many people who believe that the reforms in Northern Ireland have all been introduced.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also spoke about the increase in the volume of housing in Northern Ireland to meet the needs of that part of the country but he had nothing to say about the volume of housing here nor would it be clear to even the closest listener to his speech that the country about which he was making patronising references in regard to the volume of their housing is building twice as many local authority houses per head of population as we are.  If we are to be patronising about housing in Northern Ireland in regard to volume we must expect a reply very quickly pointing out the relative figures.  By the time the reforms go through they will be building in Northern Ireland, with half the population, about 25 per cent more houses in all and, counting local authority houses, the disparity will be even greater.  The less we say about reforms in housing in Northern Ireland involving increased numbers of houses the better, until the Government show some sign of doing something about the problem here.  This remains to me the biggest mystery of Fianna Fáil. I do not understand how a government such as Fianna Fáil whose members are in close touch with the ordinary people&mdash;they are good constituency men&mdash;can have allowed the situation in housing to develop that has developed here and how they can then talk about Northern Ireland in the same breath as regards housing.  To say the least, it is foolish of them.</P>
    <P>On the question of discrimination let me say, as I think other speakers on our side have said, that Mr. <Col N="2374" /> Faulkner's remarks on the subject are wide of the mark.  We do not have discrimination in the giving of houses. They really are allocated on a points system; whether that is the technical phrase for it or not I do not know but they are allocated on a system of priorities. I have never come across a case in my own area where I found any evidence of houses being unfairly allocated. Perhaps it has happened.  I have heard rumours and reports but I have seen no evidence.  I shall not believe it until I see the evidence.  Our housing allocation is fair but it must be said that Deputies on the other side of the House have done their best to undermine confidence in it.  Any Deputy on this side knows as well as I do that when you are dealing with constituents about housing they tell you: &ldquo;Deputy so-and-so of Fianna Fáil got a house for so-and-so.  Will you get one for me?  Are they the only people who can get houses?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no evidence of any Fianna Fáil Deputy getting a house for anybody but I have much evidence of Fianna Fáil Deputies claiming to get houses.  If Mr. Faulkner is talking about their introduction of a points system and our not having a fair system here it is because he has fallen for the Fianna Fáil propaganda on this subject.  He has fallen as so many of our own people have, into the trap of believing Fianna Fáil Deputies who say they get houses for people when in fact the system is a fair one which they do not influence unfairly.  Fianna Fáil Deputies, like Fine Gael Deputies, can help people who have failed to present their case adequately.  We must all do that.  A week does not pass that I do not find some constituent looking for a house and is not getting one because he forgot that he did not change on the form the place he was looking for.  You get the person who says: &ldquo;I will go anywhere on the south side but I cannot get a house.&rdquo;  Then you find that when they filled up the form four years ago they put &ldquo;Charlemont Street&rdquo; and, since there was nothing built in Charlemont Street, they have got nothing.</P>
    <P>All of us can help people who made mistakes of this kind.  We can draw the <Col N="2375" /> attention of the corporation to cases of injustice or unfairness that can occur in any system through oversight or mistakes but we do not distort the priority system for the benefit of our supporters in my experience.  If I am wrong in that I am open to correction. Many people believe this happens and this belief has communicated itself to Northern Ireland.  It is about time people were disabused of this belief and that Fianna Fáil Deputies stopped claiming corruption in an area in which they are not, so far as I am aware, practising corruption.</P>
    <P>We have also heard the Taoiseach refer to employment discrimination in Northern Ireland.  Again, I thought it was a very unwise subject to be raised by a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach who must have heard, or heard of, his own Member who, a couple of weeks ago, brazenly claimed in this House that three of his family had got jobs as guides at the Rock of Cashel.  He was accused of four; he claimed three.  I am not sure what way the truth lies.  This is only the tip of an iceberg of Fianna Fáil jobbery which has undermined public confidence in public institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question but that there was an interview board and that representatives of the Board of Works, which is under his control, and of the regional tourist board, were on it.  Then he appointed them subsequently.  The background to this matter of jobbery is worth bearing in mind.  I think it is worth understanding <Col N="2376" /> the historical background as to how it arose.  My own view, and I have not gone into it in great detail, is from what I have read of our history, that when the first Government came to power they were faced with a difficult situation.  I have no intention of going into the rights and wrongs of the Civil War which are not matters for debate here and are matters about which the less said the better on all sides.  They were in a position where they found themselves in conflict with a large group of their own people and where they faced a problem of not being able to rely on people in their own service who were in collusion with people on the other side of the Civil War.  It was necessary to get rid of some people for this reason.  It was also necessary for public security not to reappoint people for a period who were committed to overthrowing the existing regime.</P>
      <P>My understanding of it is that the first Government went to great trouble to avoid any kind of jobbery and introduced and maintained a very high standard in that respect.  Seen from the republican side the exclusion of republicans from jobs clearly created a problem. When Fianna Fáil came into power in 1932 I can quite understand that Government feeling it necessary to reinstate or put into jobs some of its own people, to restore the balance that inevitably had been disturbed by the aftermath of the Civil War.  I find it hard to condemn certain readjustments in public employment at that time to set the balance right so that one could start afresh.  Unfortunately, what was done then, and understandingly, became a habit and there was introduced into Irish life, originally perhaps in good faith and in circumstances with which one can sympathise, a practice of jobbery which has filled up all the nooks and crannies not covered by the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission so that wherever there is a job not covered by these bodies political influence operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen it in the appointment of judges, with very rare exceptions every ten years or so just to make the point that not all appointments are political.  We have seen it in the appointment of boards of State bodies, <Col N="2377" /> not in the case of all the appointees but in some cases a few, not a majority, and in other cases a minority.  We have seen it at, perhaps its worst and most dangerous to public confidence, in the appointments to RTE.  We have seen it at the level of the guides at the Rock of Cashel, at the level of sub-postmasters, rate collectors and anywhere it is possible for political influence to creep in through any loophole not blocked by the measures taken by the first Government.  It has crept in and corroded public life.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that all the blame for this is on one side.  I have said that the origins of it seem understandable and were perhaps relatively innocent. I am sure that other governments since have offended to some degree.  I think the corrosion and corruption introduced by this practice has spread and that the whole of our public life has become affected by it.  At times it has affected other people also.  This is perhaps not surprising but I think we must tackle it.  It is no good talking to the people of Northern Ireland about injustice in employment when they see down here the limited chance somebody has of getting one of these unprotected jobs, jobs not protected by the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission, if they are not Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Those on the other side of the House should examine their consciences on this matter both for the sake of public life in this part of the country and for the sake of any possibility of eventual reunion.  You will not persuade the Unionist million in Northern Ireland ever to join in a state where they see that jobs are allocated in many walks of life, even including the judiciary, on a political basis, and if I were one of them I would not want to come in in those circumstances either.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that the judges of Northern Ireland <Col N="2378" /> are appointed by the Lord Chancellor of England and that the political appointments system which did exist in England was abolished a while ago. I am not saying judges in Northern Ireland may not have acted mistakenly or wrongly on some occasion. It may well be there was bias in some cases, but the appointments system in respect of judges to the High Court or other judges is one which is not subject to political influence in Northern Ireland.  In any event, even if it were, I do not see that they would be any more inclined to join in another system where the influence would work the other way.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also spoke about the reform of the RUC and the B Specials, the elimination of the repressive element that existed in an armed police force and a militia which was outside control, as he said.  However, the Taoiseach who brought in the Criminal Justice Bill is not in a good position to talk about repression.  He also spoke about local authority reform in Northern Ireland, while under him Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban District Council were not only abolished but have been kept abolished. The Taoiseach can make a case that because they did not strike a rate it was necessary to get rid of them, but no case can be made for refusing to reinstate those authorities, their offence having been purged.  For the Taoiseach to talk patronisingly about local authority reform in Northern Ireland, having left these two areas without local representation, will not carry conviction.</P>
      <P>I noticed one thing the Taoiseach did not refer to in relation to reforms in Northern Ireland.  He did not mention the introduction of an ombudsman. Why?  Because the Taoiseach does not intend to introduce an ombudsman down here to protect people against administrative abuse.  This has been a rather selective approach to reform in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having gone over that catalogue in the Taoiseach's speech and having contrasted his attitude to Northern Ireland and reforms there with the performance of Fianna Fáil down here, I wish to reiterate what I said at the outset.  I <Col N="2379" /> am not saying things are as bad here as in Northern Ireland, but there are defects in our system for which the present Government are peculiarly responsible in a number of cases which make it hazardous, to say the least of it, for the Government or its leader to lecture the North of Ireland on their way of handling these same matters.  To put it the other way round, I think the Taoiseach who has delivered this homily has an obligation in conscience, in reason, to set about righting the defects here which are the direct equivalent of, if less serious in character than, those in the north of Ireland.  Our criticism of Northern Ireland and the regime there would be so much more powerful if we set about changing our own society.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that just as the concept of freedom which lay at the root of the whole Protestant ethos has been distorted in Northern Ireland into repression, so also Tone's concept of republicanism here has been distorted into something quite different from its origins.  Both of these are noble traditions. We do not, perhaps, like always to remember it&mdash;most of us are Jacobites at heart at least in Irish affairs&mdash;but the Whig revolution of 1688, whatever about its unattractive features, was designed to and did secure certain freedoms.  Catholics had to wait a century and-a-third to benefit from these freedoms, and in the meantime they suffered the penal laws.</P>
    <P>In any event, a certain foundation was laid in the Whig revolution at that time and when the Protestants of Northern Ireland, Orangemen, talk about freedom as being something guaranteed to them by the Orange Order and by their Williamite traditions they are not just inventing something. They are referring back to something that was a reality which has become distorted in their hands.  Nevertheless, there is something there of which we have a genuine pride and it is something from which we have benefited. The freedom of speech and freedom of association which we enjoy as an inevitable part of our way of living is a British tradition which finds its origin there.  We in being proud of our <Col N="2380" /> tradition are in some respects being proud of the same thing as the Protestants of Northern Ireland, although we do not trace it back in quite the same way and although we have not distorted it in the same way as they have, into an instrument of repression.  Therefore, when we have someone in this House speaking about the ideals of Tone and, at the same time, speaking about our people, 500,000 of our people&mdash;the 500,000 being Catholics&mdash;you are seeing a very weakened and distorted form of Tonism.  I referred to it in an earlier debate as deviationist Tonism, to be polite about it.  We all have our traditions of which we are proud.  Many traditions have gone to make up this island but we at times distort them to our own advantage or what we see as our own advantage.  We here are as guilty of this in our own way as the Orangemen in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should also recognise some of the strictures about this part of the country by people in the north, for example, strictures about clericalism in the Republic, which in the past at least had a good deal of foundation.  What we tend to forget is the extent to which in this respect we went backwards for a period.  I myself grew up in the belief that there has been a great deal of progress towards greater freedom, a great deal of progress away from undue interference by the Catholic Church in matters that did not directly concern it, that this has gone on continually and that things are getting better all the time.  It is only as I have grown older and read more I found this country had a strong, healthy kind of anticlerical tradition throughout the nineteenth and into the early twentieth century which died largely with independence, and that for several decades we went sharply backwards.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison between the independent-minded attitude of Irish political leaders in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century towards the Church and the attitude adopted by our Irish political leaders towards the Church in the 1930s&mdash;<i>vide</i> the Constitution and much else besides. When the Protestants in Northern Ireland accuse us of not having full <Col N="2381" /> freedom in some respects, of being unduly influenced by Church authorities in matters that should not directly concern it, they are not speaking of something imaginary, but of something that has been a reality.  Of course, like most things, it is out of date.  Just as our picture of the North of Ireland is a stereotype which is many years out of date, their picture of the Republic is many years out of date.  They seem to believe we are still back in the thirties and forties or, perhaps, even in the early fifties, the period of the mother and child scheme.  The fact that there has been a great change here has not, perhaps, impinged on them and that is probably our fault in failing to put it across.</P>
    <P>We should face the fact that the first couple of decades of the history of this State were not happy in this respect and that the fears Protestants had had some foundation, not that we ever adopted any repressive or bigoted measures against Protestants, but we did seek to create, to their discomfiture if no more, a Catholic State, and this found its expression in the peculiar and unhappy wording of the 1937 Constitution, and found its expression in other ways, too, right up to and including the period of the mother and child scheme.</P>
    <P>Look at it from the point of view of the Northern Ireland Protestant and let us see the way this country evolved: how the healthily independent attitude to the Church authorities which had characterised our people and our politicians right up to this century, and well into this century, evaporated and weakened with independence and under how much clerical influence Irish politicians fell during the first 30 years or so of the existence of this State.  If we face this we can perhaps begin understanding their viewpoint and come to grips with it.</P>
    <P>Of course, their fears are exaggerated, their concept of clerical influence here goes far beyond anything that was ever the case but certainly in this part of the country we have not been throughout the life of this State by any means as careful of the feelings of our Protestant compatriots, those of <Col N="2382" /> us who are Catholics, as we should have been.  We did seek to create a Catholic State in which they would be tolerated, with no discrimination in employment or housing or anything but in which they would have to live in an atmosphere which was officially Catholic and not simply Catholic by majority.  That certainly is something which the Protestant who does not have to live here, who lives in the North of Ireland and wishes to remain there must have found distasteful.  We must face this fact and face the fact that this country in this respect went backwards for a period of 30 years and although we have since recovered much ground and have a much better and healthier relationship from the point of view of the Church as well as the State, this is not by any means widely understood in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should listen to criticisms made by people in the North of Ireland of our State.  Some of these are misconceived and simply wrong, such as the reference to the allocation of houses made by Mr. Faulkner.  Some are propaganda, designed for home consumption; some of them have elements of truth and wherever there is an element of truth in an allegation made by a Northern Minister we should examine it and see what we can do about it.  It is no answer to the point that he makes to say that we do not need an ombudsman, that our TDs are so active that there is no problem.  This is palpable nonsense.  The function of an ombudsman, of investigating the files of Government Departments where a case is made that injustice has been done is one which no TD has ever been permitted to fulfil in this country. The suggestion that either by questions in the House or by representations to Government Departments the injustices which an ombudsman occasionally reveals could be brought to light is not worthy of a moment's discussion.  This pretence that we do not need such a man here but that they need him in the North of Ireland does us no good, when we find Brian Faulkner boasting about their ombudsman and jeering us because we have no similar institution. While we might accept that there is perhaps greater need for him in the north than here&mdash;I am not too sure of <Col N="2383" /> it in this particular instance&mdash;but whether there is a greater need or not there is a need for him here and the resistance of Fianna Fáil to any kind of inspection or control of the activities of the Government machine other than by Ministers is something that has to go, if we are to convince people in the North of Ireland that they will get the same fair treatment here as they now expect to have in the north.</P>
    <P>What are the things that need to be done here if we are to be able to say to the people in the north &ldquo;You have nothing to fear.  If you join with us you will find yourself in a State in which the way of life will be congenial to you, with your different traditions&rdquo;?  We must distinguish here between the different things that have to be done. In the Constitution there are things which in one way or another are offensive to people in the North of Ireland and constitute obstacles to a union of minds and a union of the country. There are laws we have which are inappropriate and undesirable and which would certainly give rise to misconceptions and do not encourage people in the north to want to be associated with a State which has such laws.</P>
    <P>Then again we have laws which, perhaps, do not suit the views of people in the North of Ireland and with which they would be unhappy but which reflect very seriously a tradition of our own and which we are entitled to retain, telling them that they can in this sphere have their own separate legal system.  We must therefore distinguish between these different things &mdash;the constitutional changes required, the legal changes required and cases in which their laws may be different from ours but where there is no necessity for us to change ours but where we need to make it clear that if we ever came together they could retain their own law.  This needs study and I am glad that a committee has been set up to study it.  However, I am not by any means happy that it is an inter-departmental committee.  These are matters which are so essentially political that I do not think such a committee can grapple adequately with them.  I should have been much happier if the Taoiseach <Col N="2384" /> had told us that a Cabinet committee had been set up, even perhaps a Fianna Fáil Party committee, to look at this matter, with the insight that politicians have into these problems and which the civil servants cannot be expected to have.  I hope the review will be extensive and constructive and some political decisions will emerge which will help to make changes here and which will help in some way towards bringing the two parts of the country closer together.</P>
    <P>We all know that our Constitution needs to be reviewed from this point of view.  The Article on which most attention is concentrated is Article 44.2.3 which concerns the special position of the Catholic Church.  We know that this has no legal significance and it was intended simply as a statement of fact, but it is so open to misinterpretation that it should go.  On this there is unanimous agreement, excepting at least one member of the Labour Party, in this House and amongst the Churches.  There are other Articles which need to be looked at.  There is the Article which makes the dissolution of marriage unconstitutional. Apart from the fact that the phraseology of this Article has given rise to serious legal problems because of conflict with international law there is the fact that in the North of Ireland, for good or for ill, divorce does exist and for us to have a Constitution which says it cannot exist in the national territory is hardly going to encourage people in the north who believe this is an essential part of their liberties to want to join us.  I would have doubts about changing our divorce law.  That is a matter for ourselves.  One could argue it either way.  The case is a very difficult one on which to reach a clear decision but it should not be and should never have been in the Constitution and was not in the first Constitution. It should now go without prejudice to whether our laws should be changed which is a quite different question and one on which I have no clear view.</P>
    <P>There is also Article 44.2.6 dealing with the acquisition of religious property by the State.  I am not sure why special protection is required for <Col N="2385" /> religious property as against property generally.  There was something similar in the first Constitution and it may be that by common consent in both parts of Ireland it needed to be retained.  I do not fully understand why, as it seems to me that all propery deserves some protection.  It may have been introduced originally, and I think it was, for fear that the Irish Government would confiscate property of the Protestant churches as many of those churches were, in our view, Catholic churches originally, and in other countries a change of regime has led to a change in the control of churches.  This needs to be looked at anyhow to see if there is any need for it or to see if the inclusion of a special provision with respect to religious property is desirable or undesirable.</P>
    <P>Another section needs to be looked at because of repeated statements or implications by the Government or civil servants that it stands in the way of necessary reforms in regard to housing. It needs to be looked at in this context <i>vis-à-vis</i> the North of Ireland because in Northern Ireland there is no such inhibition.  I am referring to the section dealing with private property which has been quoted as meaning that the Irish Government cannot acquire land for building purposes without paying the full development price.  I do not see how it can bear this interpretation but if, in fact, the position is that whereas in the North of Ireland land can be acquired at its agricultural value, as was the case with Craigavon, and this cannot happen down here, and that the provision of houses at a reasonable price is impossible because of this then it seems to me to be something which should be looked at in the context of relations with Northern Ireland.  If I were a person concerned with housing there I should be very slow to join a country in which it was impossible to acquire land at a reasonable price because of constitutional inhibitions. That is something that should be looked at.</P>
    <P>These are some points amongst others.  The most important point is the basic question of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Here we have never really made up our minds and decided <Col N="2386" /> what it is we want to do.  Are we still vestigially thinking of the reconquest of Northern Ireland or do we genuinely now believe, as we say we do, that Partition can and should end only with the consent of the majority?  That is the policy of this party.  It is the policy of the Labour Party.  Expressions to this effect, but never so explicit, have been made by the Fianna Fáil Party and its leader.  Possibly it is the policy of the majority of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe it should be made explicit.</P>
    <P>If this is, in fact, national policy then that is, in fact, recognition of Northern Ireland.  If that is so, then the separate regime must remain until its people, by a majority, change it.  When we talk about reunion then what exactly do we mean?  You cannot, as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien quoted me as saying, recognise diplomatically a non-sovereign State.  We recognise the Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although the Minister for External Affairs was strangely silent when asked to confirm this yesterday. We recognise Northern Ireland, which constitutes a legal unit, and we recognise the authority of the British Government over that area.  We cannot recognise it as a State because it is not a State.  We say that Partition can and should only go with the consent of the majority.  This is the only kind of recognition we can give.  Let us give it formally and make a formal statement that that is our position.</P>
    <P>If that is the case then Articles 2 and 3 need to be looked at because they are couched in terms incompatible with this concept of recognition coming only from a union of minds and hearts.  On the legal and administrative side there are other matters to be considered. On the administrative side we have the use of Irish as a weapon for examination purposes and for entrance to the public service.  So long as we retain this, so long are we dividing our island and telling the citizens in Northern Ireland that they are not wanted here.  The alternative is saying: &ldquo;Yes, come in, but you will never get a job in our Civil Service so long as you do not learn our language.&rdquo;  So long as the Government continue that policy they <Col N="2387" /> are not sincere.  There are different minds in this State at the present time. We have not recognised this fully and until we do so there will not be the union of minds and hearts for which the Taoiseach says he wishes.</P>
    <P>Again, we have provisions with regard to contraception which are an obstacle not only to reunion with the north but to the union of hearts and minds amongst our own people in the different communities that go to make up our State.  The time is past for us to maintain a law of this kind, a law which supports the viewpoint of the ecclesiastical authorities and a minority of theologians in one particular Church.  The law should not involve itself in matters of theology and private conscience.  In this the Taoiseach is particularly to blame because of his dishonesty and double thinking.  He told the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis that there was nothing to prevent people who wished to do so using contraceptives. I questioned him on that and I pointed out that their import was prohibited and so they could not be bought here; the only alternative was for people to make their own.</P>
    <P>This kind of double thinking will certainly not persuade anyone in Northern Ireland that there is any real interest in this part of the country about trying to create conditions under which people could come together. This law is undesirable because it is an intrusion into the sphere of private morality and involves taking sides in a theological dispute between churches. It is an obstacle to the union of minds and hearts among the religious communities in this country and, <i>a fortiori,</i> to the union of minds and hearts between north and south.  We should take our courage in our hands and abolish it for the anachronism that it now is.  We may have our private views about contraception but our private views should not enter into a matter of this kind.  There must be honesty in this when talking about it to our friends in the north.  That does not mean that we are prepared to align our legislation with theirs in every respect. There are views we hold as a <Col N="2388" /> matter of conviction which may not be held as matters of conviction in the north.</P>
    <P>There has been a successful union over many centuries between England and Scotland and, as in the case of Scotland, there are things in which we would want to retain our own practices.  If the law on abortion in the north bears any relation to that in England I do not see any reason why we should change our law in that particular respect.  This is a matter of public morality.  If, in Northern Ireland, they have different practices, I do not think we should insist that recognition means their dropping their practices any more than they should insist that we should drop ours or change our code of public morality. There is room for different legal systems and different public morality, but let it be clear that there is no use in saying we will adopt the practices that exist in Northern Ireland while, at the same time, refusing to examine what is inappropriate in our own community.  The public service should be looked at and dealt with. That does not mean we should blindly change over.  There is no reason why different attitudes should be a barrier to unity.</P>
    <P>Jobbery must go if we are to convince the Northern Unionists that they have a place in this country.  We must tackle the housing problem.  This means an enormous increase if we are to get anywhere near what has been achieved in Northern Ireland, even before the reforms.  We must push ahead in the sphere of social welfare, recognising that there are economic limits and it will take time for our economy to catch up with that of Northern Ireland, subsidised, as it is, by Great Britain.  We must recognise these economic differences.  Economic differences can disappear in time.  Some of them arise from the exploitation of agriculture in this part of the country by British subsidisation of agriculture in the north.  Contrary to what was said on the Labour Benches, in this respect the EEC will make a radical change, putting Ireland on a par in the two parts of the island.</P>
    <P>Progress towards achieving the same <Col N="2389" /> standards in social welfare is good.  We appear to be catching up with the north.  Progress also depends on our having the kind of social conscience that, within the limits of our resources, we do all we can from this point of view.</P>
    <P>On the question of catching up, the position is a bit complex.  We have been catching up with Britain in terms of our economic growth rate over the past decade.  Assuming Britain is over the hump now and her economy expands more rapidly, it is on the cards we will continue to catch up and our growth rate may be 1 per cent higher than Britain's in the next decade.  This depends on our overcoming our shortterm incomes policy about which I spoke earlier.  If we can overcome that we can bring our living standards close enough to what they will be in Britain towards the end of the century.  The position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland is more complex because it has been expanding much more rapidly in some respects than has the British economy. I was taken aback and a little concerned to discover the disparity in growth rates between north and south in the only period for which accurate figures are available, 1962 to 1967.</P>
    <P>Although our economy suffered a crisis in 1965-66, for the five-year period 1962 to 1967 our economy expanded by 17½ per cent while the economy of Northern Ireland expanded by about 24½ per cent.  In only one of those five years did our economy expand more rapidly.  Therefore, we are faced with the position that, whereas we are likely to catch up with Britain in terms of economic growth, in Northern Ireland under normal conditions a high economic growth rate has been achieved because of the economic policies pursued and the scale of assistance given by the British Government to regional development. We will have to work out the implications of a situation in which Northern Ireland may be developing much more rapidly than Britain and we may be developing at an intermediate rate, and we must relate this to the extent of the dependence of the Northern Ireland economy on Britain.  Finally, we will have to <Col N="2390" /> make some assessment of our prospects to match the development in Northern Ireland in the years ahead.  However, this is not an insuperable problem and we will be able to come near to its solution in the lifetime of many people in this House.</P>
    <P>No economic study has been carried out into this matter.  I hope the terms of reference of the inter-departmental committee are broad enough to examine this and that they will have the wit to employ expert advice to look at the matter in realistic terms.</P>
    <P>The real problem is a psychological one.  We must break away from the old attitude which was basically one of reconquest&mdash;that we would take over the north when we could get hold of it, perhaps not by military force but by getting Britain to hand it over to us against its will.  This attitude is instinctive in many of us and is displayed in our reluctance to amend the Constitution in this respect and to give recognition to the north.  We must break away from this attitude and develop a genuine feeling for the north and its people.  We must get to the point when none of us will say &ldquo;our people&rdquo; meaning one religious community.  It is not only the Blaneys and the Bolands who fall into this trap but we can all unthinkingly adopt a sectarian attitude in this matter.  This has been evident in speeches of Government Ministers. Thy have the tendency to take different attitudes when Catholics or Protestants are being shot.  There should not be any reluctance here to condemn those responsible for the killing of Protestants.  If we genuinely believe what we proclaim about modern Ireland we should be as concerned about the Protestants; perhaps we owe it to ourselves to be a little more concerned about them.</P>
    <P>On the whole, our attitudes have tended to remain somewhat sectarian, although we have put a good face on it. We will not make progress with the kind of threatening gestures made last August of &ldquo;not standing idly by&rdquo;.  We will not make progress with foolish talk of &ldquo;being on the brink of a great achievement&rdquo;; we will not make progress by dismissing arms found in the <Col N="2391" /> Catholic areas and talking always about arms in the Protestant areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to make the point that we do not help the objective the Taoiseach has properly set us by incautious remarks indicating that we do not really believe what we say in regard to Northern Ireland.  We do not help ourselves or our cause by the kind of threatening gestures made last August when the Taoiseach spoke of &ldquo;not standing idly by&rdquo;.  Neither do we achieve our objective by the kind of reference made by the Minister for External Affairs when he dismissed arms on the Falls Road as unimportant and took a partisan attitude about arms found in one part of Belfast.  Neither do we help by lecturing as the Taoiseach seemed to do.</P>
      <P>The best way we can help our cause is by creating in this part of Ireland a Christian society that would make a decent, northern, Protestant working man want to be part of this country. In the 50 years since this State was founded I do not think we have made much progress.  Until we have this union of hearts and minds, to which the Taoiseach referred, we will not make any progress.  However, we have begun to learn that lesson: we are still faltering and at times we fall as when the Taoiseach, Ministers and all of us use the old traditional catchwords, but I believe it is possible to look forward to a time when there will be this union of hearts and minds.  For the first time we have begun to think of this problem and to rid ourselves of the attitude of the reconquest that has influenced our thinking on Northern Ireland for half a century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I was not here for the whole of Deputy FitzGerald's speech but I had to leave the House on other business.  We are all concerned at this time with a number of objectives and it appears to me that apart from some minor criticism there is no <Col N="2392" /> great divergence of views regarding our economic prospects.  We all know that economic progress in the last two years has led to what we call inflation and that if it continues it will lead to a considerable deficit in the balance of payments.  Therefore, it behoves politicians, businessmen and other members of the community to concentrate on this problem.  We know when we devalue the £ other items are also devalued.  We put pressures on jobs, on incomes and on production.  We seriously hamper our ability to export our goods in competition with other countries.</P>
      <P>This is why, I presume, the Government have, for some time, been preoccupied with this question of wages and salaries and an incomes arrangement. It has now come to be called a prices and incomes policy.  We listened to a number of speeches on this point and in the past we have read of the attempt of the British Government to bring about a prices and incomes policy.  That is not an easy exercise. We know, from experience outside, that it is not going to be an easy matter for any Government here to gain acceptance for the view that one could have, or that we could have, a prices and incomes policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a Government take measures either to restrain consumer demand or to impose a freeze on credit, they are usually met with the argument that they are out to create unemployment or, alternatively, to deny credit either to the public or private sectors.  It is noticeable in the past year that, whatever about the public sector, those who engage in business find that the imposition of a credit squeeze makes life very difficult for certain members of the business community&mdash;I say this in the knowledge that we have great numbers of the population here not organised in unions or pressure groups of one sort or another and who have to work within the framework of ordinary commercial limits in order to carry on business.  If, for example, public capital spending takes up too much of the available cash within the community, then those of us who are in business know that there is bound to be a scarcity in the private <Col N="2393" /> sector.  However, I do not intend to go into that too far, because I think that, at this point of time, it has been borne in on us, as members of the community &mdash;whether we are engaged in private activity or whether we work in the public sector or whether we are trade unionists&mdash;that we have now reached a point when the clamour here for excessive incomes could well result in pricing our products off the market abroad &mdash;and all of us know what such an exercise could end up in.  We know that it would end up in less money for housing, for building schools, for road making, for building hospitals and in less money in general for the industrial expansion programme.  Regardless of which party we may belong to, none of us would want that.</P>
    <P>Let me go back to last January, for example, when the Government announced that certain measures would have to be taken to cool down consumer demand.  An effort was made to impose restrictions on hire purchase and certain restrictions were imposed over a range of goods.  Measures were also taken to try to contain consumer demand.  We now know that those measures were not fully effective and that the cycle has continued; that the clamour for more money to meet living costs has continued.  A further point in this context is that, despite the fact that we have had a certain amount of labour unrest&mdash;notably the maintenance men's strike of last year and the cement workers' strike of this year&mdash; coupled with the disturbance in the north, it may be said that our unity of purpose still remains unshaken.  It is my pride at this stage that confidence in the Government is still strong.  This is exemplified by the fact that foreign investors are still coming forward to invest money here.  If possible we want it to remain this way.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I was glad to hear some of the speeches made from the floor of this House today.  They indicate to me a realistic view of the present position. If we reach the point where confidence in the ability of the Government and the State to administer their affairs is weakened, we will have reached a point of danger.</P>
    <P>I am just taking the weak points in <Col N="2394" /> this programme.  We have something going for us now, something in our favour.  Last year the gross national product increased by 4 per cent.  It did not increase to the same extent as it did in 1968 but, with 4 per cent, we can report progress.  Provided we can contain our desire for unrealistic pay increases, we will do better in the years ahead.  One of the factors which contributed to the excessive demand for pay increases was the fact that there was a sharp rise in incomes and profits during 1969.  This more or less provided a basis for the various claims made.</P>
    <P>If an American were speaking here he would say that this factor in itself caused overheating of the economy and that it was incumbent on us to cool it down.  That is the jargon he would use.  Whether we accept the cooling down measures which have to be implemented, with restraint or in a revolutionary manner, is up to ourselves.  If we accept these measures with restraint, I submit that we will go ahead and make progress.  If we tend to revolt at this point we could do great harm not merely to our own prospects but also to the prospects for the country.</P>
    <P>Arising from the increase in incomes and profits during 1969, prices rose sharply.  Yesterday we were informed by the Taoiseach&mdash;and I assume the figure was well checked out&mdash;that the price of goods rose by 7 per cent roughly.  Some say a little more, but I prefer to accept the figure which was checked out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 7.4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take the round figure of 7 per cent.  It was stated also that this trend is continuing in the present year and, if anything, tending to accelerate.  Those of us who have any experience at all, even if we only buy sweets, know very well that a general increase in prices will hold back expansion and export opportunities. We are well aware of what happens when those increases hit the firms in the export field.  As I said earlier, this will result in pushing our goods off the markets abroad.  This is a very <Col N="2395" /> bad trend in view of the fact that industrial goods exported last year exceeded those in the agricultural sector. If we continue along that path it will be very bad for us.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also said that at this point in time costs at home were out-running costs at the international level. This is another red light against us on the industrial road.  Unless we can change the light and get through on the green light we will be in trouble.  I said at the outset that all parties desire more progress, more jobs and a rising standard of living.  Listening to the speeches here today, I do not think anyone would disagree with that statement. How are we to maintain that pace without seriously injuring the fabric of our production at home?</P>
      <P>This does not relate to industrial production only.  We must bear in mind the fact that it also extends to the primary producer.  He has to be taken into account as well.  As I said, we can repair that position by a cooling down in our desire for more pay, especially when the point of that pay passes the point of production.  If we all realised that fact we could get out of our difficulty as easily as we got into it.</P>
      <P>At this point in time we must come to grips with this evil.  It is my belief that it is not merely the Government that must give a lead.  If we do not, if we continue on the present trend we can break up the economy.  Nobody wants to see this.  A warning should go out from this House to all pressure groups that the Government have a responsibility which extends to protecting the currency of the country against all-comers who would try to debase it. If this is not done now by negotiation &mdash;it cannot be done on the streets or by lock-outs at factories because there will be no factories&mdash;our goods will be priced out of the market and there will be no need for producers or workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is why I was glad to see a statement from the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions last weekend, as reported in the Press last Monday, in which he instanced the fraud, <Col N="2396" /> if you like, of seeking increases in paper terms and where he rightly emphasised the desirability of seeking increases of wages in real terms of the purchasing value of the £.  It is not the paper increase that counts but what the housewife can purchase for £1 when she goes into a shop.  This is a point we could all usefully develop.  As I said before, while we have something going for us we should look ahead and see how far we can go on our programme. We have an industrial expansion programme which is one of the most attractive and most vigorous in Europe. I say this deliberately; and it is supported by and rests on schemes of tax incentives for those who export, exemptions from taxation and a wide range of grants.  We have succeeded in attracting 200 foreign firms here in the last decade and they have established themselves here providing work for over 50,000 persons.  It is up to ourselves at this time to make or mar that programme.</P>
    <P>We can create more jobs or have fewer jobs.  We should restrain our demands all round and turn our eyes towards the various schemes on which we have embarked such as that for training school leavers in order to promote higher standards of skill among workers especially in the area of technology. This is one of the factors which will become more prominent as time goes on.  Much as we have done in trying to promote skill in industry we have not concentrated sufficiently on technology.  Perhaps we do not like the word which is an ugly one and represents, perhaps, something new that has not much regard for the human element in industry, but if we are to keep abreast of developments and export our industrial goods abroad we cannot succeed except on the basis of a highly-skilled force of industrial workers.</P>
    <P>We have the basis necessary to embark on a scheme for preparing our younger people in the field of technology. There is a good beginning in the basic education they receive in our schools.  There were certain signs last year of the beginning of a shortage of skilled labour.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <P>After discussions over several months on an offer which I made on 1st <Col N="2399" /> January last, I have conveyed a substantially increased final offer on the scale of fees to the medical organisations. With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will have included in the official record particulars of the scale now proposed for operation at the start of the service.</P>
    <P>I have asked that the organisations send this offer, with a letter which I have issued detailing factors affecting it, to their members.  The results of the organisations' consideration of this is now awaited.  I have asked that they inform me of this at an early date as it is desirable that the further detailed work, including the preparation of regulations and agreements, should now be pushed ahead.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the negotiations have resulted in substantial concurrence with the medical organisations on the other aspects of the new service, including the conditions for admission of existing practitioners into it.  In particular, detailed guarantees have been given to permanent district medical officers as respects remuneration, superannuation rights, continuity of tenure of residences and the conditions for continued access, where appropriate, to existing health centres or dispensaries.</P>

The consultants will present a report in sufficient time to take all the necessary steps of evaluating the character of staffs required, which of course include the present staffs of all the 27 health authorities.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the statement made by President Pompidou at his press conference on the 2nd July.  The question of the financial obligations to be assumed by Britain on joining the EEC is, no doubt, one of the major matters which will arise in the British negotiations but, as the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate on the possible outcome of their negotiations on this question.

      <P>While it is not possible at this time to say how the treatment of this country under the tax measures relating to the taxation of US investment abroad might possibly be affected by our membership of the EEC, it is reasonable to expect, as the White Paper on the implications of membership of the EEC concludes, that membership will considerably enhance the attractions of Ireland as a base for new foreign industrial investment.</P>

      <P>There is no reason why <Col N="2406" /> Ireland's membership of the GATT should have any effect on our application for EEC membership.  The EEC is a customs union and, as such, the preferential trading arrangements as between its member States are in conformity with the rules of the GATT.

The Commission will, in addition, ensure the supply of constant and detailed information to the applicants on the progress of the negotiations.

      <P>The determination of the need for new rail services is, under statute, the responsibility of CIE. CIE are fully conscious of the need to ensure that rail services in the Dublin area are utilised as effectively as possible with a view to making the maximum contribution to the relief of road congestion in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that surveys were carried out by the board last year to determine the feasibility of extending commuter services to the Ballyfermot area and also the potential for commuter services on the main railway line between Dublin and Naas but it was found that, because of the low potential demand, extension of commuter services would not be warranted. CIE have recently engaged consultants, however, to study the suburban railways in the Dublin area with a view to determining their existing capacity and the future capacity for different levels of investment.  I am informed by the board that the practicability of rail commuter services for the south western area of Dublin will be covered in the consultants' examination.</P>
      <P>With regard to freight transport, CIE have informed me that the provision of railway sidings to the industrial estates in the area is not a feasible proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy at the outset that the basic statutory conditions for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are fundamentally different from those for disability benefit and that the proper administration of the unemployment and disability schemes calls for radically different procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attendance at a local office or signing centre at specified intervals during working hours to prove their unemployment constitutes, in the case of persons drawing unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, a most <Col N="2411" /> important administrative check towards ensuring that these payments are made only to genuinely unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the course suggested by the Deputy in the first part of his question, which would dispense with this essential requirement, would be inconsistent with the proper administration of these schemes and could only give rise to widespread abuse which it would be impossible to control.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that existing local office facilities for proving unemployment and obtaining payment in the Dublin area are adequate for present needs and that they do not impose undue hardship on claimants.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will comment on the fact that employers in Ireland as a source of financing of social security contribute 16 per cent whereas in Belgium the percentage contribution is 48 per cent, in France 65 per cent, Germany 37 per cent, Italy 63 per cent, Netherlands 39 per cent and the United Kingdom 27 per cent; and if it is his intention to revise the strategy of our sources of social security finance to bring the percentage for Ireland up to the European average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish figure quoted is not comparable with the Continental ones for a number of reasons.  The Continental social security schemes are financed to a much greater extent than here on the insurance or contributory principle, whereas in this country there is a large non-insurable sector of the population, and a high proportion of social security expenditure is on social assistance schemes which are non-contributory.  Examples of schemes within the social security field which do not operate on the contributory principle here are children's allowances and the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are appreciable differences between the social security schemes in operation in the countries mentioned, I am aware that generally in those countries employers and employees <Col N="2412" /> meet a larger proportion of the cost of social security than in Ireland. However, entry into the EEC does not necessarily involve any change in the established method of financing our social security system, whereby the cost of the insurance schemes is shared on the basis of approximately one-third each by employers, employees and the State, and the cost of the assistance schemes is met almost entirely by the State.  I do not at present propose to alter these arrangements.</P>
    <P>It could hardly be contended that the figures quoted by the Deputy for the countries other than Ireland indicate a close relationship, much less a European &ldquo;norm&rdquo;.  It does not seem to me that there is any logical reason why we, more than any other country, should feel obliged to conform to any &ldquo;average&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2413" /> The basic weekly pay of adult male general workers in Cement Ltd. was £14 4s.</P>
    <P>The company had offered to increase the basic pay by £2 a week from the 1st January, 1970 with a further 10s a week from the 1st September, 1970; a total of £2 10s.  This offer, which was higher than the percentage figure mentioned in the question, was rejected by the workers.</P>
    <P>The subsequent Labour Court recommendation proposed an increase of £2 10s a week from the 1st January, 1970 with a further £1 a week from the 1st June, 1970.  This was rejected by the workers.</P>
    <P>The final settlement provided for the payment of the Labour Court's recommended figure of £3 10s, the new rates to operate for time worked from the 1st January, 1970.  The settlement also provided for an existing service pay scheme to be replaced by an incremental wage scale, progressing from the new basic rate of £17 14s up to £21 12s 6d over 15 years.  The price of cement has recently been increased by 15s per ton plus 1s 8d (average) on freight costs.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation outlined in the first part of the Deputies' question.</P>
      <P>This matter was the subject of a conciliation conference and then of a Labour Court investigation and the court recommended that the worker originally dismissed should be reinstated, as well as all the other workers, on his giving an assurance of satisfactory performance for the future.</P>
      <P>Labour Court recommendations are not binding on the parties.  The Deputies are, no doubt, aware that various suggestions for modifying this position have been put forward from time to time but did not meet with support, especially from trade unions.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government made arrangements with the banks for advancing, free of interest, to exporters the amounts of the deposits required under the British scheme so that the scheme had little, if any, impact on our exports.  Its termination will not, therefore, materially affect our trade.  The saving to the Exchequer in the current year will be negligible as the provision made for payment of interest assumed a phasing out of the scheme towards the end of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure for obtaining consent to the sub-division of holdings for the provision of building sites is quite straightforward and applications are dealt with promptly. However, the Land Commission have, for some time, been examining the feasibility of further simplifying the system.  It is not only the granting of consent which is involved&mdash;the apportionment of annuity and possible redemption of part also fall to be arranged&mdash;and the Land Commission have to be approached on that anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that a general consent has already been granted to local authorities in respect <Col N="2420" /> of plots required for their statutory purposes.  All that is required under this simplified arrangement is a letter from the local authority notifying the Land Commission of the sub-division. A simple formula enables the authority concerned to apportion the annuity and arrangements are then made for redemption of the part placed on the lands being transferred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 45 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1962, land settlement policy has been that holdings and enlargements are planned to provide family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of mixed quality.  All applicants with holdings below that level, including any which may previously have been enlarged, are eligible for consideration for additional land.</P>
      <P>Just now the whole question of the future policy of the Land Commission, and land policy in general, is under active consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>Pending a decision on the various issues being examined, I think it would be premature to comment further on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply.  Apparently some of the officials in the Land Commissionl seem to have taken the Minister's words, with which I agree, as being the new policy of the Land Commission. In addition, some of the officials have stated that people who have already got Land Commission holdings are not eligible.  Will the Minister ensure that everybody working in that capacity at the Land Commission is aware of the actual policy?  I know the Minister has given me a reply but perhaps he would do this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only add that no directive has been issued to the Land Commission in this regard so that existing policy, which has been in operation since 1962, is continued in operation.  The question of what changes will be made in policy is under active consideration at the moment. There is no reason why estates being divided at the present time should not <Col N="2422" /> be divided in accordance with existing policy.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued on my behalf in relation to this matter and which appeared in the public press on the 24th of this month.  With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to have a copy of that statement circulated with the Official Report.  I feel that I should avail myself of this opportunity to repeat the hope that the proposals which I am implementing will be seen by all teachers as a realistic effort to reconcile conflicting points of view and to produce an equitable solution to a very complex problem.</P>
      <P>In saying that I would like to address an appeal to the ASTI.  I am a teacher by profession.  I am also the Minister who has the overall responsibility for education.  In both capacities I am most anxious to foster harmonious relations with every branch of the teaching profession.  There have been misunderstandings and perhaps recriminations but we have no reason to doubt one another's <i>bona fides.</i>  We can rise above what has happened in the past.  I extend the hand of understanding to the secondary teachers.  I ask them to reciprocate through agreeing to reconsider their decision in relation to the marking of the examinations in so far as it extends to the intermediate certificate. I am asking the Secretary of my Department to convey this appeal to the President of the ASTI.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement referred to, issued by the Government Information Bureau on behalf of the Minister for Education:</P>
      <P>In reply to a number of inquiries relating to the statement made by the ASTI in regard to teachers' salaries the Minister for Education wishes to place the following facts on record:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  A secondary teacher who prior to the findings of the Ryan Tribunal, had a maximum salary of £1,852 which included £200 paid by the school which was <Col N="2424" /> non-pensionable has now the following total emoluments:</P>

          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>
    <P>Accordingly such a teacher is now in receipt of £2,333 per annum, an increase of £481, which on the basis of pensionability equals £511.</P>
    <P>(2)  The teachers whose special functions allowances are spoken of as being frozen will have posts of responsibility available to them.</P>
    <P>(3)  Provisions in the matter of qualifications allowances for non-graduate teachers were included in the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>(4)  The arrangements in relation to posts as Principal, Vice-Principal and other posts of responsibility remain to be worked out between the School Managers, the ASTI and the Department There is no reason to anticipate that the arrangements when worked out will not be equitable as far as the members of the ASTI are concerned.</P>
    <P>The above statement is being issued merely for clarification purposes. It is the Minister's hope that the proposals which he is now implementing will be seen by all teachers as a realistic effort to reconcile conflicting points of view and to produce an equitable solution to a very complex problem.  The degree of general acceptance of the proposals which has been forthcoming encourages the Minister in giving expression to this hope.</P>
    <P>It might be added that the figures of salaries and allowances given in this statement are exclusive of the 12th round increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Minister during the summer months <Col N="2425" /> to continue to implement the new proposals in relation to salaries and conditions of employment for secondary teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I might also add that the basic concern of all of us is with the children and their education. Every action I have taken since assuming office has been based on this concern. I recognise the need for harmony in the teaching profession in order that children will gain the maximum benefit from our educational system.  All my energies have been directed to this objective.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies now recognise the difficulties and complexities of this problem&mdash;in fact, it was regarded by many as incapable of solution because of the manner in which the claims of one organisation were irreconcilable with those of another or with those of the other two teaching bodies.  I held numerous meetings and I got the best professional advice all to no avail. Finally, I was forced to the conclusion that I must prepare and implement proposals myself, taking full cognisance of the claims of the various teaching bodies.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, I presented these proposals to the teachers and the public reaction, as expressed in the press and elsewhere, was favourable. They recognised that I had made a realistic attempt to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>It would have been unrealistic to have expected open enthusiasm from any one group of teachers.  Each had to concede something in the interests of establishing a middle road.  The playback I got from many sources relative to the attitude of teachers in general was good.  The statements from the VTA and the INTO to me represent a cautious acceptance.  To me, the ASTI statement means that the Standing Committee is leaving it to its members to decide the issue and, while not recommending the proposals, they have not rejected them.  I think I can say that at the present moment we are all much closer to one another than we have been at any time in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to have harmony between the teaching bodies <Col N="2426" /> and my Department, not because it would make life easier for me&mdash;in modern times, no Minister for Education could hope to have an easy time&mdash; but because I am anxious for close co-operation between my Department and the teachers in the interests of the children. The teachers have a wide fund of experience and expertise which is invaluable in the formulation of policy. I should like to tap this.  I am convinced that I cannot effectively do this unless there is goodwill in the various organisations not only towards me but towards one another as well.  I would ask them to think along these lines and to try to adopt a more positive attitude in the future towards coming to better terms with one another.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the executives and to the individual teachers to take another look at my proposals; to accept them with whatever reservations they may wish; to let us get together to tidy up whatever things can be tidied up in the particular circumstances and to go forward towards the achievement of what I believe is the desire of all of them, namely, the perfecting of our educational system in the interests of future generations.</P>

      <P>Arising from the very full statement by the Minister and respecting his appeal to the various teachers' organisations, would he not think he could use his influence with one of these organisations to prevail upon them to eliminate unwanted, unhelpful and unnecessary statements? Feelings are sometimes aroused by one body making comments on another body or bodies.  While I agree with the Minister's attempt to bring about harmony, surely he must understand that feelings are very often aroused by such statements?  Would the Minister use his influence so that such statements will stop?</P>

      <P>I have referred to all the teaching bodies.  I have asked them to try to adopt a more positive attitude towards promoting better feelings between them.  During the past year there were many occasions when statements of every description were flying around my head and I felt an almost irresistable urge to reply.  Perhaps if I <Col N="2427" /> had replied I would have got some personal satisfaction from it.  On reflection, I was convinced that this was not the way to deal with the matter.  I am concerned not with getting any personal satisfaction from it but rather with achieving peace between the various teaching bodies and with the Department.</P>

The high level of Exchequer support for milk, which is now at the rate of more than £30 million per annum or over half of the entire return to creamery suppliers for their milk, is positive evidence of the Government's interest in the welfare of dairy farmers and the development of the dairying industry.</P>

The passengers are, the car is, what they hit is but the drivers themselves are not covered.  Is the Minister further aware that where commercial companies give the use of cars with full comprehensive insurance to employees there is no insurance cover for the drivers personally?

As regards attendance at courses in the State, arrangements are being made which will provide that a married non-commissioned officer or private separated from his family while attending any such course will no longer suffer any deduction from his total remuneration even though he is fed and accommodated at the public expense during the course.  The position of married officers in this respect is at present under examination.</P>

Increases in Defence Forces pensions of the nature to which the questions relate are a matter for the Minister for Finance in the context of public service pensions generally.  I would remind the Deputies that, in this year's Budget statement, the Minister for Finance announced that the pensions of public servants who retired before the 1st June, 1968, would be brought up to the level operative on that date with effect from the 1st August, 1970.

The amount allocated was £70,000, which was considered to be sufficient, but £10,000 of that is for the Ballymun housing scheme and £5,000 for the protection of derelict quarries where a danger to life exists. This means that £55,000 is available for the main purpose of the scheme and, of that, £25,000 was already spent in the first three months of the year.

      <P>There is a section in my Department, part of whose duty it is to arrange for the production, acquisition and distribution of road safety films.  Facilities exist for the showing of road safety films in some schools, particularly secondary schools, and my Department's films are readily available to such schools on request, either directly from the Department or through the National Film Institute of Ireland.  Moreover, the road safety officers of the Safety First Association of Ireland give film shows to school children during the course of their regular visits to schools. Ways and means to increase the showing of films in schools are being explored. I might add that children are also reached through the showing of such films on television and that arrangements exist, with the co-operation of cinema managements and film distributors, for the showing of films suitable for children in cinemas throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether planning permission is required (a) to reclaim land from the sea, (b) to develop or build on land so reclaimed and (c) by Dublin Port and Docks Board in respect of any building works by that Board on its property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that reclamation of land from the sea constitutes development within the meaning of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Planning permission for such work is accordingly required from the planning authority within whose jurisdiction the land lies, unless the work is specifically exempted by the provisions of the Act or the exempted development regulations.</P>
      <P>The erection of buildings or the carrying out of other development on reclaimed land requires planning permission unless there is a specific exemption of the type referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an exemption for the carrying out by a harbour authority of development such as the construction of docks, quays, wharves, jetties, piers, embankments and breakwaters, where such works are authorised by a harbour works order made by the Minister for Transport and Power under section 134 of the Harbour Acts, 1946.  There is, however, no exemption from planning control for the construction by a harbour authority of new buildings <Col N="2468" /> such as sheds, transit sheds, transhipment sheds, silos or stores, even though such buildings may be authorised by a harbour works order. Neither is there exemption for the erection of factories or other major structures by any other developer.</P>
    <P>As explained in a reply to a question by Deputy Moore on 17th July, 1969, there is some doubt as to the applicability of the 1963 Act to certain areas in the Dublin port.  The Port and Docks Board contend that reclaimed areas are not within the jurisdictional area of the city but in May, 1969, they gave an assurance to the Minister for Transport and Power that they would not again seek to evade planning control on these grounds.  I am informed that planning permission has accordingly been obtained for buildings erected in the area since that date.  The question of removing any doubts regarding the boundary would in the normal way be a matter for consideration in connection with the next general Local Government Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that further legislation to deal with this matter is required.  Planning authorities have very wide powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to create new public rights of way, by agreement or compulsorily, and these powers can be invoked in any case where it appears to be desirable to provide a public right of way to a beach over private lands.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time, I was making the point that better technological skill was called for in industry.  I believe that part of the answer to this problem would be better vocational schools and more and better-equipped technological colleges. This would, in general, I believe, call for a more comprehensive vocational system.  If we are to have better schools and better finishing colleges, it must be seen that we shall continue to make these centres available for our youth.  Having regard to trends in Britain and on the Continent, if we do not recognise this factor in time, and try to take advantage of it, we shall lag behind in this branch of education and training.  It is very important at this stage in our industrial drive to emphasise this point.

At this stage, one may welcome the move between the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Minister for Finance on the proposed pay increases for the future covering, I think it was said, 140,000 State employees. We should give the proposition every encouragement.  If it is adopted, it will bring some order into the system of pay claims in general. The report also said that the proposal would provide for all grades in the Civil Service as well as for all employees of local authorities and would extend to the Office of Public Works and to the Department of Lands to cover forestry workers.  This is a step in the right direction.  It is calculated to kill confusion, to recreate order and to create a uniform pattern of pay claims in general.</P>
      <P>It could also be argued that this system would make for pay increases in real terms&mdash;I referred to this earlier &mdash;rather than just a paper arrangement. Any move calculated to bring back an orderly pattern into adjustments in wages and salaries is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Another feature which I appreciate and which was mentioned in last Monday's daily papers is that the President of ICTU is reported as having made it clear that real wages are the aim of the trade union movement: he was referring to this matter in specific terms.  Let me quote from the report which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, 27th July, 1970:</P>
      <P>Referring to the resolution adopted by the recent Annual Delegate Conference of Congress which recognised that indiscriminate wage claims would be detrimental to the interests of the workers generally and calling for an approach to wage demands that would ensure a fairer share for all sections, particularly the lower paid, Mr. Maurice Cosgrave said that this must be done but could only be done by unity of approach among trade unionists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President of Congress also stated, <Col N="2485" /> in this context, and I quote again very briefly because it is relevant to this matter of the value of money, the fancy name for which, I suppose, is &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;, and it is relevant in our circumstances here:</P>
    <P>Apart from transfers of income, Mr. Maurice Cosgrave said, and other measures, the standard of living of the vast army of underprivileged and underpaid could only be raised to an acceptable level if trade unionists made a concerted effort to increase productivity in the industries and services that employed them.</P>
    <P>He said that this means not only improvements in work organisation but also in management methods and marketing, and a far greater awareness of the place of science and technology in their application to the small firm or the traditional industry as well as to the large concern which takes these factors of increased productivity as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>A moment ago I was referring to the training of our potential workers. It is borne out by those who are close to this whole problem that, in future, we must pay serious attention to their training and to the degree of skill which our young workers in particular must acquire if we are to maintain our hold on the markets we are in at the moment.</P>
    <P>As well as trying to cover the dark side of the picture in a few points I said earlier that we had something going for us.  In a press cutting it is recorded that we have this much going for us: that despite the British Government's preoccupation with their balance of payments last year and the corrective measures which the British took to right that balance, including the imposition of levies which, in turn, called for a deposit from our exporters and, also, despite the fact that total imports into the British market increased in 1969 by 2 per cent only in terms of volume compared with an average of 17 per cent for imports in the EEC countries in general, we did very well to hold our share of the British market.</P>
    <P>Taking the quantity of goods at the 1968 level we did very well.  We should have done better but for the unrest in <Col N="2486" /> industrial circles and, I suppose, the unrest elsewhere.  We have something further going for us.  I refer to the trend in diversification of exports.  A statement by the chairman of Córas Tráchtála shows that we are exporting a considerable volume of goods to markets other than Britain.  Bear in mind the fact that those are industrial goods.  This, in turn, is a welcome trend. It has the effect of reducing our dependence on the British market.  The evidence of this is also available from the figures recorded in the journal issued by Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>We exported £250.7 million worth of goods to Britain and the North last year.  We have a further statement from the chairman indicating that of the £40 million increase in total exports over 1968, two-thirds were accounted for by sales to other markets, mainly America and the countries within the EEC.  He is also recorded as saying that, while the total increase represented a rise of 11 per cent over 1968, in real terms our overall export growth for 1969 was only 5 per cent taking into account a rise in export prices of 6 per cent.  In every sentence one finds this question of industrial unrest sticking out like a sore thumb.  We can see at a glance that, even though there was an increase of 11 per cent in exports over 1968, we still lost out by 6 per cent because our goods were priced at 6 per cent dearer.</P>
    <P>All of us here, no matter what constituency we represent, would like to see industry starting in our constituencies. We should like to see more jobs, better housing and a higher standard of living being provided.  We cannot hope to achieve this aim in the way in which we have been carrying on for the past few years.  First of all, this is not fair to ourselves, if you like to put it that way.  It certainly is not fair to the people on the lowest rung of the ladder, those in the social welfare range.  It is not fair to the thousands of small producers who are not hitched up to any pressure group and who cannot call for increased pay but who have to work very hard to maintain their standards while all this is occurring.</P>
    <P>I was glad also to gather from the Córas Tráchtala report that the prospects <Col N="2487" /> for this coming year are still bright and that on outside markets there is still a good demand&mdash;and it will continue&mdash;for beef and beef products, for mutton and lamb products as well as pigmeat and frozen fish.  I do not know how we shall fare with frozen fish but if we are able to take advantage of the range of meat exports we should do pretty well in outside markets.</P>
    <P>Finally, in spite of the clamour and confusion and the industrial unrest and the unrest in the North, I have a cutting from a newspaper recording a request last year from the London Chamber of Commerce to the British Government to be allowed free export of capital to Ireland.  This is another example of the confidence in the Government and in the Irish economy. Therefore, this confidence is not diminished or weakened by recent events and it is up to us to see that it will not be weakened in the future. None of us would willingly harm the national effort.  Rather, if I know human qualities, I think every Member of the House would like to see not only an industrial advance but an advance also on the agricultural side. Being in public life, it falls to us to make known the facts that overindulgence in the matter of living standards at a premature or transitional stage can injure our economy and result not in an advance but in retarding efforts to build up exports generally.  All of us should try to make this known outside and try to prevail on people, whether they are members of unions or of other groups, to cool down their demands for more money if that money is not met by production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments on the Taoiseach's opening speech must necessarily be brief because there is not much in the Taoiseach's contribution with which one could vehemently disagree. The conventional wisdom he gave the House was of such a generally acceptable nature in regard to inflation, industrial relations and the situation in Northern Ireland that, apart from arousing the concern of Members of the House, we cannot <Col N="2488" /> dramatically differ from the Taoiseach in many respects as we go into Recess.</P>
      <P>There are some aspects, however, where we can legitimately and appropriately point out to the Government that the situation facing the economy generally is very serious and in many ways much more serious than perhaps the Taoiseach in his speech was prepared to admit.  We have rampant inflation at the moment, largely through the abject failure of the Irish community and the Government and associated sectors to evolve any effective prices and incomes policy.  Added to that, is the bank strike which now regrettably looks like continuing and seems likely to add further during the summer months to economic and social dislocation.  When one couples that with the current situation of inflation, the uncertainties coming into the autumn could be quite dramatic.  I do not want to sound hysterical about the situation but I consider it to be perhaps the most serious we have had in the past decade.  That is sufficient to give us more than adequate warning about the need for better and more effective management of the economy in the seventies.</P>
      <P>In coming to make a contribution of this kind I find that the House has virtually closed down for 1970.  It is rather amazing that Dáil Éireann should now adjourn and not reassemble until 28th October and then, for the short seven weeks remaining of 1970 this House, the National Parliament, will concern itself with the country's affairs.  By any measurement of the effectiveness of parliamentary democracy this is a rather peculiar situation and one that is to be deplored.  I intend to stress this at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The considerable imbalance that has now developed on the wages and prices front is, perhaps, the most economically damaging thing that began in the late 1960s and has been gradually building up.  We are facing an extremely critical situation and I am not certain that an autumn budget or a budget next spring or any other form of palliative which the Government might introduce would necessarily restore equilibrium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who has been and still is <Col N="2489" /> closely associated with the trade union movement it would be intellectually dishonest not to admit the important role and deep involvement of the wage situation in our current economic imbalance. There are many other forms of income, such as farm incomes, profits and dividends and so on but we must appreciate that wages are by far the most important element in national income and as such they exert tremendous influence on production costs, on prices and on national expenditure. That figure has not changed very much over the years.  In 1960 wages constituted about 50 per cent of the national income.  Today they constitute about 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it must be brought home to the trade union movement, to the Government, to everyone in the nation that while we can get from the slot machine of industrial negotiations between trade unions and employers wage increases and as a result a real increase in the workers' standard of living&mdash;admittedly there has been a substantial increase in the standard of living in the 1960s and it would be dishonest not to place this on record&mdash;we cannot obtain substantial increases without spending the next two years chasing our tails, chasing prices and trying to get back the lost value of money arising from these increases.</P>
    <P>This is where the absence of any form of price surveillance comes in.  I do not profess to be a lover of price control as such, but the absence of price supervision over selected commodities has resulted in rising expectations chasing rising wage increases resulting in a wiping out of the standard of living of those who obtain the wage increases.  Therefore, a strong case could be made for an incomes policy concerned with the distribution not merely of wage and salary incomes but of professional earnings, rents, profits and capital gains.  The incomes of farmers do not matter in this regard. Farmers' incomes are determined largely by increased production and the export prices they obtain, together with a limited subvention from the tax-payer, which, of course, can be controlled.</P>
    <P>We have obtained responsible and <Col N="2490" /> detailed guidelines&mdash;which we could not possibly go into in this House&mdash; from the National Industrial Economic Council.  I do not think it is to the credit of the Government or to the credit of either former Ministers for Finance or the present Minister or to the credit of the House as a whole that we have failed to make any attempt to implement the sound advice given to us by the NIEC in respect of an effective prices and incomes policy.</P>
    <P>Such a policy has had a very dubious background in this country, a policy which many workers regarded as being put forward by Government spokesmen as a means of freezing incomes or reducing wage and salary increases while, at the same time, carefully avoiding any effective limitation of other incomes.  It is no solution to tell industrial workers that their wages and salaries constitute 60 per cent of the national income, that they have the most important impact on prices.  This has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> to trade unionists.  Indeed, the Tánaiste has not forsaken any opportunity of pointing that fact of life out to them.  Workers cannot get away from the overall impression that an incomes policy is merely a wages policy.  To date, the Government have not given any positive indication that they will take legislative and administrative measures that will result in a genuine incomes policy operating in the most effective and acceptable sense.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was quite correct in emphasising the need for such a policy. The tragedy has been that right through the first half of 1970, instead of this House being usefully engaged in discussing the various measures to bring such a policy into effective operation, the whole political scene was dominated by the rivalry and ambitions of various politicians.  It seems to be the age-old problem in Irish politics that it is dominated more by the political attitudes of rival politicians than by the realistic and objective implementation of policies.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Government and to anyone attempting to be objective about this matter, it must be said that the problems relating to an incomes policy are extremely complex and it is <Col N="2491" /> unlikely that any arrangement could be devised which would make for overall equitable adjustment of incomes in accordance with pre-determined criteria.  That is why the Taoiseach's concept of a 7 per cent increase blew up.  One cannot put down on a sheet of paper three or four lines of economic criteria in relation to wages and salaries and other incomes in the State and hope that automatically a pattern will evolve and everything will fall into line.</P>
    <P>The strong criticism of the governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Whitaker&mdash;a criticism which was as much against the Government's policy as against the inflationary trend in the country&mdash;was well and truly merited.  The single greatest defect in the whole structure at present is the complete absence of any form of central discussion on problems among the interested parties at stated regular intervals, particularly in the general manufacturing and distributive spheres of the economy.  One must put on record to the credit of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, that by his attempts he successfully brought about general agreement in the public services.  This has been a basic approach to an incomes policy by arriving at central agreement for a sector of the economy but there has been the completely pragmatic and opportunistic approach in the other areas.  I certainly hope to see centralised general discussions taking place.  I would hope under the auspices and with the advice and guidance of the NIEC to see such discussions taking place between interested parties and I would hope to see that process developed.  I have no doubt that in time this will happen and, whatever negative impression may have arisen from the recent annual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, that there will be a more positive front and a more forthcoming approach to an incomes policy.  I was not at that conference but it did not appear to me to have developed as constructively as it might have done and as it should have done on that occasion.</P>
    <P>This is all cold comfort for many trade unionists who are currently facing <Col N="2492" /> the spiralling of prices.  I would point out to the House that the rise in prices has been as much the result of taxation policy by the Government as of the impact of wages on prices.  This is a double-barrelled development.  The Taoiseach's speech yesterday seemed to be a speech which he would have liked to deliver when he read the Budget speech this year.  I know the Taoiseach had many other things on his mind when he was reading the last Budget speech but there is a marked difference between his contribution yesterday and the contribution which may have been prepared by Deputy Haughey when he was, perhaps, in a more exuberant mood coming up to the last Budget. There is a world of difference in tone, in attitude and in approach.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms which can be legitimately placed at the door of the Government is a kind of non-policy, a kind of wishful thinking in relation to inflation, a kind of non-action.  Indeed, in regard to the propositions contained in the Central Bank report and in Dr. Whitaker's report I got the distinct impression from the Taoiseach's speech that he was merely toying with them, that he had not given them consideration in depth.  He certainly did not seem to be anxious to implement them as quickly as possible.  On that basis again I thought it was a speech for the occasion rather than a speech for action which is what we would want from him on an urgent and vital matter such as inflation.</P>
    <P>One must be critical also of the work done by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley. Frankly and brutally, I do not expect very much from Deputy Lalor anyway in respect of price control and the system of price surveillance.  Deputy Colley was notably sluggish and lax except when a number of companies got under his skin.  When he had a row with Gouldings Fertilisers he certainly woke up but in respect of a number of major issues that developed during his ministry he failed to operate an effective system of price surveillance under the Prices Stabilisation Order, 1965.  That order has been in existence for a solid five years.  It came into effect on 7th October, 1965 and there have <Col N="2493" /> been five years of inactivity on that front within the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I in no way hold the officials of the Department responsible. I simply state that there is an undying belief on the part of Deputy Colley and now inherited by Deputy Lalor that nothing can be done in the field of price investigation, in the matter of asking companies what criteria they use when putting up prices.</P>
    <P>One must note the abject, apologetic and inconsequential statement made this afternoon, for example, by Deputy Lalor, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in a reply relating to the rising and rocketing of insurance charges.  The rate of premium charged by insurance companies is a factor in price increases and one can point out that he has done nothing, that he obviously has no intention of doing anything and that the insurance companies have been allowed to jack up insurance charges.  These are charges on industry and on private citizens. That is only one example.  There is a long litany of commodities in respect of which no attempt has been made by the Department to induce into the public consciousness that if we are to have stabilisation of wages and a slowing down in the rate of money incomes as a direct <i>quid pro quo</i> by the Government there will be a determined effort made by the Government to hold back the level of price increases. As is well known, this is an extremely difficult policy to implement but, nevertheless, one must be seen to be attempting to implement it.  This is where there has been a profound loss of confidence on the part of the people in the Government.  That is why I strongly believe that while, undoubtedly, we will not have a general election now it would be in the best interests of the country and a much-needed hygienic exercise on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party if there was a change of government in this country in the near future. Such change of Government would at least give the Opposition an opportunity to introduce alternative policies or at least exercise their energies because we are going off into a kind of summer lethargy and not meeting again until October.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2494" /> Therefore one can sum up this aspect of the Taoiseach's speech by saying that the principles outlined by the NIEC do not appear to have been considered by the Cabinet.  I would see these principles as being threefold.  An attempt must be made by the Government to ensure that increases in total money incomes are related to increases in national production.  To get that principle across to people and understood by the 715,000 insured workers, by the farming community, by the employers and by those involved in the formation of policy is extremely difficult and at times almost impossible. However, this has not been attempted by the Government in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is then the second principle advocated by the NIEC and the Government have failed in this regard also.  It is a general principle that if some groups in the economy get a percentage increase higher than the general increase which is warranted by the economy other groups must accept a lower percentage increase in their incomes and in their living standards. This again is extremely difficult to get across because we live in a highly-individualistic age, in an age whose concern is with the permissiveness of the individual rather than for groups in society.  This is epitomised by the Taoiseach and by the Tánaiste when they talk about the sectional interests of certain groups.  I do not see any conscious attempt being made by the Government to point out to individual groups that if some get increases which are vastly higher than others, automatically, others must accept lower increases.</P>
    <P>I recall, with a trace of bitterness because there was a great deal of hope then, when in 1969 the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, announced, genuinely I think, that he hoped to make that year the year of the low paid worker.  However, that evaporated very rapidly and the Government simply threw up their hands in despair and were not prepared to undertake anything on the lines of an incomes policy.  Therefore these two principles are being ignored by the Government and they can stand indicted by this House in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2495" /> Equally there has been little effort made to stress the need for long-term wage agreements.  With inflationary tendencies everybody wants the shortest possible agreement so that there is an in-built insurance policy that if prices rise during the period they will catch up with them in a couple of months anyway.  The early tendency to evolve a system of long-term agreements had within it a great measure of stability in wage costs and on a voluntary basis it imposed settled conditions of employment which, looking back over some of the agreements we have had of up to two years and over, reduced the incidence of strikes in industry.  It was a tragedy that the Government did not ensure that many more such long-term agreements would operate.</P>
    <P>This would also get rid of the great air of uncertainty which exists coming up to the expiration of agreements, uncertainty in regard to industrial costs on the part of company managers in relation to orders for imported materials, and so on, and if one is to go through this exercise every 12 or 15 months it leads to an extremely unsettled and uncertain situation.  That is why I strongly favour the introduction of long-term agreements.  There is an urgent need for them.  Equally the Government should advocate the introduction of many more productivity wage agreements as a constructive step towards overcoming inflationary tendencies.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is rather difficult to have a 25 per cent increase and then start talking about a productivity agreement in the hope of recovering the full 25 per cent, but if workers are to enjoy rising living standards and lower prices such agreements could make a very effective contribution towards that end.  There is a need for this type of agreement particularly in manufacturing industry where the effective utilisation of costly capital equipment is one of the major criteria in combating inflation, and a definite need for the more effective use of manpower. This type of bargaining has to be initiated by management because only management can outline what they want from a productivity agreement. <Col N="2496" /> This kind of agreement for a more effective use of capital equipment and of manpower if it were to become a facet of our industrial life could reduce overall unit labour costs in our economy.</P>
    <P>As the Central Bank report pointed out, the relative competitiveness of our exports is rapidly diminishing and, as we are aware, 30 out of every 100 workers are directly engaged in export industries and if these exports suffer from inflation we will have massive unemployment.  It is to the credit of industrial workers and management that we have one of the highest ratios of manufacturing workers engaged in the export sector.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the need for more productivity agreements and wage agreements of longer duration and, if coupled with those, there is the prices and incomes criteria advocated by the NIEC, as far as I am concerned, some stability can be brought about.  I do not think it is any solution for the Taoiseach to imply that he may consider introducing a wage pause or a wage freeze.  That just will not work. We all know that.  If employers and trade unions are determined enough to get around anything like that, they will get around it.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial relations, I have not the slightest conception of how the Government could operate a compulsory system, a system which has failed lamentably in Europe, east and west.  The Taoiseach knows that the implied assumption of mandatory powers is just not on.  I support him in his plea to Members of this House and to Government Ministers to keep their hands off industrial disputes.  The trade unions or the Labour Party cannot, on the one hand, demand ministerial intervention in industrial disputes in order to settle them and, on the other hand, demand that the Government mind their own business in respect of industrial relations legislation generally. We cannot have it both ways.  I agree with the Taoiseach that Government Ministers, especially the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance, should not personally be directly involved in industrial disputes.  That is <Col N="2497" /> not to say that it is outside the ability and the responsibility of any Government Minister to express an opinion about the effects of an industrial dispute.</P>
    <P>In the case of the current bank dispute and the cement dispute there devolved on the Government the obligation to make known publicly their views on the effects these disputes were having without in any way trying to influence the actual terms of settlement. One of the most noticeable gaps in industrial relations at the moment is the absence of any ability on the part of those involved to negotiate effectively. I do not know what has brought about the present peculiar climate, but one gets the impression that the parties are not prepared to do for themselves that which they should do, namely, negotiate in an effort to arrive at a solution.  If no solution is reached both sides are absolutely free to take whatever action they think necessary.</P>
    <P>I often get the impression that parties in disputes have only the vaguest idea as to what the dispute is about. They go on strike and automatically a new attitude develops: &ldquo;Let us see who will starve first.&rdquo;  We cannot do anything about disputes until the parties understand what the dispute is about.  This may sound trite and naïve, but this is what has happened in a number of disputes.  One need not search very far to find out why some disputes have lasted so long.  To those who appeal to Government Ministers to intervene my answer is that the Government cannot do for employers and workers that which they should do for themselves: negotiate round a table and settle their differences.  There has been an absence of negotiation and an utter preoccupation at times with the personalities of the negotiators rather than the actual issues dividing the parties.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government to introduce legislation designed to prevent disputes occurring. I asked the Minister for Finance yesterday if, in the public interest, he would appoint to the boards of the commercial banks a nominee or representative of the Department of Finance. The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy <Col N="2498" /> Michael O'Kennedy, waxed eloquent about the position in Sweden.  He forgot that the social, economic and political climate there is vastly different from what it is here.  Each commercial bank has in it a nominee of the Government and, if things are going wrong, the Government are aware of what is going on.  We could with advantage adopt that system here.  Whether the representative would or would not have a vote is immaterial.  He would act as a watchdog on the activities of the commercial banks.  The Minister for Finance did not hold out any hope of a change of this nature.  There should also be representatives of the staffs. Whether they would have votes is immaterial.  Within our banking system there is a loss of confidence, a great deal of bitterness and a feeling of frustration on the part of the employees in their relationship with what is now the most anonymous banking group in the world.  There have been some tremendous changes in the personnel in the banking service.  These changes have had a traumatic impact and the measure I have suggested is only one method by which to restore some element of joint consultation between the parties.</P>
    <P>I support the attitude of the Taoiseach that the Government should not intervene in industrial disputes because it is not their basic function.  The Labour Court is available with the necessary machinery for the settlement of such disputes.  Equally, I agree with the Taoiseach that it is undesirable, and no credit either to employers, workers or indeed the Department of Labour, that some of our industrial disputes have lasted an inordinately long time without any attempt being made to bring about settlements.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of parliamentary reform.  I understand that at the end of the year one is supposed to ruminate on the workings of Dáil Éireann.  I am a newcomer to this House but, as I have made frequent contributions to debates, I consider I should place on record my attitude in regard to Parliamentary reform.  I would add that one of the most frustrating experiences for a newcomer to this House is the general tacit acceptance <Col N="2499" /> in all political parties of the set-up here.  I do not know what precisely is in the minds of the 16 farmer Deputies of Fianna Fáil in relation to their attitude and contributions towards the effective working of this House. Neither do I know what is the attitude of the 21 farmers in Fine Gael to this matter, although Deputy Donegan perhaps would enlighten me on this later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>And, I might add, extremely competent and effective.  I do not know the attitude of the few farmer Deputies in the Labour Party on this matter.  We have about 18 lawyers in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and a plethora of shopkeepers, publicans, auctioneers and agents in the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  In addition, we have other individuals in the three political parties who regularly attend the House.</P>
      <P>It is about time Members of this House became aware of the disenchantment and disillusionment felt by young people in regard to Dáil Éireann.  If we are to consider granting votes at 18 years we had better reform Dáil Éireann; otherwise the exercise will prove rather fruitless and will not generate further respect among the young electors.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that there have been marginal attendances even for the most important debates.  For example, when the Taoiseach spoke yesterday in what might be called a major national contribution dealing with important issues such as inflation, industrial relations and the North of Ireland, he had on average the sparse attendance of some 25 Deputies out of the 70-odd Deputies in his party. I would regard that as a measure of the attitude of many members towards the House and the operations of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we have the unique situation that some 50 Government backbenchers are totally eclipsed by the quasi-presidential status of the Taoiseach; they are totally subservient to the directions of their Whip.  There is a complete absence of freedom to <Col N="2500" /> criticise on a constructive basis or to debate openly measures brought before this House.  On the other hand, in reading the debates in the House of Commons one finds that the most circumspect and quiet Tory and Labour backbenchers are more vocal and forthcoming in their contributions.  This point is important because the Government have a majority in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the amount of constituency work that must be carried out by Deputies and understand the inevitable difficulties under the PR system of election, whereby Deputies are obliged to watch their own colleagues in their constituencies and to ensure that one colleague does not get one up on them&mdash;this is important where the colleague of a Deputy happens to be a Minister&mdash;nevertheless there is need to involve Members in matter of legislation.  The position should not obtain, as it does at present, of the Cabinet coming before the House, often displaying a contemptuous manner to the Opposition.  There is a complete absence of involvement of non-Government members in the workings of this House.  That is why the Labour Party has strongly supported the proposition of the leader of the Labour Party that various specialised committees should be established to carry out detailed analyses and investigation of legislation or of policy itself.  The massive technical details which arise from the complexity of Government legislation could be more effectively taken from the floor of the House and handed to specialised committees of the House.  Such committees could meet in public with the Press in attendance.  They would enable Deputies to contribute on a specialist basis and even be given the opportunity to make contributions.</P>
    <P>Very frequently, limitations of time and debate do not permit it.  Now that the back benches of Fianna Fáil have been cross-fertilised with some of their former front-bench members, I have no doubt the mixture will be very valuable, fluid and constructive.  On that basis, there is a very strong need for the introduction of Parliamentary committees.  I am very conscious of the <Col N="2501" /> committee system in the British House of Commons and of the various special committees of the House&mdash;on Agriculture, on Science, on Education, on Scottish affairs: I remember such a committee being advocated for Northern Ireland affairs as well.  On the other hand, the special committee on race relations in Britain, and some others, too, were not particularly successful.  I am quite conscious of these and of the fact that their contributions appear, by and large, to be somewhat marginal.  However, the experiment and the exercise should be undertaken by this House.</P>
    <P>I recall the usefulness and the value of the Select Committee on Health which was set up by the then Minister for Health, Mr. Seán MacEntee.  Unfortunately, the reform of our health services was politically castrated in terms of the attitude adopted by Mr. Seán MacEntee who treated the Select Committee with such supreme disdain and contempt that the Labour Members of that Select Committee on Health resigned and the committee folded up more or less in general frustration after a period of time.  We now have evolved a more coherent and effective structure for our health services. However, there has been discussion for five years in this House on the actual content of the health services themselves.  We are conscious of the growing need for a lengthy debate on and analysis of the geriatric problem in this country; on the need for more effective services for the mentally handicapped; on the problem of alcoholism in this country which was so enlighteningly and effectively outlined at a Tuairim meeting.  In fact, many aspects of our health services could be the subject of a Select Committee on Health.</P>
    <P>Between now and 28th October, 1970, we could exercise our collective imaginations on what viewpoints one should bring before such a committee on the health services.  There are only seven weeks between 28th October and the Christmas recess during which time we shall probably have a Housing Bill and one or two other Bills and then another Adjournment Debate&mdash; and off we go again.  That is not my <Col N="2502" /> concept of giving value to the tax-payers for the £2,500 they pay us and in respect of £2,000 of which we pay tax: we have not £2,500 tax free, as some people seem to think.  It is just about the rate for the job although I think we should not fix it: it should be done other than by Dáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>We also advocated the setting-up of a special committee in respect of semi-State bodies more particularly since Dáil Éireann provides the money for the operation of these State bodies and since they have grown in number, importance and contribution to the State itself.  The State-sponsored sector is now a dynamic element in our economic and industrial life.  It would be useful to have a special committee of this House available in this context so that Members could make an examination of the work of these bodies and of their general evolution from time to time.</P>
    <P>There are two final reforms which I would advocate.  The first may not be particularly popular with the members of the staff of the House and concerns the lengthening of the sittings.  I find it rather impossible to understand why Dáil Éireann must sit until 10.30 p.m. We have the farcical situation of an Adjournment Debate going on, this week&mdash;admittedly, this is a rare occation&mdash;to 11.30 p.m.  Newspapers have to go to press.  Presumably, what one says in this House is meant for public consumption.  Material has to be given for television and radio reports.  Many Members of this House have a great many evening commitments apart altogether from the fact that they rarely see their families during the Dáil term.  I fail to see the logic of a late sitting apart from Tuesday evening when the sitting could be from 3 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. to allow Deputies to come from the country on that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly suggest that the number of sitting hours of this House be increased by five, six or eight hours a week, up to the region of about 30 hours a week as against 22 hours a week or thereabouts at present.  That is my personal view and it is not necessarily in accordance with the attitude of the Labour Party as expressed some time ago in the document sent to the Taoiseach.  I feel that Dáil Éireann should meet on Tuesdays from 3 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.; on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and, on Fridays, from 10 a.m. or 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. or thereabouts so that Deputies may be able to get back to their constituencies on a Friday evening.  This would ensure that the Estimates, the Parliamentary Questions, Private Members' Bills, the Reports of Select Committees, which I would hope would be set up, would be fully discussed in a serious manner. It would also provide the Opposition with the opportunity of availing of Private Member's Time rather than having, as we now have, a mere one and a half hours a week for Private Members' Time.  Incidentally, we have had no Private Members' Time in the past few months.  It should be possible to introduce this new timetable even on an experimental basis.  Dáil Éireann would then be given a greater opportunity for more effective operation.</P>
      <P>The television and radio media should be authorised, as a matter of common public trust on the part of political parties in this House, to take video and sound recordings of what they would deem appropriate for transmission. This would have to be done on a daily basis while the House was sitting. The House itself would be televised and, even if the searching television cameras were to go on the empty benches, that might ensure that some Deputies would turn up here to prove to their constituents that they were at least physically present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While admittedly it has its dangers, at least television would ensure that <Col N="2504" /> some of the more outrageous nonsense that goes on in this House, and of which we had experience over the past 12 months, would be omitted, by and large, because Deputies would be conscious that they would never be elected again if they indulged in some of the recriminations and adolescent exchanges we had during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>These are some of the proposals which we in the Labour Party strongly urge the Government to consider. Unless this is done the electorate will have an even greater apathy towards the Parliamentary system, and towards the occupants of Leinster House, than they have at present.  It is rather gratuitous and rather clubbish, I would say, for us to be so critical of extra-Parliamentary activities and forms of pressure by pressure groups, and forms of agitation and protest.  if we fail to reform the rather feudal structure we have in Dáil Éireann, an inherited structure, a structure inherited from the British parliamentary system which is not necessarily suited to the Irish character or to, if I may use Deputy Blaney's phrase, our people.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable need for that reform.  Democracy does not mean&mdash;it certainly does not mean to me anyway &mdash;that every five years we expect 1.7 million electors to march into the ballot boxes and place 1, 2, 3 or 4, after the names of a panel of political party candidates.  As we are about to adjourn for the summer recess, it is important to point out that already the tripartite party political system is a very tight system indeed.  It is almost as difficult to get a nomination as a candidate as it is to get elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Seanad reminds me of the wise and foolish virgins.  If you keep your wick well trimmed and your lamp lighting you will probably be honoured with a seat in the Seanad in due course.  That happened to a number of members of the Seanad.  While, undoubtedly, we have very many excellent Senators the <Col N="2505" /> tragedy is that the Seanad is just a non-Parliamentary issue.  The Seanad would require a great deal of reform but we will leave that to them.</P>
      <P>The organisational and nomination set-up of the three political parties is extremely tight.  In many respects it is a bit of a closed shop.  When you add to that the statutory legislation that exists in respect of political parties, you find that it is very difficult to set up a party, if you want to set one up.  When we take into account the total effectiveness of the Seanad and the authoritarian tendencies which at times have been evident from ministerial attitudes, we realise that we in this House had better get out our sweeping brush and reform the institutionalised politics we have allowed ourselves to drift into. There is a need for us to come to grips with this problem as a matter of urgency.  These aspects will not go unnoticed and in time that exercise will prove extremely valuable.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude by making some remarks on the situation in Northern Ireland.  This was emphasised by the Taoiseach in his opening statement. We should place on record the thanks of the House to the Taoiseach and, in many respects, the admiration of the House for his contribution on television some Sundays ago.  That speech, or rather that television script, read by the Taoiseach with his authority and using his office, as he is quite entitled to do, was extremely Christian and statesmanlike.  It was an extremely appropriate contribution to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I suppose the word &ldquo;statesmanlike&rdquo; has become terribly debased but it was a rather statesmanlike contribution.  In many respects it marked a milestone of changing attitudes in the Republic towards Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terrible tragedy was that the Taoiseach could not have made that speech in his own party 12 months ago, without getting himself put out by the scruff of the neck by those who so violently disagreed with his policy on Northern Ireland.  The tragedy was that he did not make that statement 12 months ago or at his own Ard-Fheis. That was due, I suppose, to the <Col N="2506" /> insecurity of his position and due to his own belief that he could create a different and a more peaceful attitude in his party.</P>
    <P>In other words, welcome as it was&mdash; and in no way do I qualify the welcome I give to that very fine statement to the people of the country&mdash;the tragedy was that he did not grasp the nettle and make that statement at least 12 or 18 months ago and inform Deputy Boland and Deputy Blaney and the other hawks within the Fianna Fáil Party that that was the line he intended to follow.</P>
    <P>Had he done so, the national credibility of this Parliament, the national credibility of his own party and his own Cabinet and his own status as Taoiseach, would have been immeasurably greater.  At long last only are the Irish people currently living in the Republic beginning to appreciate the full implications of the involvement of our fellow Irishmen in the situation in this island as a whole.  We had to wait a long long time for the Taoiseach of an Irish Republic to stand up and say 70 per cent of our population on this island were Catholic, 10 per cent were Church of Ireland, 10 per cent were Methodist and Presbyterian and so on, and 5 per cent were &ldquo;others' &mdash;to use the term used by statisticians in a rather offensive sense.</P>
    <P>This is the first time we got away from the classical republican analysis of 95 per cent Catholic and 5 per cent other denominations.  Even in a cold statistical sense this meant a change of attitude on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.  At long last they are getting away from their own in-built, rather perverted, concept of nationalism and are adopting a global attitude of accepting the common name of Irish people as applying to all those living on this island.</P>
    <P>At long last there has seeped into the Fianna Fáil Party and the electorate the elementary political fact that the Scottish planters, the Protestant settlers of Ulster, are there to stay in Ulster, or whatever name they wish to put on that part of our country, and that they have now inherited with us the name of Irishmen.  I think Deputy <Col N="2507" /> O'Kennedy did not appreciate that fully last night in his reaction to Brian Faulkner.  We all find him to be an abrasive personality at times.  He is an Irishman.</P>
    <P>The insecurity suffered by those who settled in Northern Ireland has bred a great deal of spiritual fratricide which grew out of tremendous creedal divisions within Christianity which have been prostituted by politicians in Northern Ireland in the name of politics.  Only now are people in the Republic becoming conscious that these dynastic or religious wars and power politics of the 17th century transplanted into Northern Ireland have produced, on the one hand, the Blaneys and Bolands and, on the other, the Paisleys.  The analogy may not be entirely fair.  The cold and chilling reality that this fratricidal division has occurred is only now penetrating the consciousness of the people of the Republic.  I speak as one with the greatest regard for republican concepts but it strikes me that Deputies Blaney and Boland in their attitudes recently seemed to be happiest, most exuberant and constructive when attending a republican cemetery.  Perhaps that is indicative of the psychological ill-health which is afflicting the Ulster community and many of its Protestant members and which is equally evident in an equally perverse sense in many of the republicans within the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Let us not be under any illusions about the problems facing us in trying to reach out to our fellow Irishmen in the north.  Last night the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Kennedy, made a great song and dance about the attitude of Northern Unionists towards the people in the South and attempted to repudiate it as not being very worthy of full consideration.  In many of their attitudes I do not think it is farfetched to say that such is their insecurity, their traditional paranoia, that they have a vision of virile, Catholic Neil Blaneys streaming across the Border to bring about vast increases in the demographic structure and population of Northern Ireland to the extent that the carefully planned gerrymander of <Col N="2508" /> Ulster electoral districts would be thrown out of gear.</P>
    <P>This is part of their attitude in regard to the people of the Republic.  If you take the extremism of some of those who profess to be Irishmen in the south you can find it almost epitomised in the personality of Reverend Ian Paisley.  Any of us, who have seen either personally or on television the almost hysterical religious militancy of Ian Paisley and the embodiment in him of the tremendous local demogogic tradition of the Northern Unionist Party and watched his trumpeting career through Stormont and Westminster and through the electoral process, will agree that he embodies the height and the worst of the Protestant neurosis of extremism and near-primitivism which is to be found among Unionists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is a situation in which even now, coming up to the 12th August, it behoves us in the south to make sure that the dogs of hate are not allowed to slip their leash in the summer months so that we shall not have any holy wars developing of a kind more akin to pagan tribalism and certainly far removed from Christianity.  If you take the jingoistic republicanism of some Fianna Fáil Members, those who would like to classify themselves as extremists, and their fond recollection of the use of force against British forces in this country, with the fond recollection of service in the British forces by Northern Ireland Unionists, particularly Ian Paisley and the egoism and piety of devotion to a vanished British empire, as is also evident in the case of Ian Paisley, you can see that illusions have emerged which are profoundly disturbing and wrong.  Bearing these in mind, the self-adulation associated with the extremely introverted brand of Irish nationalism, the politics of armed confrontation based on fear and ignorance and lack of understanding of the peoples of this country of different traditions and stock, I certainly think there is a need for considerable circumspection in our approach.</P>
    <P>I felt very humble and indeed very proud as an Irishman when I saw the attitude being adopted&mdash;I say this quite <Col N="2509" /> deliberately to the House&mdash;by the Tánaiste in respect of the recent political troubles in his own party.  In my view the manifestations of distrust towards him during the course of that crisis were not warranted, and he emerged within his own party and the country with a stature which is to the credit of his party and to the credit of Parliamentary democracy.  While in the short-term he may not be thanked for his efforts, for the forthrightness and the stability he displayed which was then so necessary in relation to what occurred, I have no doubt that in the long-term the people of this country and the more sober and objective elements in his own party will come to appreciate his contribution on that occasion.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also&mdash;and this is not a tight-rope act on my part or on the part of the Labour Party to try to be all things to all men on such an issue&mdash;that the vast majority of Catholics in the Republic do not appreciate or understand the deep hatred and misgivings which are very evident among Catholics in Northern Ireland, the reaction to the banishment which they suffered.  They, our fellow Irishmen, have reacted with an even greater sense of paranoia on many occasions when the confrontation has occurred in that part of our country.  It is of the utmost importance that we should attempt by our actions in this House and outside it to restore political normality to the situation in Northern Ireland in the years ahead.  The unanimity which exists in this House in respect of a good deal of Government policy on this subject holds out hope that there will evolve a more democratic community in Northern Ireland or as near to it as possible in a divided Ireland, a community in which some people will no longer benefit, on a sectarian or political basis, from discrimination against their neighbours, a community in which the Protestants of Northern Ireland will begin to appreciate that nationalists, republicans and socialists are not all votaries of the great feast of Babylon, as Deputy O'Kennedy has said, a community in which people come to accept the ultimate ideal of Irish people, north and south&mdash;being united.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to say a few words about the question of Parliamentary reform mentioned by Deputy Desmond.  There was an omission from the very proper suggestions he made, in that he did not advocate greater use of the Seanad.  I, like many other politicians, was sent upstairs for a time.  I must say I hated the place. You could get nothing done there.  It was like living in a void and I must confess I used and abused it to get back down here.</P>
      <P>The Seanad, on average, sits on only 25 days per year.  There are many controversial Bills which could be sent to the Seanad first.  This has happened once or twice in the past five years. Having been passed by the Seanad, such Bills could be sent here in a form in which they would probably go through in an hour or half an hour, whereas in the ordinary way it would take several days for a Bill to go through the five Stages.  The Seanad should be used more.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond also discussed the question of our remuneration.  I think what he said was quite right.  The Seanad is properly remunerated.  They get £1,500 a year, paying tax on £1,000 of it, and for 25 sittings that seems a good deal of money.  There is no reason why that House could not do a little more work and be used rather as a committee.  They are a vocational body and there is provision for university representation.  The Seanad has taken in people who have subsequently been elected here, people like Deputy Garret FitzGerald, who is a professor of economics in UCD and who was a Senator before being elected to the Dáil.  There are other men like Professor Jessop, who was a Senator when I was there, and Senator John Kelly, a professor of law at UCD.  Such men are very well fitted to deal with various matters on which we are taking up time when we could be better engaged on other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of committees is also a sound one.  There are many circumstances where sub-committees have done very good work.  The constitutional committee did excellent work over a period of three or four years and some of its recommendations will <Col N="2511" /> now become the subject of a referendum. The select committee on health, of which I myself was a member, did very good work.  I agree there was at that time a difference of opinion between the then Minister for Health and the committee, but that select committee justified its establishment, and the Labour Party, I think, were wrong in leaving it.  It is my experience over 16 years of political life that, if you are at a meeting and you are disgusted with what is going on, and you throw your papers in the air and walk outside the door, that committee can then do what they like without your contribution.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond that there would be nothing wrong with having a videotape from Telefís Éireann here, that there would be nothing wrong with Telefís Éireann coming into this House.  It has been done in other Parliaments although not in the British Parliament, except in so far as interviews can be held in a studio as can be done in this House in the studio provided for that purpose.</P>
    <P>This year and last year it was not practical for this House to break earlier and come back earlier.  However, when I arrived here 16 years ago the reason the House sat on late and then came back late was that the farmers had their problems with the harvest, without combine harvesters. There was a longer harvest and then there was the taking in of the hay and the settlement of other farming affairs. Economically and in other ways there is no reason why we could not break in the middle of June and come back in the middle of September in order to give proper attention to the matters that are of consequence.  If you want to be precise about it the break could be on 1st July instead of the last day of July and the resumption could be on 1st October.  That would be a more satisfactory situation as far as our work is concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to devote most of my contribution to the economic situation.  I think the less said about Northern Ireland the better.  One of the things that we who have been here for some time <Col N="2512" /> do is to study, from our experience here, the way the House is moving. Prior to the election of 1969 there was the utter annihilation of all economic business as far as a proper approach to it by the Government were concerned.  One could not get a question answered in the proper way.  I have examples of questions here which I shall be referring to later.  Even yesterday I could not get questions answered in a proper way.  The Government were completely involved in their own difficulties, in the personal relationships between various Ministers of State, which only became evident on 22nd April, Budget day.  Before the Budget and before the last election there was this trouble.  I would point to two speeches before the last election&mdash;one by the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, and one by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey.  In the months of April and May they pointed to an economic crisis, a balance of payments difficulty, a credit squeeze situation that might develop and then suddenly when it became apparent that the right thing politically for them was to have a general election this whole thing was jettisoned absolutely and out they came and said that everything in the garden was rosy.  Everything in the garden was not rosy.  There was an obvious crisis in the Cabinet and there was the failure by them to attend to any economic fluctuation.</P>
    <P>We all know that in 1956-57 at the time of the Korean War and the Suez crisis there was precipitated upon this country an economic crisis which could not be dealt with in its first slow, faltering steps as an infant.  It was precipitated by those two international events and when it came upon us in a rush the curing of that economic crisis did cause unemployment.  The best that could be done was done by the Government of that day.  Instead of imposing a 2½ per cent turnover tax as was done here a few months ago to gather in the greatest amount of revenue and hurt everybody across the line in the country there was the selective imposition of levies on luxuries that we could very well do without for six or 12 months without affecting employment within the country, without hitting <Col N="2513" /> the people who depended on their week's wages.  We had Fianna Fáil at the time attacking the Government.  I remember ex-Deputy John A. Costello, then Taoiseach, being interrupted 47 times by ex-Deputy Seán Lemass in the course of a speech.  As a young Deputy sitting in the backbenches I listened to that.  That economic crisis was inflated and enlarged by the Fianna Fáil Party at the time in order to get a general election and get into power.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond's statements tonight in relation to the Tánaiste's very statesmanlike approach to the recent northern crisis.  I remember him at one time coming in here one day with two brief cases and ex-Deputy James Dillon asking him to stand up so that he could see him from behind the brief cases.  I remember him asking question after question on the fall in cattle prices, a fall in prices precipitated by an international crisis and every time he asked questions they went down another half-crown a hundredweight.  I suggest this was utterly unstatesmanlike and improper.</P>
    <P>This Government before the last election told us there was a crisis&mdash; they blew hot and then blew cold.  They got their majority, they had their crisis within the Cabinet and the explosion in that Cabinet of that crisis turned the minds of this Dáil for the last six months to nothing but the crisis in the Cabinet, to nothing but the various things that might happen to Fianna Fáil.  They have allowed this State to arrive at an economic juncture where they have waited too long and done nothing and where the remedies they will now have to apply will be extremely severe, where the remedies they will have to apply will put people out of work and will have a very great slowing down effect on the expansion we must have if we are to employ all our people and on the profits that are properly there for people who are in business and must employ the people who depend for their livelihood on a week's work.</P>
    <P>I should like to point now to the Central Bank report and to the article by Dr. Whitaker.  At page 7 in relation <Col N="2514" /> to the inflationary threat Dr. Whitaker says that the reasons are:</P>
    <P>inordinate money income increases; too high a rate of increase in public expenditure and borrowing; and at least until the latter part of 1969, excessive credit, particularly for consumer purposes.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Taoiseach can do about that.  What should he do about it?  What are the things which, if a magic wand could be waved, should be removed?  Certainly inordinate money income increases should be removed because they are only paper increases and if inflation is to continue they will be eroded completely almost before they are received. Certainly public expenditure should be pruned where it can be pruned but we practising politicians who see young couples with three, four and five children without a decent home do not want to see a slow down in housing.</P>
    <P>After the 1957 crisis to which I referred, in the years 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961 the then Fianna Fáil Government, having got into power, reduced the number of houses being built from a figure of 11,000 to a figure in one year of less than 4,000 and on the average less than 5,500.  We do not want to see that.  Public expenditure must be preserved for the good things, the things that are necessary, the things that should be paid for.</P>
    <P>In regard to excessive credit for consumer purposes, of course this must be pruned but it must be for consumer purposes.  The farmer, the businessman, the employer, the person who is doing something that is good for the country, the person who is employing labour, the person who is doing his very best in every way and is perhaps getting far less return for his family and himself than he would get in any other country in Europe, that man must not be slowed down.  Perhaps in other credit squeeze situations in this country there was too great an enthusiasm on the part of the administrators to cure the ill quickly.  I quote again from Dr. Whitaker's very sensible contribution. He says:</P>
    <P>a long and sustained effort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2515" /> He does not say a severe effort.  All the experience we can glean here is that it is not practical to try to cure this in six months or in 12 months.  We may have to suffer it until perhaps in two or two and a half years time it has been cured but the remedy might be worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>I would point for instance to the situation in Britain.  Monsieur de Sreumont at the Council of Europe said that Britain could not prepare herself for the Common Market except that for 12 years she budgeted for a surplus.  With her expertise Britain found a way out of that.  She used the deposit system in respect of imports. We, as a small nation, could not do that.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that she broke the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement unilaterally and never consulted us in so doing.  She produced a budget surplus of £2 million which she took from above the line expenditure and applied it below to capital and in this way prepared herself for a stage where she can stand up, on paper at least, and approach entry to the Common Market.  I do not know what expertise there is between Dr. Whitaker, the new Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, the advisers in the Department of Finance and all the other sources of expertise.  But if there is any other way in which we can get ourselves ready for Europe and get out of the present crisis, for which the Government are entirely responsible, then we must approach things in that way.  We have to approach them on the basis that we must not hurt our people any more than is necessary.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental wrongs of which the Government are guilty and which must be mentioned here.  In May last I asked a question about a statement by the Taoiseach, before the 12th round wage increase, that in respect of wages only an increase of 7 per cent or 30s per week would be allowed to a producer of goods as an increase in his costs.  Producers are paying as much as 25 per cent increase in wages; it ranges from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. The industries which matter most are <Col N="2516" /> those which have a large labour content in their costs of production. How can an industry which is paying 25 per cent extra to its workers, in which its labour costs are perhaps 60 per cent, continue if it only gets a price increase that allows 7 per cent increase in the cost of labour?</P>
    <P>I do not want to see costs increasing because that leads to inflation, but I do not see how this can be done. Yesterday, I questioned the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he quoted a reply of the 19th of May and said he would disallow for price increase purposes any increases in wages during 1970 in excess of 30s or 7 per cent.  He said that he did not propose to alter this position.  This was question No. 75 for Tuesday 28th July.  That is a position which does not hold water. We must be realistic.  If we pay people 25 per cent and that is going into the cost of the goods, it must be counted in the cost of the goods.  If this stupid attitude of hiding your head in the sand continues people will be out of employment within the next six months and businesses will go out of production and, as I said, the businesses which are most important are those with a high labour content in their costs of production.</P>
    <P>The question of price increases is one that must affect us here.  In 1969 we had price increases of the order of 7.4 per cent over 1968 and at the same time in 1969 our gross national product improved by less than 4 per cent, where the previous figure had been 7 per cent.  At the same time our labour content in these price increases increased without the output per worker increasing at all.  Every figure I have quoted is contained in the Central Bank report.  It is not a bible, but nobody has questioned these figures and I accept them.</P>
    <P>In that situation how can we be competitive with Europe?  How can we be competitive in our tourist trade?  I would remind the House that earnings from tourism are estimated at £100 million.  We all know that tourism has collapsed, that in the south, the area furthest away from the trouble in the north, there are empty hotels.  Yet our price increases are there.  The Government <Col N="2517" /> do not appear to have been worried over the last six months because of this.  The reason is they were worried about other things.  A small correction six months ago or a word of warning 12 months ago might have done the trick whereas now everybody admits&mdash; the Central Bank report admits, every document emanating from Government sources admits, and the Taoiseach admitted yesterday&mdash;that we are heading straight for a difficult time, when our people will have to do with less, when there will be less employment, and because of the trouble in the north we are heading for the time when we will have far less applications from industrialists to come here and avail of our generous grants.</P>
    <P>The slowing down is well known both in the Industrial Development Authority and in the Industrial Credit Company.  It is well known to the Government and to businessmen.  Only three months ago the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Minister for Finance, admitted that there was a slowing down.</P>
    <P>During my time in this House I think it will be agreed that I have been more inclined to look for hopeful things than most Members, but I should like to point to something which we must consider.  In the first quarter of 1970 we had a £4 million improvement in our balance of payments.  At first sight that might appear satisfactory, but on second sight it is most unsatisfactory. About a month ago I asked what value of housing it was estimated was involved because of the cement strike and the answer, which strangely enough did not hit the headlines, was £18 million.  At that time the builders providers stopped importing timber and other goods required for houses. This meant that there were less imports and of course a slowing down in spending by the Government.  In recent weeks the dock strike in England further affected the position.  It is quite clear, then, that the figures for the first quarter of 1970 are artificial and that the position is far worse than it would appear to be.</P>
    <P>Dr. Whitaker, on page 9 of his report, says something with which I do not agree and I do not think many <Col N="2518" /> people here would agree with it either. He says that tight fiscal and monetary conditions would discourage a moderate income increase.  That, it seems to me, has not been the pattern.  Two weeks ago the trade unions rejected a prices and incomes policy.  I am all in favour of such a policy, which I think should embrace not only wages and salaries and remuneration of all kinds but also dividends and profits as distributed. This is most necessary and something which we have to face up to. If we can get things like production bonuses operating in industry, it will have a good effect.</P>
    <P>A prices and incomes policy does not have to be 100 per cent successful to bring about an improvement. Indeed, three or four years ago, when Britain was in the throes of her troubles, one of the bright spots seemed to be that, while Mrs. Barbara Castle was under severe criticism because of her prices and incomes policy from all the unions and, indeed, from most of the Labour Party, there was an improvement and a constant improvement in the situation because she was succeeding in imposing limits on the monetary incomes that would be given, particularly in State services, and succeeding in holding things if not 100 per cent then at least 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I said, the trade unions have decided they will not accept a prices and incomes policy and that means that, unless we can get a correction now, get a proper approach, we will have the same situation in the next 12 months as we had in the last nine. With the end of the 12th round there will be a continuance of a demand, whether or not it is there to pay, for a moderate increase in remunerations. The tragedy is that they will be taken away.  They are merely paper money. The economist, the businessman and the trade unionist can work out a figure which it is possible to pay without erosion of the national purse.  The national purse belongs to us all.  That was not the evolution, unfortunately. Those who are in a strong position can succeed in getting what they want whereas the weak have no one to fight for them.  We have wages chasing prices and prices chasing wages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2519" /> The prices and incomes policy suggested by Deputy Desmond and the Labour Party must be introduced. Voluntary restraint must go.  That is the only way in which we will avoid that which must be avoided, severe restrictions which would put firms out of business and cause unemployment. That must not be allowed to happen. The cure will take two to two and a half years.  To try to cure the situation in six months will only result in the cure being worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>Dr. Whitaker says at page 13 of his illuminating report that the danger is real and menacing and will not go away of its own accord.  The wolf is at the door and he warns that this time we must remember the wolf is not a toy dog.  I agree.  This is where I want to make my plea that there should be no strong measures but, rather, a consistent and constant effort, an effort which will allow all to proceed while, at the same time, being reasonable in their approach.  It would be a great mistake if one were to go back to the Manchester School of Economics and say: &ldquo;There are the figures.  The balance of payments is out of equilibrium. We are going to cure it&rdquo; and then try to cure it with one savage slash.  That simply cannot be done today. It was tried before.  It must not be tried again.</P>
    <P>The attempt in 1967 probably avoided a far worse consequence in that it was a series of levies on specific articles.  The worst feature of Government policy in the last six months was the global application of an extra 2½ per cent turnover tax.  That hits the man with seven children who wants to buy a loaf of bread or a pint of milk in exactly the same was at it hits the man who wants to buy a bottle of champagne.  That sort of thing should not happen.  The Budget was really a ready-up Budget with a very bad effect on the economy.  This is referred to in the Central Bank report; it is given as one of the reasons for the high rate of increase in prices.  I have examined this price increase situation over about 50 commodities and I am quite certain that it was not just 2½ per cent; in some cases it was 3½ per cent and in <Col N="2520" /> some 5 to 5½ per cent.  The situation will become worse with decimalisation. There is this constant erosion of people's incomes and people go on looking for more when it is not there.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the things that must go on.  Housing must go on.  Our housing situation is pretty bad.  That may not be so obvious in some rural areas but it is quite deplorably obvious in the towns.  It is not altogether the fault of the Government.  It often takes three to five years to get a housing scheme off the ground.  Stop/go situations are bad.  At the same time, to stop now would be a great mistake. We must ensure housing for our young people.  We must improve the situation. In 1969 there was a 7.4 per cent increase in prices.  In 1970 there was the extra 2½ per cent turnover tax, which will even out at about 5 per cent, and there will be the price increase brought about by wage increases.  The bubble must burst.</P>
    <P>In many cases the 7 per cent increase will be 17 per cent, or something like that.  I think Deputy Cosgrave's estimate was a 10 per cent increase in prices this year.  I regard that as too low.  There will be a far bigger increase. This price increase will have a deplorable effect on the social welfare classes. In the last Budget and the Budget which preceded it larger increases were given to these classes in an effort to help them to keep pace with the cost of living.  These will be completely wiped out by the huge increase in prices in the current 12 months.  The pittances, and they are only pittances, of the social welfare classes will have to be looked at again.  We will have to give more from taxation to help keep them abreast of increasing prices, increasing prices as a result of a dereliction of duty, because we did not apply the correctives that should have been applied, because of disagreements, political and otherwise, within the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I referred to a slowing-down in inquiries about new industries.  I will produce when the Dáil returns the statement by the Tánaiste's colleague that there is a slowing-up.  In fact a slowing-up during 1970 is accepted as inevitable.  We must employ our people <Col N="2521" /> in industry because more and more are leaving the land.  We must give incentives and some of these incentives will not be permissible in the EEC.  Therefore we must do the job now.  I asked the Tánaiste would an industrialist come here now with the same keenness as he might have come prior to the troubles in the north or prior to members of the Government being removed from the Cabinet for activities which we cannot discuss because they are <i>sub judice.</i>  An industrialist must look at every aspect.  He must subject the situation to a clinical analysis before he decides.  He must weigh the advantages of one country against the disadvantages of another.  The Tánaiste unfortunately, can rest assured that the behaviour, Cabinet-wise and otherwise, over the last 12 months, the failure to look after the economic situation because of the political situation, must react against the advancement of industry here and the creation of new employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference by Deputy Cosgrave yesterday to the amendment to our Constitution, which has been referred to by Cardinal Conway as something over which &ldquo;he would not lose any sleep&rdquo;, is to an amendment of the 1937 Constitution.  In that Constitution the Catholic Church was given a special place.  In the previous Constitution of the Cumann na nGaedhael Government&mdash;and this is important in relation to the North of Ireland&mdash;the special place of the minority was well catered for, as was clear from the section of the Constitution Deputy Cosgrave quoted.  It was also made clear that there was no special place for the Roman Catholic Church in that first <Col N="2522" /> Constitution.  Deputy Desmond mentioned this fact and quite correctly gave as the reason the fact that there was a feeling that after the setting up of the first Dáil the property of Protestants would be in jeopardy.  There might well have been a situation in which farms would be burnt and property destroyed. Therefore, this provision gave a feeling of security to the minority to which they were fully entitled.</P>
    <P>I have observed the friendship moves made by ex-Deputy Lemass to Lord O'Neill when both of them were Heads of Government.  I have also watched other friendship moves and the difficulties of the past 15 months.  I would mention something that has not been mentioned, either in this or in other debates, namely that James Dillon has been saying for the last 30 years what we have been hearing recently.  I have attended many AOH demonstrations in the North of Ireland with Mr. Dillon and he has always said that the way we should approach this problem is in the concept of the Ancient Order of Hibernians&mdash;in friendship, unity and true Christian charity.  The emblem of the Order is two hands clasped together.</P>
    <P>Although Mr. Dillon has been expressing this sentiment for 30 years, the representatives of the party opposite remained silent.  It is only when things got bad that they decided that the various utterances of extremists in their party&mdash;including the famous comment in the Golden Grill at Letterkenny&mdash;were undesirable.  However, Fianna Fáil were only echoing the words of the statesman who has left this House.  The gentleman to whom I have referred and the Order of Hibernians were under severe criticism because they did not believe in force and because at a certain stage they came to an agreement with the British Government which would have given us Home Rule.  That is all &ldquo;old hat&rdquo; in this day.  However, with all honour to the men who died in 1916, we should realise that the only way we can have a sane conclusion to the crisis in the North of Ireland is on the basis of friendship, unity and true Christian charity.  I would add that before any of the other parades were stopped, Mr. <Col N="2523" /> Dillon announced that the AOH parades would not be held.</P>
    <P>I come now to the situation facing farmers.  They are faced with unavoidable rising costs and I have been trying to tell the House for the past 12 months that this is happening.  Farmers with farms of a certain size must run a car; farmers with a certain amount of work on their farm, be it cattle-rearing or sheep-rearing, have a heavy animal medicine bill; they must fertilise their land and they have a heavy machinery maintenance bill.  These are all unavoidable overheads.  Statistics are quoted purporting to show that the farmer has now a greater profit but I know from experience that his costs have risen to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that if we enter the EEC our price for milk will be increased, as will our price for beef; the price for grain will probably remain the same and, presumably we will be able to hold our costs at the same level as now, apart from wage costs.  Deputies must realise that farmers are not sitting on a bed of roses.  I do not want to develop this matter because it can be considered on the Estimate for Agriculture, but people should realise that farmers are not getting an increase in income greater than that given to any other section of the community and in many cases it is less.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that the farmer might be compelled to do what he did in the 1930's, namely, to live off his own fat.  I remember an old cattle dealer once telling me that the Irish farmer was the best man in the world to do this.  He explained that if things are bad the farmer would keep fewer cattle, would employ less labour and would not carry out any maintenance work on the farm.  Naturally enough when this was done in the 1930s it resulted in a deterioration of many farms.  We must not forget that the wealth of this country still remains on the farms.</P>
    <P>As shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce for Fine Gael I want to state clearly&mdash;it is no criticism of industry&mdash;that while industrial exports rose <Col N="2524" /> to a very high level in the last year much of these exports were, in fact, re-exports.  The raw materials were imported and what we exported was the work of our people, plus whatever profit element there was for proprietors of industries.  Therefore, if a bullock costing £100 is exported and there are industrial exports of the same amount, as far as our balance of trade is concerned the exports of the bullock is of greater value than the industrial exports. The latter give more employment and our industrial drive must be intensified but if we allow our farms to deteriorate we will be in serious trouble.  Farmers must be encouraged to maintain their farms and to keep a sufficient number of livestock on them. The number of livestock has not increased to the extent it should in the last number of years.  The fertiliser is available, the machinery and the necessary expertise are available, and there are many farmers who are doing an excellent job and keeping their farms well stocked.  But it is not general.  We may as well face the fact that we have got to look after them until we get into the EEC.</P>
    <P>There is a great Exchequer advantage for the Government in this regard when we get into the EEC.  Industry may be perhaps in difficulties but it is clear to me that there seems to be an opportunity to get rid of anything between £25 million and £35 million worth of subsidies when we get into the EEC.  Indeed, this is all based on the fact that milk will be at a much higher price and, as well, the system of target intervention prices means that where there is a surplus of goods of any one sort or another, it will be looked after financially by the whole of the countries of the EEC.  Whereas we are now spending £35 million on subsidies&mdash; within the EEC it would be a much greater figure because the farmers would be paid more&mdash;that would be the responsibility of every country within the Ten.  This is the advantage: the system of target intervention prices and the common external tariff look after this in a way that is an advantage for the Government.  In the intervening period, every possible assistance that can be given should be given to the farmers of Ireland to improve, to maintain <Col N="2525" /> and to carry cattle on their farms. That will make us ready for the entry that perhaps will not be very long delayed.  The credit squeeze comes up immediately.  If the farmers do not get the money they cannot have the cattle. It is very important that the level of cattle production in this country be maintained.</P>
    <P>I want to end on perhaps a pretty controversial note.  It is of the utmost importance that any restriction of credit is properly applied.  Even though the Government are sadly at fault for the past 12 months, we should not try to cure this in six short months but, as Dr. Whitaker says, we should apply it in a long and sustained effort.  We should do everything possible to see that our move forward continues, perhaps in a slower way than it did for a few years except last year, but at the same time that the improvement is sustained.</P>
    <P>Can this Government do the job now that the people who were at the wheels of so many important vehicles of State are no longer there?  I wish Deputy Michael Moran recovery from his illness. I wished him that personally the other day when he came in here.  However, I know he was the bastion of Fianna Fáil in the west.  Deputy Moran was here since 1948.  He filled various ministries in an ebullient, forceful and, in many cases, efficient way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not paying a tribute to him now; maybe I am, because I have nothing against the man.  But I am merely saying this.  Can Fianna Fáil go on without Deputy Michael Moran, energetic and a member of the Cabinet and holding the west of Ireland in the palm of his hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activities of Deputy Blaney as a Cabinet Minister were legendary as far as the winning of by-elections was concerned.  I disagreed with Deputy Blaney violently on many occasions and I am sure that, if he remains in the House, I shall again.  I grant him that any man who worked as hard as he did will be a loss. Whether his activities mean that <Col N="2526" /> he should be a loss as far as he personally is concerned is something I cannot and will not discuss.  All I wish him personally, again, is that such will not be the outcome of the present situation.  One way or another, I cannot see him back in a Fianna Fáil Cabinet in the foreseeable future, in decades.  If this is so, can Fianna Fáil do without him?  They have another man as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Deputy Blaney was controversial and I think not very successful in that office.  I think he was highly successful in the Department of Local Government.  Can this man of far lesser experience provide the alternative?  I do not think he can.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation at all about saying that in many ways Deputy Charlie Haughey was quite a striking Minister for Finance.  If I wanted to talk about the two Ministers for Finance in my period here who left their imprint on the economy &mdash; and again we did not agree with everything Deputy Charlie Haughey did, particularly on the last Budget&mdash;one was the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman and the other was Deputy Charlie Haughey. We have to do without Deputy Gerard Sweetman, God rest him, and it is a very big loss&mdash;a loss that in this party, I think, perhaps some of the younger members do not realise but anyone that was here with him over the years would fully realise it.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, for the foreseeable future and perhaps for decades ahead, will have to do without Deputy Charlie Haughey.  Again, I wish him personally and his family nothing but well.  As this is the most serious deliberative assembly in the country at present, I can see no way in which there can be a return of Deputy Charlie Haughey to a Fianna Fáil Cabinet&mdash;no criticism of him personally in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland, again, is the man who came in here and, in one day, donned the mantle of all the old Fianna Fáil republicanism we heard about.  He never served a day as a Deputy.  He came in here and on that day was made a Minister.  The Bolands were always in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet and always were going to be.  In his work, first as Minister for <Col N="2527" /> Social Welfare, and then as Minister for Local Government, on some things I violently disagreed with him.  I had a violent disagreement with him on the question of lease rents, which I was working on last night at Drogheda Corporation.  With Deputy Boland again, I had very serious disagreement on the question of fair play and fundamental policy.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Boland was a man of fantastic energy.  There is no use in saying that he was not: he was.  He could be dreadful in the House to us and I suppose we reciprocated on many occasions by being dreadful to him. Again, I can see no way at all, remembering the things Deputy Boland said about the Taoiseach and, in fact, what the Taoiseach said about Deputy Boland&mdash;mildly and gently though he meant to be&mdash;whereby in decades there could be a Fianna Fáil Cabinet with Deputy Boland in it.  Loyalty is a quality that is a bit scarce.  His Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Paudge Brennan, left with him.  When the captain went down with the sinking ship the mate did likewise.  Deputy Paudge Brennan likewise is a loss.  He is a very strong Fianna Fáil man in the constituency of Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that Fianna Fáil cannot continue without these men. With the divisions that were produced, the, I would say, almost horrifying experiences that persons who were not involved must have been subjected to, must have created chaos upon chaos in that party.  I hold that something will crack along the line.  Naturally I wish it from a political point of view, but not from a personal point of view.  We wait for the court cases which we may not discuss.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Fine Gael Party could lose a half dozen of its members, have an unholy, bitter row and retain its strength, whether that strength was 50, 40 or 80 seats.  I do not think the Labour Party could split itself down the middle and continue as strong as it was.  The personnel here perhaps may not be as wonderful as it should be. Certainly I am not, with all my sins. Be that as it may, when you <Col N="2528" /> have been here for 16 years, you have served your apprenticeship.  The men I am talking about have been here longer than I.  They served a hard apprenticeship to the trade.  Now, if they were cobblers, we would say their last had been taken from them.</P>
    <P>We are now at the beginning of what has been clearly enunciated by the Taoiseach as a financial crisis.  I appeal to the Government to use all the expertise they have to ensure that it does not hit hard, to string it out and not to apply a credit squeeze that will hit our people.  I appeal to them to do everything they can to keep the fundamental industries that employ our people going, to do everything they can to keep housing going in every local authority and, most important of all if we have any charity, to do everything they can to see to it that our social welfare recipients are cushioned against the time to come.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all I have said about the people who have gone from the Fianna Fáil Cabinet and, added to that, the financial crisis, there will be a general election.  I know not when. It will be at the time most advantageous to the people opposite because that is the way they always play it. This may be rather bad English, but the result will be that it will be the least disadvantageous time but, whatever time they have it, it will be highly disadvantageous to them and it will see them out of office.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil have continued to make progress and to develop the country.  The country's income has grown and the difficulties have been overcome and any crises that appeared have disappeared.  That will happen this time too.  That will happen particularly in relation to policy towards the north in the Taoiseach's speech made in Tralee, his speech at the last Árd Fheis, and the historic speech made by the Taoiseach on July 11th.</P>
      <P>That is what I say and it will be found that I shall be proved right.</P>
      <P>We have a very great tradition of unity in our party.  It is almost unique in the history of European democracy.</P>
      <P>I think we have the third oldest administration among the sovereign nations of the world, having been in office continuously since 1932 with only two intervals of three years each in that period.  This gives us great experience of how to deal with difficult situations, how to conduct our relations with other countries, how to deal with economic crises and how to induce and encourage economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>In spite of our long term in office we have one of the youngest Governments amongst civilised democracies and I can assure Deputy Donegan that the present team in the Government are quite capable of carrying out their multifarious duties and of approaching the question of the crisis in the balance of payments in the correct way and of doing the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan went back to the <Col N="2534" /> crisis of 1956 and tried to explain it by referring to the Korean War inflation.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Donegan looks at the economic growth that was taking place in Europe at that time, he will find that the crisis which took place here could not be seen in any other well-managed democracy in Northern Europe.  It was gross mismanagement on the part of the Coalition Government that created absolutely record and totally unnecessary unemployment and emigration.  Of course, Deputy Donegan failed to point out that at the very end they could not stand together.  They broke up completely. They ratted on each other, party by party.  Deputy Donegan has never seen a Fianna Fáil Government break up and disappear into the mists of a lost general election as a result of any division that might occur temporarily among its members.</P>
    <P>That has never yet been seen and I hope it will not be seen in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The next suggestion made by Deputy Donegan and other Opposition Deputies was that the balance of payments crisis can always be completely avoided, apparently through some divine perception on the part of the Government and the economic authorities.  This, apparently, could only apply to us because if the Deputies in the Opposition could cite the case of any country in Europe working under democratic principles where there has not been at one time or other severe inflationary periods with economic difficulties to face, be they short or long, I should like to hear them.  The suggestion that in a free democratic society one can always avoid a difficult inflationary situation, that one can tackle it even before it arises and prevent it from arising is ludicrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some countries have been able to manage their affairs better than others. Some have had shorter inflationary periods than others but every country in Europe has at some time faced the <Col N="2535" /> sort of difficulties we are now facing and which we had to face between 1965 and 1967 and which the Coalition Government failed to face between 1955 and 1957.  That is because it is impossible to ordain the economic life of any democratic country so as to completely avoid the possibility of inflation and adverse balances of payments. There are some countries where they have better arrangements for dealing with incomes and prices where these crises have been very short-lived, such as Switzerland and West Germany.  Curiously, if one looks at the history of the Netherlands where they have had some of the best industrial relations in Europe with guidelines established relating wages to productivity, one finds that after a very considerable and magnificent period of economic stability the Netherlands suffered a tremendous inflationary crisis for at least three or four years of recent date.  To talk glibly as though these crises could be totally avoided by advance action is just nonsense, particularly in a country where there are not the same traditional and close knit arrangements for negotiating incomes, wages and salaries for employers and trade unionists.</P>
    <P>When we look at the efforts made by countries to correct inflation we find that, as a rule, it is very difficult to hit on exactly the right degree of disinflationary action, to apply the brakes at just the right time and to remove braking action at the right time.  If one looks at the history of the steps taken to control inflation in the north European countries it will be found that in some cases there was a great deal of success in a particular situation. In some there was partial success followed by some difficulties and later final correction, and in some cases there was a very serious crisis over a prolonged period, as in the case of Britain.  May I make it absolutely clear that it is not necessarily the gift of any democratic government to correct an inflationary position exactly in the right way at the right time?  All we can do is to make the best possible job of it.  Making a general comparison between our disinflationary policy in the last inflation period in 1965, <Col N="2536" /> between what we did and what happened in other countries under similar circumstances, I would say that the Fianna Fáil Government made a fair success of it, although there was a reduction in gross national product and in production in certain fields.  If you see a crisis approaching, say, in 1965 and if the country can be completely restored to its former level of growth by 1967, I suggest that is a result that is better than a great many others were able to achieve even though not as perfect as it might be.  I am being quite frank about this and I am speaking honestly about the whole position of tackling inflation.</P>
    <P>We shall tackle the present inflationary position.  At the time of the Budget we referred to the inflation problem.  I certainly spoke here with other Ministers, making it perfectly clear that action would be taken at the appropriate time and I said then that it was felt that the total adverse balance of payments would not be greater than £50 million in 1970; that would make allowance for capital imports; that we would carefully watch the situation and that we would hope that in regard to any new wage and salary agreements coming up for review after all the major ones had been settled, there would be reasonable restraint.  If there was a reasonably increased volume of savings during the spring and summer and autumn, it might affect the extent to which we would have to take disinflationary action.  I went on to say that the disinflationary action we would take would naturally include any further restriction of credit, any taxation measures that might be necessary and any other effective measures that would be required in the circumstances. We were watching the situation.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that none of the events that have taken place in connection with the northern crisis have had the effect of postponing action by the Government in regard to this matter.  The Minister for Finance made it equally clear that because of the lamentable bank strike it was difficult for us in those circumstances to examine the general economic situation in sufficient depth to make any <Col N="2537" /> preliminary decisions during the period from April and May to the present time.  The Minister for Finance also said it was very difficult to make final decisions until the banks became operative again and until we could establish the level of credit.  The Minister for Finance said that he did not think the bank strike was likely to have caused an additional measure of inflation due to the use of excessive credit, but that he was not certain what the final result would be.</P>
    <P>I hope I have relieved the minds of those outside this House who are quite clearly expected to believe that this Government, as was suggested in 1965, are on the point of breaking up through being unable to face the consequences of having to deal with inflation.  We are all quite used to inflation in Europe.  All intelligent governments have had to face inflation.  There is nothing frightening about it as long as it can be dealt with effectively and sensibly, and quite a number of the points put by Deputy Donegan were sensible.  Disinflationary policies might take a short-term form in respect of some actions and a long-term form in respect of others.  Quite evidently the Government will not wish to dismantle the housing programme as hinted at by Deputy Donegan.  The capital available for industry and for housing and social services has to be based on our capacity to borrow abroad and on our own capacity to save.  Whatever housing allocation is provided in the next Budget will be based on realities and also on the very great need to continue with the housing programme.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House could agree with a great deal of what Deputy Desmond said in relation to the whole problem of establishing a prices and incomes policy.  The community have been looking for too much too early and too quickly.  If they had been starved of income increases in the last ten years this would be understandable but, as a whole, the community are very nearly 50 per cent better off than they were 11 or 12 years ago in terms of real incomes and after allowing for increases in the cost of living that have taken place in that time.  Those who are included in the category of people <Col N="2538" /> who receive industrial earnings have seen their real earnings, after allowing for increases in the cost of living, go up by over 60 per cent in the last ten years.  Therefore standards of living, have undoubtedly improved and improved steadily.</P>
    <P>Industrial employment has also been growing after a period of waiting and a period during which it was found difficult to see the final result of capital investment in industry produce employment of sufficient measure.  I think it is reasonable to ask all the people to help us halt inflation.  Other countries in Europe have solved this problem because all those receiving salaries or wages, whether high or low, recognised that there had to be a halt for a period. If one looks at the increases in salary and wage levels in countries of Europe where there are intelligent democratic institutions, it can be seen that there have been pauses of two or three years during which the increases in salaries and wages related to either something less than the growth of productivity or to the growth of productivity, and as a result inflation was corrected and the country could resume its onward march towards greater prosperity.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why people should not accept that situation here.  In fact, what surprises all those who know about this subject is why people go on asking for 15 per cent more wages and salaries when they know they will lose the better half of it in increased living costs; why they would not try, just for an experiment, in view of the country's economic position, asking for 7 per cent and keeping nearly all of it and seeing their standard of living grow just as much in real terms as it would by asking for an excessive amount and seeing it lost in increases in prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond referred disparagingly to the work of Ministers for Industry and Commerce in regard to price control.  The Deputy knows perfectly well that the levels of prices in this country and the increases therein over any period in the last five years compare with the corresponding increases of wages and salaries in a manner which shows that there is no distortion here as compared with any country in northern Europe where <Col N="2539" /> statistics are properly kept and where the same results can be observed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to check the success or failure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in controlling the prices of certain commodities and the effect that might have on general price levels, then it is quite easy to do it by looking at the increases of wages and salaries in Great Britain, in Germany, in Switzerland or in Sweden and then looking at the corresponding increases in those countries in consumer price levels.  It will be found that we have nothing to be ashamed of in so far as Government price control is concerned.</P>
      <P>In a particular period in Great Britain salaries and wages went up by 35 per cent and the cost of living went up by about 18 per cent.  If you take a period of recent date for this country where salaries and wages went up by 35 per cent, you will find the cost of living went up here by about the same amount as in Britain.  That is a fact, and if any member of the Labour Party can produce figures to show that prices have run away more than would be justified in relation to increases of wages and salaries, comparing this country with any northern European country where we have the general type of free enterprise plus socialism or plus a government-intervention economy, I should like to see them.  I have studied the figures and I cannot find any examples at all.  I am almost certain that if there is a greater distortion here some particular reason will be found for it, that either the actual proportion of goods produced here and imported here are different, or there is some other explanation for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not to say that there should not be a measure of price control as exercised at the present time.  However, between the measures of price control exercised here and the effect of free competition, I do not believe the Government are failing in their job.  I agree there should be far more publicity about this.  We must consider the whole <Col N="2540" /> question of public relations in connection with a prices and incomes policy, because I do not believe that the average person in Ireland knows anything in detail about how prices go up when wages and salaries go up in other countries.  A great many people seem to think that it is unique to our situation, whereas in fact it happens everywhere for largely the same reasons. The people ask for salary and wage increases, increases far greater than are justified by the increase in production.</P>
    <P>I hope everybody in the country will take account of what the Taoiseach said about the challenges we face.  We face these challenges in common with other countries.  Tariffs generally are being reduced.  This has the effect of creating more competition for ourselves in our export and in our home markets.  There is also the necessity of preparing to face the challenge of completely free trade in the EEC.</P>
    <P>There, again, I feel it is quite reasonable to ask people to pause in their insatiable demand for a higher standard of living in view of our having to prepare for these events&mdash;particularly when, if they do pause and accept a reasonable increase in wages and salaries, they are likely to keep the increase and it will not be eaten away by increased living costs.  It may only be affected by taxation imposed by the Government for the purpose of transfer payments for social welfare, health services and other purposes.  I think it is reasonable to ask people at this stage to show the kind of restraint that can be shown at least over a period.  When one thinks of the period of ten years in the life of a family it is not unreasonable to ask them to try to experiment and see how it would work if they followed the golden rule that wage and salary increases should equate with growth of productivity.  It would be reasonable to ask the community to carry out an experiment of this kind and to agree to it.</P>
    <P>Even though the Irish Congress of Trade Unions seemed to turn down immediate consent to the proposals of the NIEC for an incomes and prices board and for proper negotiations between employers and unions, I hope that when they further examine the <Col N="2541" /> matter they will reconsider this.  I hope they will follow the advice of Labour Deputies, such as Deputy Desmond, that they should at least consider how they could establish this type of negotiation in order that we can deal with inflation on a reasonable basis.</P>
    <P>A proper discussion must be based on, first of all, an estimate of what the growth of productivity will be in a given year and in the past year.  It must be based on what possible increase of production could be secured in industries where production bonuses are genuine, where a bonus given for extra production is something genuine and not merely, as it frequently is, an offer of an extra payment, which is not realised at the end of the year because in fact it was not fully accepted in relation to the method of either paying it or the method by which the production could be increased.</P>
    <P>Such a board can examine the question of restrictive practices in any industry where they might be abandoned in favour of some other principle. It would naturally examine wage and salary costs in the industry concerned. It would examine the element of profit in the business.  It would examine comparative costs of products of the same kind as in the industry sold abroad and how the profitability of the industry could be affected by excessive increases in wage and salary costs.</P>
    <P>Equally, the effect of continuous tariff reductions should also be examined in relation to the decisions made and, finally, the management should make quite clear to the staffs what possible employment potential there was if a reasonable settlement was accepted, the concept being that perhaps it is better to have five members of a family employed in an industry at an increase in wages of, say, 7 per cent, most of which would be kept, than having only four members or three members of a family employed in an industry where the wages went up by 15 per cent and the cost of living obliterated half of the 15 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident that sometimes people offer every kind of excuse for <Col N="2542" /> not accepting the rule of productivity and the rule that wage and salary increases should correspond with the growth production per head in the country every year.  One of the excuses they make is a belief that hugely excessive profits are being made at large. I should like to hear any Deputy in this House give a dissertation to prove that the general average profits of industry over the last ten years, or over the last three years, have been excessive in comparison with what was made in countries with moderate Labour Governments, such as in Sweden, a Labour Government, such as in Britain, or in countries with the same kind of government as we have, where taxation is pretty high and where there is a mixture of free enterprise, government intervention and socialist endeavour.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear anybody give a dissertation to prove that any person has an excuse for saying: &ldquo;I will not accept this rule because I see hugely excessive profits being made.  Can I not milk the boards of directors of these companies?&rdquo;  One figure we have is that the total increase in income of all self-employed people in this country, as a percentage of the total national income, has not varied measurably in the last five years.  There is no evidence to be found from the Central Statistics Office that there has been grossly inflated profits, that profits represent a great proportion of the total incomes of everyone and of all forms of production and trade in the country.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of that to be found.  Indeed, one can meet people who are well acquainted with the world of negotiation between trade unions and employers and when one hears experienced trade union leaders speak of this they will frequently say that the companies that pay the highest profits are very frequently the companies that provide the very best conditions for workers.  That is certainly true of some of the greater industries both here and in Britain and in other countries.</P>
    <P>I once went through the exercise of working out how much extra all the working population of this country would get in wages if the whole of the <Col N="2543" /> additional profits of all the enterprises of the country were abandoned by the directors and owners of the companies and paid to the workers after having subtracted the amount required for reinvestment in the business and to pay for the taxes imposed by the State on profits.  Four or five years ago it would mean that every worker would get something like 3s 6d or 4s more a week on his wage.  One can carry out a number of exercise of that kind and one can examine how much profit there actually is in a pair of shoes which sells for £3 10s.  If one asks a director of any of the big shoe companies here what it is, one will find that it will not be any great consolation to anyone to think that he should get x per cent more wages or salary if that particular profit was eliminated or halved or quartered.  The only result of so doing would be that there would not be the necessary investment in the business and the tax levied by the State would not be applied to social services or to all the other State services that are required.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of what I might describe as jealousy with regard to all this, people looking over their shoulders from one group in the community to another, feeling that they must get as much as or more than another group&mdash;an endless series of leap-frogging claims.  None of them is going to be really effective because the result is that the lower income group, who cannot protect themselves, suffer. As a result huge extra amounts have to be paid for extra social services, not only to provide better social services but to bring social services up to the limit at which they should be merely to counter the increase in the cost of living.  As a result the people who ask for excessive wages and salaries are themselves taxed more and they lose more again through the payment of taxes.  This whole dizzy process goes on and has gone on in this and other countries at times for a great many years.  No one can see any beneficial result from it.</P>
    <P>It is true that we had a period of very excellent ordered growth in our economy from 1958 to 1961 where the <Col N="2544" /> actual real increase in wages and salaries was as much in that period as it was from 1961 to 1964, which appeared to be a period of greater growth economically and industrially but where increases in living costs emasculated the increase in wages and salaries.  Therefore, the real prosperity of the worker grew more in the first three years of that period than in the second.</P>
    <P>If this experiment was tried, if the trade unions and employers met, if the employers gave sufficient information, collectively, about their businesses to give grounds for hope to the trade unions that if they made a bargain they would not be exploited, I believe it would have very excellent results.  It would change a great many attitudes in the employer-trade union relationships which need to be changed under our present circumstances.  If it did not work those representing salary and wage earning persons could come back and say, &ldquo;You let us down.  It did not work.  You gave us the wrong figures. You deceived us&rdquo;, and they could ask for a thundering increase to overcome the disabilities from which they suffer.</P>
    <P>One can always see the results of such an experiment.  It is quite easy to see at the end of one or two years whether the predictions were correct; whether, after allowing for such marginal changes in the price of imports or changes in taxation that might occur, the staffs of companies would actually have as much more money to spend by asking for what would correspond to the increase in the growth of production, as asking for twice as much and losing half of it.  As I said, all my colleagues have for many years asked the public to accept this concept, at least as an experiment.  We, in common with a great many other governments, have failed to persuade the people to engage in the experiment.</P>
    <P>We can look at some countries where the experiment has been undertaken and has proved successful.  At least it has proved successful for a few years, even though there was a breakdown later on and there was a period of inflation which had again to be corrected. One can see the results in some European countries, where no one <Col N="2545" /> could say that the staffs of all the enterprises in that country had suffered in the slightest degree in the sense that their standards of living had evidently grown just as much as or more than ours had over a period.  No one can say that the way of life of these people, their privileges, in some of the countries where this effort is being made and where it succeeded, hold out any dismal warning to any one here who wished to adopt the system.</P>
    <P>I have been to most of these countries and I have talked with trade unions as well as with employers' representatives, whom I was meeting not as Minister for Labour but as Minister for Transport and Power or having some other responsibility.  I never found discontent with this orderly system of wage and salary and income growth.  I never found that anyone in these countries felt he had been deprived of something to which he was entitled.</P>
    <P>There has been, of course, in these countries a tremendous growth of employment because the periods during which severe competition was faced through excessive wage and salary costs were more limited than they were in other countries where the rules were not observed and where the inflation seemed to be almost continuous.  These countries only survived because inflation took place in other countries and so they were given a breathing space in which to continue exporting, thus preventing an undue or hopelessly excessive distortion in price levels in relation to their exports.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have asked the public to look again at this whole question, particularly now that the rate of inflation is severe, more severe than it has been for some years.  When we ask for all-round co-operation in regard to inflation, that is reasonable and nobody can say we are trying to deceive the people.  We have always been frank about it and managed to survive.  Our economy has managed to grow because either there was inflation in England, which temporarily enabled us to face our own economic difficulties, or else the growth of industrial production was sufficient to tide us over <Col N="2546" /> difficulties which might occur in some particular industries.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the Government will not flinch from taking the necessary action, whatever it may be, to control inflation and, although naturally we would not wish thereby to cause excessive unemployment or to halt the economic growth that has been so evident since 1958, a record economic growth never seen before, nevertheless any disinflationary action always hurts.  One cannot kill inflation without hurting someone to some extent.  I would hope that we would get the maximum co-operation, particularly in regard to any wage and salary agreements made from the end of this year onwards.  The more we can do on a voluntary basis the better it will be.  If prices, profits, wages and salaries are examined together by a board, such as that proposed by the NIEC, and if satisfactory agreements can be entered into as a result of that examination, this would seem the best way of making progress.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would once again inform Deputy Donegan and others that they will be grievously disappointed if they imagine for one moment that the Fianna Fáil Government as at present established will neither have the effective support of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party or will be unable to face the economic issues that come upon us.  I can assure the Opposition that they will be grievously disappointed by the final outcome of the Government of this country in the next 12 months.</P>

The Chair must try to keep a balanced debate and, when Deputy Kavanagh gives up his right, that does not give him the right to nominate anybody to speak.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood and I put it to the Ceann Comhairle while he was here: whether the Minister, who was called before me, was called by convention or by the decision of the Chair.  The Chair finally called the Minister without, I think, really deciding whether it was convention or otherwise, having mentioned that there was a 40-year convention. Subsequently I inquired as to whether, in fact, calling would go around the House again, as it habitually does, and I was told that it did not necessarily follow it would.  I then asked was it likely two members from the same party might be called in succession and I was told it could happen.  As I understand it, Deputy Kavanagh has made a gesture because he consulted with Deputy Tully and found what I said earlier was correct.  I would not wish that Deputy Kavanagh, who has been very decent in this matter in offering to make way for me, should be penalised.  Deputy Kavanagh made the gesture in the mistaken belief that I would be called and it was on that basis he was prepared to forego his opportunity to speak.  Things have not worked out in that way and I would suggest to the Chair that Deputy Kavanagh should not now be asked to forego his opportunity because he was mistakenly prepared to forego it in the light of what happened earlier.</P>

      <P>This session of the Dáil ends either with a debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate or on a motion that the Dáil do adjourn for a given period.  In either event the debate is availed of by the House to review the activities of the Government party over the 12 months just ended.  It appears that this 12 months coincides roughly with the first anniversary of the election of the present Government.  Therefore, this debate affords the House an opportunity of reviewing and assessing the record of the Government in the last 12 months in the light of the promises made to the people in June last and on foot of which the Government were elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a general election held on 18th June, 1969, and I firmly believe <Col N="2550" /> that at that time the people were itching for a change of Government because they believed it was essential for the country.  In fact, this party campaigned vigorously on the basis that the outgoing Government were in power for too long and that if we were to continue to enjoy healthy democracy there should be a change.  We campaigned on the basis that the outgoing Government were out of touch with the people and that certain named Ministers had become arrogant and had come to believe they had a Godgiven right to run this country and their various Departments as they saw fit.  It may be no harm to say that in that campaign we named a number of Ministers: the then Minister for Local Government, now Deputy Boland; the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, now Deputy Blaney; the then Minister for Justice, now Deputy Moran, and the then Minister for Finance, now Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>We campaigned strongly on these lines but, unfortunately, due to the attitude of the Labour Party the people thought they had no alternative but to return Fianna Fáil to power.  The people were encouraged in that belief in the campaign that was conducted vigorously, expensively and lavishly by Fianna Fáil and the present Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch.  The people were assured then that there were dangerous days ahead and that there were economic difficulties that could be dealt with only by a Government formed by a united party and dedicated to pursue vigorously clear and well-defined policies. The House need not take my word for that because I propose to put on the record of the House the appeal made by Fianna Fáil&mdash;I make no apology for doing so in this debate because if ever there was justification for a cool, calm and critical assessment of the performance of the Government in the past 12 months now is the time.  Into every constituency in the Republic of Ireland last May and June the following appeal was sent&mdash;under a photograph of the Taoiseach there was a heading &ldquo;An election message from the Taoiseach&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The years immediately ahead will be a period of great challenge and <Col N="2551" /> great opportunity.  On the domestic front and outside in our relations with the European countries and with the rest of the world, problems and difficulties will arise for solution by Government and people alike. Only a united Government, vigorously and resolutely pursuing clearly-defined policies endorsed by the people and supported by a secure majority in the Dáil, can face these problems and overcome these difficulties. Fianna Fáil can be relied on by the people to provide that kind of Government and to take the decisions which the testing years ahead will demand.  We confidently ask the voters in this election to renew their confidence in the Government and to give Fianna Fáil a clear and decisive mandate.</P>
    <P>That was the Taoiseach's message to the Irish people immediately before the last general election.  The Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party realised that the remainder of 1969 and 1970 would present many economic problems. They realised that only a united Government which would vigorously and resolutely pursue clearly-defined policies could tackle the economic difficulties.  The Taoiseach undertook on his own behalf and on behalf of his party to provide the leadership.  On the strength of that manifesto and that assurance the people returned Fianna Fáil to power with 75 seats in this House, thereby conferring on them an overall majority to tackle the problems which they said existed, in the way they promised.</P>
    <P>It is opportune for us 12 months later to ask ourselves if these economic problems have been solved and, if not, if the Government did their best to solve them?  Did the Government, elected by the people, act as a united Government, vigorously and resolutely attempting to solve the nation's problems. The last 12 months have proved that the Government have failed miserably, and even disgracefully, to discharge their obligations to the people. The Taoiseach is the person who must take the blame as he is the man on whose word the people returned Fianna Fáil to power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2552" /> I would ask the House to consider the performance of the Government in the light of those promises.  In the economic field we have raging inflation and we have the worst possible industrial relations, resulting in strike after strike, with a loss of 900,000 working days, the increase in our export prices being the highest of any country quoted by Córas Tráchtála and the increase in the volume of our imports being less than half that of the next lowest country quoted by Córas Tráchtála.  Our percentage increase in unit wage cost is over double that of the next highest country quoted by the Central Bank. These figures are not my figures.  These figures are presented to the nation by the reports recently released of two semi-State bodies who usually are fair to the Government.</P>
    <P>In the report of the Central Bank for 1969-70, we see that, in 1969, we had the maintenance men's strike from 21st January, 1969, to 10th March, 1969.  Admittedly it was before the last general election but nevertheless it was during a period when the Taoiseach and his Ministers were in charge. We had the cement strike from 2nd February, 1970, to 26th June, 1970, which cost the country a tremendous amount in man hours, in working days. We have the bank strike in progress since 1st May, 1970, to date&mdash;not to mention the RTE strike, the teachers' strike and many other strikes.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Government are doing enough to deal with strikes or industrial relations.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach or his Minister for Labour to come in here and to say that they cannot interfere until all the procedures available to the parties have been availed of and exhausted when the cement strike had gone on from 2nd February, 1970, to 26th June, 1970.  When building operations would have been held up, when people would have been put out of employment and when grave inconvenience and substantial loss would have been caused to the country, the Minister for Labour could move in then and get it settled. Why did he not move in earlier?  If the present procedures are inadequate why are they not amended?</P>
    <P>The bank strike has now gone on <Col N="2553" /> since 1st May, 1970.  Despite the fact that these so-called procedures for resolving these strikes have all been availed of by the bank directors and the bank staff, the people are still held up to ransom.  The economy of the country is being damaged.  People are taking French leave with credit at a time when we are told there is grave need for credit restrictions.  We know that, after the last bank strike, it was found that credit had been availed of much more generously when the banks were closed than when the banks were open.  Surely the bank directors cannot have the check or the neck to return any cheque issued in a <i>bona fide</i> manner during the bank closure.</P>
    <P>The Minister or the Taoiseach has not intervened in the bank strike yet. Indeed, it would appear from the Taoiseach's remarks in this House that he considers it in some way or another beneath him, and out of keeping with the dignity of his office, to interfere in this strike.  Surely this is a strike that is crippling the economy of the country? Surely it is a strike that calls for Government action especially when both the bank directors and the staff of the banks have said they have done all they can to resolve it and both sides are calling on the Government and the Minister to come in and do their stuff and they will not do it?  I do not know what sorts of procedures they have across the water for dealing with these strikes but I do know that Ministers of State there do not think it beneath them, or do not think it outside the scope of their duties, to get in and take off their coats and do what they can even before these strikes commence&mdash; as we saw in the case of the dock strike a short time ago.  So much for strikes.  I believe the Government have failed there and failed very badly.  I believe that, even at this late stage, the Minister for Labour or the Taoiseach himself should intervene in the bank strike and prevent it from going on for another month or into the autumn.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report shows that, in manufacturing industries, the percentage changes in unit wage costs in the major industrial countries and in Ireland are as follows: The increase in 1969 over 1968 in Ireland was 10.9 <Col N="2554" /> per cent.  The next highest country was Italy and the increase there was less than half our increase, only 5.3 per cent.  I shall put on the record the increases in the other countries named here.  In the United States of America, the increase was 2.8 per cent; in Japan, 2 per cent; in Germany, 4 per cent; in France, only .9 per cent; in Italy, 5.3 per cent; in the United Kingdom, 4.5 per cent and in Ireland it was 10.9 per cent.  That is not a very creditable performance especially on the threshold of our entry into the Common Market where we shall have to fight for markets, where we shall have to compete with the other countries mentioned there.  Is it any wonder, then, that, on page 96 of the Bank report, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The result of this process is that the Irish factor incomes led by employee remuneration have increased rapidly during the past decade not-withstanding the steady increase in productivity of about 3½ per cent a year.  The price level has risen at a rate faster than most of the advanced countries.</P>
    <P>Here is the significant statement:</P>
    <P>Indeed, it seems likely that, when the 1969 and 1970 price rises in Ireland are compared with those abroad, this country will be seen to have risen to the top of the table of international price increases.</P>
    <P>That is our record on the eve of our entering into the Common Market where we shall have to compete, as I say, with the other countries mentioned there whose price cost increase is only a fraction of ours.</P>
    <P>In support of the statement I have already made, Córas Tráchtála, the Irish export board, whose report was also issued the other day, speaking of export performance for 1968-69, said that the volume increase in exports for a number of countries is as follows: Britain and Northern Ireland, 10.65 per cent; Germany, 13 per cent; France, 17 per cent; Italy, 17 per cent; the Netherlands, 14.5 per cent; Belgium, 16.5 per cent; and Ireland, 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is another alarming statement, another statement that certainly gives <Col N="2555" /> food for thought, at this time when we have decided to use our best efforts to get into the Common Market.  These reports I have referred to have been quoted at length during this debate but I think those extracts are adequate to show that, in the industrial field for the past 12 months, we have nothing to be proud of here.  For the past 12 months the difficult times mentioned by the Taoiseach have not been arrested.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have been playing politics, a very dangerous game to play, with the economy.  They have been playing politics with the economy for the past number of years. The man who started off the game was the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, who was elected to lead on.  He started these dangerous gambling tactics after the introduction of the turnover tax and on the eve of the vital by-elections &mdash;vital to the very existence of the Government&mdash;in Cork and Kildare. He started this playacting with the economy on that occasion.  He started a game of make believe.</P>
    <P>I remember the time we heard from those benches that the national cake had grown to enormous proportions and it would be unfair to deprive any section of the community of their fair share of it.  The only thing wrong with that argument was that the national cake was really only a bun but it was being presented as a five-tier wedding cake.  That is where it began.  That cannot be contradicted.  It has gone on since.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully and attentively to the Taoiseach's speech yesterday in moving the adjournment of the House until 28th October.  He dealt with three matters: inflation, industrial relations and the position in the north.  God is my judge and I came to the conclusion that the poor man was glad he had the north to talk about because it got him away from the other two sore subjects, inflation and industrial relations. That was the impression he gave me.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about inflation.  When the Taoiseach was introducing his Budget a few months ago&mdash;a Budget not prepared by himself but by his <Col N="2556" /> Minister for Finance whom he relieved of his portfolio that morning&mdash;he read out the first half of the Budget speech and he dealt paragraph by paragraph with inflation and the dangers of inflation and what would have to be done about it.  He warned all and sundry in the opening pages of that speech about the evils which attended the inflation which was developing here.</P>
    <P>Did he do anything in the Budget to curb that inflation?  We all sat here spellbound waiting for what I will call the business end of the Budget to see what steps would be taken to curb inflation.  Not alone were no such steps taken but, on the contrary, when the Government came to the business of providing the money to run the country they did so by means of an increase in the turnover tax.  I do not profess to be an economist, but anybody who knows anything about economics says that that very process was calculated to fan the flames of the inflation about which we were warned in the first pages of the Budget speech.  That was a very strange method of dealing with inflation.</P>
    <P>For the past number of years the Government and many State-sponsored bodies have been borrowing large sums of money abroad, bringing that money in here, and pumping it into the economy.  Surely that was calculated to create inflation or to aggravate inflation. Yesterday the Taoiseach at some length dealt with inflation again and, indeed, the Tánaiste who spoke before me spent most of his time dealing with inflation.  What cure had either of them for it?  Are they going to do anything about it?  Do they think that by talking about it they will frighten it away and it will disappear?  That seems to me to be what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I have told the House what I think of the industrial position, the export position and the manufacturing costs position.  What are the Government doing to deal with those problems? Within the past few months we saw a senior Minister, Deputy Colley, removed from the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Say what we like about Deputy Colley, he is a senior, experienced Minister.  He was removed from that position at a time <Col N="2557" /> when the Department of Industry and Commerce surely needed the best brains available within the Government.</P>
    <P>He was replaced by Deputy Lalor who is a decent man, a likeable man and, in my opinion, an honest man, but I do not think that even Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, would claim that he has the long experience, or the know-how, or the knowledge, or the training to deal with this gigantic task which is thrown into his lap, the Department of Industry and Commerce, with the economy in a mess.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry is one of our major industries and the present Government have failed in their duty to organise that industry to the best advantage of the nation.  The summer we are now going through has been the worst for many years for tourism. There is no difficulty in getting hotel accommodation in Dublin city.  I am told the same applies in Galway, Donegal, Killarney and many other parts of the country.  Some of this we are told is due to the troubles in the north which developed last August.  To some extent, I believe that is so but I also believe that a further substantial contributing factor is the bad publicity that the Republic of Ireland received in the world press over the past six months.  The picture of a Government engaged in gun-running, of unsettled conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am not referring to individual cases. However, I shall confine myself to saying that the world press has presented the Republic of Ireland as an unsettled place in the past few months.  Anybody knows that such publicity is bad for the tourist business.  A few years ago there were rumours of&mdash;I think&mdash; Basque trouble in part of Spain.  I knew people who intended holidaying in Spain but although this trouble might have been only a fleabite it got substantial publicity and people were deterred from going there.  That was bad for the tourist business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complete failure of the Government <Col N="2558" /> to attract tourists here by making conditions more favourable for them is also a contributing factor.  We have now ceased to hold our favourable position regarding petrol, cigarettes, drink and even hotel accommodation as compared with the neighbouring country from where the vast majority of our tourists come. That is bad organisation.  What have the Government done in regard to the falling-off in tourism this year?  Have they done anything?  I think I am not being unfair or unreasonable if I go on record as saying that the Government have done nothing or, indeed, less than nothing, because Deputy Lenihan, Minister for Transport and Power, came into this House and brazenly denied until he could do so no longer that there was any falling-off in tourist business here.  Until Dr. O'Driscoll&mdash;I think&mdash;and other responsible sources ventilated the fact that we were having a bad tourist season it was not admitted if, indeed, admission was needed by the people to whom it mattered, the hoteliers, guesthousekeepers and those in the tourist business. They felt the pinch and they knew all about it.  I accuse the Government of failing to do anything about the tourist business this year.  I understand that the amount spent by Bord Fáilte on marketing the tourist business is down this year in many countries as compared with other years but, be that as it may, if the Government knew there was danger of a drop in tourism, whether due to the Northern Ireland troubles or our domestic troubles or to price increases or any other reason, it was their bounden duty to mount a massive tourist drive and use emergency methods if necessary to deal with an emergency situation this year.  They did not do it and on that they must stand condemned.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time there has been a drift towards crime in this country.  We seem to have less respect for law and order than was previously the case.  There seems to be unrest among the youth: we have unorthodox methods of protest being used, possession being taken of buildings, of houses, of land and property.  We have sits-in and squats.  There is grave concern among responsible people about <Col N="2559" /> all this and, let us not put a tooth on it, I believe that responsible opinion is sick, sore and fed up with these unorthodox protests and the taking of possession of private and public buildings by colourful characters who are supposed to be campaigning for some genuine or imaginary right.  It appears that the law dealing with this type of activity needs to be strengthened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am dealing with the Bill that is on the stocks and has not come before the House.  There may be genuine differences of opinion as to how this matter should be dealt with.  People are entitled to have different views.  A Bill dealing with forcible entry was introduced some time ago and we are adjourning this House without dealing with it.  I am not saying whether I agree with this Bill or do not agree with it.  I am not saying whether it needs amendment or does not need amendment.  However, I want to go on record as saying it deals with a topic that badly needs discussion in this House, and we are adjourning without dealing with it.</P>
      <P>One of the matters that led to the type of activity about which I have spoken was the exercise by the Minister for Local Government of his appeal powers under the Town Planning Act of 1963.  This party here pointed out in this House and elsewhere that the appeal provisions of that Act were undemocratic and were being used by the Minister in charge of them for political purposes.  We introduced in this House a Private Members' Bill to take those appeal powers from the Minister for Local Government and transfer them to an independent tribunal.  The Government party insisted that that Bill should be dealt with in Private Members' time and they eventually voted to refuse it a Second Reading, and it got no further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2560" /> Months ago&mdash;I do not know the exact date&mdash;this Government introduced the Local Government Planning and Development Bill (No. 2) 1969 which proposed to go some of the way that we had suggested it was necessary to go, but that Bill has not been proceeded with, and you will note, Sir, it is entitled the Local Government Planning and Development Bill (No. 2) 1969, and we are adjourning now at the end of July, 1970 for three months without having dealt with that very necessary piece of legislation.  I am mentioning that precise piece of legislation because that Bill was not passed and it is because the Minister for Local Government was not properly discharging his duties as an appellate tribunal that we have some of the protests about which I have been complaining forced on the people of this city.  If that Bill had been passed and justice had been done on the question of planning appeals and had been seen to be done, we might not have had this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable talk in the course of this debate on the position in Northern Ireland.  I do not think that any protracted or inflammatory discussion here would be calculated to improve matters in Northern Ireland, but I do want to make some responsible reference to it.  There is no Irishman worthy of the name who does not long for the day when he shall have a united Ireland, when the national territory will be restored.  However, we in this party believe, and have always believed, that that restoration and that happy state of affairs can only be brought about by goodwill and by free choice and that any attempt to use physical force will, instead of attaining its object, put off further that happy day.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years I have been thinking of this matter and I know that certain well-intentioned, high-principled people believe that the Border could and should have been avoided.  When I look to Northern Ireland and try to assess the attitude of two-thirds of the people there in this year of 1970 to a proposal to bring them into an all-Ireland Republic I ask myself: what must their attitude have been 50 years ago?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2561" /> I was looking for a note and I mislaid it, but the Taoiseach in speaking on this matter yesterday referred to fear which developed into hatred, which developed into bloodshed.  I want to ask: what engenders fear, the fear genuinely held by most of the people in Northern Ireland?  In my opinion that fear is begotten by ignorance, gross ignorance.  Many people in Northern Ireland, sufficient people to carry the day, believe that home rule is Rome rule.  I believe that those people up there believe that the Catholic majority here hate the Protestant minority, that the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland believe that if they were to come into a United Ireland they could hope for nothing but a raw deal, discrimination and to be treated as second-class or third-class citizens. We, the Members of this House, know that fear is completely unfounded and unjustified.  Nevertheless, it is genuinely held by those people.  Some of the most rugged-minded of the people of Northern Ireland live reserved and quiet lives, but they have been fed with this philosophy down through the years.  Therefore, it is not entirely our fault and it is not entirely their fault if they believe what I think they believe, and that, in my opinion, is what is making the unification of this country more difficult.  I believe, too, that we who attained freedom in this country nearly 50 years ago cannot entirely absolve ourselves from responsibility for the feelings held by those people in Northern Ireland and for their attitude towards us.</P>
    <P>In the early 1930s we built up a tariff wall between what is now the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We killed all commercial activities between one part of the island and the other.  Once commercial intercourse and commercial activity ceased, there was no longer any need for people from the north to come to the south, nor for people from the south to go to the north.  Instead of getting to know each other better, instead of getting to know each other's way of life better, the two peoples&mdash;that, of course, is an inaccuracy because they are not two peoples, they are one people&mdash;but for the purpose of what I am saying the people of Northern Ireland and the <Col N="2562" /> people of the Republic were driven further apart.  They became more estranged.  They grew to know less about each other and the people who have grown up in the last 40 years&mdash; and that is the section of the people of Northern Ireland and the people of the Republic of Ireland who count&mdash;are complete strangers to each other.</P>
    <P>I was born and reared, as I said in this House previously, nearer to Northern Ireland than practically anybody who is a Member of this House. I was born and reared within one mile of the river that divides the County Monaghan from the County Fermanagh. I should have a better opportunity of knowing and understanding the people of Northern Ireland than most people but do I?  Had I ever any reason to travel in Northern Ireland?  Was the Border not there?  Were the custom huts not there?  Were there not people there to detect smuggling?  Was it not illegal to bring goods from Fermanagh to Monaghan and was it not illegal to bring lots of goods from Monaghan to Fermanagh?  That is the sort of situation that the 40 years old and under in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland have grown up in.  Is it any wonder they do not know each other?  Is it any wonder they do not understand each other?  Is it any wonder they mistrust each other?</P>
    <P>It did not end there because although there were tariff walls built up, it was still possible for leading people in this part of the country to visit Northern Ireland and mix with the people there and <i>vice versa</i> but they did not do it. It was a major news item if a member of the Government of this country went to Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa.</i>  That is the situation that I honestly believe is responsible for the attitude of the rugged northern Protestants and I believe that until that is killed and until that attitude is cured we will not be able to do what we would like to do&mdash;restore the national territory in a peaceful way.</P>
    <P>It did not end there either because, as Deputy Cosgrave said yesterday, when we enacted our Constitution in 1937 we wrote into it for the first time Article 44 which, although meaning nothing, although conferring no benefit <Col N="2563" /> on anybody, although conferring no privilege on the Catholic Church in this country, although it only contains so much verbiage, contained words which insulted the Protestants of Northern Ireland and, more important, constituted an instrument for the people at the top in Northern Ireland with a vested interest to beat and use against the proposal to unify the country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any inflammatory speeches on either side of the Border are serving any useful purpose. I said in this House&mdash;and I am on record as saying a couple of years ago &mdash;that Deputy Blaney was, in effect, the Ian Paisley of southern politics.  I probably would not say that here tonight were it not for the fact that he is in the House.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  By that I meant to convey that Deputy Blaney holds views as strong and expresses them as ruggedly on this side of the Border as the other gentleman does in the opposite direction on the other side of the Border. No doubt both of those people hold these extreme views about attaining their objects honestly and conscientiously but both of them are wrong.  The man below believes that home rule is Rome rule, that the Pope is a bad article, that Catholics are evil people, that the Catholic religion is a dangerous conspiracy.  That is what he is preaching in Northern Ireland and undoubtedly he has succeeded in instilling that into the people who had not an opportunity, because of the iron curtain of tariffs of which I have spoken, of coming up here and seeing for themselves.  He is wrong and I do not agree with him.  Deputy Blaney, on the other hand, believes that the only way of dealing with the Rev. Paisley and those who subscribe to his philosophy is apparently to blow them out of it.  That is equally wrong and it will not get any place.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We are asked to adjourn this House until the 28th October.  If ever there was an occasion on which we should be slow to adjourn the House unconditionally this is it.  Usually when people decide to go on an extended holiday they try to ensure that their desk is tidy and that everything that requires to be done has been brought up to date.  They also try to leave behind them some responsible person or people to look after the business.  Here we are proposing to adjourn at a time when there are many things to be attended to.  I have pointed to the Planning and Development Act, to the Forcible Entry Bill which should be discussed, and the important debate on the Common Market which has been adjourned, and there are other Bills which were introduced and have not been dealt with.</P>
      <P>We are proposing to adjourn at a time when at any moment a dangerous situation could arise either here or in the north.  I hope it will not.  We are leaving in charge of the economy and the affairs of the country not a united Government or a united party but a Government kept in office by a divided party, a Cabinet divided within itself. Indeed it may be that some members of the Government, some high up members of the Government, believe that there is unity within the Fianna Fáil Party and within the Cabinet, because about an hour ago we had the unprecedented experience of having the Tánaiste and a senior Member of his party both offering to speak and neither would withdraw.  The Tánaiste held his ground and the other Member insisted that he was entitled to speak and left the House.  In spite of that, the Tánaiste in what was apparently a prepared speech&mdash;he did not read it out but is consisted of thoughts which he had formulated in his mind&mdash; started by chastising Deputy Donegan for daring to suggest that there was any title of disunity in the Fianna Fáil Party or that the Cabinet or the Government were anything but united.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any thing unfair in my drawing <Col N="2568" /> attention to that?  The Tánaiste said he would never live to see the day when the Fianna Fáil Party would break up or become disunited, while, at that very moment, we see with our own eyes members walking away from the second-in-command of that party. These are people in charge of this country at a time when serious problems have to be dealt with.  That is the sort of government that is there to deal with these problems.  I do not think this is right and, if the Taoiseach wishes to hold on to the leadership of the party and to the position of Taoiseach, and if he insists on adjourning this House until 28th October, he should at least give a solemn assurance in public here in this House to the leader of the Fine Gael Party and to the leader of the Labour Party that if they ask to have the House recalled to discuss something of national importance the House will be recalled.  That is the least we should expect from this unusual Government in these very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that requires to be corrected is Deputy Fitzpatrick's reference to the Adjournment. I presume that the party to which Deputy Fitzpatrick belongs and the Whip of that party were a party to the arrangement to adjourn this week until 28th October.  If that is so, it comes rather strangely from this man of great honesty and integrity that he should make a last plea as he sits down to show why the House should not adjourn when he and his party were a party to the agreement that it should adjourn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I begin to talk on matters of really serious import in this particular debate, I want to refer to a few of the matters mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick in order to put them in their proper perspective.  The Deputy talked about the serious situation in the country. He talked about the tourist industry and what has befallen that industry. He did not advert to the aid and assistance he and a number of his colleagues have given over recent months towards placing that industry in a difficult position.  He did not advert to the manner in which he and his minions <Col N="2569" /> have peddled around the country during the last two or three months the danger of civil war in this country. That is really a laugh, but it seems to suit the book of those who go peddling these wild stories.  This is what the Deputy was doing at the beginning of last May.  I have no doubt that since then he has not taken anything from it in his wanderings around his own county, whether near the Border or far from it.</P>
    <P>I would also say to the Deputy that in his thoughts, as expressed here, of what other people have said he has been anything but honest in attributing to me certain beliefs that he says I hold and he had not the good manners, the good sense or the honesty to withdraw when challenged.  Rather he tried to put another construction on them. When he sees the report of his speech he will have some correcting to do in order to make his assertion tally with what he said later.  We have known Deputy Fitzpatrick over quite a considerable period and for me, at any rate, it is nothing new to find the Deputy waffling in this manner and trying to attribute to people things they never said, but always with a certain amount of truth showing through just to make what he says appear credible.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to discuss the most important matter for discussion in this debate, namely, the Six Counties and related problems, I should like to mention a few other matters of importance here.  I should like to start with the situation, as I know it to have existed for some considerable time now, and to ask if we might be enlightened somewhat before this debate ends.  I speak of happenings that perturb me, Members of this House and the public generally. I am concerned about phone tapping in this little statelet of ours. Phone tapping was alleged months ago. As I understand it, it was apparently given to us to understand at that time that it had not taken place.  My information since then is that very definitely it has been taking place.  What I want to know is the circumstances in which phone tapping is, in fact, legal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that the phone number of no <Col N="2570" /> member of the Oireachtas was being tapped.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the situation in regard to the legal tapping of a phone?  Is there a ministerial warrant required for it?  Have such warrants been signed and, if so, how many during the past six months?  How many of them are in existence and still operating today?  Or is there any?  Or is there phone tapping going on without warrants and, therefore, illegally?  At whose instance and by whose authority is such tapping being done if the ordinary process of the law by way of warrant from the Minister for Justice is not being adhered to?  This is a matter of grave importance to the House and to the public and we are, I think, entitled to know just what the answers are to these few questions in regard to this particular matter, a matter on which everybody feels strongly, I am sure, as I do, something everybody would dislike and would wish to discourage.  If it has to be done, it should be properly controlled and not done by people who do not have any allegiance to this House and no allegiance to the public outside so far as we know.  Neither do we know who they are or the authority they work under.  If there is no illegal tapping of phones, I shall be very glad to hear that that is so, but I have very good reason to believe that that is not the case, and that phone tapping has been practised, that it has not been practised legally and it, therefore, requires an explanation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest that the watching of people, keeping people under surveillance by the Special Branch, is on the increase.  It may well be only a rumour that 200 additional Special Branch men were sought to be recruited from the Garda in the last couple of months.  It may well be also that a Special Branch is necessary, but I wonder is there a special Special Branch?  Is there a branch that is, in fact, based on ex-members of the Special Branch and, if so, who recruits these people?  Who are they?  To whom do they owe their allegiance? <Col N="2571" /> Who pays them?  What is their job and under what authority do they work?  Is there such a special force? Is there, in fact, a B Special force in this country and has there been such a force for a considerable time?  Is it under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice, of our Government and our Parliament, or is it not?  I would be very glad to know that such a force does not exist but, again, rumour is very strong that it does not exist, that it is composed of people, who have given service in the past in the Special Branch, who have retired and who are now operating in this new additional special Special Branch, or B Special branch, if we may call it that for identification purposes.</P>
    <P>I wonder also how many of the Deputies of this House are aware that Special Branch men are still roaming through the corridors of this House and that you are likely to sit at the table next to them in our own restaurant here, without knowing who they are, and that you may find yourself having a drink in the Visitors' Bar and you may find some of them there as well.  Under what authority and on whose authority are they brought into this House and for what purpose?  Is it the job of the Ceann Comhairle, the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard to look after the security of this House?  Has the myth of this civil strife gone so far that these people must be brought in to roam about this House, looking to see what the various Deputies are doing?  Do they exist or is it a myth?  I think there is a great deal of substance in it and for the benefit of all we might find out a little more about them, who they are, who sent them here, and under whose authority is the security of this House actually placed?</P>
    <P>In view of all the developments we have heard and read about in recent months, I would query how active have these forces been in apprehending the murderers of Dick Fallon?  This murder was witnessed by some members of these forces and yet the people involved in this murder escaped the net.  What progress has been made in this matter or are our forces engaged <Col N="2572" /> to such a degree that they cannot concentrate on a murder as blatant as this one, that took place in broad daylight and in the view of a number of our peace-keeping forces in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Could we also inquire what has happened in regard to the document that was produced by Deputy Cosgrave, purporting to have come from a Garda member on Garda paper?  Who provided that document to Deputy Cosgrave? What efforts have been made to find out whether this document was given to an unauthorised person by a member of the force that was supposed to be keeping law and order and looking after the security of this nation?  It would satisfy the public to know that real progress has been made in trying to detect how such a document could come into the hands of an unauthorised person, regardless of his standing.  Regardless of the status of Deputy Cosgrave, he was an unauthorised person.  I should like to know if the person responsible has been dismissed or if he has even been detected. If not, have efforts been made to find him and, if he is found, will he be dismissed from the force for overstepping his duty in supplying information to an unauthorised person?</P>
    <P>Finally, may I refer to a statement made in the House some weeks ago which I did not anticipate it would be my responsibility to mention.  It is in connection with the assertion made by Deputy L'Estrange some weeks ago, casting reflection by innuendo and inference on the integrity of a district justice in the carrying out of his duty, namely, District Justice Kearns.  On the 14th July, as recorded at column 979, volume 248 of the Official Report, Deputy L'Estrange asked the Minister for Justice:</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think it was right that one of the most junior justices in the country was appointed to what is probably one of the most serious trials we have had in this State for a long number of years?  Is he further aware that this particular justice's mother is a very near friend of Deputy Neil Blaney?</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Malley: It is not my function, as the Deputy knows, to <Col N="2573" /> assign justices to particular cases. That is done by the President of the District Court.</P>
    <P>Not to be outdone, Deputy L'Estrange replied:</P>
    <P>One would think a senior justice would have been appointed.</P>
    <P>I want to tie up this remark by Deputy L'Estrange with his previous assertion. He then said: &ldquo;People are beginning to ask questions&rdquo;.  One can put this with the tail-end of his first paragraph in which he mentioned that the justice's mother was my friend, and it was obvious that he was speaking about the justice who had sat on the bench in the court in which I was discharged a few days before.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that nobody in this House, either in the Government or in the Chair, should have stood up and asserted the right of this House to ensure that this kind of innuendo is not cast on members of the bench.  I was amazed that I should have to come in and say I had made inquiries about the justice's mother&mdash;I am glad to know she is still alive, she is 87 years&mdash; and not to my knowledge nor to her knowledge was there any friendship whatever established between this person and myself or anybody belonging to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange can get this on record, with his innuendo that this alleged friendship would have influenced the district justice to carry out his duties in a manner other than what should be expected from a member of the bench.  It is scandalous that more than two weeks have passed and nobody in this House has taken notice of that innuendo.  It is not to be wondered at, if this kind of practice is allowed in this House, that we had a report last week of remarks regarding the reluctance of judges to take certain cases.  That is not surprising if this kind of blackguardism in regard to those who carry out their duties is allowed to go unheeded.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on a matter that is topical and, without doubt, most important at the present time, namely the situation in regard to the Six Counties and Partition.  I want to make <Col N="2574" /> it clear that I shall not be diverted in any way by the innuendoes and inferences of the past few months, that by speaking of this matter I am inciting and inflaming the situation.  It appears to be in order for some people to speak in a certain way, but it is not allowed to others to speak in their way.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in the Six Counties, unparalleled since its establishment, in that after 50 years of trial and error&mdash;mostly grave errors&mdash;the regime in Belfast is tottering on the brink of extinction and we should recognise this to be the case.  Instead of trying to bolster it up by gestures of co-operation we should be telling the world about how the sorry impasse has been reached and that it is the culmination of 50 years of misrule, discrimination in jobs and housing that has brought this about.  Those 50 years of failure by Stormont Government have shown the total myth that Partition was a solution to the Irish question when it was imposed many years ago. Partition has failed utterly to work and the actions and words of those who would hang on to office in the Six Counties are indicative of a group who no longer believe they can hang on to the power they have been given by Partition.  That power has been sustained by the British Government and maintained by the force of arms of the Crown in all those years.</P>
    <P>At this time we should be trying to get across this fact to the British people.  If they fully appreciated the facts surrounding the Six County situation they would not stand for what is happening.  I am firmly convinced that, if the British people knew what has been perpetrated in their name during the years, the British Government would be forced to begin undoing what they did 50 years ago.  They would be forced to begin the ending of Partition, without which beginning there can be no real peace in this country.  We should keep this fact in mind.  The years have shown that there is no way around the difficulties and the strife that not infrequently flares up in the Six Counties.  Britain by her arms and money has maintained Partition which she imposed many years ago.  She may have had good reason for imposing it <Col N="2575" /> then.  She may have had some military reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anybody in Britain today, particularly in its Government, who believes or feels that there is anything to be gained from a continuance of the partition of this land of ours and that there is a great deal to be lost.  International public opinion is being lost to the British people at a time when they badly want it.  Hundreds of millions of pounds are being poured in, to try to sustain this tottering Government which is that of Stormont.  This situation is demanding more and more troops which the British Government do not have and cannot afford even if they were there. These are good reasons why they should wish to part with the whole thing and the whole situation that is the Six Counties today.  We should be helping to educate their public.  We should bring it to their notice, as a Government, that their public and their voters want an end to Partition; that they want an end to paying taxes additional to what they would otherwise be called upon to pay in order to sustain something which is shameful in the eyes of the world.  Surely this is the role we should be playing but to a much greater degree than we are prepared to do at the moment or that we are doing at the moment.  Surely we ourselves, here, should keep in mind that the bringing an end to that situation, and that the emergence of the beginning of the end of Partition, will bring about the true friendship that can exist and should exist between the two island peoples of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>This, to those who would depict me as otherwise, may come strangely from me but this I firmly believe&mdash;that they need us as much as we need them.  In the shrinking Europe of the future, in the days when Europe will be united and in the days when Britain and ourselves may well be members of that united European Community, surely our people and the British people should in every sense, be capable of standing together as two island peoples on the fringe of that great population in Europe&mdash;able to stand together, to help each other because remember <Col N="2576" /> there will not be many others who necessarily will have the same interests in us as we might have in each other. It behoves them to end Partition now. It behoves us to help them to bring about the situation where Partition can begin to run itself down.  That beginning. I believe, can peaceably be brought about only in the British Government's being brought to the point where they would say, in effect: &ldquo;As and from a certain date&rdquo; whether one year or five years' hence, &ldquo;the British armed forces are being taken out of the Six Counties.  In so far as the financial support that is now being poured in, in endless millions, is concerned, it will be phased out over the next five, ten or 15 years&rdquo;.  If those two dates were written up, I have not the slightest doubt that the people in the Six Counties who are in control today, and our people in Government here, would, within a matter of a year or two at the most, be able to sit down and work out our own salvation among ourselves without any blood bath or any further trouble of the nature we have experienced in these recent months.  This I firmly and sincerely believe.  I believe it is the way towards which we should bend all our energies.</P>
    <P>We will not bring that about by in any way lessening or reducing the difficulties that exist up there, by trying to make them appear to be less than they are.  We will not do it by running away from them or hiding ourselves from them.  Much more will it pay us if we can in fact highlight the difficulties and dangers that are inherent in the present situation as we now sit in this House tonight and point out that the trouble will continue regardless of what any of us may do.  Do not go around pointing to the peaceful &ldquo;Twelfth&rdquo; we had on the 13th of this month.  Peace&mdash;at what price?  Peace&mdash; and the only parallel that I know for it in my time was Budapest in 1956 and Prague back in 1968 when you had the people ringed with steel, closed in.  How many thousands were closed in, in Belfast, on that day?  How many could not even get to their work?  How many could not get outside their own locality?  If this is peace, then I am afraid it is not the sort of peace many <Col N="2577" /> of the people in this House have been clamouring for.  It is not peace: it is merely keeping the thing down at the moment.  By all means, try that in any way you can but it is no answer.  It is no final cure.  It can erupt again and possibly because of its being repressed in that way, it may erupt with all the more force.  This is a sad picture that is there and it is one we should not run away from but, instead, face up to and expose for what it is.  We, I believe, should do this rather than making it appear that the trouble has gone away or is going away and that it will not recur again.  It will recur again.</P>
    <P>In Belfast around the beginning of July, and in the weeks before it, if you were then to see it, with the new tall buildings that emerged in that city, as in other cities, in recent years, on every vantage point of such buildings a machine-gun emplacement, manned by British Army personnel was covering every street and every approach. This is the peace that exists in Belfast today.  This is the sort of peace we hear talk about here as if it really meant something.  We all know that while there must be occupation forces there is no real possibility of peace and that it is only holding things from blowing apart at that particular time. That brings me to the idea of the ban on parades.  They are banned for six months: OK.  Assuming that the ban is adhered to&mdash;for the first week it has been practically and totally ignored&mdash; but if it is adhered to, what, at the end of six months, will we have attained? Will we have a situation that the Orangemen will not want to parade any more or that the AOH will have been cured of their wish to parade as well? Or will we have a build-up of enthusiasm among people to get out and parade and make up for all the parades lost in the previous months?  Where do we go from there?  Is this the best the ban can accomplish?  Again, it is a holding operation at its best.  At its worst it can do damage.</P>
    <P>This ban, imposed at the will and the wish of the British Government, was going to be a sour pill for certain people up there to swallow, so they wrapped it up and what do we get? We get the RUC being directed to go <Col N="2578" /> back into the Falls and into Bogside again.  Cast your mind back for 11 months and you will find that the real trouble up in the Bogside and in the Falls had to do with the incursions of that same force aided and abetted by the B Specials of those days.  Those are the people who are coming back in again.  If you ban parades you hit the Orangemen.  You send the RUC back into the Falls and into the Bogside and they hit the Nationalists literally as they have done over the generations and particularly in recent months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The forces of the Crown above in Belfast are the people who, a short while ago, when the trouble was in the Falls, were given a certain sympathy which, I think, was somewhat misplaced.  I have looked at them myself, in Derry, in Belfast and on the roadsides and I have often said that they have a lousy job, but it is not of our making, and it is not of the making of the people up there.  It is of the making of their own <Col N="2579" /> Government who brought about this sorry situation all those generations ago for their own reasons.</P>
      <P>Those same occupation forces in their operations in the Falls behaved as the Tans behaved, according to what I have been told about how the Tans behaved back in the 20s.  These are the people who are excused their excesses that night and the shooting of four snipers, or three, or two, or one.  Who were they sniping?  The Army used arms that night and poured their lead into that area of the Falls, having just ringed it with steel, with heavy guns, and tanks, and armoured cars, and between 2,500 and 3,500 troops.  They shot four people, three who died that night&mdash;or I should say they shot two.  Another died for another reason, and the fourth one died a few days afterwards.</P>
      <P>Who were these snipers we were told about the day after the shootings? We had Burns who was outside putting the shutters on his own little chip shop up in the Falls when he was shot by rifle fire or machine gun fire from the troops who were then coming up the particular street on which he lived. That was sniper No. 1.  Sniper No. 2 was Charlie O'Neill, I think.  I may have got the names mixed.  He was a member of the Citizens Defence Committee who went out in front of a Saracen tank coming down the street to try to wave it down not to come any further, to go back because there was no need for them to take this sort of heavy armoury into the area at all.  He was driven over.  According to the eye witnesses he was just driven down. That was sniper No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sniper No. 3 turned out to be a really difficult one because he turned out to be a Pole, a free-lance photographer. He found himself in the Falls that night.  While the shooting was going on he was sheltering in the house of some person or other and he decided during a lull in the shooting that he would get out of it and make his way out of the Falls, that he had had enough of it. He left his camera and his coat behind in this house and went out the back door, tried to scramble across the back wall of the garden, and was riddled <Col N="2580" /> while he was going over that wall.  He was the Pole, the photographer.  That was sniper No. 3.</P>
    <P>I forget the fourth man's name but he died a couple of days later.  He was 62 years of age.  He was shot, apparently outside his own door.  He had come out to get a breath of air in a lull in the shooting which was not so evident apparently in his street as it was in some others.  Those were the four deaths which were brought about by the action of the British Army in the Falls that night.  Those are the snipers who we are told were the cause of the shooting by the British Army.  Those are the four, and there is not a sniper among them.  The British Army can now talk their way out of that if they wish, and try to make themselves appear as merely defending themselves from the unruly mob of Catholic snipers who apparently were thick and fast on every roof in the Falls that evening.</P>
    <P>We then had the searches, the searching of houses one after the other in the Falls.  We did not have them next door in Shankill Road, or Sandy Row, or any such place where you would find a Unionist rather than a Nationalist. Here we have these impartial forces of the Crown going through these houses looking for arms and wrecking some of them in the process.  These are the facts of the situation.  This is not a myth.  It is there to be seen.  It is still to be seen.  You can see for yourselves, if you go to Falls, just what depredations were done and how even the slates were taken off the roofs of houses in order that the ceilings could be looked at more readily from the outside rather than the inside.  These things happened only this month up in Belfast and were perpetrated by a British Army of occupation.</P>

We cannot and we should not trust them to be impartial when we find from their very actions they have shown themselves to be totally partial.  They are as unwelcome today in Belfast as they were in Dublin 50 odd years ago.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had his say a few days ago.  I should like Deputies in this Assembly to be aware of what goes on above in those Six Counties of ours and the situation of our citizens whether they be Unionist, or Catholic, or Nationalist, or Orangemen.  They are all our citizens.  They are all Irish people.  We claim them and we give them the rights of citizenship.  We claim the territory of the Thirty-two Counties and we have responsibilities to them. I do not think we can depend upon the British Army to carry out those responsibilities impartially for us or on our behalf.</P>
      <P>I should like also to say that in these searches&mdash;lest Deputies might think that they applied only to the area of the Falls that seems to have got the name of being so badly behaved that it really had to be cleaned out&mdash;they spread their wings and went further. They searched around Dungannon and Coalisland and down in South Armagh. Again, because of some peculiar trait that seems to be inbuilt in them, it was all Nationalist houses that were raided there again in the week following the Falls operation I have talked about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the morning of 13th, the morning of the delayed Twelfth Parade, we find them surrounding a house up in a place <Col N="2582" /> called Tirkane near Maghera near Glenshane Pass at four in the morning and turning three elderly people, all of them over 60 years, onto the street, a young married woman and a year old child.  Out they were put at 4 a.m. while the house was ransacked from top to bottom.  The skirting boards were taken up.  The floorboards were taken up. All of this, together with the outbuildings, the haybarns and the cattle sheds which were ransacked from 4 a.m. on the 13th until 9 a.m. on the same morning.  Their explanation to the owner of the house, whose name was McEldowney, was that they were looking for his son-in-law, one John Kelly of whom we have heard a little in this House before.</P>
    <P>They were even looking behind the skirting boards for John Kelly on that morning for five solid bloody hours. They took that house apart looking for this man who was not there. Apparently because his wife and young child had arrived back from a visit to John Kelly the evening before at 9 o'clock, the boys' information was pretty sound and they were there in strength.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing the Parliament of this country and that includes Deputy O'Leary.  I ask that we make it quite clear that we do not regard the majority in the Six Counties as having a right to determine what sort of country we are to have in the 32 Counties in the future.  This is a matter that over the years we have maintained the right of the majority of all of the people of all of this island to determine and not any majority in any particular section in the Six Counties or elsewhere.  We must keep this clearly in our minds because if we were to concede that we concede everything upon which our people's aspirations have been based and throw away the entire claim for unity of our country, for a republic of the 32 Counties for which so many good Irishmen <Col N="2584" /> gave much and for which many gave their lives.  We cannot and should not run away from that at any rate.  We should not be misled into believing that by conceding that we are doing something for the situation; we are not.  We are merely running out, betraying that for which the patriots of the past died.  We should have that ever present before our minds because it is important to all of us today and particularly to those who will come after us tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I have been misrepresented on many occasions and I am sure I shall again be misrepresented even arising from tonight, particularly in regard to the use of force.  I want to make clear again that I believe that peaceful means is the ideal solution to Partition, as do the vast majority of all our people north and south of the Border, but again&mdash;and I must say it even at the risk of being further misrepresented&mdash; the minority, if under attack, if under assault of a murderous nature as they have been on a number of occasions in the past 12 months, are morally entitled to, and it is just should they decide to defend themselves with arms. This is something that is not to be misrepresented and should not be taken as meaning that force is being advocated as a solution to Partition.  There is a vast difference between the two things.  I have tried to clarify that as my outlook on many occasions but time without number, whether wittingly or unwittingly, I have had this misrepresentation made, the two rolled into one and, of course, assertions being made that I was advocating the use of force to end Partition.  That is not what I have advocated at any particular point and I again wish to reiterate the difference between these two things so that there should not be the confusion created by further misrepresentations, wittingly or unwittingly, by anybody who may listen to or read anything I say tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary rightly asked about St. Mathew's church and the episode that took place here.  If we recall that particular night we shall find&mdash;and the evidence is in Belfast to assert and to show&mdash;that it was under attack by a mob of anything up to a couple of <Col N="2585" /> thousand Orangemen on that night, that the British Army were, perhaps, otherwise engaged, dispersed at other points throughout the city.  Whether that be so or not, only 60 of their number could be made available to try to intervene in what was to become very serious trouble before that night was out.  Those 60 came and, I understand, having had a look, they went again to the nearest barracks where the RUC were already closed in and locked themselves in with them.  I think they were probably very wise to do it.  That is the same barracks to which an MP of the Stormont Parliament, Paddy Kennedy, went at some later stage that night asking that the army should do something about the situation at St. Mathews and the reply he got from the commanding officer was that he could go and stew in his own juice.  This has been published; I do not present it as original.  It has come across before now.</P>
    <P>The main point is that St. Mathews was under attack by a very large number of Orangemen on that night; there were petrol bombs; there were machine and automatic weapons available to those people; the first person to be shot that night was not an Orangeman, as people might be led to believe but was one of the defenders of St. Mathews and another of them was quite seriously injured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely giving what I have ascertained in my own way in <Col N="2586" /> Belfast since the night of the St. Mathews episode in which two of the Orange people were shot and many wounded.  The defenders of that church that night were not only defending their church but behind the church there is a convent and adjacent to it a girls' hostel.  I need scarcely, I am sure, embellish what I have been told as to what the mob were saying they were going to do not only to the church and the convent but to the nuns and the girls as well.  I wonder today if they had succeeded and got through that night and had there been no defenders, inadequate though their equipment may have been, to defend the church, the convent, the nuns and the girls, what would have been the outcome.  If the church had been burned as the sacristy was burned, if the convent was razed as it might have been, what might have happened to the nuns, to the girls and to the priests.  Had they been murdered, ravaged, abused or whatever you like, what would be the attitude of any of us in this House tonight if we were recalling that particular episode? Would we feel that the minority that night had a right to protect themselves, their church and convent, their nuns and girls in that hostel?  Unless we are blatantly and totally dishonest we must admit that had that been the outcome we would feel very much aggrieved that nothing could have been done to save the situation.</P>

I am trying to get through to the British Government and the British people that this is not a matter that can be swept under the carpet any longer as it has been for many years, that the discrimination has maintained the Six Counties with the power of the British Crown behind it and with the millions of money that was being poured in over the years.</P>

      <P>I should like to move on, that is, if I am still in possession &mdash;sometimes I rather doubt it, but that is not a reflection on the Chair; it is not the Chair's fault&mdash;to this whole question of reforms in the Six Counties <Col N="2588" /> about which we have heard so much.  One of the reforms boasted about today was the disbandment of the sectarian army called the B Specials and their replacement by another force known as the Ulster Defence Regiment. The B Specials were disarmed and disbanded and in their place was put perhaps a wolf in sheep's clothing or a sheep in another sheep's clothing, but it has not been as successful in enlisting recruits.  Of course the B Specials had been in existence for many generations; they had a long time to build themselves up.  This is one of the reforms that were boasted about today, the disbandment of this mob, and that is all they were, an armed mob acting under the legal authority of the Stormont Government, a sectarian mob who perpetrated, as they wished, any visit of any of those they did not like and there was no redress.  I shall tell the House later on that this is so.  That is one reform, if it is one, which I did not appreciate very much; it is negative; neither do I think did the people of the Six Counties despite the noise made by the propagandists from Stormont that it was a great move forward.</P>
      <P>Then there was the removal of side arms from the RUC.  The RUC being a professional force, most of them may well have wanted to be rid of these side arms, thinking perhaps the arms were an invitation to someone to have a crack at them and that they were not powerful enough to retaliate, but in addition to the side arms being taken away, their armoured cars were taken away as well, and this took from them the mounted machine guns which had done such depredation not many months before.  Again a negative reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let none of us, however, imagine that the B Specials no longer exist or that they do not have arms.  They were issued with arms over the years and their arms were changed on several occasions as they became obsolete and they got new issues.  What was the evidence tendered at one of the tribunals, either Scarman or Cameron: That no record was kept of the arms that were issued to that force over the years.  Going back over the years and assuming four or five changes of arms <Col N="2589" /> for this force, it could add up to a sizeable quantity and variety of arms available to and in the hands of the ex-B Specials, those who were recently disbanded and those who may have retired not very long before or may have retired a few years ago.  They control the Right Wing, the extreme wing of the Unionist Party.  They also provide, no doubt, the trained and skilled snipers that are needed for the Orange mobs.  I have no doubt that at this moment they await the rundown of the British Army in the Six Counties to avail of further opportunities to put the jackboot down on their traditional enemies as they have become, the ordinary people and the Nationalists of the Six Counties.  That is the situation in the Six Counties today and we should not run away from it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the RUC, 17 members of this force were found guilty by their own officers of misconduct early last year in Derry when the people of the Bogside were batoned mercilessly in their homes.  One man died from the batoning he got as he stood on his own kitchen floor.  Has one of those responsible been brought to the courts and tried for his misconduct, to say the least of it, or tried for the death of Sam Deveney?  None of them was brought to book and the 17 men found guilty of brutality are still serving in that force.</P>
    <P>Then there was the case that shocked us so much, that of Seán Gallagher. He was a Civil Rights man who was shot down without giving any provocation in the midst of a Civil Rights gathering as he was leaving a hall in the city of Armagh.  He was shot down by the B Specials.  Was anybody charged with that offence?  Were any of the people who were under suspicion really investigated?  We have never heard of such charges being brought.</P>
    <P>Then there was the case of McCluskey.  Maybe Deputies do not like being reminded of these things but McCluskey of Dungiven was batoned to death in Dungiven less than a year ago.  There was also the case of the nine year old boy, Patrick Rooney, above in Belfast shot dead as he slept in bed by an RUC armoured car machine gun going through the Belfast <Col N="2590" /> streets at that time.  This is probably the case that shocked us most and brought home to us more than anything else what sort of situation exists in the Six Counties and what sort of situation our people have had to put up with in the City of Belfast over all those years.</P>
    <P>Then we had the case of Samuel McLernan who was shot as he was pulling down the blind of the window in his home.  All of these people were not involved in any row.  These were shot not by any mobs at that time. They were shot by the armed forces of the Government of Stormont.  These are the sort of things we must keep in mind when we are talking about the RUC and their impartiality, because these are the same RUC who have not had one of them charged, not one of them dismissed for any of these offences or these murders as I think they should properly be described.</P>
    <P>That is the force that is being sent back to the Bogside, back into the Falls, and we are asked, and the people up there are asked to accept them as an impartial police force.  Surely it is straining the credibility of those people to a degree beyond imagination if, with that record in recent months, those same people are to be sent back in and be regarded as impartially carrying out the application of the law to all the people in that particular area?</P>
    <P>There is another reform we hear a lot about, that is the local authority reform and all the talk about the votes for all the young people at 18 years of age.  What they do not, of course, boast of is that there will not be any opportunity to operate this vote before 1972. In the meantime, Mr. Faulkner, fine propagandist that he has shown himself to be, will have gerrymandered the new local authority areas in a manner that will nearly replace the old system but with a new cover on it.  He will have that done before 1972 and all the talk about the votes for the people from 18 upwards and one man and one vote will go out the window again if the gerrymander is done as undoubtedly it is intended to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we have the much praised, much vaunted, points system of fair allocation of houses. This has been ignored, remember, by most of the gerrymandered local authorities.  It may be on the Statute Book but if it has not been given effect to what is the difference and it is not being given effect in most of the local authority areas throughout the Six Counties today.</P>
      <P>We should also keep in mind the example of Derry city.  Here is a city where the shamefully gerrymandered corporation existed for nearly 50 years, giving control of a predominantly nationalist city into the hands of a very small minority, who manipulated that city to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of that city's progress over those same 50 years.  What do we find there?  They decide to do away with the old gerrymandered council and in its place they put a commission.  Why could they not have done the obvious thing?  Why could they not have had a properly elected and non-gerrymandered council which would have been representative of the nationalist city of Derry instead of getting a commission to whitewash and paper over and do the same sort of roguery as the old gerrymandered unionist controlled corporation had been doing for the past 50 years?  That is another of their much talked about reforms that they have carried out in the recent past.</P>
      <P>Then of course we have the introduction of the ombudsman&mdash;I suppose a joke if it was not such a sad and sick sort of joke.  Here again, in the context of the operations and the manner of manipulation up there, this particular office is merely used to whitewash and to paper over that which was always there and continues to be there&mdash;the discrimination against nationalist and nationally minded people in jobs, houses and anything you name that there is any value in.  The discrimination continues.</P>

    <P>Talking of discrimination, if there is one thing the unionist regime up there must be given credit for, even though it is a rather left-handed compliment, it would be that, given the circumstances when partition was first imposed they did a hell of a great job in <Col N="2592" /> discriminating against the Nationalists since then, in denying them jobs, in denying them houses and thereby keeping down their numbers and hanging on to power&mdash;this together with the gerrymandering of the constituencies where that was necessary as well.</P>
    <P>Credit where it is due, if one can think of it on those terms, they did the best job that could be expected from them in the difficult circumstances in which they were left, trying to hold this fort which is built on sand, which is tottering today and which those who control it know is on its way out and all we need is an admission from Britain, the chief architect of that tragedy in Irish history, an acknowledgment that it is on the way out, that Partition has failed, that it requires another solution and that they must get down to business to find that solution before it is too late.  I believe they can be got to think in this way and I believe that if they are once committed to thinking in this way half the battle is already won and we can in the not too distant future look forward to a time when the British Government will get down to serious discussion with this Government of ours to devise ways and means of finding a beginning of the end of the problem of Partition which 50 years of trying under the present system has just displayed as completely unworkable and not capable of being continued in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like in conclusion to say that there was another little bit of reform that was to go ahead.  Much was made of it.  It may seem little in retrospect but remember we had a famous clause which about 10 months ago, the unionist government, undertook, on British insistence, that they would write into all contracts for Government employment. That clause was to remove discrimination from all such appointments. It has not since happened.  It has not been written in.  Do you know the reason?  They have not been able to agree on a form of words that would fit the clause that would give this guarantee, in the contract of employment, against discrimination.  Perhaps it is more difficult than we realise.</P>

      <P>Nor do I believe that we can trim or amend our outlook merely for the sake of satisfying those who regard the Six Counties and its problems as a hindrance to the advancement of their own self interests. This is the sort of thing that the affluence of recent years can readily bring into our midst and I think it has done so to quite a degree.  They say that prosperity and increasing affluence have two effects in any community. One is that they diminish the religious fervour of the people and the other the patriotism of those same people.  I do not hold myself out to be any authority whatever on the religious aspect but from my own knowledge I would say that patriotism perhaps is suffering as our prosperity has been growing.  We will have to hold on to our patriotism while making the prosperity grow even more in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I get around to the swan song I will notify the Deputy to be in attendance.  I believe that based on these republican traditions of the 1916 leaders, and of Tone, McCracken and Orr and others of like religious beliefs we in this Parliament, the public representatives, must bring home to the people our responsibility to the <Col N="2597" /> ideal of nationhood, and I say &ldquo;nationhood&rdquo; deliberately.  I further believe that we must press with all the resources at our command on the Westminster Government, and it is the Westminster Government and not the people in Belfast that I am talking about, to get them to accept their responsibility in this matter by beginning to dismantle their armed occupation and their financial sustenance of that régime known as the Stormont Parliament.</P>
      <P>This, I believe, is the way towards a peaceful solution to that which has been a problem and will continue to be a problem until we find the unity of our country and ultimately the unity of our people.  These are the things in which I believe.  If I have not made myself as clear as I might have perhaps there will be other occasions. However, I would ask Members of this House, my colleagues on all sides of the House, to refrain at least from misrepresenting me in regard to the matter of the use of force, as has been done so often in the past and then try to make it appear that I have been to blame for inflaming the situation by talking about using force.  Do not do that on this occasion because in doing that you will be inflaming the situation and it was you people who misrepresented me and others in the past who brought about this sort of situation that could be said to have been a cause of inflaming past situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us finish on this, that the peace you seek in the Six Counties can be gained, and peaceably at that, provided the British Government accept and acknowledge that their trial of 50 years of Partition just does not work and that they have a responsibility to the sundered peoples of the 32 Counties to get down to business and try to find the real answer.  If they were to do this I believe sincerely that we within the four shores of Ireland, who do not have to fear each other, can then find our solution, that we can live together and that we are all Irish people and it is only when Britain will have got out of this land that we will get together and live together and become not only a united territory but a united people <Col N="2598" /> and in a few words, a nation once again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What a wonderful transformation a few weeks out of ministerial office makes in a Member of this House.  Deputy Blaney spoke about the transformation, the change that came about in this country as a result of rising prosperity.  From one of the founders of Taca we heard in sorrowful accents what rising prosperity does for patriotism.  Whilst I have no doubt Deputy Blaney was sincere in his speech this was the speech of a man who misunderstands profoundly the complications of Northern Ireland and misunderstands the difficulties that lie in the way of Irish unity. It was noteworthy that throughout his speech the only dead referred to, the only casualties referred to in the present Northern Ireland tragedy, were Catholic tragedies and Catholic dead. No word of sympathy for the Protestant dead and no word of sympathy for the Protestant casualties in that vicious conflict.</P>
      <P>There must forever be a temptation to politicians on this side of the Border to appeal to all sections of the Irish people living on this side of the Border for we can be assured that our message will be received with goodwill and with sympathy if the message we give our people on this side of the Border is one that seeks to lay all the blame on the Protestant bigot side and one that sees all justice and all right on the Catholic side there.  We can be sure of instant appeal to our people down here with that kind of message on the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it is not quite so simple as that and that is why I asked Deputy Blaney <Col N="2599" /> about the shootings in St. Matthew's Church in which Protestants were killed.  Deputy Blaney had one version and I had another.  Whatever about the particularity of the incident in St. Matthew's Church, it was in this incident we had brought home to us the real difficulties inherent in the northern problem.  Here were no British troops. The 60 had gone home to their barracks and Irishmen were killed; Protestant Irishmen were killed.  There was no British Army.  Here we can see what can happen in Northern Ireland should the British Army go home, a bloody holocaust in the six north-eastern counties of our country in which Protestants and Catholics alike will be killed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney is correct when he says that the British Army occupation offers no permanent solution.  But the British Army is present there in answer to the express wish of the majority of the people in the north.  Deputy Blaney did not say explicitly that he disagress with the policy of the Government but, as I read him, he disagrees with the idea that the majority in that part of the country should be listened to to the extent that would allow them the right to live in the State in which they at present live.  He appeared to me to be disagreeing in fact, with what I gather is the particular approach of both the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs, namely, that the majority by the very fact of their being a majority have a certain identity and a right to live in that particular State, always with the proviso that their being a majority does not give them the right to penalise, hold in subjection or discriminate against the Catholic minority there.</P>
    <P>There are no simple answers.  Of course the British had a part in that particular tragedy.  Britain cannot be absolved of her responsibility.  But the real responsibility must to a great extent ultimately lie with ourselves because, for more than 40 years, we ignored the north and it is only right if, in the last year, we have corrected the balance somewhat by emphasising and underlining the Irish aspect of this Irish quarrel.  I would not go all the <Col N="2600" /> way with those who say it is a wholly Irish quarrel.  The British are also involved and we need the co-operation of the British Government if we are to find a solution to the quarrel.  But there is no doubt at all that a great many of the differences dividing Catholic and Protestant have been manufactured and substained within this island.  That is why Irishmen down here in the 26 Counties must resist a certain temptation when dealing with this very complicated problem.  It is a temptation to which every Deputy may succumb.  It is a temptation to which Deputy Blaney has wholly succumbed.  Whether or not he is sincere, he has succumbed and his observations, therefore, suffer the distortion of a person who has an imperfect understanding of all the elements which make up the northern tragedy.  His conclusions are defective. His advice is not to be trusted and cannot, therefore, be followed in this situation. Tomorrow morning I may come back to deal more fundamentally with some of the impressions left on my mind by Deputy Blaney's intervention here tonight.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree there was not a great deal of colourful material in what Deputy Blaney said.  This Government are led by a Taoiseach who has resisted debate here on Northern Ireland for a number of weeks now for the purpose of preventing the likes of Deputy Blaney from speaking here.  Deputy Blaney's own Taoiseach&mdash;he did not name him here tonight&mdash;is presumably the person on whose orders Deputy Blaney's phone is being tapped and he <Col N="2601" /> is the person who in the past few weeks has avoided discussion on this matter. Deputy Blaney referred to people who considered themselves free to speak on Northern Ireland in any manner they wished but did not wish him to speak in the manner he wished or make the suggestions he had in mind.  I can sympathise with Deputy Blaney.  The Taoiseach, according to Deputy Blaney, sought to prevent Deputy Blaney from speaking here.  It was the Taoiseach's apprehension in relation to Deputy Blaney's views which prevented this House discussing the situation in Northern Ireland earlier this month.</P>
      <P>This is a Cabinet which suffers more acutely from internal personal problems than any Cabinet since the Second World War.  When I entered this House in 1965 we were regaled <i>ad nauseam</i> with details of the breaking up of the last inter-Party Government. The recent debacle will be recorded in the political text books as an outstanding example of Cabinet chaos.  Those who sit in the House in 1990 will discuss the events of 1970, the back stabbings, the 'phone tapping and all the other matters Deputy Blaney ventilated here tonight.  We have a Cabinet in which, apparently, suspicion is the order of the day, in which Cabinet colleague may find Cabinet colleague transported in a Black Maria for trial in Green Street Courthouse any Tuesday morning.  An extraordinary state of affairs: a ring at the door on Monday morning and a plain clothes officer of the law telling a Minister to come along with him as he has certain evidence which suggests that the Minister and other members of the Cabinet are implicated in a plot and must be brought before the court immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking now about some relatively unknown area on this globe. We are talking about the Fianna Fáil Government, led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch.  We have a unique situation.  We have two sets of problems simultaneously.  There is the problem of the Cabinet acting as a unit, people working together in peace and confidence, and the problem of that same Cabinet facing an external problem.  Deputy Blaney waxes eloquent about the wickedness of the <Col N="2602" /> Unionist régime in the north.  We are all agreed we want to see our country united, but this latter-day republican, coming down from the mountain with the seals of republicanism, had nothing to say about the Common Market.  Considering he has been so busy in the north seeing all the oppression there, one would imagine he could spare a moment to consider the overall oppression of this country economically under Common Market rules.  Deputy Blaney had not time to discuss such mundane matters as, for instance, how the Irish people will fare under such conditions.</P>

      <P>he will revise the regulations governing the extended kiosk programme for rural areas to ensure that the usage of the call office telephone is not the sole determining factor in assessing the demand for a kiosk in a particular area; and if he will take particular cognisance of factors such as the number of coin-operated telephones in business premises in the area, the convenience of the call office to local shopping centres, etc., and the general availability of other means of communication with the outside world in the area.</P>
      <P>The relevant part of the Minister's reply reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural areas are selected for inclusion in the expanded rural kiosk programme on the basis of the use <Col N="2603" /> being made of the call office telephone in the local sub-post office. This is considered to be the best and fairest method of selection and I do not propose to revise it.</P>
    <P>In other words, the sole criterion used by the Department to determine whether an area shall have a kiosk is the usage of the post office phone.  If there is not a post office in an area, under present rules the district has no hope of getting a telephone kiosk.  Perhaps there is a post office but the phone may not be used to a large extent&mdash;possibly because it may be inconveniently sited or there may be coin box phones in the area.  These facts, however, are not taken into consideration when an application is made for the provision of a kiosk.  The only criterion is the usage of the post office phone.</P>
    <P>This is an unduly rigid criterion.  We must remember that a kiosk is open for 24 hours, unlike the public phone in the post office or the phones in business premises, which are available only during office hours.  In the provision of kiosks consideration is given only to areas where there is a post office, but surely some thought should be given to districts that have no such facility?  While we can measure the demand that may exist for a kiosk in an area in which there is a post office, there is no way of assessing the demand that may exist for a kiosk in an area without a post office.</P>
    <P>Let me cite an example of a district on a busy county road&mdash;I have in mind the road between Kells and Navan.  There is not sufficient population along this road to merit the provision of a post office but there is a vast amount of passing traffic.  If there is an accident in the middle of the night or a breakdown, the people concerned must ask the permission of a householder to use his phone or else they will have to walk to Kells or Navan.  This road has one of the worst accident rates in the country but because there is not a post office located there a kiosk will not be provided.</P>
    <P>An example is the area of Tankardstown, where it is generally conceded that there should be a kiosk <Col N="2604" /> but, again, it cannot be provided under the present rules.  Liscarton is a rapidly developing area but, despite the fact that there will be a considerable demand for a kiosk, it will not be provided.  There are many isolated areas with poor roads leading to them, but if it is decided that the usage of the post office phone is not sufficient they will not get a kiosk.  This can often result in hardship and inconvenience. I know of an area called Ticknevin in County Kildare in my constituency.  There is only one road leading into this village which is situated in the Bog of Allen, but there is a large school there.  Despite these facts a telephone kiosk will not be provided.</P>
    <P>The civil servants with whom I have discussed this matter have sympathy for people living in areas with high accident rates, in newly developing areas and in isolated districts, but under the present rules they cannot do anything to help.  The usage of a post office phone is not a true guide to the actual demand for a telephone kiosk. It is possible that there might not be adequate privacy in the post office to make telephone calls and for this reason people might prefer to use the phone in a private house.  In addition, there might be a large number of business premises or public houses in the area where coin box phones are available. In both cases this could lead to an unduly low usage of the post office phone and would not be a true representation of the actual demand for a kiosk.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, when both the post office and these business premises would be closed down, there would be a very great demand for a kiosk there.</P>
    <P>This is another factor which takes away from the validity of the criteria at present in use.  In the town of Kilmessan there is a large number of shops and public houses with coin-operated telephones.  There, the call office is not used sufficiently.  Again, take a place like Clonee in my constituency with the main Dublin-Navan road passing through it and where there is a large number of licensed premises with coin-operated telephones. There, there would probably be a very great demand for a telephone <Col N="2605" /> kiosk.  But, because the post office is the only thing that is considered, it probably will not get a telephone kiosk for quite some time.</P>
    <P>Again, you might have the case also that the post office telephone might not be used to any great extent because it is inconveniently sited in the village in question.  It might be sited well away from the main shopping centres.  I have particular places in mind.  It could be down at one end of the town, far away from the shopping centre where most people would congregate and where perhaps they would like to make use of a public telephone.  In that case, they would use one in a business premises and would not trudge all the way down to the post office premises unless they wanted to buy stamps or do some business which would bring them there.  In that case, the actual demand for a telephone in that area would not truly be represented by the actual usage of the post office telephone.</P>
    <P>This brings me to Question No. 115 which is the other question I propose to raise.  I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs:</P>
    <P>if public telephone kiosks are available in all places where rural Garda stations have been closed down in the past ten years and if he will give an assurance that such kiosks will be available in any place where a Garda station may be closed in future.</P>
    <P>In his reply, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy G. Collins, said that in relation to the past ten years he understands that 58 Garda stations have been closed and that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have provided telephone kiosks in 17 of these places.</P>
    <P>They provided such kiosks in only 17 out of 58 places where Garda stations were closed down.  In other words, areas where people had previously been able to get in touch with probably the most important people concerned with the preservation of law and order, the Garda, and where they are no longer able to meet them personally&mdash; in only 17 places out of 58 such places were people able to get in touch with them by means of a telephone kiosk. <Col N="2606" /> It is most likely that people needing the help of the Garda will need that help at night when private houses and business premises will not easily be available.  Crime might take place at night in areas where previously the people could get in touch with the Garda, who were available locally but who must now be contacted by telephone. Consider the position when there is no easy access to a telephone on such an urgent occasion.  Closure of the rural Garda station should be a consideration for providing a kiosk in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister is precluded from giving any cognisance whatever to this because, under the extended rural kiosk programme, it is laid down that the only consideration that can be taken into account is the usage of the post office telephone.  In other words, areas which are isolated, areas which have lost their police force, areas which, for various reasons, may not use the actual post office telephone, cannot be considered under the present criteria because we have this very neat system of usage solely of the call office telephone. It is a very convenient system. It is an immediate slide-rule by which you can tot up the number of calls.  It does not involve anybody in making any real judgment as to the usage. They have a mathematical formula for arriving at whether or not a decision should be made to provide a phone in a particular area.</P>
    <P>This is very convenient for the civil servants or for the Minister in avoiding local pressure.  Surely the criteria should be widened so that the Minister can take into account the factors I have mentioned?  Obviously other considerations which now elude me could demonstrate that there is a demand for a telephone kiosk quite apart from the usage of the call office telephone.  Probably the Minister will not give me satisfaction in his reply tonight but I will ask him to consider what I have said so that, when revising this extended rural kiosk programme, he will try to find some way of having greater discretion in the choice of areas and that the use of the post office telephone will not be the only criterion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place.  I <Col N="2607" /> am glad Deputy Bruton has had an opportunity of getting this great big load off his chest, even if it is a late hour at night and if it is a considerable inconvenience to the staff, who are overworked and very tired.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton painted a very bad picture of the operations of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;a picture I believe to be false and untrue. When Deputy Bruton had questions down for reply on 4th June&mdash;Nos. 114 and 115&mdash;I gave him what in my opinion was very clear and concise information, information that would satisfy any Deputy, I should imagine; information that would have satisfied me personally if I had put down such questions to a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton might not be aware that up to very recently it was not the policy of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to provide telephones in rural areas.  We did have a policy change in 1969.  We provided a certain sum of money for the provision of kiosks in rural areas.  Whereas last year we had approximately 50 kiosks to our credit, at the end of this year we hope to have 150.</P>
      <P>I will say that I have a certain amount of sympathy with some of the things Deputy Bruton said, but not with everything he said.  I am quite sure that Deputy Bruton is quite sincere when he says that the road between Kells and Navan is very important.  I am quite sure that Deputy Bruton could possibly justify the case for the provision of a telephone on this road.  Does he want a telephone between every village and town in this country?  Where would the money come from for this purpose.  This is a ridiculous suggestion&mdash;and I am sorry to have to say this to the Deputy.  Is he trying to tell the House that we should provide a telephone at every crossroads and every townland in the country?</P>

      <P>We could not even consider this at all.  Deputy Bruton mentions places such as Tankardstown, <Col N="2608" /> Ticknevin, Kilmessan and Clonee. With regard to Tankardstown and Ticknevin, in County Kildare, I am not able to talk on the claim of these two particular townlands, or they might be bigger than townlands, for a telephone. If the Deputy asks a question at a later stage, I shall be only too glad to deal with these two cases but I am not prepared to talk about them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned Kilmessan.  When he had this question down, I gave Deputy Bruton a very good reason why this place could not be provided with a telephone within the foreseeable future. Deputy Bruton seems to think that we have a rigid rule here in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that, if this rule is to be observed with regard to the provision of a kiosk, telephones cannot be given to areas except where call office telephones have been used.  This is not the end of the claim of these people for a telephone, if they want to go further about it.  If a group of people in an area such as Tankardstown or Ticknevin or Kilmessan can convince their local authority of the need for a telephone kiosk then, through the local authority, the Deputy can get the local authority to go guarantor for those people and provide them with a telephone.  It has been done before and we shall be only too glad to consider an application for a claim if this procedure is followed.</P>
      <P>I agree that the guideline which we have been using for the siting of kiosks in rural areas, that is the number of calls going through the call office phone, is not an infallible guideline.  It could not be infallible.  But it is a good guide.  From long practical experience the Department have found this to be a good and, indeed, a very fair guide.  I agree it is not the final answer but it is the best that is available to us.  We have to work on this until some other method can be developed that would help us in making these decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that it can happen, but I would say very rarely, that post offices are not sited in the <Col N="2609" /> best locations.  This is no fault of the Department.  It often happens that the premises available to us for post offices are not in the exact centre or in the best location in the area the post office is to serve.  As far as possible these post offices are centrally located and we put these kiosks, these public telephones, outside them.  We have had very few complaints in the Department.  If, as the Deputy says, these call boxes are not being used, due to the fact that they are not centrally located, or that they are awkwardly sited, I would suggest that, since the guideline we have to follow is reasonably clearly spelt out for the Deputy, then if the people in the locality or the area are really serious about getting a telephone kiosk, they should try to use the call office phone for a year or two and in that way help themselves.  They have the remedy in their own hands, if they want to use it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the provision of telephone kiosks in areas in which Garda stations have been closed down. He quoted from the Official Report of the Dáil debates but he did not give the full quotation.  He said that only 17 telephones were provided in areas where Garda stations had been closed down, and that, in all, about 58 Garda stations had been closed down.</P>

      <P>I gave this information to the Deputy on a previous occasion and I am surprised that he did not think it worth his while to mention it.  He seems to think that the people in rural Ireland will have great difficulty in contacting the Garda authorities, if they need to contact them.  I am satisfied that the difficulty will not be as great as Deputy Bruton thinks it will be. I come from a rural area myself, an area which might not be regarded as being as well off as the area in the constituency of Meath from which the <Col N="2610" /> Deputy comes.  We have not got telephone kiosks in every townland or crossroads&mdash;but we can still get in touch with the Garda if we want to.</P>
      <P>It is a well known fact that there are many private subscribers with telephones&mdash;with coin boxes in some instances&mdash;and these people will certainly facilitate their neighbours, if necessary.</P>

      <P>When we have to look at the deciding factors for kiosk location in rural areas we first consider the location of the existing call office telephone which is being replaced. Then we have to consider the convenience of those likely to use it. Thirdly, we have to site the kiosk where it will attract the maximum revenue.  The Deputy forgets that it has been the policy for a fairly long time that the Department should pay their way as far as possible.  In 1969 we decided to draw up this plan for the provision of kiosks in the rural areas. In our first year we provided a little over 50.  This year we are providing 150.  This is a fairly reasonable start considering the costs of the kiosks and <Col N="2611" /> the other things we have to consider. We have to get our priorities right. While I have a certain amount of sympathy for Deputy Bruton's point of view, my sympathy must be tempered <Col N="2612" /> by commonsense.  If the Deputy could do the same with his emotional thinking he would agree with me.</P>
