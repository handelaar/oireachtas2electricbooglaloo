      <P>The only aspect I propose to deal with this morning is agriculture.  The Government have a peculiar approach to cattle prices and milk prices.  Undoubtedly, we stand to gain substantially from both these products if we join the EEC but there is a complete reluctance on the part of the Government to face up to the <Col N="800" /> other major implications in respect of our agricultural policy.  On the basis of current prices in the EEC, we can look forward to an increase of 60 per cent in cattle prices.  Entry to the EEC will not be until 1973 at least.  There will then follow a transitional period of five years.  Cattle prices, therefore, become somewhat unpredictable.</P>
      <P>The current price of a gallon of milk in the EEC is 3s 9d, whereas the average price paid to Irish farmers in 1969 was 2s 5d.  One can superficially say that Irish farmers will receive an automatic increase of 1s 4d per gallon in the event of our entry into the EEC. Apart from these two increases, the Government have given no indication what other benefits our agricultural industry will obtain from entry to the EEC.  There has been a complete failure on the part of the Government and on the part of those who favour rapid entry to face up to the fact that the whole agricultural pricing policy, the whole structural policy with regard to agricultural subsidies and <i>vis-á-vis</i> the level of food prices in the Common Market has become an unholy mess.</P>
      <P>Although the numbers employed in agriculture in the Community have fallen dramatically the problem facing the Common Market is the high number of people still employed in agriculture. It may come as a surprise to some of the more traditionally-minded Fianna Fáil rural Deputies to learn that although only 14 per cent of the labour force is employed in agriculture that is viewed by agricultural economists in the EEC as being a matter of almost imminent catastrophe. That figure of 14 per cent is five times as many as are employed in agriculture in Britain.  On entry, Ireland will have the highest proportion of its labour force of any European country employed in agriculture.  The problems for us are very considerable indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deficiency payments system operated in Britain and the support subsidy levy system operated in the EEC are in many respects incompatible. The common impression in Britain and the widespread impression in the Common Market is that if negotiations break down&mdash;we shall not know that for at least a year and a half&mdash;<Col N="801" /> they will break down on the price to be paid for the amendment of the common agricultural policy and, more particularly, its absorption with Britain going in.  It is, therefore, superficial, inappropriate and misleading to the Irish farming community to state on a global basis that they will get 60 per cent increase on their cattle prices and an increase of 1s 4d a gallon for milk and, hey presto, all their problems will be solved.  It is much more complex and traumatic for Irish farmers than a superficial approach of that nature.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his opening speech, and Deputy Hillery in his approach to the problem have failed to deal effectively with the actual effect on Irish agriculture of the current incompatibility of the British support system for agriculture and the common agricultural policy as it now exists and has been adopted by the EEC countries. There has been very little analysis in this approach.  All we had from the Minister after his visit to Luxembourg on 30th June was this particular statement in the official communiqué in which he said that the Irish Government accepted the objectives of the common agricultural policy as set out in the Treaty of Rome and fully supported the action taken by the Community to implement that policy.  I must confess I view such statements with amazement on occasion.  The farmers in the Republic should examine closely the implications of the support given by the Irish Government to the objectives of the common agricultural policy and all action taken by the Community.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that in the European Commission there is a very adamant and definite view as to what should be done with agriculture in both Europe and Ireland.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has visions of the Italian veal producers having a long look at Irish grasslands at this point in time.  I met some Italian people with agricultural interests who have not hidden their views.  They would regard Ireland as a useful point from which to fly veal to Italy.  Their interests in Irish dairy herds and Irish grasslands would be marginal.</P>
    <P>The most outstanding aspect of the Commission's approach to agriculture <Col N="802" /> is its adamant intention to reduce dramatically the size of the farming population in this country.  I do not propose to express particular personal judgment on this.  Does the Fianna Fáil Party, and do the traditional rural Deputies in that party, appreciate the implications of the general proposition to enter into the EEC?  If they accept the profound structural and regional implications for agriculture, as are proposed in the Common Market by the Commission, that is fair enough.  Let them be prepared to go throughout the country and explain this to the Irish farming community.  Let them convey the implications of Irish entry to the EEC to the farming community.  That is their democratic choice and function. If they do not appreciate the point, and if they rely on changes in the cattle and milk prices to the exclusion of all else, they are being politically dishonest.</P>
    <P>The Commission have stated that as a result of measures which it is now introducing it is hoped that there will be an acceleration of the exodus of farmers so that by 1980 the farming population will have fallen from the current figure in the EEC of 10 million persons in agriculture to approximately 5 million persons in agriculture.  If those 5 million people were to quit agriculture by 1980 in the EEC, and they occupied 12½ acres on average, then more than 60 million acres of the land in the Common Market would have to change.  Part of the land will be withdrawn from agriculture and part will be kept in agriculture and used to increase the size of farms for those farmers who decide to stay in agriculture.  These farms must be large enough to allow an optimum combination of production factors in order to be efficient.  These larger units will have to be created by the expansion of the existing farms, by the process of amalgamation and by voluntary co-operation between farmers.  Let us put that to the Fianna Fáil cumainn in rural Ireland.  It may be the best thing that ever happened to Irish agriculture but then again it might not be the best thing.  Let the cumainn be aware of what the implications are in terms of EEC entry.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out to the <Col N="803" /> House that there are 76,000 Irish farmers living on farms of under 30 acres. There are 52,000 Irish farmers living on farms of between 30 and 50 acres. My interpretation of the EEC policy is that, by and large, there are about 120,000 Irish farmers in this country who, on EEC criteria of agricultural viability, should not be engaged in agriculture.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and to the Government to say this to the Irish farmers before they start holding a referendum and before they start Christianising Europe and sending the monks, <i>á la</i> the Tánaiste, Deputy Childers, back to Bobbio.  Let them start putting these hard facts of life before the Irish agricultural community. We would then have a more honest reaction than a very short-term one in terms of immediate changes in some agricultural prices.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the House what has happened in respect of the Danish farms over the past couple of years.  In the 1960s the number decreased by approximately 50,000. Smallholdings were amalgamated to form bigger units.  In the 1970s a further reduction of approximately 70,000 in the number of farms is foreseen, leaving 80,000 farms in 1980 compared with approximately 200,000 farms in 1960.  This has been a transformation. There has been a change in agriculture in Denmark too.  It is not unfair to say that in this country there has been a very considerable reduction in the total number of persons employed in agriculture.  Very little stress is laid on the proposition in the official estimates for Irish agriculture produced by the Irish Government in terms of future implications for Irish people and Irish farms.  It is stated that if we take the Buchanan strategy, which I accept has not yet been adopted by the Irish Government, there were 330,000 people employed in agriculture four years ago. According to Buchanan, by 1986 there would be 198,000, a drop of 135,000 people in agriculture within 16 years. We must face up to the implications contained in these facts.  Without making any particular judgment on the fact as such, all I wish to state <Col N="804" /> to the House is that there has been an abysmal side-stepping by the Government in respect of this analysis and this urgent need to analyse the extent to which there would be massive changes in the structure of Irish agriculture on entry to the EEC.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I shall also place on record the fact that within the EEC farm structures are perhaps somewhat worse than they are in Ireland.  However, this is a cold comfort because in the EEC only 14 per cent of the population are engaged in agriculture. Within that 14 per cent there is a substantially worse situation than ours in terms of smallness of farms.  Some 48 per cent of Irish holdings are between one and 30 acres.  In the EEC, the figure is 67 per cent.  Some 20 per cent of farms in the EEC are between 25 and 50 acres while in Ireland the figure for the same size of farms is 21.6 per cent&mdash;no great difference, although there are substantially greater numbers of small farms of up to 25 acres within the EEC than there are in Ireland.  Notwithstanding that, there are far fewer persons engaged in agriculture within the Common Market than there are in Ireland.  Therefore, to sum up my attitude in relation to the prospects for agriculture, I would say that for most of our products, they are reasonably good.</P>
    <P>The White Paper estimated the volume of gross agricultural output that might be expected to show an increase by the latter years of the decade. This increase was estimated to be in the order of 30 or 40 per cent over the present level, but even with an increase of that nature in Irish agricultural output by, say, 1978, there would be a very substantial reduction in the number of persons employed in agriculture.  The outlook is favourable for cattle and sheep and it is certainly favourable for lambs, but I must put a question mark where milk is concerned. In so far as pigmeat, poultry and eggs are concerned&mdash;these products account for 16 per cent of agricultural output here&mdash;the cost of production is likely to increase.  This increase will arise largely from increases in cereal prices.  I am not very hopeful in regard to pigmeat, poultry and eggs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> EEC is not fully appreciated by the</P>
    <P>In relation to horticulture, I would like to point out, as has been borne out by the first report of the Committee on Industrial Progress, that although horticulture accounts for only 3 per cent of Irish agricultural production, there will be very severe competition for these products within the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with the Mansholt Plan because it has already been dealt with effectively by Deputy Justin Keating.  However, I will say that I find in the statements of many Irish Ministers, notably the statement of the Minister for Lands&mdash;whom one might call Mansholt in reverse, or Mansholt in perverse&mdash;a total contradiction between the attitudes of the front bench members of the Government in relation to the reorganisation, the restructuring and rationalisation of agriculture and the attitude that they themselves adopt in many respects towards the rationalisation or development of Irish farms.</P>
    <P>I shall deal briefly now with another aspect in relation to which a serious difficulty arises in respect of the Common Market and where, in so far as I am concerned, there is a rather extraordinary reversal of the normal attitude of Fianna Fáil Deputies in particular and, indeed, of Fine Gael Deputies.  This is the question of the sale of land to aliens.  I think that there is a glossing over of the failure to appreciate the full implications of EEC entry in this regard.  I have heard opposition in various parts of the country to the purchase of land by aliens, and questions on the matter have been raised in this House by Deputies of all parties who now, apparently, support entry to the EEC.  I merely want to put the facts before the House because, to my mind, support of entry to the EEC and simultaneous opposition at home to the sale of land to aliens are naturally contradictory.  It is about time that the Government and those Fine Gael Deputies who support entry on a general basis should at least appreciate what exactly they are advocating.  There has been action on the part of the Government in the context of Land Act legislation in so far as the sale of land to aliens <Col N="806" /> is restricted substantially.  However, that is generally accepted as being contradictory to the various articles of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the House that acceptance of Article 52 of the treaty would mean that restrictions of the freedom of establishment of nationals of a member state will be progressively abolished in the course of the transitional period.  This means that over a period of five years from 1973, assuming that that is to be the date of entry, we then abolish any internal statutory restrictions that we might have on the sale of land to non-nationals.  I prefer to use the term &ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo; rather than aliens but I do not suffer from any perverted patriotism in that regard. Article 54 of the treaty specifically provides the enabling of a national of one state to acquire and to exploit land situated in the territory of another state.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made in the Government's White Paper to refer quietly to this as being a qualified right under the EEC.  In the White Paper of 1961-62, the Government said that this qualification was, to the extent that there was no infringement of Article 39, paragraph 2, part of the Treaty. But I would point out to the House that Article 39, paragraph 2, does no more than set out as part of the objectives of the EEC Commission the need in preparing agricultural policy within a member state to make appropriate adjustments gradually.  There is nothing in article 39 to give the kind of protection that since 1962 the Government have been saying exists in relation to the sale of land to non-nationals. There is nothing in these qualifications which could be interpreted by any stretch of the imagination as being in conflict with the proposition under Article 52 permitting foreigners to buy Irish farms on the same terms as Irish nationals.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Fianna Fáil that they go to the crossroads, to the chapel gates and to the cumainn meetings and tell the people what that involves.  If their reaction is tested, it will be found that we are telling the truth in this regard.  I may be wrong in thinking that this aspect of agricultural policy in the <Col N="807" /> agricultural community in general.  If it is understood and appreciated by the Government and the agricultural community it represents an extraordinary reversal of the views of the Fianna Fáil Party and of other spokesmen for the farming community in this country.  We should also point out that land generally in the European setting is regarded as very viable, lucrative and a stable form of capital.  Land values are at least three or four times that in Ireland. Land certainly has a speculative content vastly in excess of what Irish nationals would consider it to have. This is one of the considerations which have not been adverted to in relation to the Government's approach to entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>One of the problems facing the country and the agricultural community in particular is the lack of any dialogue on the part of the Government in regard to the implications for agriculture. It may not sound unduly snide to say that we have a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who, by and large, in terms of dialogue with the agricultural community, in terms of being known extensively on a personal basis to agricultural leaders, has failed to live up to the example set by his predecessors. He is certainly not as ebullient as the previous occupant of that Ministry but I do not think it can be said that Deputy Gibbons has won the confidence of Irish farmers in terms of Irish entry into the EEC.  In such a situation, in a situation of political uncertainty in this country with major problems looming on the agricultural front, there is need to have the National Industrial Economic Council reconstituted as a matter of urgency.  The agricultural interests in this country should be incorporated into a wider National Industrial Economic Council. I have repeatedly suggested in this House that the NIEC, with its exclusive industrial base, should have its scope broadened and its personnel extended. The Government should exercise their imagination and employ their energies to ensure that the NIEC becomes a broader National Industrial Economic Council incorporating agricultural interests.</P>
    <P>It is no credit to the Government <Col N="808" /> to say that after 13 months in power they have done nothing in this regard. One can count on one's fingers the progress made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries over that period.  Apart from getting involved in the usual wrangles about milk prices and so on, he has not done much. While I accept that many members of the Cabinet, notably Deputy Colley and Deputy Gibbons, have a disregard for the NIEC, such a powerful organisation as the NIEC should be reconstituted. The Government never gave it the support it deserved.  They should do something to integrate the agricultural community into the broader economic mainstream of activities.  If they do not, I am afraid that in the context of entry into the EEC there will be yet another internal deficiency and lack of involvement.</P>
    <P>I might also say that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in the context of entry into the EEC is probably in need of an injection of dynamism. I do not know what has happened to this Department over the years.  It had a succession of political heads who were more involved in their own fortunes and those of the party than in developing a dynamic Department for the largest industry in this country.  Apart from some exceptionally competent and tremendously capable men in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries with a considerable knowledge of the various agricultural communities in the EEC and the effective liaison which two or three of them have with the Irish permanent staff in Brussels, there is no real contact with the agricultural community in this country.  A specific section of senior personnel within the Department of Agriculture should be set up which could devote its time to examining fully the implications involved for the agricultural community in this country if we enter the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Government produced a White Paper in relation to our entry into the EEC and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries produced a separate paper dealing exclusively with agriculture. Over the years we have experienced this isolation of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  If something is not done about this you may <Col N="809" /> have the Minister for External Affairs speaking in Brussels with one voice, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries with another voice, the Department of External Affairs with still another voice and no one quite sure what to say or do in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the strictures I have to make in terms of the need to reconstitute the NIEC, to reconstitute the role of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This is certainly overdue.</P>
    <P>I support the strictures of Deputy Begley in regard to the fishing industry. Deputy Begley very competently and effectively pointed out the serious difficulties facing the Irish fishing industry in the event of entry into the EEC.  The Minister for External Affairs dealt with the matter in one line on 30th June in Luxembourg when he said it will be necessary to raise particular points regarding other agricultural matters, including future arrangements with regard to fisheries.  That was a rather cavalier attitude to adopt in respect of this industry which will face an upleaval for the 1,600 full-time and 3,500 part-time workers in the industry.</P>
    <P>I come now to milk prices.  There is a certain intellectual dishonesty in respect to milk prices.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said that, on entry into the EEC, the farmers will get 3s 9d per gallon for milk.  The price currently is 2s 5d or thereabouts.  In my opinion, the Minister told about one-third of the story.  Admittedly, one can argue hypothetically and theoretically that the Irish farmers will have the price per gallon jumped from 2s 5d to 3s 5d.  This looks very attractive, but it is far from the harsh reality of what must take place in the light of the current massive butter surplus within the EEC.  It seems to be an utterly intractable problem.  At the beginning of 1970 there were 350,000 tons of butter in the EEC countries. Whether it is sold to the Chinese, the Russians, or anyone else, one will certainly not get very much for it and, were it not for the increase we got in the quota to Britain, we would be in really dire straits entering the EEC. Three years ago, Mr. Harold Wilson <Col N="810" /> warned British milk producers that they had very little prospect of substantial benefits within the EEC.  It is rather extraordinary that he should say something utterly different from what we are being told here.  In May, 1967, he said to the House of Commons:</P>
    <P>Perhaps the House will bear with me for a moment if I say a word about milk, in respect of which the problems have been frankly analysed in the White Paper which my right hon.  Friends presented to the House. As they made clear, the difficulties which it is only realistic to foresee depend on the assumption that the EEC regime for milk and milk products will be extended automatically and unamended to Britain on British entry.  This must be a matter for the negotiations, but I think that it is fair to point out that the Community have found it to the advantage of their existing member-countries to encourage within the Six the expansion and output of dairy produce rather than the expansion and output of liquid milk.  I should be surprised if, on reflection, those members of the Community who export dairy products will want matters so arranged on British entry as to encourage in Britain a milk policy and a system of prices for milk and milk products which would result in the production of more butter and cheese in Britain to the detriment of their own producers of milk products.  It might very well suit them, and it would certainly suit us, for the present pattern of milk production in Britain to remain pretty well as it is. But we shall see.</P>
    <P>I am not hopeful.  I am full of trepidation at the prospects for Irish milk and dairy products generally within the EEC in both the short and the long term.  This is one of the crucial aspects in negotiation for both Irish and British agriculture over the next 18 months.  It should be pointed that we ourselves are the creators of the situation here because, at a cost of £70, £75 or £80 million, we have developed a situation in which in the short span of ten years milk intake into our creameries has doubled and the value of our exports of dairy products <Col N="811" /> has quadrupled.  The latter is all to the good.  Our creameries handled an increase in milk of some 250 million gallons over ten years.  The value of our exports in the same period rose from £8 million to an estimated £33 million this year.  That is the statement of Mr. Joe McGough, general manager of Bord Bainne.  Were it not for the efforts made by Bord Bainne the Irish economy, the taxpayers and the farmers would be facing an extremely critical situation.</P>
    <P>We have doubled the output of milk over the past decade.  There has been a dramatic increase in cow numbers and the yield per cow has also dramatically increased.  We face a serious situation from the point of view of the disposal of milk products.  I do not want to depress the House, or to deceive the House, because my relatives in mid-Cork are involved in dairy farming, but it is only fair to stress that there is a depressing prospect for butter and skim milk because of the mountain of butter which exists in the EEC countries.  As Mr. McGough said, this is a matter of grave concern.  I shall not emphasise it more than that.  There is a massive mountain of 500,000 tons of butter which must be moved.  It would appear that there is no option but to sell it at give-away prices.  That is the only prospect for this massive butter surplus.  It is all very well saying the Irish farmer will get an increase in the price of milk from 2s 5d to 3s 9d per gallon but, if the price of butter in England, for example, goes up from 3s or 3s 6d per pound, on EEC entry, to 5s, 6s or 8s 6d a pound, the British housewife is quite likely to shift to substitutes as have many Irish housewives who have given up buying butter because of its exceptionally high price on the home market.</P>
    <P>Seeing that everybody, in the past couple of days, has been telling the British Government what they think, in terms of their relationship with this country, I may say that I have often felt that if half the energy expended at Press conferences, and in other aspects of related political life, were expended by Irish negotiators in seeking an increase of the Irish butter quota in Britain, the benefit to the Irish <Col N="812" /> economy would be substantial.  We have not been getting from Britain a very reasonable or normal deal in terms of Irish butter quotas.  In relation to Common Market entry, fair enough.  We must certainly maintain our present butter quota and seek to have it substantially increased on entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to understand the thinking behind a great many of the supposedly sympathetic British attitudes towards Irish agriculture, particularly the alleged benefits to Irish agriculture under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Britain imports some 450,000 tons of butter each year&mdash; 175,000 tons from New Zealand; 90,000 tons from Denmark; 70,000 tons from Australia, and this year, some 30,000 tons from Ireland.  Let us be under no illusion.  If Deputy Hillery could choke Sir Alec Douglas Home with butter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for External Affairs should avail of every opportunity in negotiations to point out to our British counterparts that 30,000 tons of butter out of 450,000 tons of British butter imports is not a reasonable or a fair butter quota for us to have.</P>
      <P>My concluding comment is in respect of the regional policy of the EEC.  The prospects of a regional policy have been summed up rather tersely in the Common Market monthly review of January, 1970.  In an article on the Grogan Report on Regional Policy in the Community certainly one comment raised the hair on my head&mdash;what is left of it.  The Minister for Lands, Deputy S. Flanagan, in particular, may be interested in this analysis of the prospects for regional policy:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission offers a solution for each of the different types of regions.  In the industrialised region, the existing momentum should be maintained but one should be aware of the dangers of mushrooming organisation. In the case of the semi-industrialised regions, the promotion <Col N="813" /> of investment is envisaged.  In the agricultural regions provisions should be made for the extension of an agrarian infrastructure.</P>
    <P>This, then, leaves us with the regions not fit for anything.</P>
    <P>There, the Commission expects to see built sanatoriums, rest homes, hotels and research institutes.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure how the Irish Government view that particular concept of a regional policy in terms of the EEC.  It is as well that the people of the alleged non-prosperous and under-developed areas of this country should be aware of the possible regional effects of EEC policies on this country.</P>
    <P>It should be a matter of major concern of the Government and, indeed, of the Minister for Lands in particular, to ensure that, in negotiations with the EEC, as far as we are concerned, there will not be any decimation of, particularly, the regions of the West of Ireland.  A peculiar attitude has been taken here, a kind of writing-off, on a regional basis, of very much, in many respects, of one of the critical backbones of the country.  We tend to forget that the West of Ireland has made, is making and will continue to make a very distinctive regional contribution to the Irish economy.  Any attempt, therefore, by the EEC to write off the 160,000 holdings in that part of our nation should be viewed with very considerable reserve and very considerable reaction by the Government. Otherwise, I am afraid the imbalance which is already evident in the Irish community would be very profoundly accelerated and, in that case, we would be in further trouble.</P>
    <P>These are my concluding comments on the Government's White Paper. There is a need for extensive consultation during the next 18 months on these developments as they emerge in relation to negotiations.  I would make one suggestion to the Government in this regard.  I am conscious that, with due regard to the Civil Service team in Brussels at the moment and to the front bench of the Government&mdash;no longer as strong as it was; certainly, there is a need to strengthen it&mdash;there is a need <Col N="814" /> to ensure that the Government have the fullest consultation with the various representative interests of this country during the course of the negotiations.  I would, therefore, suggest strongly to the Government that it might be an invaluable and fruitful exercise if the Irish negotiating team were enlarged to include, on a purely non-political observership information basis, representatives of the farming community, agricultural economists, senior representatives of the agricultural organisations and representatives of the business community, employer organisations and trade union organisations. It is desirable that they be given the option of being present with the Irish negotiators in Brussels&mdash;not necessarily for the full 18 months; I think that would be quite impossible.  It is quite inadequate that the Taoiseach should stand up here and say, in effect: &ldquo;I will brief the Opposition leaders.  I will tell them all that is going on.&rdquo;  That is quite inappropriate.  If we become involved in EEC negotiations there is a necessity for more widespread dialogue in the nation than is proposed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>These are my views on the EEC White Paper.  They are my personal views.  I do not want the House to be caught up in any false euphoria.  I have tried to make a rational, objective and cool analysis of the situation, not on any particular ideological basis.  The House should remember that in the 1970s the number of students coming out of the secondary schools will have doubled.  By the mid-1970s there will be about 140,000 students coming out of the secondary schools as compared with 73,000 now, as a result of the explosion in Irish Education.  We must have an expanding economy to provide them with jobs.  In the past eight or nine years about 26,000 students have come out of the vocational schools and we expect that there will be about 46,000 in the future.  Employment must be provided for those young persons in this State.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously, Irish agriculture must be developed and protected.  All the political energy of this House will be needed to ensure that the kind of society we all desire emerges.  It is a <Col N="815" /> chastening thought that, notwithstanding the tremendous wealth and the international standing and power of the American economy, an economy which is a vast common market in itself, greater in power and vastly bigger than the EEC, they have not eliminated unemployment and poverty. If we enter the EEC there is no guarantee that we will eliminate unemployment and poverty.  In America only a few years ago it was accepted that some nine million families, or 20 per cent of the population, were living below the poverty line.  It was estimated that in 1965 that number of families were living on an income of less than 3,000 dollars a year for two or more persons.  That was the poverty line drawn by the President's economic advisers.</P>
    <P>If, with their power, their technological skills and their own common market, they found it and are finding it extremely difficult to resolve the problems of poverty and unemployment and the problems of geographical and regional imbalance and discrimination, on our entry into the EEC&mdash; whether the Irish people decide to go in or not is a matter for them&mdash;it is very likely that we will find it difficult also to resolve our problems.  It is up to the Opposition and the Labour Party to point out the difficulties and the problems involved.  I would hope that our contribution to date has been of value even if it has been lengthy.  I want to assure the House that that was quite unintentional on my part and on the part of Deputy Keating.  It was not intended as a filibuster.  We wanted to put these problems on the records of the House.  We wanted to do the job for which we receive £2,500 of the taxpayers' money and we wanted to perform the function for which we were sent here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the contributions from the Labour Party it is very difficult to understand, never mind to assess, the attitude of the Labour Party to entry into the EEC.  I was under the impression earlier on that the Labour Party were totally opposed to any idea of entering the Common Market but, listening to Deputy <Col N="816" /> Desmond over a long period last night, it seemed to me from the very many helpful suggestions he put forward in one way or another that there was a change of base, a change of opinion, so far as the Labour Party were concerned.  Unfortunately, this morning, again I seemed to detect a hardening of attitude in the speech made by Deputy Desmond.  One wonders whether the Labour Party are trying to be on both sides of the fence, trying to guard themselves in case we do get in and, if we do not get in, being able to say they were right. This is an attitude that should not develop in this House or outside it because, once we are in&mdash;and it would appear that we will get in&mdash;we will need the unified backing of every Member of this House and, indeed, of the people outside it.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I had my doubts about the wisdom of going into the Common Market but, when I saw the eager and even the avid approach of our farming community towards getting into this organisation, I changed my opinion.  If a body as conservative as our farming community see advantages&mdash;and they have been going to Europe to examine and study conditions there for a number of years&mdash; in our entry and are prepared to take this chance, the whole nation should be behind them.  As a member of a committee of agriculture I attended meetings in Europe over a period of years and I am satisfied that there are very great opportunities for our farmers in the Common Market.</P>
      <P>We have advantages that no other farming section in Europe has.  We have our magnificent grasslands and limestone soils which are the foundation of our whole livestock industry and which help to produce healthy animals.  We produce plenty of grass which gives us the cheapest form of feeding.  It is very obvious to anybody going through Europe that none of the farmers there have this advantage. Practically all the cattle in Germany have to be stall fed.  The food has to be produced and brought into the houses for the animals.  That is certainly not the cheapest way of producing beef and milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is and has been for a considerable <Col N="817" /> time a shortfall of 20 per cent in beef supplies in the six Common Market countries.  This augurs well for our cattle interests and our cattle production. I am reasonably satisfied from information picked up at many committee meetings I have served on that cattle prices will have to increase by as near as possible to 75 per cent over the present price.  This should help to get our farmers off the backs of the ordinary people.  This has been said all too often by people other than farmers. I never believed that the farmers have been on the backs of anyone but if they have been it behoves everyone to help them in their effort to get to grips with the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The livestock industry can, I believe, be increased fourfold.  We have the land, the energy and ability to produce beef and having regard to the fact that there is this colossal market in Europe, it is here that the best interests of agriculture can be served. We have the grasslands and clean, disease-free herds backed up by a very progressive sales system which should be one of the big factors in getting our dead meat into Europe in the cheapest and best possible way.  This is of the utmost importance to the farming community and the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I also believe we can maintain if not increase our milk production and dispose of it within the Common Market. In reference to what Deputy Desmond said earlier, I should like to draw his attention to the fact that his figures for surplus butter are not up to date. He said there was a surplus of half a million tons of butter in Europe but recent figures show that this surplus has been reduced practically by half by virtue of a reduction in the cow population of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the cost.  I am giving facts.  Much of the Deputy's speech was useful but throughout there was a rather authoritative note based on theory.  Theory and supposition have been disproved by history.  Reference was made to the Mansholt Plan.  I can assure Deputy Keating from my experience of Europe, <Col N="818" /> that the Germans, the Belgians and the Dutch are as much opposed to this plan as we should be and are in this country because the Mansholt Plan does not fit in at all with our set-up.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would definitely not work in this country or in Europe either.  The bulk of German, Italian and other farmers in the countries concerned have the very smallest holdings. Deputy Desmond gave figures of 76,000 under 30 acres and 56,000 between 30 and 50 acres.  I can give better figures than those.  In County Kerry 84 per cent of the farms are under £10 valuation and £1 per acre is considered a fair valuation so 84 per cent of Kerry farmers have only ten acres of land each and yet they are the most progressive farmers in the country.  They produce one-seventh of the milk of the entire country and nearly one-quarter of our pigs. Those may be startling figures but they are statistically correct.  County Kerry farmers have nothing to fear from the Common Market and I can assure Deputy Desmond that the Kerry farmers and those in the rest of the country are confident that they can meet competition from European farmers. We have all the advantages on our side climatically and this is where we can score.  No Irish farmer will feel he is less well fitted than a European farmer to stand up to whatever the Common Market brings.  Our people can produce and I think we shall find them selling their output to Europe in the condition in which Europe wants it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also referred to veal demands in Europe.  European veal is different from what we term veal in this country.  What they call veal in Europe is baby beef to us; it is the finished animal of 12 to 15 months, the correct type of animal to produce and finish as far as possible in this country.  Here we term as veal a calf of anything from three to six weeks old.  Let us call it beef because that it what it is.  We are better fitted than any country in Europe to turn out profitably an animal of ten cwt at 15 to 17 months.  We have room for vast improvement in production so long as <Col N="819" /> our people get the backing and are realistic in their approach.  It behoves all of us to encourage them.  I am prepared to go to any crossroads in this country, as Deputy Desmond suggested, and I know that those waiting there to hear of the advantages of the Common Market will not need to be told; they know them themselves.  Quite a number have been out to see for themselves.  Anything we have to say here will not affect their approach. They are a conservative people but once they have made up their minds it is up to us to back them to the limit.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed two years ago to be informed by the German Department of Agriculture that there were 38,000 cows in the heart of Berlin to supply milk to the city.  If cows must be reared inside a city, fed and kept there, surely we should have no worry about the position of our farmers.  We were shown some of these in Berlin.  At least they were there two years ago.  I do not know if they are there now.  This is the type of competition we shall be up against from Europe and it should not be serious.</P>
    <P>I attended the Paris agricultural show with Deputy Clinton and we were amazed to see the various types of cows of all sizes and colours there, not a standardised type.  There were very few Charollais there, peculiarly enough, as we thought this type would predominate in France.  Apparently, it does not.</P>
    <P>The milk problem in Europe is fading out.  With the high cost of labour and of milk production the farmer is in a difficult position and it is thought that most European farmers with plenty of other work to do will phase themselves out of milk production.  This must be to the advantage of our farmers.</P>
    <P>Beef production must also be developed particularly in relation to the suckling calf.  Larger farms of 200 and 400 acres should be involved in this.  A 200-acre farm should be carrying a minimum of 150 cows of beef type and all too many of them are down to 50 and under.  This is where the scope for increased beef production lies.  If possible legislation should be brought in to <Col N="820" /> compel people with large tracts of land who are not using it to advantage to lease some of that land to people who would put the right type of stock on it. In milk-producing areas many of our farmers who normally sold the calves at the dropped stage will feed those calves now to a mature stage of 12 to 15 months.  Therefore to get the extra production needed an examination of our entire grasslands should be undertaken, if these statistics are not available already, in order to ensure the maximum beef production.  Our animals must also be kept free from disease.</P>
    <P>On the question of animal diseases, on our entry into Europe we shall have to take every precaution to see that the diseases so common in Europe are not brought into our country.  In most European countries, particularly France, foot and mouth disease is endemic. They do not slaughter and the disease is prevalent at all times even although not active.  I am sure the Department of Agriculture, who are aware of our record in regard to disease-free animals, will be ever-watchful of that position.  At meetings in Europe we have tried to bring about a change in the attitude of France and other countries, but they insist their method suits them.  However, we want to ensure it does not endanger our position here.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of everyone in this country should go to our farming associations who are so anxious to face up to this challenge.  I am satisfied that they will grasp the opportunity which is being afforded to them.  We should give them the maximum support and assistance and at no time should we say or do anything that would discourage this approach and this attitude.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to our fishing industry.  By and large, we have no fishing industry.  Some weeks ago I compared the position in this country with that of other countries in Europe. I said the Faroe Islands with only thousands of a population are producing £10 million worth of fish as against our recent figure of £2.5 million worth of sea-landed, fish.  References have been made to protective measures that should be undertaken to ensure that the Europeans do not encroach on our fishing.  It would have been much better to refer to the fish which is <Col N="821" /> there and which we are not catching.</P>
    <P>There is a 12-month fishing season around our coasts, and if wisdom had prevailed down the years this industry would be a very strong arm of our economy.  Our fish landings should be on a par with those of Norway who, having a population somewhat similar to ours, have £100 million worth of fish landings, and employment on land and on sea should be available to about 100,000 of our people.  Let us hope that even at this late stage a vigorous attempt will be made to develop this very lucrative industry. There is a market of £186 million within the six EEC countries.  That is the amount of fish they must import, and we should be able to obtain a little of that for ourselves if sufficient effort is made.  It is unfortunate that fisheries were never made a separate ministry with sufficient money to develop them. They have always been attached to agriculture which is so onerous and complicated that fisheries were left on the outside without the help and initiative necessary to develop them to the maximum.</P>
    <P>It is starting that Norway, with only four months of a fishing season, are capable of having an industry worth £100 million, while this country with a 12 months season can produce only £2.5 million worth of sea fish.  Let us hope this industry, which could be the saving of the west, will now be developed.</P>
    <P>In fishing, as well as in industry, education is going to play a very big part.  Agricultural advisory services are absolutely essential in order to get farmers interested in the most modern methods.  Such services have helped to a very large measure in my county. We were the first to get the maximum advisory services which were available and that step is beginning to pay off in a big way now.  Great credit is due to the men who were sent out ten years ago to get the message across to farmers that the development of grass, the maximum use of fertilisers and individual attention to animal care to prevent disease were essential. As I said, this has paid off and the results are to be seen in the productive effort made in my county.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> I have often studied and read about the position of various committees of agriculture in other counties and I am amazed and indeed alarmed at the very small number of advisers which they have.  Advisory services are essential and can be very helpful.  During the election campaign in Westmeath I was canvassing in certain areas in that county and I was amazed to see the amount of land which had no grass of any kind on it.  If the advisory services were available there the people would have a different approach to their agricultural problems.  There were two cases which I noticed particularly. One was the case of a very big and up-to-date farmers who had good green fields with a good mat of grass over many acres.  At the other end was a smallholder with about 15 acres who had a very good mat of grass but the fields all around him were as bare as the roadway and just as white.  This indicates what could be done.  These two farmers were using plenty of fertilisers on the land.  Advisory services should be extended to the utmost, particularly in good grassland areas, to get across to the farmers the message that they should develop their grasslands to the maximum and thus be able to produce the maximum quantity of beef which can be sold so easily throughout the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to the danger to our industrial arm and to the position generally of our industries. I should like to point out that practically all the industries in Kerry, which are mainly German or Swedish firms, are exporting their products to Europe and into the Common Market.  To do this they have to pay between 14 and 17 per cent entry duty but still they are in full production.  They are developing each year and adding extensions to their factories.  This, therefore, is the answer to Deputy Keating's suggestion that our industries will be in danger. Why should our industrialists be afraid of a clash with the Common Market with all the organisation they have both in the way of trade unions and executive ability?  Why should they be afraid of entering the Common Market when our farmers are eager to come to grips with it and to get in?  Our industrialists <Col N="823" /> are capable and competent.  Those who are not yet organised should get organised now while they still have time and then they should have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>We pride ourselves on our ability, our energy and our strength of purpose and we have measured up to the very best.  Therefore it is not understandable why there should be a suggestion that our industrialists fear going into the Common Market.  It is obvious that we cannot compete against the very big concerns in Europe, but then we will not be competing with them anyway. We are not producing the type of goods or materials they are producing. Our industries are based on smaller outputs of materials and goods which require individual attention and which could not be mass-produced by very big concerns.  There is, therefore, plenty of opportunity in Europe for our industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating also said he was satisfied that trade unionism here had nothing to learn from Europe.  I could not agree with that.  Our trade unions do need to be educated.  In Europe the trade unions get on well with management and they arrange a working plan for five years which enables the industrialist to book orders.  They have an agreed wage structure, at whatever increasing levels are required based on output and this seems to work quite well.  They do not have strikes as such. This is one sphere in which the trade unions here can learn and gain.  One thing about which the trade unions must be aware is that in many places, particularly in Dublin, trade union members serving behind counters are quite prepared to present customers with foreign made materials and goods as against our own materials and goods. I drew attention to this about seven or eight years ago in regard to a particular firm and I was amazed to hear recently that a lady had to walk out from the same place because she wanted to purchase an Irish knitted garment and the person attending her tried to convince her that a Scottish article or something else he had was far more suitable.  All too often in hotels and bars when you ask for a <Col N="824" /> whiskey you will be asked &ldquo;Scotch or Irish?&rdquo;  They do not even say &ldquo;Irish to Scotch?&rdquo; Reference should not be made at all to Scotch whiskey and when you ask for whiskey you should be given Irish whiskey.  This is where the trade unions could help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, I am aware that staffs may be forced to some extent to do this because many firms here are foreign-based and they purchase in large quantities materials from outside. Trade unionists could control this to seme extent.  They should use every method in their power in an effort to keep their fellow-Irishmen in work. They should ensure that the Irish manufactured article is always shown to the customer.  We all know that the home-manufactured product is as good as the foreign-made article, although it may not be presented as attractively. I cannot agree with the statement made by Deputy Desmond that trade unions here have nothing to learn from trade union groups in Europe.  We can show our sense of patriotism by ensuring that Irish-made goods are given prominence in our shops and stores and if trade unions would bring this point to the notice of their members who serve in those establishments they would do something really effective to help our country.  In view of the suggestions that have been made that we may be faced with dumping, we need all the organised ability we can get and trade unions should realise that by informing their members of the desirability of promoting Irish goods they can help us in this direction.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that we have a great future once we enter the EEC.  I do not suggest that it will be easy because we shall be in competition with people who work harder than we do and who will use every means to further their own interests.  However, it will be a challenge and we have the ability and initiative to meet it.</P>
      <P>Contrary to common belief, I consider we have an advantage over the rest of Europe in the industrial sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> Any factories that will be established here can be so designed as to give maximum production with minimum effort.  I have been to many cities in Germany and have seen factories which were divided up into different sections, sometimes spread throughout many parts of the cities.  It is a well-known fact that because of the land shortage factory-owners on the continent very often have no choice but to locate their businesses on any sites that are available.  That situation will not arise in this country and it is possible for an industrialists to design his factory in one complete unit and to have the manufacturing process carried out under the same roof.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are ideally qualified to produce high-class, specialised goods which can find a ready market in many parts of Europe.  This is an area that should be explored and I am convinced it would be greatly to our advantage to do this.  We were mainly concerned about our prospects in the agricultural sphere but I have no fears in this regard.  The prospects for our farming community, which comprises a large part of our population, are good. Hard work will be necessary but the rewards are there and I am convinced our farmers will reap the benefits.</P>
    <P>Members of this House should give all the necessary encouragement and support to our people.  We should not display a gloomy attitude because fears do not exists among the farming community regarding our entry into the EEC.  On the contrary, farmers are eager to enter the Common Market and we should give them all the assistance we can.  It is clear that large quantities of beef are required in Europe and this is one area in which we can reap many benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot but admire the evolution of the EEC.  One must recall that this co-operation between countries developed after the second world war-a war that ravaged the countries of Europe and destroyed much of their economies.  The progress the Communities have made since 1958 merits our admiration.  I quote from a booklet issued by the Information Service of the EEC:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> It is also one of the fastest growing major economic areas of the world.  Between 1958, the year in which the Common Market began, and 1966, its gross product increased in volume by 51 per cent, compared with 45 per cent for the USA and 30 per cent for the UK.</P>
    <P>This is an indication of the success of the EEC in the matter of economic and industrial co-operation.</P>
    <P>One can be slightly disappointed at the progress achieved in Ireland.  In the past 100 years our population has continued to fall.  We are not a prosperous nation by western European standards and our <i>per capita</i> income is one of the lowest in Europe.  It is as low as Italy and Spain.  We were not involved in the second world war.  We did not suffer the consequences of that war to any great extent.  Yet we have not prospered like Switzerland has. Perhaps our industrial and agricultural policies have been a failure; by that I mean our capacity has not been utilised to the full.  This is a sad reflection on the policies pursued over the last 30 and possibly the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>I believe we have decided to seek membership of the EEC because Britain has applied for membership. We are tied to the coat tail of Britain in matters of trade policy.  This is unfortunate but for historical reasons it is unavoidable.  We should have applied for association to the EEC in 1958.  I think the Government were neglectful in not doing so.  Association would have permitted us to gain access to European markets for our agricultural produce and this would have led to an increase in exports to the EEC. Over that period our balance of trade with the EEC has been very much against us, yet the Government have made no attempt to rectify the imbalance. Our whole foreign policy is open to criticism.  Apart from Britain, we have allowed ourselves to import from numerous countries, especially the EEC, far more than we have ever exported to them.  We should have been tougher and gone to western Europe and eastern Europe and said, &ldquo;Unless you import £10 million worth of our goods we shall not import £10 million worth of your goods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> Unless our negotiators obtain a very hard bargain on a number of vital issues I feel it will be a mistake to go into Europe.  No one can say what the outcome of the negotiations will be, but after the negotiations we shall have a referendum either on the constitutional changes required or on the straightforward issue of entry or no entry.  Our negotiating team should be as strong as we can make it.  It should not merely be a team of civil servants: successful businessmen, industrialists and academics should be invited to help our negotiating team in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The implications of membership of the EEC must be carefully considered because almost every aspect of our way of life will be affected if we join.  Our agricultural community will be most affected.  I am very enthusiastic about agriculture provided we get free access for our products on all European markets at all times of the year.  An enlarged Community of approximately 250 million people has much to offer our agricultural industry.  I think this in the mainstay of our argument for going in.  It was indicated in the White Paper on Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC that 65 per cent of our agricultural produce can command higher levels of prices in the EEC.  It must be remembered that the EEC is a protected agricultural market; it will be protected from outside imports.  Imports from countries such as the Argentine, Australia, New Zealand and the eastern European countries will not be permitted.  Our advantage lies in our gaining free access to those markets without those countries being allowed to gain access to our markets. America is a protected market for its citizens and the EEC, as at presently constituted, is a very protected market. The benefit for us lies in the continued protection of the EEC, especially in matters of agriculture.</P>
    <P>This must be borne in mind by our negotiators.  Our negotiators must not only worry about our position and our direct application but they must also worry about our competitors.  We will allow European countries to market their goods in our country and we will allow their workers to come here.  This <Col N="828" /> must be on a reciprocal basis.  We must not be denied the fruits of our agricultural competitiveness by seeing other outside countries allowed into this market.  I hope our negotiators will not overlook this vital issue.</P>
    <P>In general, State aids to agriculture will cease.  The structural State aids which help to alter the structure and increase productivity by current subsidies will not go.  We have come to associate subsidies with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and these subsidies will go.  Support prices for pigs will go.  We will be dealing with a different market.  I hope we will leave the cheap food market and go into a dear food market.  This would have an effect on prices.  I will deal with this point later.</P>
    <P>I should like to indicate that the common guide price for cattle in the Community is 287s 10d per live cwt. This is 60 per cent above the level of Irish cattle prices for fat cattle in 1969. This is good.  The European Community offers Ireland an excellent market for our cattle but it offers it only for quality beef and not for fat beef.  Europeans will not take fat meat.  Our breeding policy must be realised.  I am enthusiastic about the Charollais breed.  I do not propose to discuss the breeding of cattle now.  We must be careful about the breeding policy in relation to beef.  On page 36 of the White Paper it says:</P>
    <P>The long term outlook for beef in an enlarged Community, on the basis of OECD forecasts for the period up to 1985, is one of consumption exceeding production leaving a sizeable deficit to be met by imports.</P>
    <P>That is a good omen for the future of our beef cattle.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent market awaiting us for our sheep and lambs.  I must condemn the Fianna Fáil Government over the last few years for allowing the sheep population to drop by over one million.  It is unfortunate that this happened because sheep and lambs are very saleable animals.  There is a solid, permanent market for these animals, especially in France and possibly in Germany.  Our Government have failed the farmers by allowing the sheep <Col N="829" /> population to drop so drastically.</P>
    <P>The problem of milk is a complex one and is not easily explained.  On pages 37 and 38 of the White Paper it says:</P>
    <P>...it is clear that membership of an enlarged Community would result in a substantial increase in the price of milk to Irish producers.</P>
    <P>The price would be approximately 3s 9d as against 2s 7d per gallon at present.  This is good.  There is substantial over-production of milk and butter in Europe.  Whatever happens and whether the Mansholt Plan is accepted and adopted or goes by the board is a matter for the future.  I feel we are protected from price falls through the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  This is a stabilisation fund by means of various types of export subsidies, domestic subsidies, an import system and by threshold price systems.  This is the fund which regulates the market for our agricultural produce in Europe.  In the long term I feel we would be successful in the milk and butter industry in Europe.  I say this without 100 per cent conviction. I feel that the European governments will not allow large drops in prices over the years.  They will be forced to maintain the price of milk and better.  Whatever surpluses arise will have to be exported with the help of subsidies from this fund.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the method of financing this fund will lead to a substantial saving to the Exchequer.  On page 120 of <i>Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC</i> it says:</P>
    <P>As from 1st January, 1975, the Communities' resources, out of which the Fund will be financed, will be made up as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) the receipts from import levies and special sugar production levy;</P>
    <P>(b) the receipts from customs duties;</P>
    <P>(c) the revenue derived from a rate not exceeding one percentage point of the standard value added tax.</P>
    <P>This is a system new to Ireland. Further on in this chapter it says that <Col N="830" /> there will be a saving to the Irish Exchequer of £36 million and that it will cost us in contributions £19 million. There will be a net saving of £17 million to the Exchequer.  This is a reflection of the changing-over to the higher-priced European food system as compared with the British low-priced food system.  The guidance section of the fund is essentially committed to structural improvements in agriculture.</P>
    <P>We have structural agricultural problems, such as problems of fertilisation, problems of land drainage and so on.  It is my belief that we can benefit from this fund under EEC membership, but our negotiating team must be very clear as to what it entails.</P>
    <P>The Mansholt Plan is a plan for the improvement, in Mansholt's opinion, of agriculture.  It is a plan for the elimination of large surpluses and for the rationalisation of farming.  It is worth studying and has been considered within the Community but, as yet, it has not been adopted.  In so far as milk production in Ireland is concerned, its adoption would be dangerous. It would be dangerous in so far as the agricultural structure here would have to be altered and, if altered, could lead to substantial emigration; and this is something which I and, I am sure, everybody else in this House, would not wish for.</P>
    <P>According to the previous speaker, Deputy O'Connor, our fishing industry is non-existent.  I come from Waterford and in my constituency there has been built a new harbour at Dunmore East for the specific purpose of having a port for the landing of fish in the south east of Ireland.  If one goes out there during the fishing season one will see Dutch, English and other trawlers of various nationalities using the port but one will notice that these trawlers are much larger than the Irish trawlers. This is wrong.  It is disappointing that we do not have competitive trawlers that can go out into the deep sea and fish successfully with all modern radar equipment and navigational aids. Development has been lacking in the fishing industry in Ireland.  This industry, if properly equipped and adequately financed, could be much greater than it is.  The Government <Col N="831" /> have failed to provide sufficient State aid in the form of grants.  They have failed to guarantee proper marketing facilities.  In other words, they have failed to make use of sea fishing, which is one of the great natural resources of our country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is a great future for pig meat within the Community. There is a limited market for pigs and lightweight pork but this market could be developed.  As was pointed out in the White Papers, feeding costs have increased and will increase further on our accession to the EEC.  Many of our small farmers have always reared pigs.  This has been a good sideline for them but it could be a profitable mainline for small farmers in Ireland.  The Government have allowed feeding costs to increase out of proportion to selling costs.  The recent increase in the price of pigs, as announced in the Budget, has not been fully implemented and the claim submitted to the Minister by the Bacon Curers Society has led to nothing.  The increased prices allowed by the Minister were miserable when compared with the increase that was asked for justifiably and which was based on feeding costs and increased labour costs.  Indeed, it was based on a survey of the marketing conditions that will prevail during the coming year.</P>
    <P>It is only by increasing the factory prices that our farmers can benefit from so-called guaranteed prices.  The farming community are not happy with the profitability of the bacon industry.  This could be a much more prosperous industry.  Our factories are working to only 50 per cent capacity. There is a lack of markets and a lack of belief by the Government in the future of the bacon industry.  This is a reflection on the Government and it is bad for the farmers.</P>
    <P>In the matters of animal health, the Irish people can hold their heads high but we must be very careful in this respect in going into Europe because foot-and-mouth disease is widespread on the Continent.  Infected animals are not killed but are merely injected and immunised if possible.  The disease is endemic throughout the Continent.  We must not allow live animals to be imported <Col N="832" /> from there to this country because there would be a very real danger of importing foot-and-mouth disease.  This would have dire consequences on our exports to America because we would not then be allowed export beef or meat of any description to the States.</P>
    <P>Our food processing factories must be modernised to comply with modern hygiene standards.  Again, there is not enough State aid in this field.  It is not enough to give a grant of 25 per cent for a modern factory.  In this sphere, too, there is a lack of interest on the part of the Government.  Of course, they have other matters on their minds at this time.</P>
    <P>On balance, I will leave the question of agriculture on an optimistic note.  I am optimistic about the future for our agricultural community but we must be very careful in our negotiations to get free access for our products and prevent outside countries from getting access.  England would be a great danger here because she would be seeking access for Commonwealth countries.  We must tread very carefully here.  We must be hard bargainers. We can become the kitchen of Europe if we manage our negotiations properly but, on the other hand, we could throw away the advantages we have by not insisting on our rights.</P>
    <P>Frankly, the problems facing industry worry me.  The scale of industrial production, except in a few industries, is not on a sufficiently large scale to survive in Europe.  The numerous CIO reports have indicated this with regard to certain industries.  The White Paper paints a relatively rosy picture but it does not deal in depth with the problems facing industry.  I must criticise the White Paper for not giving adequate information in relation to the effects of our entry on industry.  I feel we will be faced with unemployment in a good number of industries.  We must in our negotiations again insist rigidly on an anti-dumping clause.  This is very important because whatever chance we have in industry with fair competitive circumstances we have no chance whatever if dumping is allowed.</P>
    <P>We can, on the basis of a developing nation, on the basis of regionalisation, <Col N="833" /> continue to offer grants to new industries.  This is important but it is, again, a matter for our negotiating team.  The White Paper would lead one to believe it is possible to continue with the grants.  It is essential for us who are relatively undeveloped in the matter of industry to be allowed to continue offering those grants and also tax free profits for a number of years to foreign companies and to Irish companies. In this respect we must ensure that those who become redundant will have every chance of being re-employed in other industries.  We must ensure that labour is retrained where necessary, that there is free movement throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Let me discuss for a moment the free movement of labour within the Community.  In the EEC workers will be free to go from one country to another at their discretion.  They can come to Ireland and they must be treated as if they were in their own homeland.  They must have access to the same working conditions, the same social security benefits and the same unemployment benefits as appertain to Irish citizens.  This could lead to substantial immigration from southern Italy or Spain even.  This could magnify the problems of unemployment. There will be unemployment according to the CIO Report and nobody should doubt that.</P>
    <P>We are taking a chance in relation to Irish industry.  I hope we do not revert to the Act of Union.  I hope the consequences of the Act of Union do not again manifest themselves in Ireland where in the early 19th century Irish industry was wiped out for 30 to 40 years because of free trade. I think, on balance, this will not happen.  We must at the negotiating table ensure that the employment of Irish people is protected as much as possible against unfair competition.</P>
    <P>I feel that the right of establishment in Ireland is good.  It will lead to more competition.  I welcome it in such spheres as banking, and insurance.  Up to very recently in banking circles you had a tight semi-monopolistic ring. Competition does not exist in banking in Ireland.  This is very bad and is detrimental to the national interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> You also have this ring in insurance where premiums are fixed and competition is lacking.  The free movement of capital will lead to much more competition which I believe will be good for Ireland.  Monopoly leads to inefficiency and also to political patronage. Competition will do away with that to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>We have much to improve on in the matter of industrial relations in Ireland. The rate of industrial disputes here is the highest in Europe.  Last week I asked the Minister for Labour to introduce a 60 day cooling off period but this was rejected.  This is a mistake. We must have better industrial relations. If this is to come about it depends largely on the Government's policy in the matter of controlling prices.  Little headway has been made in relation to a prices and incomes policy.  Year after year, for the past ten years, we have seen major industrial disputes disrupt the economy. That is wrong.  It is something which is avoidable if the Government act sensibly in relation to price increases, budgetary policy and taxation policy in general.  Increased taxation and increased prices have led to wage claims. It is hard to know who is to blame or which comes first&mdash;the chicken or the egg.  We will have to cry &ldquo;stop&rdquo; at some point because Europe is a very competitive community.  If we stick our heads in the sand and if industrial dispute follows industrial dispute we will not succeed in Europe.</P>
    <P>We must have a more realistic prices and incomes policy and a more realistic approach to strikes, especially unofficial strikes.  We must have a realistic approach to demarcation, to the question of who does what.  Trade unions must be flexible in their approach to industrial problems and employers must also be flexible.  Many employers are out of date in their approach to industrial relations and in relation to the improvement and the development of industry.  This is holding industry back. Something will have to be done.  Nothing has been done in the last ten years to rectify the position.  This is most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The social policies of the EEC are <Col N="835" /> quite specific.  Every effort will be made to eliminate poverty.  Poverty will never be eliminated.  Here in Ireland, despite what the Government say, there are many people, in receipt of incomes below the breadline level, living in deplorable hovels.  This problem has not been successfully tackled.  There will have to be a crash programme to do away with slums, provide better housing and have a more human social security policy.  Social policy must be geared to providing a minimum income. That is being attempted in Europe.  We will welcome this, but we have not come to grips with the problem at all. It has been left to voluntary bodies, who are doing a very good job, but they have not really got the goodwill of the Government.  They are left to work on a voluntary basis.  We have not come to grips with the social problem here.  Perhaps we will be forced to do so upon our accession to the Community.</P>
    <P>The position of sterling will have to be reviewed because we will have to re-align our monetary policy towards Europe.  We should have greater control over the inflow and outflow of capital.  All foreign moneys moving into and out of the country should go to the Central Bank rather than the commercial banks.  We should have an exchange control policy, not necessarily designed to restrain the movement of capital but to keep capital under control so that we will know exactly what is happening from the point of view of the balance of payments and the use to which the capital is being put.</P>
    <P>In the EEC we will be subject to the policies and rules of the Community. There is a short-term economic policy committee and a committee of governors of central banks.  There are medium term economic policy programmes. There is a memorandum on plans for short-term monetary support to member states.  We will have to seek permission to devalue and to take steps to rectify balance of payments deficits. We will have to discipline ourselves in matters of monetary and economic policy to a greater extent than heretofore. Perhaps this will be a good thing.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments deficit last <Col N="836" /> years was of major proportions and there is every likelihood that there will be a similar deficit in the current year. Fears in the tourist industry have been confirmed.  This is very serious.  We cannot continue in this way.  The Government have done nothing to control prices.  This is serious.  This is the real crisis in our community, not the political crisis.  The political crisis is important only to the Fianna Fáil Party.  The real crisis facing the country is the crisis on the economic front, a crisis of rising prices, a crisis which affects the lives of all our people. There has been an unprecedented rise in prices in the past year and all the indications are that prices will go on rising.  The Government do not seem to care a damn about increased prices. They have played politics with the economy for far too long.  The balance of payments deficit is of serious proportions. The Government appear to be turning a blind eye to it.  In my opinion, because the Government have neglected economic policy, they have thrown away an advantage in foreign markets.  Five years ago we had a tremendous labour cost advantage.  I would have been very enthusiastic five years ago about industry and its future in the Common Market.  Now, because of Fianna Fáil economic policies&mdash;or the lack of them&mdash;I cannot so hope. This Fianna Fáil Government have thrown away our advantage and I must condemn them in this respect perhaps more so than in any other respect. They have completely and utterly lost control of the economy.  In the last Budget, £10 million had to be set aside for wage increases alone.  This indicates the magnitude of our inflation problem. Furthermore, this Government are discredited by the events of the past few months.  I may not expand on this.</P>
    <P>Our approach to education will have to be re-examined.  Greater emphasis must be placed on the teaching of foreign languages.  We must adopt the most modern techniques for this purpose. Perhaps we shall be forced to modernise our approach to examinations. I feel myself that the leaving certificate, as it at present exists, is outmoded.  I consider that the intermediate certificate should be designed <Col N="837" /> for the 17-year-old age level and that this would be the examination necessary for people leaving school.  It would also be the examination which would qualify adolescents to enter trades and professions.  For those who want to go on to higher education, the matriculation could be taken a year after.  Our approach to the whole problem of education in this country needs to be re-examined in the light of modern developments and modern requirements.</P>
    <P>All in all, there will be many developments if we ever enter the EEC. The negotiations have just commenced. They may not even conclude successfully, in which events I hope the Government will take steps to form an association with the EEC.  If Britain does not succeed in getting a strong and successful agreement she will not go in and therefore, I take it, from remarks passed here and there, we shall not go in either.  In that event we should certainly look for association.  If we do go in I think we can still be a sovereign independent State.  A red herring has been dragged into the discussion by some members of the Labour Party: we can still be a sovereign independent State just as much as England will remain sovereign and independent.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of our national life will be affected.  We can remain insular, possibly, and be successful in so far as we might survive at a relatively prosperous level but, in remaining insular, our population will continue to decline.  By accepting the challenge of Europe I think we could have an increasing population and a repopulation of the western areas.  Therein lie my hopes.  I cannot say for certain, any more than the Cabinet, Fianna Fáil or anyone else in this House can say for certain, that we shall enter a utopian state: we shall not.  There will be challenges.  There will be failures. There will be disappointments in some fields and successes in others.  It is a great challenge to the Irish nation which, on balance, I agree to accept on the assumption that our negotiating team will successfully conclude a very hard economic bargain for the Irish nation.  It will be a long, hard <Col N="838" /> road, if we do go in.  I feel that, if we get a proper agreement with the EEC, the Irish nation will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy E. Collins that this is a challenge.  This should be the thinking behind the matter.  This is the challenge of the 1970s.  We have been speaking about it for nine years and talking about our possible entry into the EEC.  It looks now as if we are close to the moment of truth when we shall know our fate about admittance to the Community. To me, it will be a great disaster if we are not to join in this Community.  We are Irish but we are also Europeans.  It may be a <i>cliché</i> to say that, centuries ago, our missionaries helped to spread the light throughout Europe: they saw and accepted the challenge of their time.  I do not think we should prove less worthy than those men and women of other times in accepting the challenge put before us this year or next year.</P>
      <P>It has been said that we will sacrifice some of our freedom and sovereignty if we go in.  This I doubt very much indeed.  At the same time, I want to be quite realistic and to state that we are not going on any joy-ride into Europe.  It will be tough going from the word &ldquo;Go&rdquo;.  Our negotiators will have to drive the hardest possible bargain.  I have the utmost confidence in our negotiating team to do just that. It will be hard going indeed for our industrialists and for our farmers but this will show the stuff we are made of.  As Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, we cannot, all the time, be tied to Britain's apron strings.  We shall enter as equal members in a noble concept of a new Europe.</P>
      <P>A Labour Party Deputy said the dream of the late Herr Hitler was to have a united Europe and feared, therefore, that this is a kind of Nazi plot.  One might as well say that because Hitler liked Wagner's music the many millions of people who like Wagner's music are Nazis.  I mention that merely to demonstrate that there has been some unsound argument in this debate.  We have the opportunity now to assume full nationhood as an equal member of the EEC</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> Let us be quite frank about it.  Were we to stay out voluntarily and go into a period of isolation we would become as irrelevant to Europe as the American isolationists were after the first world war.  There were many people in the United States in 1939 who preached this policy of keeping away from Europe.  We saw the tragedy which befell Europe in the second world war. Had the Americans not been so shortsighted and had they been there, their voices could have been heard in the Council of Europe and the League of Nations to prevent the holocaust which was the second world war.</P>
    <P>Our voice will not be as strong as that of the United States but, at the same time, we will have a voice in Europe.  I believe the greatest catastrophe which could befall Europe or the world would be a third European war which, no doubt, would spread into another world conflagration. Robert Schumann, one of the authors of the EEC said Europe was divided and we had war.  We should bend our whole energies into going into Europe. If by doing so we could prevent another war, our decision to go in would be justified.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the European Economic Community would be one power bloc, Eastern Europe would be another, China another and America another.  Deputy Keating reminded me of the Book of the Apocalypse when he painted a frightful picture of the four horsemen riding forth bent on the destruction of mankind.  The fact is that, unless we go into Europe with Britain and the other countries and play our part, not in propagating a new power bloc, but in showing that we believe in the brotherhood of man and federation, surely we must face the possibility of another world war with the terrible destruction the world suffered from 1939 to 1945.</P>
    <P>That is only one aspect.  We will play a noble part in Europe as we did in the League of Nations and as we are doing in the United Nations.  The EEC gives us a greater opportunity of playing a real nation's part in the new Europe which is about to be created.  It has been said that we are not ready for Europe.  That is like saying that one is <Col N="840" /> never ready to get married.  We cannot dictate the time of entry.  We can only hope that, by showing our willingness to be a partner in a new Community, we will be accepted.</P>
    <P>This will create many great problems for us but to stay out would create much greater problems.  If we stayed out we could not strive so nobly in Europe to play our part in a better world to come.  I know that our industrialists will face this great challenge. Since the industrial revolution other countries have had more than a head start on us in the industrial sphere.  I am convinced that Irish workers and Irish management are just as competent as the Belgians or the Dutch or the German.  If we really accept this challenge and realise the problems, with a good lead from the Government and with the co-operation of the people, we will not fail in this great undertaking.</P>
    <P>As I said, it has been suggested that we are not ready to go into Europe and that we should seek some form of association with the EEC.  Five years ago, or less, I thought there might be something in this thinking and that, perhaps, we should seek association. Deputy FitzGerald made a very fine contribution in which he pointed out the fallacy of seeking an easy way out and having a foot half in the camp and half out.  That just is not &ldquo;on&rdquo; at this time.  We must go in there as full members having striven for, and I hope achieved, the best possible conditions. We will not be cut-price members.  We will be in there playing our part with the Germans, the Belgians and other people.  We will not be regarded as the sick man of Europe.</P>
    <P>We will be welcome there.  We will be appraised because of our past.  We have a great sense of freedom.  We will go in there and I hope we will contribute something to the new Europe, because Europe wants freedom not colonialism.  The nations will be all working together to create a better way of life for the people of Europe.  I hope the European example will be followed by other communities seeking, not imperial domination and not economic domination, but a better world which most men dream about and most men <Col N="841" /> believe in even if they differ about the way to achieve it.</P>
    <P>Never before in history have we been given this opportunity.  We may think ourselves fortunate that, after 50 years of self-government, the opportunity has arisen now.  In the past decade we made tremendous strides in building up our economy, so we stand a very good chance of playing a full part as a member of the EEC.  Despite the disadvantages or the temporary handicaps we will face, we would not be worthy of this nation if we were to say we are not going in because this is just a plot by the European economists or, because, as it is said, we will shed some part of our sovereignty should we go in.</P>
    <P>The Community offers a new concept of nationalism.  Sovereign nations will be giving up something for the common good.  Surely it is the highest ideal of man that we should do this.  In the new concept of nationalism we will be in the EEC, not as a partner lagging behind Britain, but on equal footing, for the first time in modern history, with Britain, Germany and Belgium. This is the great prospect before us. We will go into the EEC as a nation.</P>
    <P>The Community will recognise existing political boundaries but, if we stayed out because we do not recognise the unnatural division of our country, that would not bring about unity any quicker.  In fact, the opposite would be the case.  When we are in Europe that will make the Border between the 26 Countries and the Six Counties even more silly than it is at the moment. The physical border will have disappeared and many people will wonder why Partition should be continued when it is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>If we can remove the physical division between us, we can concentrate on removing from the hearts of our people in the north any doubts they have as to what would happen to them in a united Ireland.  We would show them our sacrifices in going into Europe in the cause of European unity and therefore we could say to them that when we are prepared to make these sacrifices in order to create a better Europe, surely they, who differ from us in regard to the concept of one <Col N="842" /> Ireland, will make some sacrifice so that their children will have a better future and a better life than our generation had.</P>
    <P>The name &ldquo;unionist&rdquo; would suggest union.  Up to this to be a unionist in the Six Counties meant that he wanted to be in union with Britain, but the time has now come when we should suggest a wider concept of Unionism, unity in Europe, where they can play their part as part of our ancient nation.  The people of the north with their skills in shipbuilding and other industrial undertakings could come in and play their part as free men in this great new Community.  Even if they approach this from the point of view of self interest they must realise that in this new Community there is a great future for the industrial undertakings in which they have become so expert.  This may dawn on many people who are at present opposed to Irish unity.  They may well see that there is an opening for them in the new Community and at the same time they can play their part as Irishmen.  They will not be one bit less Irishmen and neither will we by accepting the new Europe. We should prove ourselves cowardly if we tried to become an insular group on the edge of Europe.  Civilisation would pass us by and the great developments would take place without us.</P>
    <P>People have said that by entering Europe we would lose our identity and our language.  I do not accept this.  I have always noticed that if one goes to Europe on holidays or business how often the people with one refuse to speak English and even those who are not fluent will speak Irish abroad. They then feel the challenge of Europe. They do not become any less European by speaking their own language.  They have shown willingness to speak English, French or German, but they also want to impress on the Europeans around them when abroad that they have a language and culture of their own.  This is what we want to bring to Europe, the culture of a small nation, a new State perhaps but a very old nation.  That is what Irish freedom is all about.  Men of past generations did not strive to create an entity here that would refuse to co-operate with <Col N="843" /> Europe.  Our whole history has shown how willing we have been at all times to join the Europeans in building a better world.  The opportunity is now here and I feel we shall make good use of it.</P>
    <P>Again, I emphasise that wishful thinking will not achieve anything and that great effort is required on the part of everybody in Ireland to improve the economy, safeguard our language and cultural inheritance.  When the enlarged Community is set up and operating we shall get to know the European mind better than we do now. We shall see that far from being a Nazi plot, as suggested by members of the Labour Party, this is a noble concept of a new unity in Europe.  It has also been said by members of the Labour Party that it is just the tycoon idea of a cheque book conquest, but if we think of men like Haferkamp of Germany and Mansholt of Holland we cannot call them capitalists in the sense that the Labour Party speakers mentioned capitalism.  As far as I know, Haferkamp is a socialist in the European sense and has no outdated Victorian concept of socialism, but his is a socialism that I think every Member of the House shares in that we want to create a better life for our people.</P>
    <P>We want life in Europe not to be interrupted every 20 years by war.  We do not want to see again millions of refugees on the roads of Europe and we want to play a part in preventing this.  We have kindred souls in the associated countries striving to create the EEC.  They suffered more than we did in the last war and the lesson of that war will not be forgotten in Europe for many generations.  By then we hope mankind will have learned that peace and sanity are necessary even for self preservation.  This is the whole basis of this great ideal, to unite Europe into one Community not with one Government but with a delegate of each Government a member of the central body so that each nation will retain its identity.</P>
    <P>This is no dream of a Hitler or a Caesar; it is a dream of the European people like Robert Schumann and others.  It is a noble concept and I dislike <Col N="844" /> hearing it derided by speakers as a capitalist or Nazi plot.  It is no such thing.  Like the fat boy in Dickens, it is easy to make the flesh creep with talk of atomic holocausts, massive unemployment and emigration and so on, but let us raise our eyes and see what is in this for us, if we want to be materialistic.  Let us examine what is in it for us.  On the industrial side I believe our industrialists have made tremendous strides, especially in the past ten years, and that the time is coming&mdash;indeed it has already arrived &mdash;when the home market is far too small to be a challenge to the industrialists and workers, those who create wealth.  Therefore, we are going into a market of 250 million people who will need clothes, footwear, food, housing and so on.  If we can play a part in this for the betterment of Europe I believe we shall see our unemployment problems solved, not by having surplus workers emigrate but by the fact that in our own country we can maintain our quota of supplies to the new Europe thereby giving employment at home.</P>
    <P>At the same time we must face the fact that from now on there will be emigration of a different type.  Whether we go into Europe or not, there will always be some emigration.  In the emigration of the future I hope it will be our technicians, so well trained in industry and agriculture, who will go to Europe to help in this great undertaking and that they will be able to show that our products can face competition with the products of any other country.</P>
    <P>We must not neglect the ambitions and achievements of the EEC in the help they are giving at the moment to 16 African states.  This is not neo-colonialism, as has been stated by my friend on the left.  It is a generous attitude to the developing African nations. Here are the advanced countries of Europe who are not just satisfied to create an affluent and well-fed society but who are willing and, indeed, eager to show that Europe, after 2,000 years of history, can come up with something better for the developing African states than mere exploitation.</P>
    <P>The African states are not equal <Col N="845" /> partners yet but since the war they have been emerging towards the ideal of playing their full part in a better world.  It is to the credit of the European people that so early in the formation of this new community they can take time off to think of how they can help these developing countries.  It is very hopeful for the future that Europe, which is so advanced in technology and such a rich continent, is eager to share the products of the area and give financial aid towards the development of those African states.</P>
    <P>It is said that if we go into Europe we shall be sacrificed to the vested interests in the Community.  There is a colossal fund available in order to help a partner or a member who is having trade balance difficulties.  This may be done from motives of self preservation, although I do not accept this, but the Community cannot operate with one weak member who would retard the general progress.  Therefore, if a member state meets a balance of payments problem which it cannot overcome immediately, it can receive help from this fund.  It is not just a subsidy because people are lazy or indolent but because, in spite of trying hard to meet their difficulties they are unable to do so without aid from this central fund.</P>
    <P>It would be much easier at the moment to minimise the advantages of joining the EEC and to say we must go into our shell and keep away from Europe.  I do not think the vast majority of the Irish people would accept this passive role in European politics.  We would be unworthy of past generations were we to hide ourselves out on the edge of Europe and refuse to take part in the great evolution which is going on there.  We would become something like the people of Tibet who for their own reasons became very insular.  They had the right to do that and would have continued to do so were it not for the fact that imperialist China could not leave them alone.  However, this will not happen with the European Community, because it is not a power drive backed up by guns nor the cheque book conquest of the tycoon.  It is a <Col N="846" /> very noble concept and I believe we shall play our part in it.</P>
    <P>People have said we would lose our sovereignty and that the men of 1916 would abhor the very thought that after all they and successive generations fought for we shall sacrifice something. I cannot see that.  In fact, I believe the men of 1916 like Pearse and Connolly would have been in favour of going into Europe in this great movement to create a community of people not always at war with one another, not always having the clouds of war hanging over them.</P>
    <P>Speaking to people in the street or at meetings I hear them say: &ldquo;Yes, we want to go into Europe.  Our place is there, but we are worried about what will happen to our sovereignty.  Will we just become a very small member of a great community having no voice there?  Will our industries suffer and will our workers be forced to emigrate? Will we not be a nation any more? Will we be breaking faith with the Proclamation of 1916 in which we claimed the unfettered right of the Irish people to the whole of Ireland?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a new concept of nationalism, and nobody wants to perpetuate the Europe where a powerful country like West Germany or France would dominate the affairs of Europe.  If we have to make sacrifices, I do not think they will be any greater than the German people or the French people had to make.  Three times in the past 100 years the French and German peoples have gone to war against one another.  This brought great suffering to both those countries and to other countries in Europe and, indeed, to the whole world eventually.  Neither the French nor the Germans would sacrifice one inch of their territory but they are now prepared to come together for the greater good of Europe.  They are prepared to sink the old animosities which existed for so long and which broke out in such bitterness in 1939.  They see, as most of us here see, that were Europe to continue on the old pattern, another war would be due in 1975.  Things are very different now and by 1975 I trust the Community will be well on its way to full operation, and we will not be fearing the effects of another world <Col N="847" /> war but we will be working for peace in Europe.</P>
    <P>This lesson will not be lost on the rest of the world.  Those who say that we will lose some of our sovereignty should realise that the proof of our sovereignty lies in the fact that we are electing to go in.  We are not being dragged in or forced in.  At the same time, it will be the people who will decide whether we go into Europe or not.  Some 90 per cent or more of the people say that this is the path we must follow.  People are realistic and they do not think that if we go into Europe everything will be wonderful.  We are not asking for that; we are merely asking that we be given the terms which we think are necessary if we are not just to help ourselves but to become a loyal and full member of the Community.</P>
    <P>Over the last decade when the EEC was first mooted the Government took steps to try to bring industry and agriculture up to a standard which would allow us to compete in Europe.  We have made some progress in that regard but I am not satisfied that we have made all the progress we could have made.  In a very short time we will have to be dedicated to the cause of modernisation in industry and agriculture. There is still time to do this and in the industrial sector, between management and labour, we can do this.  The fact, of course, is that we have got to do it; there is no way out.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the only table which we topped in Europe was the OECD table dealing with the number of days lost through industrial strife. This is a great problem because we cannot afford the luxury of the industrial strife which has been so rampant in our community for some years past. However, I see a ray of hope in the fact that changes are taking place and while capital and labour have fought many battles recently we see that in Cork today the Trade Union Congress are discussing this very matter.  They are suggesting means and methods by which industrial strife will be greatly reduced.  We cannot afford industrial strife in the European concept.  Other countries in Europe also have their troubles and, indeed, there is one <Col N="848" /> country, which I shall not name, which did not have a government for six months.  They just could not agree on a government.  At least we can say here that while we may have our disagreements in the industrial sphere we can form a government.  I am sure that with a realisation of the problem that faces us we will get down to finding out just what is wrong in our system of industrial, or I should say human relations, why we have so many strikes, why both sides, labour and management, as well as the community generally, suffer because of these strikes.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am being unduly optimistic when I say that now when we are about to go into Europe we will show a greater realism in facing up to all the challenges which we must face up to if we are to play any part in Europe.  Indeed, if we are going to survive as a nation we must do these things.  I know it is easy to get up here and speak about what should be done but I have had experience on the factory floor and in later years on the other side and that is what gives me confidence in regard to what we will do in this sphere before we enter Europe.  We have much time to make up but the dawn is coming and we can show Europe that we are coming in not just for what is in it for us&mdash;although frankly that is our concern&mdash;but also for the part we can play in Europe.</P>
    <P>Members of the Labour Party have stressed the frightful things that will happen if we go into Europe.  I took the trouble to read some speeches of Labour Party Deputies and while two of them did make good speeches and put up good arguments they both asked: &ldquo;What happens if we do not go in?&rdquo;  This is the kernel of the matter. If we do not go in what will happen? It will be said that we can find markets elsewhere outside Europe but the British market would be gone and what would we do while we sought new markets?  It has been said by critics of our application that the future of industry here, that is for both employers and employees, is very depressing indeed.  Recently, I read a statement by the Confederation of Irish Industries which stated that if we went into Europe Irish industrialists <Col N="849" /> would have a better time because English industrialists who at present are making terrific efforts to sell their goods on the Irish market would then switch to Europe with its 250 million people because our market then would be very small compared with the European market.</P>
    <P>That statement cannot be taken lightly.  I merely mention it to show that the prognostications of disaster in the industrial sphere must be challenged. The Europeans do not want us just because of our blue eyes.  Things will be very tough for us but not any tougher than we are in being able to face up to this challenge.  We have faced challenges in the past and, indeed, our whole effort since the foundation of the State to build up an industrial arm has taken a high degree of thinking and hard work.  We have done reasonably well although not as well as I would have liked, which would have meant that we would have nobody unemployed, but then I do not know of any country that has achieved that position yet.  By going into Europe we will be given an opportunity of creating an economy and society that will offer our people a good standard of living in their own country.  If they wish to emigrate to Europe they will not go as they formerly did to Britain as &ldquo;hewers of wood and drawers of water&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we perfect our educational system so that it can compare favourably with that of European countries.  In the last three or four years we have made progress in giving greater opportunities for post-primary and university education, but we have still much more to do in this regard.  I should like to see the new university at Dublin operate like the Free University of Berlin or some of the other great universities of Europe.  Any improvements will cost money and entail much hard work, but I am convinced that the Irish people are capable of overcoming any obstacles, whether in the educational, industrial or agricultural spheres.</P>
    <P>Although we have been in existence as a State for only 50 years, we are an old nation; and our application to enter <Col N="850" /> the EEC means that we are going back once again into Europe&mdash;admittedly a different Europe from that of 500 years ago.  We should have a full realisation of what the new Community holds for us, the benefits we can get from association with it and what we can give in return.  We should not go along with the view of those who can only see in the Community a plot by financiers and tycoons in Europe.  I am not suggesting that everybody in Europe is a true-blue European patriot but I consider that the European people have recognised that it is a choice between confederation or a continuation of the old pattern of war in the Continent&mdash;and a trade war very soon develops into a nuclear war.  The people of Europe have learned a lesson from the past and have realised how essential it is to build this great new world.  This is a noble dream but it cannot be achieved without effort.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned in the White Paper that we must accept the fact that not all Irish industries will survive the challenge.  We must see to it that industries worth safeguarding, those which ensure a decent standard of living for their employees, are preserved.  It will be a matter for our negotiators to obtain the best possible conditions of entry for us.  We realise that the negotiations will be tough and difficult but our negotiating team know our weaknesses and will do their utmost to protect our interests.</P>
    <P>We are not being forced into Europe. However, after nine years of discussion in this House and outside, we cannot be accused of rushing blindly into the Common Market.  There is, of course, the possibility that we may not be admitted, which would indeed be a tragedy.  In common with most people I realise that it is not a matter of a soft place being found for us in Europe; the rewards are there but hard work will be essential if we wish to attain those rewards.</P>
    <P>I am not an economist and I would not dare to speak on the agricultural aspects of the EEC.  However, having read the White Paper and some of the speeches of Dr. Mansholt and others, I am convinced that our agriculture has a place in Europe.  However, our agricultural <Col N="851" /> industry must gear itself to meet the challenge, which I think it will do in an effective way.  It would be wrong for me to suggest to any farmer that Ireland will be a land of milk and honey once we enter the Common Market.  Let me repeat Deputy FitzGerald's phrase that &ldquo;it will be a land of milk and money&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They already have the milk there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they have too much milk there at the moment.  However, I would not dare to explain the agricultural aspects&mdash;that matter I shall leave to the experts on agriculture. There are many places in the world where milk products would be of great value to the people and perhaps some day the Community may do something about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They have one million tons and they do not know what to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC have shown concern for the less well-off people of Africa and the developing countries and they may find some way of using the surplus milk to convert it into other products that would be of value to the underdeveloped countries.</P>
      <P>The question has been posed that perhaps we might become engulfed in the European Continent and thereby lose our identity.  It is wrong to assume that this is true.  In the past Ireland survived many attempts to smother her identity and had we acquiesed perhaps our country would have had much more prosperous times.  It is not in our character to accept this kind of thing. We shall go into Europe as a nation willing to play its part but we shall not lose our national identity in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months, as people have begun to talk about our joining the EEC, they have become very conscious of their nationhood.  I addressed a boys' club last year and following my address the boys were allowed to ask questions for half an hour.  A young boy questioned me on certain aspects of the EEC.  I am not an expert on this subject but the very fact that a boy of 12 <Col N="852" /> or 14 years of age had read something about the EEC and wanted to know more about it is a very healthy sign.</P>
    <P>The present generation will ensure that we will not lose our national identity.  Neither the Treaty of Rome nor the Treaty of Paris asks any nation to give up its identity and say, &ldquo;We are not Germans, we are not French, we are not Belgian, but we are Europeans&rdquo;. The attitude of members of the Community is that we are German, we are Dutch, but we are also Europeans. Members of the community seek to create a new Europe better than any Europe we have ever known.</P>
    <P>Robert Schumann was the first person I ever read on the EEC.  He set out to create a new community and his words about Europe not being united and therefore at war shows that the French abhor war the same as the rest of us.  It is not enough merely to abhor war; steps must be taken to remove the causes of war.  A trade war is generally followed by a physical war.  By setting up a Community such as the EEC steps have been taken to ensure not that we do not have competition but that we have civilised competition. This may be the answer to the international cartels who exploit peoples in the name of trade, even if it means causing war.  I am idealistic enough to believe that the founders of this Community had a noble ideal not just for self-advancement but a noble ideal for a Europe, a Europe like that of the Golden Ages, where we shall have real civilisation.  We shall not have a Europe where the stronger nations tread on the weaker ones, first, in a trade war, and then in a physical war. This new Europe will not only be better for the people of Europe but for the rest of the world as well.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the Community will constitute a new power bloc which will be in competition with the power blocs of eastern Europe, China and the United States of America.  The EEC is a new concept of a community which may well spread, not as a power bloc but as an example of man having rejected the futility of war and the senselessness of war and uniting instead to work in harmony in a community spirit.  This nation can play its part in such a Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies undoubtedly realise that the motion before this House states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann takes note of the White Paper entitled <i>Membership of the European Communities: Implications for Ireland.</i>&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and that the leader of the Opposition has proposed an amendment which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and urges the Government to ensure that the terms of membership to be negotiated adequately safeguard the interests of the people of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Not only in this Parliament but in every European Parliament millions of words have been spoken on the subject and economists have written tens of thousands of lines about it.  No doubt they have spent many hours studying the position.  Most Members of this House, and probably most members of other Parliaments, will have read all the material and the statistics compiled by the economists, the advice of statesmen and the various editorial comments in daily and weekly journals.  It is quite right that we should consider the economists' reports and the speeches of politicians throughout Europe but we should also ask ourselves what the opinion of the man in the street is and what the opinion of the politician is in relation to this movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things which I do not like in public life&mdash;&mdash;and I am sure Mr. Harold Wilson will subscribe to my feelings on them&mdash;and they are economists' reports and public opinion polls.  If politicians would pay less attention to economists' reports and take little notice of public opinion polls, and listen more to the opinions of farmers, workers, business people and those engaged in industry and trade unions they would get informed opinions.  If our future is to be based on the reports of economists we are in a bad way.  We must not accept the results of opinion polls.  There is a duty on all of us to give of our best in Parliament and to contribute as wisely as we can to the debate on this vitally important issue.  This is the most <Col N="854" /> important debate we have had concerning the future of this country since the establishment of the State.  Deputy Cosgrave has clearly indicated the views of this party in so far as our entry into Europe is concerned.  This party were not influenced by the fact that Fianna Fáil are endeavouring to get into the European Community, nor by the fact that the Labour Party take another view.  The Fine Gael Party felt it was right to try to get into the European Community.  The leader of the party has stated on many occasions that we feel Ireland should seek membership of the EEC.  This line of action has been supported by everybody in this House associated with Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Why are Fine Gael taking this line? They are doing so because they realise that the world is becoming a small place but, at the same time, it is becoming a very selfish place, where the big and powerful may prosper at the expense of the small and the weak. Fine Gael realise that we have a part to play as a nation and that we can undoubtedly contribute by word and by deed&mdash;and I would like to say by example also.  Perhaps the future may hold better things in store for us.  There is much we can contribute to Europe. It would be disastrous if we could not take our place as a nation and have our voice heard at conferences and be a member of this Community.</P>
    <P>The men who founded this State were men of foresight and ambition. Their ambition was that we, as a nation, might play our part in the moulding of public opinion abroad. They felt we should have a voice abroad and should endeavour to bring about harmony and statesmanship. They felt we could help to contribute so that people of different countries to be associated with us would enjoy high living standards.  It has been customary for powerful nations to ignore the voice of smaller nations.  We have seen in the past that powerful nations endeavour to squeeze small countries out of existence.  We are one of the smallest countries in Europe, and maybe one of the weakest, but we must have the greatest traditions in Europe.  Denmark may be a more powerful country although it is only the size of Munster. <Col N="855" /> It can maintain a large population. Many thousands of people in Europe, in Africa and in the southern states of America really thought that Ireland was a part of Britain until it was clearly indicated to them that there were separate applications for membership of the EEC from Britain and from Ireland.  Many people found out recently that we are an independent, sovereign State.  Why was that?  It was because of our geographical situation and our proximity to Britain.  Britain, as a bigger country, was able to overshadow us in Europe.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with what Deputy Cosgrave said in regard to this matter. I agree that we have a duty to stand on our own feet.  If we have been dominated by Britain economically it is time that we examined the situation and shook off that domination.  We have now a wonderful opportunity of venturing into Europe as a sovereign and independent State.  We can go in, if admitted, like Denmark or Britain. It would be interesting to hear from those who think that we should not apply for membership of the EEC what they would say if we did not apply for membership and if Britain applied to be admitted.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information requested by the Deputy.  National average retail prices are given for mid-May, 1970, for the principal food items included in the consumer price index.  In introducing the new consumer price index in November, 1968, certain revisions were made to the list of items priced.  As a consequence, in compiling the percentage change in prices between mid-May, 1965, and mid-May, 1970, it was <Col N="856" /> necessary to group some of the individual items.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte administer a scheme of grants to An Óige for the improvement and extension of youth hostel accommodation. The levels of grants are 80 per cent in the western areas of the country and 50 per cent elsewhere.  The 50 per cent level applies to Limerick City.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that An Óige have been in communication with them about a grant for a hostel in Limerick but that the site proposed would not qualify for an 80 per cent grant as it is not in the western area. Bord Fáilte believe that it should be possible to find a location for a hostel within reasonable walking distance of the city which would qualify for the higher rate of grant.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister received a deputation some months ago from An Óige, which was accompanied by Deputies from the constituency, and that he was then in full agreement with the submissions made by the deputation. Further, is it not a fact that the Minister agreed to take the matter up with the Minister for Finance with a view to securing an 80 per cent grant?  Can the Minister say why he wrote to the Minister for Justice a few weeks ago saying <Col N="859" /> he could not see his way to requesting the Minister for Finance to give this grant?</P>

    <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that, while at the present time the overall picture for the year shows a situation in which there is a decline in some of <Col N="860" /> our main markets for the months of June, the picture for the first six months of the year shows a nett increase of 4.8 per cent in tourist numbers from all markets except Northern Ireland, for which it is not possible to make an estimate at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of detailed surveys of the pupil potential in the Clonmore and Ballyconnell districts carried out.  These surveys were undertaken in the context of the introduction of the new primary school curriculum and the necessity in relation to its implementation to ensure that wherever possible pupils will at all times have the benefit of a school with at least three teachers.  This necessity arises from the fact that the curriculum is child centred.  The results of the surveys and the compelling educational considerations involved have convinced me that all the pupils concerned would best be catered for by closing Clonmore school and amalgamating it with Ballyconnell school.  The latter school was built in 1966 and lends itself to enlargement so that a five teacher school can be provided there.  The Clonmore school is in a very unsatisfactory condition.</P>

It is four months now since the Minister received a deputation of the people concerned about the closing of this school and this is the first indication we have got from the Minister that it is quite definite he intends to close the Clonmore school.

As I explained in my reply, I am aware that some of the parents in the Clonmore area are opposed to the closing of this school but my information is that the majority of the families there are in favour of the closing of the school.  I accept that it is some time since I met a deputation of parents led by local Deputies. Of course, the Deputy will recognise that I am particularly careful in relation to the closing of schools and that I examine every possible aspect of the matter before coming to a final decision. When I come to a final decision, I make this decision in the interests of the children.</P>

      <P>The prices charged by Cement Ltd. for cement are governed by a condition in the licence which was issued to the company under the Cement Act, 1933, which permits the company to increase its prices to offset increased costs that are outside its control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I did.  I said the recent increase was necessary to offset, in part, increases in wage costs and in various other costs.  The fact is, if we <Col N="874" /> were to recover all the costs arising from increased wages and other factors, the increase would be substantially higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the question I asked.  What effect does the Minister expect this will have on the Taoiseach's proposed 7 per cent?  Does he not appreciate the fact that this will prove to many other companies that the 7 per cent was all cod at the start and could not be maintained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The point I was making was that it is not correct to assume that the recent increase was due solely to the wage adjustment made as a result of the strike, which is, I think, what is implied in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The company got 15s earlier and is now getting 16s 6d.  Does this not prove, no matter what way the Minister puts it, that the 7 per cent increase suggested by the Taoiseach just could not work in this year 1970?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is concerned about the effect of this increase on the cost of houses.  One of the realities we have to live with&mdash;some people have not yet got round to recognising it&mdash;is that if the cost of one item goes up it almost inevitably leads to an increase in the cost of another item.  Increases of that nature and increases in wages <Col N="876" /> cannot be carried on thin air.  In the situation in which we exist, where there are price and wage increases, there is a spiral.  It keeps affecting the cost of materials.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the firm in question have refused to give similar trading terms to the trader unless he agrees to join a particular ring?  Does the Minister think it requires many months of frustrating correspondence with the Fair Trade Commission to ascertain that such are the facts of the case when the original cause of complaint, on the face of it, requires a trader to be a member of a ring before he will be given the favourable terms of trade?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that that is so or that it is very obviously so.  I cannot deny that it will ultimately turn out to be so.  The original complaint made by this trader to the Fair Trade Commission was investigated. The upshot of that incident was that the trader concerned was sued for defamation by a representative of the company of which he complains and was obliged to pay damages.  He subsequently made complaints to the Fair Trade Commission about the refusal of this firm to supply him on certain terms.  Inquiries revealed that he had not made any inquiries from the firm or sought any orders.  Despite that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the growing concern amongst residents and business people in Crumlin village, Dublin, at the large numbers of incidents of burglary, breaking and entering and other crimes in that area and at the apparent weakness of local Garda strength which is unable to provide adequate protection; if better steps will be taken to strengthen the numbers and effectiveness of the local Garda; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first six months of this year, the number of indictable crimes in Crumlin village, as known to the Garda, was 14 of which <Col N="882" /> 11 were housebreaking and the like. Detections have already been made in ten out of the 14 cases, including seven of the 11 house breakings.</P>
      <P>While these offences are, of course, of serious concern to the people affected and the people of the locality generally, the figures are insufficient to allow a valid statistical comparison to be made with earlier years or to speak with any confidence about the detection rate though, taking the figures at their face value, the detection rate is over 70 per cent which is very high for an urban area like this.  However, it is an unfortunate fact that crime generally is on the increase and I would not wish to gloss over that.</P>
      <P>Crumlin is a Garda district headquarters and its strength was increased by one sergeant and three gardaí on 25th March last.  At present, a general review of the deployment of the available manpower is being pushed forward with all possible speed and every effort is being made to utilise the resources of men and equipment to the best possible advantage.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister agree that the concentration should be on prevention rather than detention?  In the Minister's reply he appeared to be declaring a certain degree of pride at the rate of detection. Does the Minister agree that prevention is more important?  Is he aware that, in this vicinity, apart from the substantial and worrying damage caused to the business people in Crumlin village, a considerable amount of terror and upset is caused to a large number of elderly people who dwell in chalets?  There are some hundreds of chalets on a site at this location. The Garda have indicated that they have their existing resources stretched to the limit in providing the minimum of protection but they are unable to provide the protection required at this chalet site between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. every night because their resources are used fully elsewhere in the area.  Will the Minister have a look at the possibility of increasing the Garda resources particularly during those hours?</P>

      <P>The fixing of dates for trials in both the Central Criminal Court and the Dublin Circuit Court is a matter for the presiding judge.  However, an accused person who has been returned for trial in custody is given priority and usually has his case heard within the term.  Other cases are normally taken in order of return for trial but circumstances such as the non-availability of witnesses or others may result in some cases being put back for later hearing.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Central Criminal Court, the normal waiting period between the return for trial or the transfer of the case from the Circuit Court and the actual trial is about eight weeks during which, of course, the person concerned is on bail.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether in connection with the Orange parade which was proposed to be held in Ros Neamhlach, County Donegal, on July 12th he is aware that threats of incitement to violence were made; and whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to statements reported to have been made at a meeting of Donegal County Council.  I have seen newspaper reports concerning these statements but they do not purport to give more than a very abbreviated account of what was said.  The reports suggest that threats were made&mdash;which, it is scarcely necessary for me to say, I strongly deprecate&mdash;and that they were a factor in the calling off of the parade but I am personally aware that this was not why the parade was called off.  The local officers of the Garda Síochána had already reported to me that it was not the intention to hold the parade.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of public knowledge that the Government have strongly urged, in the interests of peace and community relations, that provocative Orange parades should not be held in the north at the present time.  On the other hand, the Government would wish to distinguish very clearly between on the one hand, those parades which, because of the places and circumstances in which they are held and the manner in which some of their adherents tend to behave, are likely to provoke even moderate and peave-loving people in particular areas and, on the other hand, parades such as the one referred to which are in an entirely different category, being no more than legitimate and reasonable expressions of the traditions of those who take part. That these traditions are not those of the great majority in the locality in no way diminishes the right of those who adhere to them to express themselves. Rather does it place on the majority a special obligation to ensure that their right is respected and upheld and to ensure also that it is seen to be a right and not something that is only tolerated.</P>
      <P>That the people concerned should have decided of their own volition, and before any question of a threat arose, to call off the parade this year in order to avoid any risk of giving offence to their neighbours is a gesture deserving of the highest praise and I am, therefore, glad to have this opportunity to give the facts to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will introduce a scheme to provide cheap interest loans for local authorities to build houses to offset the steep increase in the capital cost of housing and of interest rates in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government pays an annual contribution towards the loan charges on the capital borrowed by local authorities to finance the provision of houses.  This subsidy is equivalent to about £106 a year for most serviced houses and, in effect, <Col N="900" /> reduces the interest rate of 8½ per cent, at which local authorities at present borrow from the Local Loans Fund, to an average of about 5 per cent.  There has been no increase in the Local Loans Fund interest rate in recent months.</P>
      <P>Subsidies for local authority housing from central taxation and rates are estimated at substantially more than £9 million in the current financial year and are expected to grow by about £1 million a year on the basis of the current local authority housing programme. The more these subsidies grow the more they absorb money which could be used to build decent houses for those who have not got them.  The estimated current level of subsidy payments could, in fact, finance the building of a further 3,000 local authority houses annually if it were available for that purpose.</P>
      <P>While the level of subsidies is kept under constant review, I do not propose to increase it at this stage.</P>

      <P>I have also said that I noted the members of the deputation argued that existing schemes are causing hardship. I doubt if any hardship endured by a person with housing of reasonable standard is comparable to that of families without it, who must be the first concern of any acceptable social policy in housing.  However, I am having proposals in a memorandum submitted by the deputation studied in consultation with the local authorities principally concerned and with particular reference to the cost to these authorities of the proposals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state the approximate cost of the damage done annually to public telephone kiosks throughout the country; and if, in view of the vandalism in this particular field, he has any suggestions to deal with the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The average annual cost of malicious damage to public telephone kiosks in the last two years was about £7,800.  Malicious damage to kiosks is a problem in most countries and I know of no country where a satisfactory solution has been found. Certain measures are taken to minimise the extent of such damage.  For instance, sites for kiosks are selected, as far as possible, where they will be least vulnerable to damage &mdash; for example, on main well-lighted thoroughfares, near Garda stations and <Col N="906" /> 24-hours service garages.  Kiosks which are subject to excessive vandalism are removed to alternative sites; and all cases of vandalism are reported to the garda, particular attention being drawn to those kiosks which have suffered a high incidence of malicious damage or theft.  The Department are keeping in touch with any developments of a technical kind which might be helpful. Finally, the inculcation of a greater sense of civic responsibility towards public property generally would contribute towards a solution of the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was saying that there were many thousands of people in Europe who were not aware of the existence of Ireland as a sovereign, independent State until our application to join the EEC was made and made separately from that of Britain. It was then revealed to these people that this country was an independent and sovereign State.  The enlargement of the European Economic Community presents this country with a wonderful opportunity.  I cannot understand the case put forward by those who are opposed to this country joining the EEC.  As I have already pointed out, and as other Deputies have pointed out, Fine Gael believe that it is in the best interests of this country that not <Col N="923" /> alone should we apply for membership of the EEC but that with Britain and Denmark we should endeavour to obtain full membership.  By obtaining full membership we will be immediately securing ourselves against economic dependence on Britain.</P>
      <P>Politicians and economists agree that for trading and business purposes our geographical position and our proximity to Britain makes it easy for us to trade with our nearest neighbour. There have been links in the business sector as well as the important link of sterling between Ireland and Britain.  It is also a fact that there are many thousands of Irish people who could not obtain a decent standard of life in this country and are now employed in Britain, and I would add the fact that with modern means of transport we can go to the cities of London and Manchester in a very short time. Because of those links, and due to other circumstances, for many years we have had to depend too much on Britain as a market for our exports and this total dependence is not desirable.</P>
      <P>What are the alternatives?  As we enter the seventies we should give serious consideration to our position if we embark on a policy of isolation.  We have no wish to repeat the disasters of the economic war but it is worth noting that as a result of that economic war Irish agriculture was in a depressed state.  Despite the fact that Britain was our nearest neighbour and our major export market, in those early days people were advised to burn everything English except their coal and there was much rejoicing in many parts of this country when it was said that the British market was gone forever. The people who engaged in such exercises have since learned of the importance of the British market and of any other market that will ensure profitable prices for our farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that Britain took the major part of our exports, we must not forget that we helped in no small way to provide the British people with cheap subsidised food.  We know that the trade agreements between this country and Britain were not as favourable to <Col N="924" /> us as we would have wished them to be, with the exception of the 1948 trade agreement which I consider the most successful contract negotiated between the two countries.  That agreement was responsible for our farmers receiving many millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>On several occasions since 1948 Irish Ministers have gone to Britain to negotiate markets and to discuss levies and tariffs.  I can clearly recall one such occasion when an Irish delegation went to negotiate better terms for Irish exports but the outcome was that we lost some of the markets we had previously. It is difficult to visualise the situation of a delegation at ministerial level not only failing to secure increased markets but actually having existing markets reduced, but this is what happened.  The Irish agricultural producers had to put up with that situation because there was nothing else they could do.  The fact that the Irish representatives might have blundered or were out-manoeuvred by their British counterparts meant that the producers were the sufferers.  It must be admitted that nine times out of ten the British negotiators were more skilful than the Irish negotiating team.</P>
    <P>In 1948 the position was different and I regard the agreement concluded in that year as the most decisive breakthrough in negotiations between the two countries.  It was probably one of the main reasons for the general improvement in agriculture in the early fifties.</P>
    <P>A situation in which we have to depend to such an extent on Britain necessarily places a restriction on us. I have yet to hear a convincing argument put up by those who cannot see the wisdom of joining the EEC about what we should do if Britain closes her doors to us.  If Britain joins the EEC and we do not, again, what happens to our exports?  Nobody has stated where we could obtain profitable export markets for all our products. This situation convinces me that we must take this step forward.</P>
    <P>In this situation there is a difference in the attitudes of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Fianna Fáil believe in joining the EEC.  Fine Gael believe this is the right step but our party are not satisfied that sufficient safeguards have been <Col N="925" /> provided to protect the interests of the Irish people and Fine Gael have no confidence in those who will negotiate on our behalf.</P>
    <P>When we realise that Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg have come together in this Community and that the applications of Ireland, Britain, Denmark and Norway are under consideration we cannot possibly stay out in isolation. We must take a step forward.  I would much prefer to see us take a courageous step into the future than to stand still.  The only proper step forward for us to take is to go into Europe, along with Britain, Denmark and Norway.</P>
    <P>When we enter the EEC we shall have to take on certain commitments. We shall find a ready market for all the goods we have exported which will mean we will not have to depend on Britain or be subject to frequent meetings between Irish Ministers and British Ministers and the changing whims of both Governments.  When we enter the EEC we shall enter a Community in which we have a say and in which the larger powers cannot crush the weaker ones because machinery is there to ensure that that cannot be done.  Ireland will have a say, perhaps not as loud a say as she would like, but nevertheless she will be heard along with Norway, Denmark, Britain and the Six who are already in the Community.  If my reading of the history of the EEC is correct there is no danger of this country being overshadowed or dominated by any of the other member countries.  For far too long economically we have been dominated entirely by Britain.  It is time we shook off that domination or dependence. If we are the independent sovereign State which we are supposed to be we should not be afraid to stand on our own feet and face the future, not independently of Britain but with Britain and independent of all the other member countries.</P>
    <P>We are a small country, this part of which has its independence, but economically we have always been tied to Britain.  It is time we broke these ties and sought new and more profitable markets, instead of always depending <Col N="926" /> on the British market as we have done in the past.  It has been found that big powers act to suit themselves and smaller countries have no means of defending their economies.  We all know that France, Great Britain and Germany are inclined to throw their weight about, but by being in the Community and not having to depend on Britain for our existence, we shall be able to stand on our own feet and utilise the new markets which will be opened up to us.  I thought it was very sad to read&mdash;and it was written not only in one newspaper but in many&mdash; that, despite all our talk, there were thousands of people in Europe who did not know of our existence as an independent State but merely thought of us as part of Great Britain, Britain's shadow in Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe it is correct to say that Britain controls our markets.  There may have been times, such as in 1948, when we got the better bargain, but more often than not Britain got the better end of the bargain.  More often than not Britain got the real value and the real profit out of the skill, hard work and industry of our farmers.  For the very first time we have an opportunity to take our place in Europe and help to build up a Europe of peace and co-operation; a Europe free from jealousies, bickering and bigotry; a Europe which will contribute towards world peace; a Europe in which our people will have improved and better standards of living.  That should be our aim.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a serious point about the negotiation of the terms on which we should enter or on which we are to enter the EEC.  I hope I shall be forgiven by the Government for saying this, but it is better for one to say what is on one's mind.  I think we have a very dependable and highly efficient Civil Service.  The successful outcome of the EEC negotiations must be based on the activities of our well-trained, efficient Civil Service because the Ministerial group who should be making the case for Ireland in the name of Fianna Fáil do not enjoy the confidence of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>We cannot refer to civil servants by name in this House.  My remarks will be read by some of them.  I hope the civil servants associated with Ireland's entry into the EEC will assist our Ministers. They are the men we must depend on to carry on negotiations when Fine Gael are not there to do so.  If Fine Gael were in office they would carry on more favourable negotiations and would look for much better concessions for Ireland in connection with entry to the EEC than Fianna Fáil can do at the moment.  We have a new, young Government.  All that can be said about them is that they are there. They cannot agree among themselves. They do not trust each other.  They are the men who will sit with Ministers from Norway, Denmark, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Holland.  It is well known in all these countries that this Government stands discredited.  This Government have not the confidence of the Irish people. They are a Government who have not the confidence of the Prime Minister. This Government seems to be completely without leadership.  They are stumbling from one crisis to another. They hope for more favourable situations. They await better days.  It is most tragic that very important decisions, such as this one, must be taken by men who distrust one another.  It is tragic that Ireland should have to depend on such men.  The members of the Government are greedy for power and authority.  They are all seeking to further their own ends.</P>
      <P>This is the time for hard thinking and planning.  If the Fianna Fáil Government were asked to give an account of the manner in which they prepared for entry into the EEC all that would emerge would be plans, commissions, reports, boards of investigation, inquiries and files packed away in Government Buildings but none of the recommendations in them would have been implemented.  I would be interested to hear a Minister clearly and distinctly outline how he has equipped the people under his control for immediate entry to the EEC.  This Government have not shown much action. They all talk loudly but say little of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> I should like to inquire whether those who will be considering Ireland's application in Brussels will ask for what is known as a certificate of solvency of this State before they consider the application.  I remember reading in a British newspaper that on the last occasion on which Britain's application was under consideration an inquiry was made as to Britain's economic and financial standing.  Some of those who were on the Commission in Brussels commented that it would be time enough to consider Britain's application for membership of the EEC when she had put her financial affairs in order.  If that was said about Britain on the last occasion on which the application was under consideration, what can be said about Ireland now?  Can this Government produce a certificate of solvency?  Is it not correct to say that our economy is on the verge of national bankruptcy?  Is it not correct to say that economically and financially we are on the doorstep of national bankruptcy?</P>
    <P>Our agricultural community which should be geared to a high degree for EEC entry is in a state of gloom. None of the important schemes has been carried out to ensure that our livestock for export will be taken if we enter the EEC.  We could not provide the necessary clean bill of health required by the EEC for livestock because we still have warble fly and other infestations.  No effort has been made by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to provide money to equip Irish farmers to have their livestock in such a condition that they could meet the full requirements of entry to the EEC</P>
    <P>We know that agriculture is depressed. It could not be otherwise after the mismanagement of the past four or five years.  The other main industry linked closely with agriculture is the tourist industry.  Whether we like it or not, this Government have destroyed the tourist industry because of activities both north and south.  They have been responsible for bringing about what we can describe as a disaster for all connected with the tourist trade and industry.</P>
    <P>How can we produce a certificate of solvency when there are between 60,000 <Col N="929" /> and 70,000 people unemployed in our country and when we have what is perhaps the world record for strikes? There can be added to the list of achievements under Fianna Fáil in relation to strikes what was perhaps one of the longest strikes in the world, the cement strike which lasted for more than five months.  We complain that the tourist industry has declined but we find that for several weeks past the banks have been closed so that week after week there is a gradual build-up of chaos in business, in commerce and in trade.  This very important economic factor has a bearing on the tourist industry and on the general economic trends in the country.  Our record in relation to strikes is deplorable.  It is not a record that can assist us in any way in entering Europe.  I shall not develop that point.  I shall merely say that all of this has led to a declining economy.  As was indicated clearly in the Ross and Buchanan Reports, we are an underdeveloped country.  We cannot describe ourselves in any way as being a country fit to take our place with Britain, with France, with Italy or even with Denmark if we compare their agricultural progress with the agricultural progress of this country.</P>
    <P>We are entering into the great unknown with confidence but we are going in with the disadvantage of being ill-equipped because of the failure of Fianna Fáil to realise their responsibilities to the people of this country.  The steps necessary for preparation have not been carried out in an effective or efficient manner.  In fact, no steps have been taken.  How often have we read reports in the newspapers of the speeches of Ministers at chambers of commerce, at cumann meetings and even in dance halls, making reference to our preparation for EEC membership? Is it not true that we have only been scratching the surface, and scratching it very lightly, and that the real preparation for entry has not been made by our people either in industry or in agriculture because they were not given the chance to make preparation?</P>
    <P>According to the review of the Department of Finance in 1969, more than 1,400 firms in this country have received adaptation grants but that represents only one-third of the number <Col N="930" /> of industries that require to be geared for entry to the Community. May I ask the Taoiseach or any member of the Government what is to happen to the remaining two-thirds?  Are they to collapse?  Are they to disintegrate or disappear?  Will they be unable to compete and so be priced out of business within the Community?  I want to know what exactly is the position in relation to the two-thirds of our industries for which State grants have not been made available.</P>
    <P>I am a believer in Irish industry.  The techniques and skills of our industrialists and, in particular, of our workers, are as good as any to be found in the world.  If Irish industry were properly prepared for the Common Market, it would give an excellent account of itself.  Suitable grants should be provided in order to increase efficiency. One cannot expect those engaged in and sponsoring Irish industry to increase efficiency without having some measure of Government support and co-operation.  In other words, it is the Government who should gear industrialists towards the Community so that they will be able to compete with France, Germany, Britain and other powerful countries.</P>
    <P>There has been a high degree of failure on the part of Fianna Fáil to prepare our people for Community membership.  As Deputy Cosgrave has indicated clearly, we, on this side of the House, agree that Ireland should seek membership of the Community because of our belief that we can play our part as a nation.  However, our people must be prepared and equipped for membership.  Fine Gael have not been in a position to prepare or equip them. The responsibility lies with Fianna Fáil.  This may be the 11th hour but even at this stage the Government should examine seriously their conscience in relation to the preparation of our people in industry, trade and agriculture for Community membership. Those of us who have been abroad realise the keenness of competition that must be faced in Europe because of the mechanised farming and the marketing systems there.  Our people are so ill-equipped that our entry into Europe could be compared to putting <Col N="931" /> an untrained boxer, without boxing gloves, into the ring with a champion.  We are not trained for the European exercise and the blame must rest with the Government.</P>
    <P>All branches of our economy must compete with Europe's best.  Therefore, we must put our people into the position in which they will at least have a fair opportunity.  The Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Defence and all the other Ministers of the Government have failed miserably to emphasise the importance of the role our people can play in Europe and to help them to meet the drawbacks that the Minister for External Affairs says we might experience.</P>
    <P>Is it not right that on an occasion such as this Deputies should ask if as a result of our entry into Europe there will be redundancy in industrial employment, and if so, what steps are being taken to minimise that redundancy and what steps have been taken to provide alternative employment? When levies and tariffs are removed and when there is more or less free trade between member States, will many of our industries be faced with unfair competition as a result of price cutting or dumping?</P>
    <P>All the cards should be put on the table.  The Minister for External Affairs says when you are playing a good game you do not put all your cards on the table.  This is an occasion when the Irish people expect all the cards to be put on the table, when they do not want to draw blanks, or to toss the two-headed penny.  This is an occasion when they want to be told the facts.  I ask what are the facts in connection with the pricing out of Irish industry as a result of free entry of foreign goods.  What will happen in the event of redundancy?  What will happen in the event of an increase in unemployment?</P>
    <P>Does this mean we will be faced with wholesale emigration or will our negotiators insist, as part of the bargain, that the effect on our industries of free entry of goods must be considered and, when an approximate figure is arrived at, require efforts to be made through the EEC to attract European industrialists, and particularly <Col N="932" /> British industrialists, to establish industries here?  Would it not be far better to have a group of Irish workers working at home for an English concern than to have them working for the same concern in Leeds, Bradford or Halifax?  Would it not be better to have a group of Irish workers working for a French concern in Ireland than to have them employed outside this country?</P>
    <P>Therefore, as part of the bargaining in connection with our entry into the EEC we should say to some of those countries, where industrial expansion has taken place, that this is an undeveloped country and we want industries here.  We can describe ourselves as an undeveloped country and we should not be ashamed of this. We must face facts.  I know it is very hard for a Government, having been 35 years in office, to stand up and say: &ldquo;We admit we are an undeveloped country.  We admit we cannot take our place amongst those great powers which are already in the EEC&rdquo;.  Our negotiators must be prepared to admit that we are not ready to compete with those other countries.  We should endeavour to have a bargain made that where there is to be an expansion of French or German or British industry that expansion will take place in this country in order to provide employment for those who may be displaced or made redundant as a result of free trade.  That is necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach what progress has already been made with regard to expansion of industries in this country.  Have there been discussions with the Germans, the French and the British in relation to the establishment of new industries when we enter the EEC or are we to be the poor relation again?  Should there not be a give and take in this matter?  Why should all the gains be on one side? If there is to be industrial expansion by Germany, France or Italy, if there are to be certain agricultural facilities for the farmers in Denmark, will there not be some governing authority in Brussels to see that all this activity will not take place in those countries while an undeveloped area like Ireland may experience gross unemployment as a result of our entry into the EEC?  We <Col N="933" /> may have living standards falling as prices rise for housewife and consumer. Surely we are entitled to some concession? Surely we are entitled to the best part of the bargain?</P>
    <P>We have not had any word from any Minister which would give us a ray of hope that there will be increased industrial expansion in this country when we enter the EEC.  There is nothing easier for a Minister to do than to talk at a cumann, a comhairle ceanntair, a chamber of commerce or even a dance in rural Ireland but we are entitled to know the facts and to know in the event of our entry into Europe in 1972 or 1973 what industrial expansion we will get.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that we are going into Europe for what we can get out of it, not for the love of it.  We are going in because Fine Gael believe it is the right thing for this country to take her place as a nation in Europe.  We are not going in to become the pauper of Europe or to allow anybody else to make us the pauper of Europe.  We are going in because we feel there is a hope that we will get some good from it.  We are going in because we believe that there is prosperity in Europe which we may share. If there is prosperity in Europe do not let us leave the prosperity in that part which is cut away from us by the Irish sea.  We want to get a share of that prosperity in our own country.</P>
    <P>That is why I want the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, or the Taoiseach to give the details here of what has been done to date.  I say nothing has been done.  I say these men are not competent to do anything in this regard.  I further suggest that they would not have the confidence of the Danish, the French or the German Ministers.  They certainly would not enjoy the confidence of the British Government in any negotiations.  That is the only regret I have in connection with our entry into Europe.  It will be mishandled because those in charge are not really capable.  I am grateful that we have such a high standard in the Civil Service because it is the higher civil servants who will keep the Ministers on the rails.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that our people are <Col N="934" /> properly prepared.  Indeed, I am convinced they are not prepared.  Never in the history of this country have we been presented with such a huge and profitable market for everything we can make or produce.  That is why Fine Gael are solidly behind Deputy Cosgrave in regard to our entry into Europe.  We know it is the right thing to do.  It will give our people an outlet for everything they can make or produce.  The Irish have never been afraid of competition.  I have every confidence in our Irish farmers, if Fianna Fáil gives them the chance.  I have every confidence in our Irish industrialists, if they get a chance.  I have every confidence that the Irish business man can conduct his business as efficiently as his opposite number on the Continent.  Entry to the Common Market will give our country a wonderful opportunity of breaking new ground.  We will be going in with friends.  We are not going in with enemies.  We will be going in with people who will help us.  We are going in to make more friends.  It should be our aim and ambition to reduce the numbers of our enemies and increase the numbers of our friends.  We can make more friends in Europe and we can reduce the number of our enemies. Appreciating the great prosperity that is in Europe we are going in to get a share in that prosperity.</P>
    <P>Critics of the Common Market say that when we go into Europe &ldquo;we have had it&rdquo;.  However irrelevant repetition is, we should repeat over and over again, for the benefit of our EEC critics both inside and outside this House, that the EEC rules and regulations are not fixed for all time.  If there are commitments which might not be in the best interests of this country our representatives in the European Parliament will not be dumb; they will not be tongue-tied.  To use Mr. Paisley's phrase: they will not have cottonwool in their ears.  They will be men, appointed by this House, for the purpose of serving our interests.  If there are certain things that need to be changed or altered to suit prevailing circumstances here, then these things can be changed.  Is there anything fairer than that?  This argument that <Col N="935" /> membership of the EEC commits us to buying a pig in a poke is not correct. It is clearly stated that the laws, rules and regulations can be changed. They are not fixed for all time.</P>
    <P>With regard to economic development, thanks to Fianna Fáil, we will have no difficulty in producing the necessary certificate of qualification to prove that we are an undeveloped country.  That is the result of 35 years of Fianna Fáil government.  We trust that whoever is responsible for making Ireland's case will make a strong case so that we will get the best possible share of European funds to assist our economic development.  I have not heard anything about any efforts made to obtain sums for the purpose of converting this country from its undeveloped state into a developed state.  I do not know if any survey has been carried out as to requirements in order to make our country one with a high economic standard.  The time has come when the Taoiseach, or some responsible Minister, must put all the cards on the table and indicate what the future plans for economic development are and what safeguards there will be for our workers in the event of our accession to the EEC.  There will have to be a clear understanding with the French, the Italians and the Germans about the establishment of industries here to compensate for any loss of employment which may be caused by entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, as I said, was not influenced by the activities of Fianna Fáil in relation to our application.  We approve of entry because we believe entry is in the best interests of this country.  We must bear in mind that the main organisations representing industry made it clear they favour membership; that the principal farming organisations&mdash;NFA and so on&mdash;have made it clear that, so far as Irish agriculture is concerned, they favour this country's entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why so many people are critical of progress.  They speak of certain defence commitments. It is only right to put on record that, at this time, membership involves no such commitment.  They complain that when we enter into Europe the Irish <Col N="936" /> language will go, that Irish culture will fade and that we shall lose our independence.  All that is poppycock.  If people have not respect for the Irish language before we go into Europe they will not have respect for it afterwards. The same case can be made for Irish culture.  Membership of EEC will strengthen our economy.  A lot of time is spent bargaining with Britain for markets.  Our ambassadors and representatives spend much time seeking markets for, for example, certain kinds of fish we export to France.  In a clearer and more defined way we can convey the fact that we are a nation with a voice in Europe.  We have our own language, our own culture, our own country.  That is why I feel that membership, at this stage, does not involve commitments.</P>
    <P>Reading down through the Treaty of Rome or any other code of regulations governing the EEC, can we not ask ourselves a few simple questions? What are the gains?  What are the losses?  What are the prospects?  Are the gains not likely to be greater than the losses?  Are the prospects, with entry, not likely to be greater than if we remain isolated from the Community? Is the most courageous step not to go forward?</P>
    <P>To those critical of the future of the Irish language within Europe may I say that, whether we are in or out of Europe, an Irishman who has not regard for his own language is not worth his salt.  All of us know that we have a duty in this country&mdash;just as the French have a duty, as the Danes have a duty, as the Italians have a duty&mdash;to sponsor, to encourage and to cherish our own language.  I cannot see that our entry into Europe will minimise our efforts to sponsor and to foster the Irish language as our national language. Great strides have been made in recent times in so far as the Irish language is concerned.  Very recently, I was present at a function in a vocational school in my constituency where, at the one time, no fewer than 53 Fáinní were presented to Irish speakers.  Does anyone mean to tell me that, because we enter Europe, these people will lose respect and love for their own language? We cherish our language.  We <Col N="937" /> believe and have faith in our language. No matter what the critics may say, the Irish language will never die; it will never be allowed to die.  I am convinced there are parts of this country where there is greater usage of the Irish language today than ever before. If we enter Europe, I venture to say that it can prove one of the best challenges to the Irish language.  Because of our association with our brother-Europeans, then and then alone will we stand up, hold up our heads and say, in effect: &ldquo;We have our own language just as the French have their language, just as the Italians have their language and just as the Germans have their language.&rdquo;  This will be a means by which greater interest will be taken in the revival to the fullest of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I honestly think that the case put forward by critics of our entry into Europe, if it is based on the survival or the progress of the Irish language, is along the wrong lines.  My opinion is that it will have the opposite effect to what they feel it will have.  I think it will bring a greater awareness and a greater sense of responsibility, a greater sense of duty, a greater sense of nationalism.  Our people will be proud of their language.  They will encourage its usage and speak it.  That is why I disagree with the argument that when we go into Europe the Irish language and Irish pastimes and cultures will finish.  That is all poppycock.  If you create competition, if you create obstacles or difficulties, people will overcome them.  That is why I feel our language will prosper.  I believe that when we enter Europe there will be a greater awareness of Ireland and its cultural heritage amongst the member countries which will encourage rather than hinder the Irish language and Irish culture at its best.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of involvement in any military commitments against our will.  There is no such question.  I have not read it in any document connected with Ireland's entry into the EEC.  There are people who are extremely worried about our policy of neutrality.  Our policy of neutrality was decided upon during the 1939 to 1945 war.  We are now living <Col N="938" /> in what can be described, perhaps, as a new world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising the subject matter of these questions and the subject of vandalism in general as a result of the widespread increase in vandalism in the city of Dublin and in urban areas. I raise this matter today because certain questions which I tabled were answered in a totally and completely unsatisfactory manner by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The reason I am speaking on the Adjournment today is the complex and complicated situation which has arisen in this city as a result of the gross mismanagement of the Department of Justice, a Department associated with the prevention of crime, the detection of crime, the punishment of crime and the rehabilitation of criminals.  As the Minister said in reply to my questions, it is intended as part of the general review of the organisation of the Garda to have the needs of the Finglas area fully examined.  When will this be done?  What system of allocating the Garda is used by the Ministry in the Dublin and rural areas?  What type of logistics is employed in that Ministry?</P>
      <P>We who are active in our constituencies have seen over the past 12 months a fantastic increase in so-called undetectable vandalism.  A short time ago I raised a question related to increased vandalism in the North Circular Road area and the reply which I got from the Minister was that there was no such crime as vandalism.  We are all aware of the spirit of the law and the letter of the law, but surely when it comes to the point that telephone kiosks, plate glass windows in shops, house-windows, corporation house doors and letterboxes, motor cars, litter boxes are broken, when people are molested in towns when excursion trains arrive and there is the vandalism which we had recently following the Kilkenny Beer Festival and also in Kilcullen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Surely vandalism of this nature must in some way come under the control of the Department of Justice. Surely it is not fitting for the Minister to come into this House and tell us, the elected representatives of the people, that vandalism is not a crime.  In his reply he also stated that malicious damage in the area mentioned was apparently on the decrease, as last year there were four cases of malicious damage and this year, to date, there were three.  Hence there was no apparent increase in the incidence of malicious damage.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to cases which have occurred in the past nine months, cases which possibly the Minister has not got on record, because people in the city of Dublin are now fed up reporting malicious damage and vandalism, and the Garda are fed up of going out and trying to arrest vandals and bring them before the courts, where they are let away under the Probation Act, or given a caution of one kind or another which encourages them to go about their bowsie tactics in the city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The ability to prevent vandalism is grossly impaired due to the fact that the Garda are not encouraged to take into custody vandals who are disturbing the peace in areas in the Dublin suburbs.  I want to quote a case which occurred recently. Six teenagers in the Chapelizod area were intoxicated by the consumption <Col N="940" /> of alcoholic liquor which had been purchased by them in the area and they were apprehended.  Much of the malicious damage which is occurring today is associated with and directly attributable to two factors.  One which does not come under the direct administration of this Department but is associated with it, and hence I believe is relevant, is the lack of sufficient recreational facilities and swimming pools in these working-class areas and in all suburban areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a responsibility for the sale of liquor to teenagers.  The second factor I want to mention is that alcoholic liquor is available in this city in supermarkets.  Teenagers can walk in&mdash;they are under the statutory limit of 18 years&mdash;and buy beverages which contain alcohol, go out and become intoxicated, and carry on in a most inappropriate fashion. Recently nine teenagers, apparently either intoxicated or drugged, were seen parading naked in daylight on the streets of Ballyfermot.  This may be an isolated incident, and I sincerely hope it is, but it is the responsibility of this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to something that is specifically related to these questions, increased vandalism in a particular park area which the Minister for Local Government approximately one and a half hours ago in this House confirmed was the only playing field in West Finglas.  Only recently I attended a meeting of people there who wished this playing area, the only one for approximately 30,000 people, to be closed down because it was an attraction for vandals outside the area to come in and wreck the swings, molest teenagers in the area and cause general strife and anxiety among the parents in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other Deputies at present in the House who can verify this.  There were Deputies in this House before me who did great work to get these parks established and now, because of unchecked vandalism all over Dublin, there is complete unrest amongst the citizens.  They are completely dissatisfied with the police force and with the Minister for Justice who, at a time when this country was in turmoil and had insufficient Garda Síochána last year, condones the fact that hundreds of members of the force were up in <Col N="942" /> the Wicklow mountains making a film with a film company from Ardmore studios.  If that is administration of justice and if that is how the Minister for Justice thinks he will combat vandalism he has another &ldquo;think&rdquo; coming. This party have never stood for that type of inadequate administration and will certainly not change their tactics now.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister say that the force is under-manned.  We, and I particularly, would like to see the Minister increasing the number of gardaí available for the Dublin suburbs where this vandalism appears to be rampant, where people are becoming afraid to go out at night.  In part of my own constituency in Ballymun in winter not only are young girls followed home at night but also when they go to school in the morning.  This must be controlled. I call on the Minister for Justice to use his good offices with the Taoiseach and to urge the Taoiseach to consider, with his civil servants, the establishment in what is left of the Government, of a ministry of sport and recreational planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the questions which deal with vandalism.  Will the Deputy please relate his remarks to his own questions?  We cannot have a general debate on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider myself to be a practical man and I do not think the answer to vandalism lies in locking up everybody who happens to commit any offence but in the prevention of offences.  I believe the answer to most ailments of society lies in the prevention of these ailments rather than in using the cat-o'-nine-tails or in locking up the misguided youth of today. It is a tragedy to find that vandalism is not confined to the male section of the youthful population but is beginning to spread to the females and that young boys and girls are now going around together committing petty acts af vandalism for which the Minister has no statistics because vandalism is not a crime.  However, vandalism is a reality.  In the North Circular Road, Dublin, a committee has been established to deal with vandalism because <Col N="943" /> the people have completely lost confidence in the Government in the past few months.  In the Deanstown Road area of Finglas West a proposal to set up vigilante patrols of the residents was seriously considered.  It was these residents who apprehended certain skinheads who had infiltrated into the park recreational area.</P>
      <P>We know that it is difficult to prove vandalism and difficult to rehabilitate vandals.  It is difficult to compile statistics on vandalism but let us not be tied up in bureaucracy.  Let us realise that vandalism is on the increase and that alcohol and drugs are contributing to this increase.  Let the Minister know that fully from this side of the House, as we know it.  I am here this evening to call on the Minister, firstly, to curtail the vast increase in vandalism in Dublin and, secondly, to make an allout effort to prevent vandalism.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's reply today that it would not be in the interests of the prevention or detection of crime to specify the arrangements for policing particular areas, I dispute the wisdom of this statement.  I believe it would be in the interests of the prevention of crime if the chances of detection were great.  The reason that it it not at present in the interests of the prevention of crime is that there is no chance of detection or prevention because the force in the particular area is insufficient.  We also know that the number of squad cars available for this vast area is only one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area which I believe comprises the best part of 50,000 people with more due to come there, we would have very minimal motor patrols.  There might be only one squad car available to patrol an area with a total population of some 50,000.  Is this proper and efficient administration? We had a bomb thrown at the Protestant church at Finglas West a few days ago but there was not a word about it and nobody was apprehended. <Col N="944" /> Only recently we had a bomb thrown in Coolock and not a word about that either.  We had statements that in the Ballymun area people have been asked to prepare for trouble in August.  Will we hear the Minister in his reply referring to any preventive measures when he has not even got the Garda station open there?</P>
      <P>The people whom I know and meet every day of every week of the year are completely dissatisfied with the way this Government are dealing with the enormous problem of vandalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>After the somewhat contradictory statements of the last 20 minutes it is no harm that we should come back to reality, and the best way that I can set out the position is by quoting to the House my reply to Deputy Tunney at column 423, volume 248, of the Official Report of 2nd July, 1970, when he asked a question on this problem:</P>
      <P>As in the case of virtually all types of crime in Dublin, the figures for malicious damage have shown an increase in recent years and it is true to say that in some areas of the city the position is worse than in others. The Garda Síochána say they are not aware of any organised gangs engaged in acts of malicious damage. In the majority of the cases known to the Garda, the damage is done by young people travelling in groups to dances, <i>et cetera.</i>  The less serious incidents of malicious damage are particularly difficult to detect except where members of the public are willing to come forward with information.</P>
      <P>Special late-night Garda patrols are provided in particular areas and the Garda authorities say that these patrols together with the ordinary beat patrols and mobile patrols operating from the local Garda stations should prove effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first comment I want to make in regard to vandalism or malicious damage in the city of Dublin and elsewhere is that, to an extent as high as 95 per cent or more, it is caused by <Col N="945" /> young people and, very often, very young people.  The Garda find that most of these offenders whom they apprehend are in the age group 12 to 15 years.  It seems to me that Deputy Byrne has got his priorities all wrong when he criticises me, or the Garda through me, for not allegedly taking effective steps to counter the vandalism which undoubtedly exists.  It can hardly be disputed by anybody who takes a reasonable, realistic view of the matter that young people of 12 to 15 years of age who cause most of this damage are not primarily the responsibility of the Garda but are the responsibility of their parents.  The sad fact is that a great many parents in this city neglect their duty to control their children and to see they do not get up to the sort of mischief that has been referred to in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>It is unfair for anybody to seek to place on the Garda a duty that is not primarily theirs, and parents who neglect their duty cannot impose that duty on the Garda.  It is regrettable that Deputy Byrne should seek to concentrate on the repressive or negative approach to this problem, in other words, on apprehending, bringing before the criminal courts and punishing the vandals.  In view of the fact that the bulk of them are in the 12 to 15 age group, surely they are not criminals in the accepted sense of the word? The proper approach is not the heavy hand that Deputy Dr. Byrne suggests but a positive approach involving parents, teachers, other leaders of the local community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="946" /> repeat that my feeling on the matter is that positive action by parents, teachers and leaders of the local community is the most effective and the fairest way of trying to stamp out this problem. The primary responsibility should not be put on the Garda but, unfortunately, because many parents neglect their duty, the responsibility is put on the Garda.  The Garda realise it and I realise it.  For that reason, over the past couple of months the strength of practically every suburban Garda station in Dublin has been increased. The strength of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin Metropolitan Area now exceeds 2,300, which is the highest figure it ever was in the history of the force.</P>
      <P>It is also worth pointing out with regard to vandalism or malicious damage, particularly of the more trivial kind, that it is almost impossible for the Garda Síochána to apprehend offenders unless members of the public are willing to come forward with information. I should like to take this opportunity of appealing to the citizens of Dublin particularly to give every assistance they can to the Garda in this respect.  The work of the Garda is difficult enough at the best of times but it is made practically impossible in these cases if full co-operation from the public is not forthcoming.</P>
      <P>There is nothing further I wish to add on this matter except to refute once again the allegation of Deputy Byrne that I or the Government or the Garda Síochána are in any way complacent about it.  We see the problem in a clearer and more realistic light than Deputy Dr. Byrne does, and I hope he uses whatever influence he has in his constituency and in the city of Dublin to try to engender in parents, teachers and local community leaders a sense of responsibility with regard to supervision over the young people who for the most part commit these petty crimes of vandalism.</P>

    <P>NOTE: In calculating the prices for mid-May, 1970, an appropriate adjustment was made to individual price quotations to include any turnover tax charged on the basis of total purchases. The mid-May, 1969, prices were not similarly adjusted.  It is estimated, however, that the amount of the corresponding adjustment would be in the range 0.0-0.5d according to the level of the price in question.</P>
