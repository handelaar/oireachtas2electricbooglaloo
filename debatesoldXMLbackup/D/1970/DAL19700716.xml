    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1970: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The opportunity afforded by the discussion which arises here annually on social welfare allowances is availed of to a large extent to focus attention on the grievances <Col N="1256" /> Deputies are made aware of from time to time in regard to the administration of social welfare benefits.  That is a good thing because so many people are dependent on social welfare benefits for their existence.  Last night I endeavoured to focus attention on the desirability of changing the qualifying age for pensions to 65 years.</P>
      <P>I should like to repeat that such a change has been made in almost every country I know of with the exception of Ireland.  This question was left in abeyance to a large extent last year because the Minister made some announcement about two years ago, in advance of the 1969 general election, that the age limit would be reduced to 65 years.  Naturally that was well publicised so Deputies came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to raise this matter last year and that legislation would be enacted to bring about this desirable result.</P>
      <P>I want to ask again this morning, as I have asked down through the years, why should people in the better type of employment with bigger salaries and safer and surer jobs get their allowances at 65 years of age while the self employed shoemaker, tailor, carpenter, farmer, shopkeeper and people like that must wait until they are 70 years of age?  The changes made here so far as insurable employment is concerned are little more than changes in the system that has obtained during the past number of years whereby most insurable employees of 65 years or more availed of social welfare payments under the heading of unemployment benefit or disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned last evening, I think the House and the Irish people in general would be prepared to provide the funds necessary to bring about that change.  I want to ask the Minister to take note of the statistics provided from medical sources, and others, which show that every other person of 70 years of age or more suffers from a complaint of one kind or another.  I am saying that again because it will be 12 months before this House will have an opportunity of discussing this question again.  There is a great deal of public anxiety about it.  The shoemaker, the tailor, the hairdresser, the shopkeeper and the small farmer are <Col N="1257" /> self employed people, and they cannot see why the qualifying age for their pension has not been changed since it was introduced by the British Government in 1908.</P>
    <P>I have said a great deal about this in the current debate.  I do not think I raised this question last year because of the announcement which had been made by the Minister.  There is an obligation or responsibility on the Government and particularly on the Minister to make a special announcement on this matter at the close of the debate.  It is unnecessary to repeat that at least 50 per cent of the money paid to old age pensioners comes back to the Exchequer through taxation.</P>
    <P>The next question that arises is that of the means test.  The system used here has been attacked continuously and is likely to be attacked in the future, as many people do not appreciate the difficulty of evolving a formula that would cover all cases.  At present it must be said that the means test is favourable for many people. For instance, those with a good deal of property who assign it to a member of the family on retirement and still live in the house, which is the usual thing, can qualify for the maximum rate of £3 15s weekly without much difficulty.  I suppose it is fair to say that to many such applicants this allowance is essentially pocket money, it being assumed that their families continue to provide for them in their old age.</P>
    <P>At the other extreme are old age pensioners who are entirely dependent on the £3 15s, having no other income.  In some cases they live alone and in others with people incapable of supporting themselves never mind contributing to the support of an additional member in the household.  In such cases the allowances are very small.  When this Bill becomes law the non-contributory maximum rate will be increased to £4 5s weekly.  If one considers the statistics submitted to the Dáil by a Minister less than a fortnight ago, showing that it takes £1 17s 9d at present to purchase goods which £1 could buy seven years ago, that is the clearest indication of the position that we have had for a long time.  It indicates clearly that increases in social <Col N="1258" /> welfare benefits do little more than maintain standards, having regard to the ever-increasing cost of commodities.</P>
    <P>To put it mildly, I think the means test is unfair.  To qualify for the maximum pension you must have less than £25 and, while there is some easement in the provision for the assessment of £2 12s if you own a house or have unfurnished lodgings, in respect of some classes of pensioners, I think it is unreasonable at present to say to a person that because he has £26 he cannot qualify for a full pension.  I can illustrate this with a case that has come to mind without disclosing the identity of the person concerned.  Last year, I was approached by an old woman who was entirely dependent on her pension of £3 10s a week.  She had no home of her own and had to reside with relatives.  She was advised to come to me to ascertain whether she was entitled to the maximum rate of £3 15s.  From my discussions with her I found she was not, because she had on her person £40 for her burial expenses.  She had put that money into a special purse and is still taking that money around with her today.  Because she had this £40 and because, as many people are, she was quite truthful in her pension declaration and in stating her means to the social welfare officer, she is losing 5s weekly.</P>
    <P>Why should that be the position? Why should she, a woman in her circumstances, have only £3 10s a week when a farmer of £150 valuation who assigns his property, say, to his son on marriage, leaving no capital in his own name, gets £3 15s?  I know it is difficult to devise legislation to cover all types of cases but the reason for giving this illustration is to convey to the House the inadvisability of continuing this system which brings about such a position.</P>
    <P>This booklet I have here gives information regarding entitlements, if one is in the non-contributory class, on reaching the age of 70.  To qualify, you must have no means or less than £25 and nothing in your own name. You must not own the house you live in unless &mdash; and this was mentioned here yesterday as happening in a few cases <Col N="1259" />&mdash; the applicant is in a position to prove that the house is less than £25 in value. It is strange to think that anyone in Ireland is living in a house of an estimated value of less than £25.  If an applicant is to qualify for the third rate of pensions of 65s, his income must be less than £52 10s per annum or £1 per week.  If he has an income of £1 0s 6d per week he loses 10s a week pension.  The rate is reduced from the maximum 75s to 65s.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for the continuance of that type of policy in the Department?  Does it so happen that the Government and the Minister leave that over to the Civil Service side and never bother to go into these matters, which may seem insignificant to them, which may be beneath the Minister's notice but which to the individuals all over the country are of primary importance? It is no harm to remind the House and the Government that non-contributory pensioners have during their lifetime of work and toil contributed to the welfare of this State. They have contributed to taxation, local and national, both directly and indirectly.  In their old age they are entitled to a better deal from public funds and from those who administer public funds.</P>
    <P>Again referring to this booklet, it is not wasting the time of this House to deal with the scale applicable for old age pensions of a non-contributory nature.  If the income rate is £2 0s 6d weekly, the loss to the pensioner is £1 5s.  The pensioner is awarded a pension with no flexibility in the regulations to save him.  There is no argument, no case to be made for him, no representations to be made through a social welfare officer or an appeals officer.  This is the forum for making representations to get rid of this system.  When I or any other Deputy of this House make such a case there is nothing he can do but tell the pensioner: &ldquo;The regulations are such that you must lose your £1 5s a week.  If a man has an income of £2 0s 6d then he gets £2 10s pension, that is, £4 10s 6d.  Under the new regulations he will be getting £5 0s 6d.  It is unfair that we should ask a man to live <Col N="1260" /> on £5 0s 6d, that because from his own industry he has an income of £2 weekly, public funds should effect a saving of £78 annually in respect of that person.</P>
    <P>According to the booklet, a person who has an annual income of £221 15s, which is about £4 5s per week, finds that the appropriate rate of pension is 5s weekly; in other words, by virtue of having an income of £4 5s weekly the non-contributory rate of pension in his case is reduced by £3 10s, from £3 15s to 5s.  If he has £4 6s a week he is out completely.</P>
    <P>These are items which should be examined by the Minister and by the Government.  There is a great deal of reading in this booklet.  I would advise some of them to take it to bed with them and study it.  They will see for themselves what food for thought one could get from a careful examination of this booklet in relation to social insurance and assistance services in 1970.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour and Social Welfare, Deputy Brennan, is obliged, by virtue of the office he holds, to listen to debates and suggestions and reply to them.  There is a feeling growing up in this country and, indeed, within the walls of this building that debate now serves no purpose, that the Government have fixed minds, that they are the know-all people, and it is boring and monotonous to sit over there in that seat listening to contributions from this side of the House. I do not know if such assertions are correct but they are made by several Opposition Members of this House and I think there is something in them. That is my own personal viewpoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are not getting away from the debate.  What I am trying to emphasise is that when suggestions are made here by Opposition Members and they are replied to, that is democracy.  That is how it should work.  Let the Minister say these suggestions are inadmissible, that it would be inadvisable to operate them but let him give reasons why such suggestions should be rejected.  As <Col N="1261" /> well as that, a Cheann Comhairle, for your own personal information may I say assertions made around this House are that Government Deputies are precluded from contributing to many debates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I never intended getting getting away from social welfare, but year after year suggestions are made here and they are not dealt with.  There is an obligation on a Minister of State, no matter what Government is in power, when his Department is in receipt of a large subvention from public funds, to deal with such recommendations. If a Minister finds it boring and monotonous to listen to debates here or to deal with Departmental matters as requested in this House, then there is no obligation on him to remain in office.  He has a way out; he can resign.</P>

      <P>I have asked the Deputy to get back to the Bill. The Deputy is making a general statement on the Government attitude and it does not arise on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>The Chair is telling the Deputy that it does not arise and the Deputy knows it does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wrong; it does <Col N="1262" /> arise.  One of our functions is to make representations to the Department and at one time I gave credit to the Department for dealing as effectively as possible with correspondence regarding old age pensions and other social welfare benefits.  That has not been the position of late.  There has been a clamp-down and I understand it is by direction of the Government.  I may be referring to that later on.  I gave reasons why the system should be recast. In the early sixties pleas were made here for an easement of the means test and what did we find?  At that time you qualified for the full pension if your means were deemed to be within the £26 5s to £52 10s group. What easement was brought about or what did the Government do?  They said the means must be nil &mdash; and &ldquo;nil&rdquo; is the word used here&mdash; to qualify for the pension, the first £25 not to be taken into account.  I say there is an unanswerable case for recasting this scale.  The figures are not realistic in 1970.  Because a person has 25s, 30s or 35s a week income from some other source sizeable reductions are made in the pension allowances.  The rapidly depreciating value of money must be taken into account.  If that were done we should have a new booklet if not in 1970 at least in 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to the scale in which I am particularly interested, the scale for widows' non-contributory pensions. The scale, with slight variations, is somewhat similar.  Down through the years I have pleaded here on behalf of certain classes of widows, widows of farmers, or shopkeepers, or of self-employed people who are not in insurable employment.  Once the husband dies, very often unexpectedly, the income position of such a family changes.  Let us take the case of a shopkeeper or farmer.  The husband, who was looking after the business and through his activities was the main source of income, dies leaving a widow with a young family.  In a number of such cases the man may not have had the opportunity of making a will or an assignment of his property.  Such widows find themselves in great difficulties. When they ask for help from the State by way of widows' pensions it is almost impossible for them to <Col N="1263" /> qualify.  When the application is made, the usual procedure is for an officer to investigate the case and he takes into account the income for the previous year.  Invariably, he overlooks the fact that the accounting year is the year in which the husband was alive and well and was able to contribute towards the income but now that he has gone the position is completely changed.  It seems strange that the Department and their officers never seem to appreciate that fact, that the widow's income undergoes a great change for the worse when the husband dies.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a farmer's wife who has three or four children and nine or ten cows.  Divide up the income whatever way you like.  I agree, of course, that it is almost impossible for a social welfare officer to make a favourable report.  It is very hard to say that a widow with three children has not an income of, say, £6 or £7 a week.  She would want that to buy food for the household.  If that is said then the pension, if any, is negligible.  This is something which is crying out for amendment.  The booklet says that a widow with no children and an income of over £4 weekly, or £208 a year, is out.  A widow with £261 annually, or in a range from £260 15s to £273 15s and two children &mdash; that is from £5 to £5 5s weekly &mdash; qualifies for 8s 6d.  This is the law today and it is not right.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a small business. The pension officer comes along and inquires: &ldquo;How much did you get from this wholesaler or from that wholesaler?&rdquo;  and he calculates 22 per cent or 22½ per cent gross profit and, naturally, he is bound to find, even in small businesses, that the income would be £6 or £7.  There are many widows with three or four children who have small businesses and because of the regulations they are not getting pensions.  The Parliamentary Secretary probably knows of such cases in County Galway.  I am making a special plea for widows because I do not consider they are being treated in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>The booklet issued by the Department makes the position clear.  There <Col N="1264" /> is an increase granted of 11s 6d for widows and 2s 6d for each child.  The Minister could say that a widow with two children who has a weekly income of, say, £5 from a shop or small business will get an increase of 16s 6d weekly when this Bill becomes law. That is a meagre amount and I have much sympathy for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a great difference so far as widows with contributory pensions are concerned and the widows of, say, members of the public service or Members of this House.  For the latter group their pension rates are spelled out not in shillings but in some cases in four figure sums and, in addition, they often receive a substantial gratuity.  Why should the widow of a small shopkeeper, a farmer or a self-employed worker who perhaps has saved some money so that the income could be deemed to be £3 or £4 weekly, be treated so shabbily?  I do not like to criticise our system but it is part of our job in a debate of this kind to point out the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister for Social Welfare to review such cases because he has more information at his disposal than any of us.  It is completely out of place in this age that a widow with a weekly income of, say, £5 from a small business should have to make do with the meagre increase now granted. Despite the many representations made, the only help forthcoming from the Department was that the first £39 of income was not taken into account in respect of widows and dependent children. They are allowed to earn up to 15s weekly which will not be taken into account and I need hardly add that in this age 15s is a totally insignificant amount.  The woman who has a small shop and is dependent on casual trade is harassed by social welfare officers in connection with her income.  It can be said that the officers are only doing their job in assessing her means but it is amazing the number of small shopkeepers who are deprived of their entitlement.</P>
    <P>I have already raised the question about unemployment assistance allowances for farmers in the West of Ireland who are assessed on a land <Col N="1265" /> valuation basis.  There is no doubt that such allowances are of benefit to small farmers, especially when they have large families.  I am satisfied they appreciate the action of the Government in bringing in this legislation.  It applies only to farmers with small valuations and frequently such people have their income cut off for part of the year; for example, their creamery income ceases from October to April or May and quite often they do not receive cheques from the creameries for milk supplied because their trading balance is in the red.  The Government stated that farmers in the 12 western counties would have their means assessed on a land valuation basis for unemployment assistance purposes. It was stated that, irrespective of their stock, that would be the only yardstick by which their income would be measured, with the exception of assessment on capital.  It worked out satisfactorily for Counties Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, the five counties of Connacht and County Kerry but when it came to County Cork the law was changed.</P>
    <P>More than half the total area of Cork is clearly defined by the Government as coming within the scope of western counties legislation.  Everyone knows that the 12 western counties consist of 11 home counties and part of County Cork.  Why was another boundary drawn through that part of Cork county which comes within the scope of the western counties legislation? Why did the Minister remove from the benefits of this scheme more than half the county, the area deemed to be part of the west so far as congestion is concerned?  The Minister draws a line from Glandore to Dunmanway and out towards Inchigeela. By virtue of being chairman of the county council I was a member of the county development team in Cork for three years.  I am well aware of the boundaries of County Cork and of the area being dealt with by the county development team for industrial purposes. I thought that would have the desired effect and that I would not have to ask supplementary questions, but it did not.</P>
    <P>The land in Dunmanway, Reenascreena and Roscarbery is no better <Col N="1266" /> than the land in north Kerry or any other place.  I tried to point out to the Minister, through supplementary questions, that, in most instances, as one moves northwards and eastwards in Cork county, land valuations increase so much that the scheme will apply to only a very small number indeed. It is for that small number that I am pleading here.  Why are they discriminated against in the scheme?</P>
    <P>Land valuations per acre are much higher in that area and, because of that, the scheme would be of little benefit there except for isolated pockets of poor mountainy land.  I feel there is an obligation on me, as a Deputy for the constituency, to focus the Government's attention on this discrimination &mdash; perhaps I should not say discrimination, oversight might be more accurate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no responsibility for the valuation of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Minister indicated when he announced this legislation here, and in reply to questions, that he was responsible for determining the areas where this discrimination would apply.  I am saying to the House that this must be through an oversight.</P>
      <P>I want to get some cogent reasons from the Minister as to why there is one law for Cork and another for the 11 other counties.  I want to be able to transmit this information to the people who have made representations to me.  There are enough boundaries in Cork at the present time without the Department of Social Welfare coming along and making another boundary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time I also mentioned electoral divisions, because the people do not know where the electoral divisions begin or end.  I am not blaming the Minister.  I am sure this is an oversight, but I would like to rectify the matter.  If the Minister is in any doubt I can get sent on to <Col N="1267" /> him, or he can get it from the chairman of the development team, Mr. Conlon, the Cork county manager, a map of that part of County Cork deemed to be within the 12 western counties.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see improvements are being made in the regulations governing the payment of disability benefits which will mean it will no longer be necessary for people of 65 years or more to travel to doctors to get medical certification.  That is a step forward. I hope the invalidity pension will replace the disability pension because when a person is incapacitated, instead of having to get a weekly certificate or at most a monthly certificate, it would be much better to give a blanket certificate when it is obvious he is not going to be better for two or three years.  I am glad someone has suggested the change and that the system has now been modified.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister and the House are conversant with my views on unemployment benefit.  I have again and again stressed at national and local level the desirability of the State contributing towards the maintenance of old people no longer able to work because they have reached retirement age and of those who are incapable through physical or mental illness of providing for themselves.  With our relatively small population I believe nobody should be unemployed.  Why not have some discussions at the top? Why not have an inter-Departmental Committee that would draw up suitable employment schemes of a productive nature in every district where people are unemployed?</P>

      <P>It is set down in this statement that unemployment benefit will be increased by 15s per week in <Col N="1268" /> respect of a single man.  My views are that if Cork County Council had four men unemployed in a particular part of the county and their employment ceases on any Friday evening, the forestry division or the drainage division, or some public body might have work within that district that would be quite suitable for such men.  Instead of going to the exchange they could be transferred to other public work of a productive nature.  It is not good for any country, particularly a small country like ours, with a population of 2.8 million people, to be in a position in which it cannot provide productive employment for all the people.</P>

      <P>The Chair would remind the Deputy that there is nothing in the Bill dealing with this.  We are dealing with social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Roads have to be improved and water schemes must be provided.  There are many schemes necessary in built-up areas and several works of public utility await implementation. It is not in the best interests of the Irish nation that able-bodied members of our population should be forced to sign on at exchanges for a weekly contribution from public funds even though part of that money may be their own contribution and the other part the State's subvention.  It is better from every point of view that an alternative system should be provided. I have made this point in this House many times.  Most people prefer to get money through productive work rather than through calling at the exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the question of hospital costs, which are £18 weekly. We must advert to the position of the old people.  The local authorities are finding it impossible to provide accommodation for the aged who cannot continue living on their own or with relatives or friends.  If the bed complement of the district hospitals was increased suddenly by 200 or 300 per cent the hospitals would be full of patients again within a couple of weeks.  I spoke of the hospital cost of £18 weekly.  That is what it costs to provide weekly accommodation for an old person in the district hospitals in <Col N="1269" /> Cork County or at least in Cork south west.  I am sure that the figure in the county homes is sizeable also.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained that the primary obligation in relation to the care of the old people rests on their children.  The State should not encourage people who are capable of minding their parents to pass the burden on to the local authorities.  I am not trying to transfer the burden to the public unless circumstances warrant such transfer.  A few years ago people with lower salaries than obtain at present cared for their old people at home.  I hope that position will continue. Financial difficulties create problems and it is evident that the Department are now satisfied that that is so. They have introduced the special allowance of 55s weekly for some categories of old people who are cared for by relatives. I have been pleading for such assistance at local and national level for a number of years.  I pleaded that the disabled person's maintenance allowance should be payable to people over 70 years of age where their physical condition warranted such payment. Their condition should be indicated by medical certificates.  I am seeking an improvement in what is contained in the Bill in so far as the allowance is concerned.  We will not have an opportunity for another 12 months of dealing with such matters in detail.  An old woman, whether she is the mother or grandmother of a housewife, must be certified as suffering from a permanent disability in order to qualify for this allowance.  A female relative thinking about applying for an allowance and reading the advertisements in the newspapers will find that in most cases she is ineligible because she is married. Such a female relative who is not married may be ineligible for the allowance because she has a male relative over 16 years of age living in the house.  This would debar her from applying.</P>
    <P>That rule is too harsh and very much out of place at present.  It is within the competence of the Department to devise regulations more flexible than that one.  It is not fair that a female should not be entitled to benefit simply because there is a male relative of more <Col N="1270" /> than 16 years living in the household. The Minister should consider this regulation with a view to having it changed. I know of a case where a woman was turned down when she applied for benefit although the other member of the household was in receipt of disability benefit.  One would not think that an incapacitated relative would be taken into account but such is the position.</P>
    <P>I am trying to relate the cost of allowing for more flexibility in regard to this regulation.  The cost of maintaining a person in a district health hospital is about £18 per week.  While I am sure that no Member of the House would wish to remove old and incapacitated people from hospitals, at the same time, one will often find in the locality surrounding any hospital a number of other cases who are equally as deserving as those fortunate enough to be hospitalised.</P>
    <P>From my experience of talking with old people in public institutions, I have found that, invariably, they would much prefer to be residing at home with their relatives and in their own surroundings.  Our people do not adapt easily to what could be termed institutional conditions and most people try to avoid going to hospital unless there is absolute need for treatment. However, most of the cases in district hospitals at the present time are social cases.  They are people who are not getting active treatment of any kind. If the relatives of these people had a little extra money from the State &mdash; I am speaking of circumstances which warrant additional help &mdash; they would keep these people at home.  As well as this being a blessing for the people concerned, it would be also a blessing for the State which is now being pressed so hard by public opinion to provide additional accommodation for geriatric patients.</P>
    <P>Among the points raised by Deputy Tully during the course of his contribution was that of a phased rate of pension.  I have to put my own interpretation on what he had in mind. Was it that when this Bill becomes law the maximum pension will be £4 5s, or was it that when a person reaches the age of, say, 75, he will receive an <Col N="1271" /> extra £1 a week and when he reaches the age of 80, he will get yet another extra £1?  People who are more than 90 years of age &mdash; there are not many of them &mdash; should be entitled to some special consideration.  While I am on this subject, I might mention that I am glad to hear that the amount paid to centenarians is being increased to £50.  However, I am merely throwing out the suggestion that those people who are more than 80 years of age might receive some special consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up too much time but I wish to refer briefly to the section of the Bill which deals with deserted wives.  Having heard what some of the Deputies had to say on this section, it would appear that there is a problem of deserted wives within the metropolitan area but I must say that in so far as south west Cork is concerned the number of deserted wives could be counted on the fingers of one hand.</P>
    <P>I notice the term &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; had not yet been defined.  This may be a difficult exercise.  I agree that wives who are deserted by their husbands are entitled to help, but the Minister must be cautions.  Most of our people are quite honest and upright and, in cases in which husbands and wives are living apart by agreement, the husband contributes to the support of the wife. There is provision in the Bill to the effect that where the State can establish there is a contribution from the husband the regulation will not apply. Now, up to a point, that is right.  I should not think the number in west Cork is very large, but I will take a case in point to illustrate my arrgument. Take the case of a married couple in which there is no hope of a reconciliation but the husband is contributing £3 a week to the support of his wife; it is really a question of take it or leave it.  The wife is naturally anxious to get something and £3 is better than nothing.  I do not think a woman in her position should be debarred from consideration.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that this will not cut across efforts at securing a reconciliation between the parties.  There are <Col N="1272" /> cases in which married couples part, for one reason or another, but there is almost invariably the possibility of reconciliation.  Naturally everyone would like to see husbands and wives reconciled.  I trust this will not prove a hindrance.  A wife getting an allowance might be tempted to think the allowance was safer from her point of view.  We shall have to be very watchful in this regard.</P>
    <P>Where the means test is concerned, I want a definite reply from the Minister. Take the case of a man of 70 years, or over, who decides to distribute his savings between his children, having assigned his farm to his eldest son.  He may give one child £800, another £500, a third £400, and so on. The pension officer comes along and says: &ldquo;You gave that money away in order to qualify for the pension.  We will give you nothing.&rdquo;  Is it not time to put an end to that?  The right thing for a man of 70 years of age, or over, to do is to distribute any money he has between his family, having given his farm to a son.  I warn the Minister that I will raise by way of question in this House every case of a pension being refused in this fashion and, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will raise it on the Adjournment also.  It is time an end was put to this system.  A man may not have his mind fully made up about the disposition of his money and he may get a part pension.  Having made up his mind and disposed of his money he applies for an increase and he seeks advice from someone conversant with the regulations.  My advice would be that he should distribute his money between his family because I believe that is the right thing to do.  His family is his first obligation.  The people in Store Street and their agents down the country tell him they will not give him an increase because he gave this money away to his family with, to use their jargon, the fraudulent intention of getting a subvention from the State to which he is not entitled. I trust that sort of thing will not happen again.</P>
    <P>By way of question here some month or six weeks ago I raised the case of an employee whose employer did not stamp his cards.  According to the law, <Col N="1273" /> this is an offence.  The employee took it for granted that his cards were being stamped.  Having discovered that they were not, he got in touch with the Department and he was told that the Department would recover the money for him.  The amount due was £134 odd.  Yesterday another Deputy had a somewhat similar question here.  Now people do not like having difficulties with their neighbours.  Since I became a Member of this House some 20 years ago this is only the second such case I have had occasion to raise here.  As I say, the employee was told by the Department that they would get the money for him.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the Department would have got the money for him were it not for the fact that the State Solicitor has sufficient powers to block the Department's efforts.  Surely no public employee should have that power?  I never like raising a case here, which may reflect on a public official, without making every effort to get a constituent's grievance rectified by some other method, but this case has gone on now since 1965 and no action has been taken and I am satisfied beyond all doubt that the State Solicitor is responsible.  I am satisfied the Minister is unwilling or incapable of taking action against him because the State Solicitor is a prominent supporter of his party.  That is a fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say no more on that.  I would like again to say that in so far as the increased allowances are concerned naturally they are welcome to the people generally.  Having regard to the sharpening depreciation of the value of the £, the sum of £1 17s 9d in 1970 can do very little. Nevertheless I appreciate that the State is endeavouring to help the people who qualify for those allowances in a reasonable way.  There is goodwill. Money must be found to do all that requires to be done and it is difficult to collect it.  At the same time so far as old people and widows are concerned we should be more liberal.</P>
      <P>Let us hope then that the discrimination of qualifying ages for retirement allowances will disappear within the next year.  Members of the Dáil are usually unanimous in approving of funds for the payment of benefits to those of our people who are compelled by their circumstances to avail of such benefits.  It is, however, difficult to understand why a higher percentage of our people are dependent on social welfare funds than is the case in other countries.  So far as the benefits, leaving out children's allowances, which are administered by the Department are concerned the rate <i>per capita</i> is higher here than in other countries. Why should that be?  Should we address ourselves to finding a cure?  Why do so many people find themselves obliged to avail of those services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A system should be devised to try to get work for all our people so that a day will come when only those people who cannot live without benefits <Col N="1275" /> from the Department of Social Welfare will receive them.  We should find work for our people instead of giving them unemployment benefit. We should find the money so that somebody in the Department can get down to formulating a policy of finding work for all our people so that, from Donegal to Cork, young men and young women capable of doing a good day's work will not have to go to the exchange for unemployment benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is obviously an attempt by the Government to rectify the grossly inadequate welfare benefits which have been paid to the less well-off sections of the community and to make provision for persons who have not been catered for in any way up to date.  Following on what Deputy Dr. Browne said yesterday, it is an attempt by the present Administration to prevent starvation among certain sections of our population.  The Bill provides a nominal increase in monetary benefits which today will be insufficient to achieve the end for which they are intended, that is, to provide the necessaries of life for the beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>We are the best fed nation in the world.  We have an average consumption of 3,000 calories per head of the population, which signifies us as the best fed nation in the world by definition of the World Health Organisation, but we still have sections of our population in mental hospitals and in county homes due to the fact that they have not had sufficient means at their disposal to procure the necessaries of life.</P>
      <P>It is welcome to see certain sections of the population who were not included in social welfare benefits to date being included in this Bill.  Due recognition should be given to the fact that the present Administration have at last realised the inadequacy of the amount of money given to the sections provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the new increases are totally inadequate although, naturally, they are a help.  It is unfortunate that synonymous with the announcement of these increased benefits, there was an increase in indirect taxation.  Furthermore, <Col N="1276" /> the extra benefit will not be available until approximately six months have elapsed from the introduction of the Budget whereas there was an immediate increase in indirect taxation.  Over the past 50 years the record of Fianna Fáil in Government towards the less well-off sections of the population is such that we can expect that nothing will be done to increase these allowances further in the next Budget.  I should like to see an arrangement whereby these allowances will incrase in accordance with the increase in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>This country has the highest rate of mental hospital patients recorded in the world.  Many of these unfortunate people are in institutions here because they had not sufficient money to purchase the necessary foods to nourish their systems sufficiently to render them capable of looking after their own affairs outside these institutions. It is an unfortunate fact that when they are locked up they are forgotten about.  When they are put into the county home, they are forgotten about.  When they are put into a mental home they become family stigmas in many cases and are left there to pine away.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not give sufficient cover for the maintenance and support of senile people at home in the family circle.  The allowance for a dependent relative is insufficient.  When the financial crunch comes and a choice has to be made between furthering the educational interests, for example, of a young member of the family or retaining the aged member within the family circle &mdash; sometimes certain medical care is involved here also &mdash; the invariable decision at times of great financial strain is that well intentioned relatives who may wish to retain such elderly people at home are unable to do so and the unfortunate person ends up in a county institution or a health authority institution and then becomes a burden on the community financially and a burden on our conscience.  The family circle is the unit on which this country and its Government are based. The family circle comes first and we must strive to keep it intact.</P>
    <P>Our country, by virtue of different factors, has the highest rate of maternal <Col N="1277" /> mortality in Europe and the highest rate of peri-natal mortality, infant death, in Europe &mdash; twice that of the average.  We have, furthermore, the highest rate of mental hospital patients in Europe.  Factors relating to these points have direct relevance to our social welfare payments.  With the increased efficiency of medical science, diagnostic acumen and the ability to save lives which, 25 years ago, would have been lost, we are increasing the life span of the disabled section of our population and lowering our infant death rate by keeping alive more premature infants.  We should bear in mind, however, that the incidence of mental retardation increases according as prematurity is greatest.  As medical science advances in efficiency the number of people who find it necessary to claim these benefits will increase.</P>
    <P>One particular section are unfortunate babies who through no fault of their own happen to be retarded or affected in some form or other.  Of these, an important group are those suffering from spina bifida.  I am disappointed that there is no special allowance in the Bill for those people.  I realise that the Bill can, in conjunction with other legislation, be used to provide, in certain cases, allowances for the parents.  Allowances are made under the Health Bill for medicines at a reduced cost for sufferers from spina bifida.  However, I should like to see definite provision for this group in the Bill.  Those affected most severely by this disease die and those suffering less severely from the disease carry on reasonably normally but the bulk of those who remain in the community are unable to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the increasing affluence of society in Europe the number of people who are injured in industry and in road traffic accidents is growing. We read in the newspapers at weekends about the number of people killed in the 26 Counties.  This, of course, is not really relevant to the Bill but I am particularly concerned about the increase in the number of people invalided in industry or because of accidents in the home or on the road. A significant number of injuries to head and limb is involved in road accidents. <Col N="1278" /> These injuries render people relatively unemployable.  They may be able to do a job but because of their physical handicap they are not good insurance risks and hence they are at a disadvantage before they even take up employment.</P>
    <P>By virtue of our religion and family traditions we have the largest family units in Europe and the larger the families the greater the number of defective children, the greater the number of maternal deaths the greater the number of orphans and the greater the number of children who need special care.  We should take this into account when drafting a Bill like this because these are factors which are peculiar to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The economic stresses and strains of life in Ireland because of the large families and the relatively low income <i>per capita</i> can lead to desertion by a husband or wife.  It is not only the husbands who desert.  In many cases where there are large families the mother can also disappear from the scene, although invariably she returns.  I have spoken to some deserted wives.  They are well aware that many husbands have been left with a number of children on their hands but they feel that these are reasonably well catered for because the system at the moment permits somebody to look after the children.</P>
    <P>Here, again, is an example of the family being deprived of its most important element &mdash; the mother.  The husband cracks through the stresses and strains of the living circumstances. Perhaps, the sixth or seventh child is mentally defective, is a cretin, suffers from spina bifida or is a fibrocystic. The likelihood of this happening increases with the number of children. This stress can result in the husband disappearing from the family circle. We all have tremendous sympathy with anybody to whom this has occurred. The majority of husbands who desert do so because matters have got on top of them in one way or another.  I am very pleased to see that nominally anyway we have recognised the social position of the deserted wife.  It is unfortunate that we must call her deserted, but this is what she is <Col N="1279" /> technically.</P>
    <P>There are well-defined factors which contribute to the majority of desertions in the lower social group.  We are not here dealing with the well-off man who disappears from the scene.  His wife will be reasonably well catered for and she will not look for social welfare benefits.  In this Bill we seek to secure sufficient money for the housewife under 50 years who has been left with two, three or four children or a dependent child under 18 years, so that she can provide enough food, fuel and accommodation to keep herself and her children.  At the same time, we would like to see other Bills introduced to provide the family unit, incomplete as it is, with sufficient health and educational facilities.  These are in process of being drafted, I am quite sure.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife factor is the newest element in this Bill.  We should tread cautiously in this matter.  We are not trying to be social workers here.  We are not trying to re-unite the family. What we are trying to do is to see that the disunited family is kept alive and can buy sufficient food.  How effective is this Bill under the present system?  I am speaking for the Dublin area with which I am familiar.  I am quite sure the same system prevails in other areas.  A deserted wife with three or four children, living in a corporation house in a Dublin area, can obtain £6 per week from the home assistance officer, and a medical card and free schooling.  With her deserted wife's allowance and her children's allowances her income goes up to £6 5s I think. I am subject to correction on that. The point is that her income will not be appreciably more than she is receiving from the home assistance officer.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see in this Bill that the burden of maintaining this family unit will be taken off the ratepayer. The Bill does not refer to home assistance being taken over by the Central Fund.  Home assistance is still the burden of the local authority.  Because of that, this is perhaps an inadequate way for the Department of Social Welfare to direct the health and public assistance authorities.  Home assistance is administered by the health <Col N="1280" /> and public assistance authorities, subject to the general direction and control of the Minister for Social Welfare. There is no mention in the Bill of &ldquo;subject to a grant or payment by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife is now being taken off the home assistance and catered for financially through the Central Fund by the Minister.  This is a nominal change.  However, we are taking the burden off the rates.  Not many people will claim this deserted wife's allowance because of the stigma involved. Therefore, it is nominal, but it is a step in the right direction.  It is unfortunate that this Bill does not include a provision for the payment of home assistance by the Department.  It is unfortunate that although it is administered by the Department it is not paid by the Department.</P>
    <P>Abuses can occur in the payment of home assistance, as I mentioned here a few weeks ago.  Because of the qualifying system, people can drive up in large cars and claim home assistance. The only qualified person I know who could drive up in a car and claim home assistance is a taxi driver who would need the car to earn his living. I do not think this abuse is confined to the Dublin area.  The abuse of home assistance is widespread.  If the Department took over the financing of home assistance they would have a more direct interest in its administration and allocation.  At the moment the Department are not interested in it.</P>
    <P>An increased number of people in our community will be qualifying for social welfare benefits.  I do not think we are catering properly for this increase. I do not think we are taking these statistics into account, or even referring to them.  I have already mentioned the decrease in peri-natal deaths which has resulted in an increase in mentally defective children.  Secondly I referred to the massive maternity mortality rate which we have and, as more children are born into the family, this mortality rate increases.  The number of defective children, without reference to the maternity mortality rate, being born into the community is also increasing.  When the mother dies there is a psychological effect on the <Col N="1281" /> family.  Then there are the autistic children, and related diseases or defects, which result in an increase in social welfare recipients.  When the husband or wife disappears from the family unit, once again there is a further aggravation of the situation.</P>
    <P>Road traffic accidents and home accidents are increasing.  More people are being invalided and qualifying for social welfare benefits.  With the increase in our industrial employment there is an increase in industrial accidents and associated things like industrial dermatitis.  Therefore, the burden on the Department of Social Welfare is increasing.  We must remember that the average life span now is close to 70 years.  With the improvement in conditions in the world &mdash; which are not in any way attributable to Fianna Fáil but are reflected improvements which this country has gained over the past 15 years &mdash; longevity has been one of the results.  Whereas 100 years ago the average life span was 40 years and people worked approximately 70 hours a week, now people are living to 70 years and working an average of 40 hours per week.  The number of old people &mdash; the seventh stage of life, as William Shakespeare described it &mdash; is increasing, and this section too will be claiming social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a concerted effort made by the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health, which are closely allied, to come to grips with this problem, some planning done for the future instead of trying to close the door, as we are doing here, when the horse has bolted. The question of deserted wives was neglected for years.  What will be achieved with this grant, which does not appreciably improve the situation of the deserted wife?  How can we prove that she was in fact deserted? Where does the proof lie?  Where is the hard and fast line?  How much of the private details of her life must she disclose to the authorities before she can claim this allowance?  To what humiliation must she submit?  Will she always bear the stigma of being a deserted wife if she draws this allowance? Are we going to compile a register of deserted wives?  We are now <Col N="1282" /> only guessing at the number of deserted wives in the country.  This is not particularly important because not all deserted wives will come forward to claim this allowance.</P>
    <P>If there is a family with a small income in a working class area, the husband, perhaps, working in England, as often happens and sending back £8 or £9 a week or less to keep the family over here, are we going to encourage him by this provision even nominally to desert the wife and sneak in and out of the house?  Suppose he has genuinely deserted the wife but because she is getting, if she has three or four children, £6 or £7 in children's allowances and deserted wife allowance, shall we encourage the husband to come back or encourage the wife to welcome him back?  There must have been factors of stress and strain there originally which resulted in the husband disappearing.  I should like to see some reference in this debate to efforts being made to recoup this money small as it is, in cases where we know where the husband is living in Britain, the US, Canada, Australia or New Zealand or wherever the popular places are for husbands to go when they desert.  If the husband can be traced I should like to see some effort made to have the money recouped to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I know of a few cases where husbands are working in England and quite well off with very good jobs but they have completely neglected their families here.  The authorities know where they are but there is no way in which the money can be recovered from these people.  While I am open to correction on the figure of £6 5s for a deserted wife with three or four children, compared with the £6 which she gets from the home assistance under the Dublin Health Authority, in any event I do not think it will put much more money into her pocket.  Perhaps it will lessen the strain of collecting the money.  Perhaps, once she has endured the initial stigma of having to disclose private details of her life, she can then go on collecting until she reaches the age of 50, with one qualified child or until she reaches 70.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill makes clear when or how often checks will be <Col N="1283" /> made to see if the wife is deserted or is back with her husband.  Personally, I like to see social welfare benefits introduced but I do not like abuse of any of these benefits.  Unfortunately, when you give something for nothing as a so-called State benefit, people look upon it as a right and use many devious means to obtain this money. I do not know what type of check or deterrent the Department have in mind for the prevention of abuses. When the Minister is replying I should like to hear what he has in mind, because I think a good deterrent would prevent abuse of the scheme and lead to the moneys being properly distributed. A new section of the population are being officially recognised as being an underprivileged section and are being labelled as such.  We should be aware in introducing this, although it could have been introduced long ago, that, as with all new allowances, there are ways of getting around the rules and regulations in order to abuse the scheme.  Since the qualifications and conditions of proof do not seem to be clearly defined, I think we should keep our ears to the grounds for the first year or two of the administration of this scheme so that we can make sure that all loopholes are properly sealed up and that only those for whom the money is intended will actually get it.</P>
    <P>We are catering in this Bill for old sores, so to speak, increasing benefits which we knew were necessary, and we are catering for sections of the population which we know existed even 20 years ago as real underprivileged sections but we are not budgeting&mdash; and this is the most disappointing part of the Bill &mdash; for the increase in the number of people who will become eligible to draw social welfare benefits. I should like to see the Minister for Social Welfare and Ministers for other Departments associated with social welfare, whether physical or mental, directing their Departments to investigate the sectors that I have mentioned, to investigate the massive increase we are witnessing and which has not yet come to the surface.  I do not think it has been catered for in other countries but then they would not have <Col N="1284" /> the same problem as we have.  An investigation should be carried out.  We know the number of epileptics has increased fantastically, that the number of old people has increased and the number of mentally defectives has increased in our population.  However, there is no mention of this in the explanatory memorandum or in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have to be amended in many ways and should involve other Departments.  I should like to offer here a solution which has been carried out in the Netherlands.  We welcome longevity of life and the decrease in our peri-natal dath rate, so we should be prepared to cater for social welfare beneficiaries and to plan for them before they devour the moneys allocated for them under this Bill.  In the Netherlands a system has been introduced under which one trade has been designated for handicapped persons in receipt of social welfare benefit.  In one case the shoe industry has been so designated and all the shoes made are made only by people who would qualify to draw social welfare benefit by virtue of the fact that they are disabled but who are well enough to contribute to the economy and feel they are useful citizens.</P>

There again the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot, of his own accord, bring in legislation which would put aside one section of our industry for handicapped persons who are unable to find employment in industry.  Because the cost of the insurance necessary to cover the factory plant would be too great, these people are debarred from employment and are covered by social welfare.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has a responsibility to encourage people to find employment, to increase the social welfare benefits paid to them, benefits which we in this party feel are totally inadequate at the moment, and to see that these people are encouraged to contribute to the economy.  I have mentioned the example of the Netherlands where the shoe industry has been set aside.  In this country we have a great tradition in handcrafts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to digress from the Bill.  I should like to see included in this Bill a provision whereby medically handicapped persons in receipt of social welfare benefit, who would be able to work, could retain all or portion of the social welfare benefit allowed to them if they find employment up to a certain stage, and then that could be gone into.  They should be encouraged to find employment of one form or another and not be totally dependent on the State, because this ruins their outlook and their spirit. Nobody wants to live on handouts. There may be a few exceptions.  It is not good enough to fill people with food.  We must see they are as happy as they can be and have peace of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lethargic approach by the Department in this regard.  I do not think the Department have even considered it.  It is certainly not mentioned in this Bill and it should be mentioned in it.  The Department of Social Welfare should go even further and include in this Bill grants to voluntary organisations for the training of people who are drawing these benefits. This would be part of the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  This is not mentioned in the Bill either, and without such a provision <Col N="1286" /> it is not a complete Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to another section of the Bill, that dealing with the death grant.  The death grant has been introduced and it will be payable on the death of an insured person or the wife or husband of an insured person, provided the contribution conditions are fulfilled.  This is not an adequate death grant, but I am glad to see it introduced. The Government have not acted here early enough because they have been afraid of pressure from insurance companies who have gone around and extracted weekly payments from people who were afraid that if a child or other relative died the family would have the terrible stigma of not being able to afford private burial but would have to bring the remains to one of the cemeteries for burial in a mass public grave.  The organisations who provide these graves are providing a good service, but I do not think it is the responsibility of these organisations to transfer the cost of burial from those who cannot afford it to those who can afford to pay a little more.  The Department of Social Welfare should give a realistic grant which will cover the cost of a reasonably decent funeral. It is bad enough in the city of Dublin but what is it like in rural areas where everyone knows that so-and-so cannot afford to bury a child and has to apply for the death grant?</P>
    <P>The grant should be a realistic one. The Department should conduct an inquiry into the cost of funerals, what the minimum requirements will cost. Many families in the community cannot afford the cost of a funeral.  Any type of decent cortége is not within their means and the grant is not bringing it within their means.  There is no provision at present for a number of small things which mean a great deal and provision for which would relieve much hardship, such as the erection of a headstone and other normal practices in our civilisation.  All the grant does is provide for the grave to be opened, the body to be put in and covered with clay.  It is as primitive as that.  No effort is made to alleviate the anguish and stress caused to the family.  While the death grant is a good thing it is not adequate.</P>
    <P>In regard to old age pensions the <Col N="1287" /> means test can be a frightening thing for many people.  Many people have complained to me that they give a great deal of information and then afterwards, when they have left the room, forget what they have said and are frightened.  The file is taken away, put in a secret place and they never have access to it.  They have given out information and have signed on the dotted line but because of their age or one thing or another, they forget what they have said to the investigation officer.  These people should be given a carbon copy of what they have said to the officer.  We do not want to see these people being frightened, we do not want to see a means test which will frighten them.  The provision of a carbon copy will not cost anything and it will ease the mind of these people.  Those who do not immediately forget what they have said will have forgotten it within a couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to section 35 and to the offices which are under the administration of the Department. Many of these offices are dirty little rooms which are not suitable for the purpose of interviews.  Many of them are not sound proof and people do not have the secrecy which we would like them to have.  Once we are providing these services and this amount of money we should see that the offices are reasonably well equipped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to section 35 of the Bill.  In the general adminstration of the allocation of these benefits we should try to do away with the agents who were appointed under the 1932 Act.  If we did away with the local agents and replaced them we would have greater efficiency. The local agents are purely political appointees, so to speak.  They are set up by the Minister's Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer then to the adminstration of the allocation of these benefits to qualified persons. When they are allocating the death grants, the invalidity pensions, the retirement pension, the old age pension, the deserted wife allowance and the increased children's allowance the Department should have a less rigid screening.  The feeling around the country is that for some time now the Act has been prostituted in a certain fashion by the appointment of certain people.  These grants have to be administered by somebody.  They have to be handed out by somebody.</P>
      <P>We have the case of the old age pensioner who goes to the office and he may meet the man who is taking his particulars in a dirty old office.  A form has to be filled up and I have asked that a carbon copy be given to the applicant.  It is important that when this man goes in to collect his pension he will know that the man with whom he is dealing is not somebdy who has been politically appointed.  Otherwise the efficiency of the system will be diminished.  The local agent in charge of home assistance can sublet the premises.  To my mind these people are not suitably qualified people for the investigation of means and this is where I think the scheme will fail. If a home assistance officer who is appointed for some area in rural Ireland can sublet his premises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We all know of cases where husbands, wives, nieces and nephews hold all the posts of home assistance officers down to pensions officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to take into consideration the inefficiency of the present system.  There is a section in this Bill which deals with retirement pensions.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare was reported in the newspapers last summer as saying that he would shortly be introducing a Bill that would give a retirement pension to all people at the age of 65.  In this Bill there is provision that a person on reaching the age of 65 years shall be entitled to a retirement pension if he satisfies the relevant contribution conditions.  However, the Act is restrictive in that there are conditions attached in regard to contributions.  Although it might be difficult to administer, I should like to see the Minister preparing a scheme whereby people who retire will get some form of pension.  Fine Gael have always advocated that the old age pension be £5 per week and that it be given at the age of 65 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did and I agree that it was a worthwhile proposal.  In fact, I was very disappointed to see that it is not included in this Bill.  However, when our party are given a mandate by the people we will introduce the old age pension at 65 and Deputy Geoghegan's promise will be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the allowance of £2 15s per week given to the &ldquo;prescribed female relative&rdquo; of old people unable to care for themselves, I would emphasise that this sum is not adequate to provide the care necessary. The geriatric homes in this country <Col N="1290" /> are crowded to capacity and the meagre sum provided in this instance will not help to alleviate the situation.  Old people are living on their own in tenement conditions in Dublin and throughout the country and they are dying slow deaths because they are unable to buy proper food for themselves or to prepare the food.  We have not the necessary legislation that would enable a countrywide scheme of meals on wheels, which service is in operation in certain parts of the country. Had financial provision been made for such a scheme the wellbeing of many old people would be improved.</P>
    <P>Widowed pensioners aged 70 years and over who are incapacitated are entitled to an increase of £2 15s.  Ten years ago this sum would have meant something but at the rate the cost of living is going up today it is totally inadequate.  Old people are in receipt of certain nominal benefits, such as free turf, free electricity, free transport and free television and radio licences.  What relevance have these free benefits?  Some of these people are too crippled with disease to light a fire, some are deaf and cannot hear the radio, some suffer from defective vision and cannot see the television and others are either unable to travel or have no where to travel to.  The free electricity is the only good scheme.  The people who travel in Dublin city under this scheme are those who have been shifted from the centre of the city to the ghetto of Ballymun.  They travel back to the city centre to recapture the comradeship and friendship which they had there.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister for Social Welfare to list the free schemes available, but how many of them are used?  I believe they are there purely and simply for political motives, so that when someone knocks at a door looking for a vote and the old age pensioners say, &ldquo;You have done nothing for us.  We old age pensioners have been neglected.  We helped to found the State; we were here when times were rough.&rdquo;  The person looking for the vote is then able to list the free schemes available.  To a deaf, blind, arthritic old age pensioner none of these free schemes means anything. I do not know how the Government <Col N="1291" /> have the audacity to apply to join the Common Market because our social welfare benefits are dragging well behind those given in the Community, particularly in relation to the care of the aged.  No attempt has been made to provide any statistical information as to how many people need this type of care and allowance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, referred to the position regarding deserted wives, but the provisions of this Bill will not make any great contribution to that particular section of the community.  I appealed in the Minister's absence for careful surveillance of the administration of this section of the Bill in the first year in order to avoid abuses arising out of the necessarily vague way in which it is drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to the Minister, now that he is back in the House, that I should like to see careful surveillance of the administration of this section of the Bill during its first year of operation so that abuses do not arise.  We do not want to see every second housewife who is a member of a local Fianna Fáil cumann collecting this hand-out every week.  We know what happened in regard to the Rock of Cashel recently. We must ensure that appointments are made in a proper fashion so that we can put an end to the prostitution of the 1932 Social Welfare Act, whereby every assistance officer in the country is a Fianna Fáil hack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome what money is being given under the Bill for the care of the aged I should like to see much more money being spent here.  If the Minister were to investigate how much it costs to keep a person in an institution he would see the wisdom of this party's policy of providing for the care <Col N="1292" /> of the aged in their homes and by their own families instead of making them a financial burden on the State and making them unhappy for the rest of their lives.  The percentage of the population, especially on the western seaboard, represented by the older age group is on the increase.  Homes for the aged are bursting at the seams, and yet insufficient allowance is made to encourage relatives to keep old people at home.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the age limit for childrens' allowances has been increased. I believe these allowances should be made available to everybody. I was disappointed to see in the report of the Commission on Army Pay published today that an extension of children's allowances has not been provided for privates and NCOs.  The payment of social welfare benefits should be non-discriminatory so far as the lower ranks in the Army are concerned. The Minister knows that, if an officer in the Army furnishes a certificate showing that his son is attending full-time school, he can go on drawing children's allowances over and above the age limit, but this privilege is denied to NCOs and privates.  I intend to table a special amendment later on to see that this injustice to the troops is rectified.</P>

      <P>The other point I should like to refer to, without delaying the House too long, is that there are many sections in this Bill which provide benefits &ldquo;if a man is such an age and satisfies the insurance contributions&rdquo;.  The age should not be so important here. People by virtue of unemployment or illness or inability to control their own position may not have made the full contributions.  In conclusion, I should like to say that the old age pension age should be reduced from 70 years to 65 years without further delay, as advocated in the Just Society policy document of this party.  The promises made last summer by the Parliamentary Secretary, and reported in the papers, that retirement benefits would be given at 65 years, have not been honoured.  If the Government would accept the superior policies of the Fine Gael Party and implement them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to say that amendments to this Bill will be put down.  We are totally dissatisfied with it and with the amounts being given to the needy sections of the population. We are disatisfied that there is no tangible, logical approach being made to cater for the underprivileged sections of the population.  We are completely dissatisfied with the old age pensions allowance contained in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to speak rationally, having listened to the previous speaker.  I have been listening to him for over half an hour.  Being an older man and longer in the House, and having a certain amount of sympathy for newcomers, I will do my best to refrain from alluding in any way to the remarks the Deputy made.</P>
      <P>We in this House are all agreed, no matter to which party we belong, that we would wish to see the social services increased and the benefits given to as many of our people as possible. It is seldom we hear realistic comments about where the money is to come from.  It is not the duty of this House, while they may point out and be as critical as they like about certain sections which may be overlooked or about people who may not be getting their fair share, to minimise what has been done or what is being done.  The fact is that we will spend an estimated £70 million on social welfare in this year as compared with £42 million in 1966-67.  To my mind that means progress, in spite of the fact that the money may be of less value than it was then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are taking for this purpose a much bigger slice of the national cake than we used and we are increasing each year the amount taken. Whether it is being spent in the best possible way is certainly open to discussion. When one hears people advocating old age pensions at 65 years we know that everyone would wish that this would happen &mdash; except, perhaps, people who are 65 years of age and who are working and feeling that they are now in the prime of life and would not like to be regarded as old age pensioners.  Most people would agree that it would be a good thing for <Col N="1296" /> the country if we could afford to give pensions at 65 years.  Is it more desirable to give pensions at 65 years than to spend the same amount of money on increasing the amounts of money being given to those of 70 years of age who are the present recipients?</P>
    <P>The last speaker spoke of old age pensioners as if they were all arthritic, deaf, blind and unable to enjoy television or even light a fire &mdash; whatever that had to do with free electricity I do not know&mdash;but the Deputy felt they were so arthritic they would not enjoy anything.  He inferred that the whole rush was to get them out to vote, but if they are as blind and as deaf as he makes out, I do not think they would be of any great advantage as voters to the parties, either.</P>
    <P>However, the matter must be considered in relation to what we can afford to spend and in relation to where the money is to come from.  We know, of course, that people in general do not object to paying an extra shilling or two if it will mean a little extra in the contribution to widows, orphans or those who are sick.  We give credit for that but, at the same time, let me say that when an extra shilling is added to the social welfare contribution of the working man, the employers complain that it adds to their costs.  The employees may not complain at the time but as soon as there is an increase in wages, the basis for the claim is the take home pay packet and not the gross amount.  Therefore, I do not think that anybody can claim they really pay extra money by way of taxation, directly or indirectly, so as to keep social welfare recipients in as good circumstances as we would wish them to be.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has been in public life, who has served on a local authority, will be aware that at every meeting there are proposals for increases in salaries, wages, pensions, office equipment and so on.  As a rule, these are granted without much comment but when the day of reckoning comes and the rate is being struck, these increases have to be taken into account.  Very often, a month or so later the parish priest or local doctor will lead a deputation to the authority demanding some <Col N="1297" /> new or extended services and so the same procedure goes on from year to year.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is a matter with which we are all concerned because the recipients are people who are not able to fend for themselves and who cannot get as much out of life as the average person.  Many changes in respect of social welfare have been made in recent years.  It is only within the past decade that the contributory old age pension was introduced.  Before then there was the iniquitous system whereby a person who contributed a few shillings a week to a superannuation fund and who may never have missed a day at work could find himself at the age of 70 not being eligible for the old age pension by virtue of the fact that what he was receiving, as a result of his superannuation scheme which might be augmented by his employer, would amount to more than the statutory amount specified in determining eligibility for the old age pension.  On the other hand, a person who might never have done an honest day's work and who might even have been in and out of jail at the taxpayers' expense, would receive the old age pension at 70.</P>
    <P>The reason for that situation was simply that we could not afford to give a contributory old age pension but that has now been changed and the introduction of such a pension is an indication that we are now more affluent than we were ten years ago.  The other benefits that are now granted to pensioners such as free fuel, free television licence and free travel are, to my mind, of greater value to those people than money.  I know of many people living away from Dublin who can come to the city to see their sons and daughters who have been in business in Dublin for many years.  If it were not for the free travel facilities, they would not be able to come.  At this time of the year, also, they can take a bus to the seaside or elsewhere. This is of great personal benefit to them.  In spite of what the previous speaker said, these benefits are greatly appreciated and I am glad to say that recently when I met visitors from across the water they were very impressed by these benefits and said that <Col N="1298" /> when everything was taken into account, there was no great difference in the circumstances of old age pensioners here and in England.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point where I wish to say a few words to those who have been comparing our social welfare benefits with the benefits that are payable in Britain, in the USA and in West Germany.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but as Deputy Dr. O'Donovan knows, in the world today we are among the upper ten in relation to our standard of living.  There are countless numbers of people who are very much worse off than we but, of course, great care is taken not to compare them with us.  Rather, we are compared with the wealthiest nations in the world &mdash; those highly-industrialised nations who have had self-government for centuries.  At this stage, I do not propose talking to the &ldquo;just society&rdquo; people about their own record in so far as old age pensions are concerned but I would advise my young friend who spoke before me that he should look at their history in the past in this regard rather than talk about what should be done.  If his party ever get into power &mdash; I am sure that some day they will have a say in the government of the country &mdash; I hope that at that time it will be possible for them to do what he visualises should be done.  However, there is an unreality if one cannot say from where the money will come for all the services that are advocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is in relation to persons who, as a result of being absent from work through illness, have been drawing benefit but who, after a certain length of time, are sent for medical examination to the Department's doctor.  That doctor may say that the person is fit for work at that time although he has a medical certificate from his own doctor certifying that he is not fit for work.  The point I am making is that in such case the benefit is discontinued.  The person may appeal <Col N="1299" /> but sometimes a considerable time elapses before the appeal is heard and, consequently, before payment can be resumed if the person is still unfit for work and the appeal is upheld.  I wonder if it would impose any great hardship on the Department to give the recipient the benefit of the doubt and to continue payment until the appeal is decided?  In most cases that I know of, it would be much easier for the State to bear the loss rather than the person concerned because the discontinuance of benefit often imposes great hardship on one who is entirely dependent on social welfare benefits.  I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to that matter.  It is my opinion that, as well as alleviating hardship, this would expedite a decision.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the officers of the Department with whom I deal in the city and county of Cork.  I find them by and large most sympathetic in their dealings with the public and in their anxiety to stretch the regulations as far as they can.  There are exceptions and there are times when like most human beings they become a bit exasperated but I think on investigation we can find that one of the usual reasons is that a certain type of person is trying to get something to which he is not entitled.  Of course that makes it harder for the legitimate claimant when he comes to the counter.  I feel, however, that they are people who are very often the butt of remarks hastily made by members of the public and by public representatives.  My own personal experience is that they behave very well towards the public.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Department on the new provisions, following those I have mentioned, the deserted wife allowance and the burial grants, which are a sign that the Department are not asleep.  They are doing their best to make progress and they have nothing to be ashamed of with regard to the money they have spent over the past ten years.  I hope in the next ten years we will show the same rate of progress.  I hope when we are asked to give more money towards social welfare benefits we will be prepared to <Col N="1300" /> make sacrifices so that the less well-off people will benefit.  The ordinary worker, the industrial employee, will realise that the less well-off section of the community are entitled to those benefits and that we are judged as a Christian nation by the amount we give them and with the willingness with which we give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the last Deputy on the succinctness of his speech and the limited amount of time he took.  He referred to the previous speaker and said he listened for half an hour to him.  I listened to him for an hour and 40 minutes and I cannot say that I was greatly enlightened.  The trouble was I could not hear him for most of the time and I am sure that is true for the rest of the people in the House also.</P>
      <P>This Bill, of course, is the great angle of this year's Budget just as the turnover tax is the depreciatory part of this year's Budget.  I got some trade union information for the month of April, 1970 and this shows that in the year 1966 we spent £22 per head of the population on social welfare.  The next lowest country in western Europe, since we are in the upper ten, was Italy, who spent £58.  We hear a lot of talk about the amount of money spent by Britain but all they were spending was £77 per head of the population, although of course this probably does not include the health services.  I suppose the health services in England cost an enormous sum per head of the population.  Certainly in this country the figure I gave included the health services at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Germany, as one would expect from the long history of social welfare in that country, are top of the league.  In 1966, they spent £103 per head of the population.  It does not matter that we have increased the allowances since because they have been increased in those other countries also.  We are well at the bottom of the league.  Italy spent more than two and a half times per head what we spent and Britain spent three and a half times.  I remember during the 1950s there was a great deal of talk here about the welfare State across the water and how objectionable that was.  From the way Deputy <Col N="1301" /> Healy spoke I suspect he would be one of the people who would say that they are going to blazes in Britain, that they are going down the mine and all the rest of it.  Of course, they are trotting after the Common Market countries. All I can say is if we go into the Common Market, which God forbid, there is one thing quite certain which is that our approach to social welfare will have to be quite different.  It might be the only thing which will come out of the Common Market if by any accident we get in.</P>
    <P>There is no point in my pretending that there are not some good things in this Bill.  Apart from the provisions for deserted wives the Bill is modest enough.  In many cases the amount given will not cover the increase in the cost of living.  In fact, for a period of three to six months the unfortunate recipients of social welfare will be worse off because turnover tax was doubled in May and prices went up by at least 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I always advocated giving an allowance to old age pensioners living alone although I never succeeded in getting the message across.  I was told if there was a separate rate for old pensioners living alone some of our rural people would put their fathers and mothers living in an outhouse in order that they might qualify for this extra payment.  I am not accepting that this is true.  I have more belief in the kindness of our people than to swallow that argument.</P>
    <P>I want to concentrate on the children's allowances angle of this Bill. The reason I want to do this is that I find even widows, who are probably the next worse treated, can speak up for themselves by comparison with children in large families.  As I said before in this House I do not know who the social idiot was who decided that an allowance should be granted for the first child.  Deputy Cunningham, the Parliamentary Secretary, raised this point with me the other day and said we are better than England in this regard.  We give only 10s a month, which is about 2s 4d a week and only 4d a day.  This would not feed a cat or a dog.  It would barely feed a canary.  This is the great contribution <Col N="1302" /> of the Fianna Fáil Party to children's allowances in this country.  If that £1.8 million were given to the children in families larger than four it would do one thousand times as much good.</P>
    <P>I have seen the conditions in large families and they are appalling.  There is no use in Deputy Healy talking about our being in the upper ten. There are people as badly off in this country as there are in any country in the world.  I am against giving an allowance for the first child.  As I said before, people who have no children generally have either a cat or a dog so that they will have some living creature around the place.  Subsidising the first child is absolutely wrong.  It is a philosophy that stinks in my nostrils.  It is a typical example of &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;.  If this party ever has any say in Government that money, and a great deal more as well, will be transferred to the bigger families.</P>
    <P>The increase given last year was given only because the election was looming up.  The allowances had been stationary for seven or eight years. This year the allowance is being increased for the third and subsequent child from £2 a month to £2 5s a month.  All other social welfare benefits are written in in terms of weeks.  We are told there is an increase of 5s in children's allowances &mdash; 5s a month, which is about 10d a week.  Fianna Fáil are always quoting examples of people who get an increase of 10d a week.  Here we have an increase of 10d a week in children's allowances this year.  It would be much better if this sort of thing did not happen at all.</P>
    <P>This costs the best part of £2 million a year.  There are large families in dire straits; I will not say they are starving, but they find it virtually impossible to provide adequately for their children.  How can a boy or girl under our system of education remain at school after 14 years of age when there are no proper children's allowances? The bourgeois taxpayer gets an income tax allowance for his children so long as they are attending school or university. After the age of 16 the child of the lowly-paid worker does not qualify for relief.  What I notice about <Col N="1303" /> the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party is they look after those who are incapable of working at all and they do nothing for the lowly-paid worker except put a bigger burden on him. Only a few days ago I read a letter in the <i>Evening Herald</i> in which a young lad said he had done his intermediate certificate but could not go on and do his leaving certificate because the family income was only £10 a week. We all know there are such cases.  The age was increased in the case of widows with children, but it has not been increased generally.  Admittedly this is an improvement.  Let us be frank about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across a case recently which illustrates the difference in treatment. The father of a family of 11 children was earning £16 a week and, for income tax purposes, he wanted to transfer two or three of the children to his <Col N="1304" /> eldest son who, although only 17 years of age, was earning £20 a week and paying £5 income tax.  I saw the letter from the Revenue Commissioners: they said no boy could be regarded as adopting a couple of children while his father was still alive.  I do not like that kind of thing.  The ordinary income taxpayer gets £150 relief if he is earning less than £2,000 a year.  This works out at about £40 a year which is £13 a year more than the children's allowances, which stop at 16 years of age.  Where the father is earning more than £2,000 he gets £52 relief a year, which is £1 per week.  Where he is in the surtax bracket the allowance is £75 a year.  In other words, the concession become bigger and bigger the better off the parents are.  In my opinion, this is the reverse of a proper system of public financing and a proper system of social welfare.</P>
    <P>One asks oneself why are children's allowances stated as so much per month?  They have been so stated ever since the famous change in 1952 when they were paid a month in advance prior to three by-elections.  The Fianna Fáil Party were in grave difficulties. Ever since then children's allowances have been quoted at a monthly rate. The reason is, of course, that they were so derisory no party could stand up to them being quoted per week.  Our children's allowances compare most unfavourably with other countries. They are half the rate in Britain.  I pointed this out on the Budget and the Parliamentary Secretary from north-east Donegal interrupted and said there was no allowance for the first child in Britain.  Our children's allowances are half what they are in France and Italy.</P>
    <P>We can prate as much as we like about how fond we are of children but I do not believe we are one bit fond of children.  I think we hate children the same as we hate the poor in this country.  It would bring tears to one's eyes to see how we treat children and the conditions in which large families have to live.  I worked with the St. Vincent de Paul Society for about ten years when I was young and it would make one ill to see the conditions then obtaining.  I did that work in desperate times and, were it not for that experience, <Col N="1305" /> I could not now witness present conditions without having to spend a day in bed to recover from the spectacle.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about certain aspects of the non-contributory pension and to refer to section 36 in particular.  Ever since the word &ldquo;nil&rdquo; was put in the total relief to old age pensioners, instead of &ldquo;£26 5s&rdquo;, all kinds of anomalies have arisen.  If it would be in order I would put down an amendment to take out of that section 36 the piece of it that is within brackets &ldquo;(excluding any plot provided therewith)&rdquo;.  It is an improvement that &ldquo;the cottage&rdquo; is being taken out and we must express our appreciation of what the Government have done here.</P>
    <P>The new rate of old age pension will be £4 5s.  Take the old age pensioner who lives in a vested cottage, with the usual plot of one acre with these old labourers' cottages, as they were called, the valuation of which would be £1 in any of the good land counties.  This valuation means that the old age pensioner will lose 5s a week.  Therefore, there is no change in their position just because they have a piece of land which is intended as a garden.  The obvious answer is that, instead of &ldquo;nil&rdquo; which was inserted under the 1966 Act, I think, to put in £26 5s as the minimum rate &mdash; in other words, that a person whose means did not exceed £26 5s would get the maximum old age pension and that a sum like 10s a week would be regarded as a kind of &ldquo;tuille&rdquo;, something that people would not expect to be mulcted for having.</P>
    <P>I do not speak about children's allowances in the way I do for any political reason.  I have a conviction that the present system is all wrong philosophically and practically and in every other way.  I do not know who was responsible for it.  If the Minister wants to make a worthwhile contribution in his new post as Minister for Social Welfare he should take out the first child &mdash; the £6 a year is worthless, anyway &mdash; and transfer the moneys to the really big families which are becoming fewer and fewer.</P>

This has been referred to many times.  I admit that not many Deputies have attempted to put forward a comprehensive alternative system to replace in every particular our present patchwork system.

      <P>This Bill should have incorporated the whole system of home assistance and disabled persons maintenance allowances and other systems which are at present administered by the Department of Health so that there would be a comprehensive system which would cover all people.  Mention was made some time ago of the introduction of a system of flat rate benefits.  As reported as column 709 of the Official Report, Deputy Boland, then Minister for Social Welfare, speaking on the Estimate for his Department on 19th March last, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it is time to depart from the system of flat rate benefits. <Col N="1307" /> It has been announced that the Government intend to introduce a system of pay-related benefits and contributions.</P>
    <P>It is open to us to advocate that such a system of pay-related benefits should have been incorporated in this Bill.  I had expected that the announcement would have been put into effect in this Bill.  The introduction of a system of pay-related benefits and pay-related contributions, as distinct from flat rate benefits and flat rate contributions, is something we would possibly have to do in the EEC because all the EEC countries have a pay-related system and we have merely a flat rate system.</P>
    <P>There are a number of advantages in a pay-related system.  First of all, it is a guarantee against inflation in that, as pay goes up, so do contributions and benefits; whereas at present increases in social insurance benefits are purely at the whim of the Government and are not immediately and concretely related to increases in pay, which are usually related to the cost of living.  I feel that if benefits were on this pay-related basis the recipients would be protected to some extent against the erosion of inflation.</P>
    <P>There is an additional benefit to be considered and it is that people who are at work and earning a certain amount enter into long-term expenses appropriate to their standard of living. If they are at work and earning quite a considerable amount and then suddenly find themselves through disability or for some other reason out of work, under a flat rate system the fall is much steeper; whereas if the benefit were pay-related the drop would not be so great.  In this context there is something to be said in favour of a pay-related system because people do enter into long-term expenses: buying certain items by instalments, starting off their children in a type of education which may involve greater expense.  Under a pay-related system they would be able to continue these expenses without great disruption because the benefits they would be receiving would be related to what they had been earning previously and on the basis of which they had decided to undertake these expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> On the other hand, there are certain disadvantages in this proposal which are worth mentioning.  First of all, it involves to some extent moving away from the concept of social welfare provisions acting as an instrument for redressing an imbalance in the distribution of income in the community in that people who are earning more will get more from social welfare when they are not earning and people who are earning less will get less.  This in a way perpetuates, during the period when these people are out of work and relying on social welfare, the divisions of income in the community and, to some extent, involves a moving away from the principle that social welfare should be used as a method of equalising income distribution within the community.</P>
    <P>It is also true that it would be to some extent regressive.  Under this system the people who earn more get more, and that is regressive.  I have not a very definite conviction as to whether we should have a pay-related system of benefits and contributions.  This is something which needs to be considered in much greater depth.  There is a considerable degree of urgency in this because of the fact that we may be entering the EEC in the near future and we would need to do some very hard thinking on both the benefits and the disadvantages of a pay-related system.</P>
    <P>Social expenditure in this country as a proportion of our gross national product, if the figures I have are correct, is six per cent whereas all the EEC countries and Britain spend in the region of 13 to 16 per cent of their gross national product on social welfare. These figures would seem to indicate that we are spending less than half the amount on social welfare than other countries are.  This, on the face of it, looks very bad, although we must qualify it to some extent by pointing out that the State contribution to social welfare here is much greater proportionately than the State contribution in other European countries in that much more of the schemes there are financed by employers' and employees' contributions than in the case here.  For example, the State contribution to <Col N="1309" /> social welfare in general here is about 66 per cent of the cost, whereas in the EEC countries it is somewhere ranging from 7 to 22 per cent.  This is something we must say to qualify the bald use of these figures.</P>
    <P>It is something to consider that the State has taken overall responsibility, even if it does not pay for it all itself, for a much greater amount of social expenditure in the European countries than is the case here.  Many of the schemes which are undertaken under the State umbrella by the EEC countries are financed by private insurance schemes here.  We should consider whether we should extend our field of State-directed social expenditure to the level which obtains in the EEC countries, because this would ensure that these social expenditures were directed towards maximising the community welfare and were not merely administered by private schemes as is probably the case here.</P>
    <P>There is another question which has not been considered and it is that of selectivity in social welfare services: the question of whether or not these services should be given only to those who are in great need &mdash; this obviously necessitates a means test to be applied &mdash; or whether they should be given to all members of the community.  The obvious advantages in selectivity are that it minimises cost and it is a more progressive system in that whatever money is there is being spent on the least well-off and is not being wasted on people who can provide for themselves. On the other hand, means tests involve a certain incursion on people's dignity and can result in certain anomalies in that these means tests, which are devised by human beings, are never perfect: people can fail to get what they are entitled to or, on the other hand, get benefits to which they are not entitled and which they would not get if the system was perfect.</P>
    <P>This whole question of selectivity is one of the fundamental issues in relation to social welfare which has never been considered in this country on anything like a broad basis.  We have always been introducing schemes here and there of a patch-work nature which <Col N="1310" /> are largely selective but sometimes are not.  There has been no fundamental thinking as to whether selectivity in this field is or is not desirable.  This is one of the questions on which fundamental thinking has unfortunately been lacking in our whole approach to social welfare.</P>

      <P>The Third Programme for Economic and Social Development sets out, in Chapter 14, the special measures initiated by the Government for western development &mdash; based on more intensive farming in economic units and the development of non-farm sources of employment in industry, tourism, forestry and fishing. With the aid of the special regional development fund a significant amount of employment and income has been guaranteed in worthwhile economic projects which could not be helped otherwise.  Commitments from the fund, which exceed £1 million to date, include the provision of assistance to small farmer and handcraft cooperatives, local airports, miscellaneous tourist projects and small fishing harbours.  As part of the plan &mdash; announced in the Budget &mdash; to attract industrial projects suitable for location in the smaller western towns, a programme is being worked out to provide prefabricated buildings for small local industries in their early stages.</P>
      <P>The wide variety of measures which constitute the Government's agricultural policy, and which are expanded as circumstances demand, make special provision for smaller farmers.</P>

    <P>In the current volume of Estimates for Public Services, there is an increase of over 50 per cent in the total provisions <Col N="1311" /> for improvement schemes in the Gaeltacht and capital expenditure by Gaeltarra Éireann.  The industries for which Gaeltarra Éireann has authorised financial assistance in the past few years are expected to provide wholetime employment for over 1,000 workers when in full operation.  The Industrial Development Authority, in their industrial grants scheme, apply a differential &mdash; 60 per cent of fixed assets as against 45 per cent elsewhere &mdash; in favour of designated areas which include the counties on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Of the total of 147 new hotels opened in the country in the past five years, 89 were located in the 13 western counties, involving an estimated employment content of 3,000 persons.  Nine resorts and areas, on or adjacent to the western seaboard, have been selected by Bord Fáilte for development under the major resort development scheme whereby grants are given towards development work subject to a minimum local contribution of 20 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development the Government outlined the ways in which they hoped to bring about the development of an incomes policy which would be based, so far as possible, on voluntary co-operation.  They indicated their hope that the Government's role, so far as negotiations relating to incomes were concerned, would be confined in large measure to providing an appropriate institutional framework and supplying economic guidance, while leaving the parties directly concerned the maximum freedom to determine their own affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> The NIEC report on incomes and prices policy restated the principles on which incomes policy should be based and made certain specific proposals.  It was publicly welcomed by the Government as a most important report.  The Government took immediate steps to bring about the major institutional innovation recommended &mdash; the setting up of the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>A voluntary incomes policy presupposes a willingness by those involved in negotiating income increases to work out together a pattern of increases which will help the country's economic growth, assist in slowing down price rises and protect the weaker sections of the community.  As the NIEC itself has stated, new institutional arrangements of themselves will not solve the problem of inflation.  If, however, the new arrangements are whole-heartedly supported by all concerned, then I am confident that it will be possible through them to work out a policy which will be in the common interest of our people.  I am not convinced that a voluntary policy is beyond our capabilities.  It is essential that no time be lost in putting such a policy into effect.</P>

I do not say agreement will not emerge but why erect the dwelling houses first and then begin talking to the applicants? Would it not be considered that the siting of the dwelling houses in relation to each other should first be sorted out in consultation with the people who were to be put on the farms and that the houses should not be erected before they had any say in it?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the circumstances in which the levy provisions of the UK minimum import price system for eggs and egg products might be applied to Irish egg exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Exporters of eggs in shell require licences under the Agricultural and Fishery Products (Regulation of Export) Act, 1947 (Export of Eggs) Order, 1952 and licences for exports to Northern Ireland are granted where the applicant declares that the export price is not less than the relevant UK minimum import price.  Any person furnishing false or misleading information for the purpose of obtaining a licence is liable to prosecution and on conviction to a fine not exceeding £100. There is no export trade in liquid or dried whole egg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exporter named informed my Department on 2nd July that the position was as stated by the Deputy. However, other regular exporters of eggs to Northern Ireland were able to meet the minimum price requirements <Col N="1327" /> and got licences for a greater total quantity than last year.</P>
    <P>In my reply to the Deputy's question on 18th June I indicated that as a result of discussions between the British and Irish Governments in the context of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement the general levy provisions under the UK minimum import price system do not apply to eggs imported from Ireland and that no levy could be applied to Irish egg exports unless they were supplied below the UK minimum import price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The last two sentences of the Minister's reply seem to be contradictory. He said first of all that the levy does not apply and then he said the levy will not apply unless imports are below the minimum price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy a question to put?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clear up that apparent contradiction? Would the Minister not agree that, from the case I have mentioned and which he conceded is true, this minimum import price system for eggs is interfering with free trade in eggs and that this particular exporter, and probably a number of other exporters, could not export eggs to the United Kingdom at the price asked because of the minimum import price system?  Is this not something that should be taken up by the Minister in negotiations in relation to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement?  We are now regressing as regards free trade in eggs.  There was free trade in eggs some time ago, but now there is this discriminatory arrangement which prevents the free export of eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not discriminatory&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except in this regard, that our exports must not be supplied at a price below the minimum import price.  I think it is in this regard the person named in the Deputy's question got into difficulties.  Other exporters who complied with this regulation <Col N="1328" /> had no trouble at all in disposing of greater quantities of eggs this year than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that an offer was made to him below the minimum import price by the Northern Ireland importer?  The initiative did not come from him at all. The offer was made and he could not accept it because of the minimum import price.  Is that not the case?  Would the Minister also explain to me about this levy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>He got a bad offer for a number of reasons, because there were greater supplies on the Six County home market this year than last year, a smaller tourist trade and so on.  He evidently did not pursue the matter further.  The offer he got was a bad one, but whether it was the only offer he got&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not in a position, therefore, to supply the Deputy with the detailed information he seeks, but I may add that a national dressing campaign will be feasible only on the same basis as previous national campaigns, with farmers agreeing to pay the cost of treatment and my Department giving all possible help in the organisation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The ultimate objective obviously is to eliminate warble fly but as I said to the Deputy on that occasion this will require a constant annual dressing I would think.

    <P>The total amount of the grants paid to the firm in Clonmel, to which the Deputy refers, was £5,750.  I am concerned at the situation which has arisen locally as a result of the closure of this firm.  As the firm were operating at a loss they cannot be expected to restart production.

The commissioner assures me that no reduction in strength is effected until he is fully satisfied that no loss of police efficiency in the area will result.  Increased mobility and more efficient radio and telephone communications networks have helped to make this possible.</P>

      <P>Crime figures are compiled in respect of the year ended 30th September and for Garda divisions rather than individual counties as such.  Accordingly, the figures asked for could be obtained only by a disproportionate amount of research.</P>
      <P>The total number of indictable crimes known to the Garda in the years ended 30th September, 1960, and 30th September, 1969, in respect of the Garda division of Longford/Westmeath are as follows: 1960, 234; 1969, 561.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the apparent connection between the reduction in gardaí numbers and the startling rise in crime should lead to a re-examination of the policy of taking gardaí away from rural Ireland?  Does the Minister not agree that it is necessary to step up recruitment to compensate for that policy and for the reduction of the hours worked by gardaí?</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that Rathcormac Garda Station is on the main Cork/Dublin road but it is on the main Fermoy/Cork City road. Only two gardaí have been working there for the last three months.  This area includes the Castlelyons co-operative creamery which has been the object of many robberies over the last few years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Traffic accident statistics are now compiled and published by An Foras Forbartha and any question relating to them should in future be addressed to the Minister for Local Government.  I am, however, informed that the figures for 1969 are not yet quite ready for publication but that mechanically propelled vehicles were involved in approximately 390 out of a total of 438 fatal road accidents.</P>
      <P>Figures for prosecutions and convictions are not available in the form sought.  The available statistics are published in the annual report of the commissioner, Garda Síochána, on crime, which relates to the year ended 30th September.  The report for the year ended 30th September, 1969, was published recently and, as usual, has been placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, however, state for the information of the House that the general picture is that, of those drivers who survive fatal accidents, the evidence justifies a prosecution for manslaughter or dangerous driving in only about one case in every six and that, of those so prosecuted, slightly more than three-quarters are acquitted of the charge brought against them.  Put in another way, only about one driver out of every 26 who survive a fatal accident is convicted <Col N="1346" /> of manslaughter or dangerous driving.  I should, perhaps, make it quite clear that the standard of proof required to sustain a charge of this nature is effectively set by juries, as most of these cases are jury cases.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1970: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters which, as I said, require fundamental thinking almost on a philosophical level in regard to social welfare.  These are, firstly, the question of the principle of selectivity in the allocation of social welfare services&mdash;this applies also to health services&mdash;and, secondly, the principle of choosing between our present flat-rate system of contributions and benefits and the pay-related system which applies in the EEC countries and with which we are likely to be asked to conform if we enter EEC. It is by no means certain that in every respect a pay-related system is necessarily better than our system. This is something that we should not accept blindly simply because we are entering EEC.  We should examine the whole question and determine for ourselves whether it is better to have a pay-related or a flat-rate system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have not indicated publicly that they have done any fundamental thinking on this.  They seem to accept the idea of a pay-related system simply because it is the case in the EEC and we want to conform with that.  I have not got a closed mind on that.  It may well <Col N="1369" /> prove that a pay-related system is better but we need a bit more discussion on the implications of it, the implications of the preservation of existing differentials in regard to the distribution of income which might occur under a pay-related system and the idea of a flat-rate which brings everybody to the same level.  We should examine both systems.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of the three waiting days in respect of which people are not paid at the moment in regard to disability and unemployment benefit. When a person becomes unemployed or is unable to work through illness he is not paid in respect of the first three days he is out of work.  The reasoning behind this is to prevent people staying out of work for very short periods for possibly frivolous motives.  The thinking is that people who stay out of work for more than three days are obviously seriously ill or their unemployment is of a sufficiently permanent nature to warrant their being paid. There is a case for retrospective payment in respect of those three days. In other words, if a person is out of work for more than 12 days he should be paid not only for the last nine of those 12 days, as he is at the moment, but also in respect of all the days he is out of work, that is, for the full 12 days.  The former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Boland, agreed with this point when he said at column 710 of Volume 245 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>I can see a case for retrospective payments for the first three days of illness in the case of more prolonged illnesses.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the present Minister for Social Welfare holds this view also.  If he does is it proposed to introduce legislation to implement this point of view in relation to the waiting days?</P>
    <P>There is another point which should be considered and that is the question of relating social welfare increases to the cost of living index.  Very often the increases which are introduced in this House are lauded as real improvements in the standard of living of the <Col N="1370" /> people on whom they are conferred. In many cases they are but to some extent this is mitigated by the fact that the cost of living has risen so substantially that many of the benefits are eroded.  There should be an automatic increase, at possibly yearly intervals, in all social welfare benefits corresponding to the increase in the cost of living over that period.  The cost of living could decrease over this period and this would mean that the benefits could conceivably be decreased.  If this were to happen on an automatic basis the Minister if he introduced an increase over and above this automatic increase based on the cost of living, would be seen to give a real increase in the standard of living of those people.</P>
    <P>We should clearly distinguish between increases which merely compensate for increases in the cost of living and increases which involve a real improvement in the standard of living.  If we had benefits tied to the cost of living there would be a proof against benefits being used as electoral carrots for getting votes, in other words that the criteria for deciding whether an increase takes place could possibly be the political position of the Government and not the welfare needs of the people.</P>
    <P>There has been a rather regrettable element in the approach of the Government to the whole social welfare system.  There has been a tendency on the part of Government speakers in this and other debates repeatedly to refer back to what the Opposition parties were alleged to have done or not to have done when they were in Government.  This sort of historical bone-raking makes no contribution whatever to the improvement of the position of the social welfare classes. A classic example of this attack is revealed in something which the former Minister for Social Welfare said at column 701 of Volume 245 of the Official Report on the Estimate for Social Welfare:</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies mentioned unemployment assistance on this occasion although when in office this was a service that might never have existed because it was never increased by them.  Largely because <Col N="1371" /> of that, it is still the lowest of all our social welfare services.</P>
    <P>In other words, largely because the Opposition parties when in office 13 years ago had not increased the benefits, they had not come up to standard since.  Something which happened 13 years ago surely is not the main reason why unemployment assistance is lower than other assistance.  The Minister had 13 years since the Opposition parties were in office to do something about bringing unemployment assistance up to standard.  Yet, last March he was able to say that it was largely because the Opposition parties who were in Government prior to 1957 had not increased unemployment assistance, this benefit was behind the other benefits. This surely is a rather false attitude on the part of the Government?  They had 13 years to do something about the level of unemployment assistance, so they cannot blame their failure to do anything about it on what happened 13 or 14 years ago when the Opposition parties were in Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to the payment of family allowances, I should like to endorse wholeheartedly the attitude adopted by Deputy O'Donovan when he spoke here earlier.  In the field of family allowances we will have to harmonise our payments with those in the EEC if we enter that Community.  Germany prior to entering the EEC had no system of family allowances but because she entered the Community where family allowances were paid in the other five countries she found it necessary to introduce a system of family allowances also.  This is a good example that a country as big as Germany had to harmonise her social welfare system in respect of family allowances with that of other EEC partners.  We will also have to harmonise our social welfare allowances with those of the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>In this context this will involve a very substantial increase in the level of family allowances at present being paid.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy O'Donovan that there is need for a dramatic increase in children's allowances. Large families have been neglected and there has been an <Col N="1372" /> emphasis, as the Deputy said, on helping people only when they are out of work and not helping the lowly-paid with large families.</P>
    <P>If equal pay for equal work is introduced here the breadwinner of a family who is normally the father, will be earning the same as a single woman doing the same work.  There will be need to compensate for this by increasing children's allowances.  There is a strong case for increasing children's allowances much more substantially and for computing the allowances on a weekly rather than a monthly basis so that comparisons can easily be made with other social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>In relation to death grants, the Minister said that this scheme will make a grant of £25 payable on the death of an insured person or the husband, wife widow or widower of an insured person, £15 on the death of an insured person's qualified child aged between five and 18 years, and £5 on the death of a younger qualified child.  I cannot understand why there should be this differentiation between children under five and children over five.  I should have thought it more logical to pay the same for all children.  The sense of loss and the expense involved would be just as great in the case of a child under five as in the case of a child over five.  I should like some further information on this from the Minister.  Why is some system similar to this not extended to those who are not insured, small farmers and so on?  Why should not they have the death grant made available to them?  Why is it confined to those who are insured?  Again, could the Minister not make this retroactive? Why should it not apply in the case of deaths occurring before the end of March, 1971?  Why is it not possible from the point of view of contribution conditions to make the scheme retroactive?</P>
    <P>The invalidity pension will be payable to insured persons who are, or become, permanently incapable of work and whose insurance satisfies the contribution conditions.  These conditions are that not fewer than 156 contributions have been paid and not less than 48 contributions have been paid or credited in the most recent contribution year.  This seems a somewhat unnecessarily <Col N="1373" /> stringent requirement.  Those with less than 156 contributions will not get all they should get.  There is a strong case for reducing this to 100 contributions. Those who have been working for less than three years should qualify for many of these benefits.  The benefits should not be confined to those who have worked for over three years.</P>
    <P>There is this new invalidity pension for those who are insured.  What similar service is there for those who are not insured, those in the assistance classes? There is a disabled person's maintenance allowance but it is administered by the Department of Health.  There may be people who might not qualify for a disabled person's maintenance allowance who would, if they were insured, qualify for disability benefit. Because they are not insured they qualify for nothing and they have to fall back on home assistance.</P>

    <P>The report on the care of the aged was published recently.  Income maintenance comes within the ambit of the Minister for Social Welfare.  There are some recommendations in the report which have not so far been implemented and I should like to have the Minister's <Col N="1374" /> viewpoint on them.  There is a rather telling sentence here:</P>
    <P>That these payments do not in many cases so provide is evident from the fact that old age pensions, for example, are being supplemented by home assistance in a considerable number of cases&mdash;some 3,500 at present&mdash; although home assistance should be a short-term payment to tide a person over a temporary need rather than a way of life.</P>
    <P>This is a very harsh judgment on our social assistance and social insurance schemes.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The committee recognises, therefore, that in addition to the payments under the joint scheme of pensions, benefit and assistance, supplements should be paid to meet the exceptional difficulties experienced by certain poor aged persons in providing the basic needs of housing, heating, lighting and cooking.</P>
    <P>I should like to have the Minister's view in regard to the supplements.  Is it proposed to accept the recommendation or will it be shelved?  In paragraph 43 of the report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but not chapter 4.  The committee further state that if administratively possible, payment should be associated with whatever form of benefit or pension is in payment by the Department of Social Welfare rather than as a separate sort of scheme which would enable them to avail of something free.  I am not committed to the recommendations of the report in this respect but I should like the Minister's comment on them. Paragraph 45 concerns needy persons in the age group 65 to 70 who would fall outside the scope of this arrangement. I realise that, in respect of insured persons between 65 and 70, the Minister is introducing retirement benefit but he is not introducing anything to meet the recommendation here in <Col N="1376" /> respect of persons who are not insured &mdash;those who would be relying on the non-contributory old age pension when they reach 70 years of age.  There is nothing for them when they reach 65. In Northern Ireland, women at 60 qualify for the old age pension and men qualify for it at 65.  Here, a person does not qualify for the non-contributory old age pension until 70. What does the Minister propose to do in relation to paragraph 45 of the report on the care of the aged?  This report was produced at public expense and I should like the Minister to comment on those recommendations publicly.</P>
      <P>This brings me to retirement benefit which, again, becomes effective from 1st October next.  Why is this concession confined to insured persons? What about persons in the assistance classes who would qualify for non-contributory old age pension?  Why is the age for them not brought down to 65?  Why was it possible merely to bring down the age of the contributory old age pensioner to 65?  Why was it necessary to introduce a separate scheme calling it &ldquo;retirement benefit&rdquo;? Why could the age not be brought down to 65 for the non-contributory old age pensioner without introducing a new scheme?  There may be a good reason.  I should like to hear it.</P>
      <P>The assistance classes appear to be left behind in favour of the insured classes.  The Irish population structure is such that there are more people in the assistance classes&mdash;self-employed persons, small farmers, and so on.  The benefits going to insured persons under this Bill will not be extended to persons in the assistance classes who are not insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill relates to assistance. This is the supplement on the old age pension which is paid to an incapacitated old age or widowed pensioner aged 70 or over who requires full-time care and attention given by a prescribed female relative and who would otherwise be living alone.  There is a case here to extend this where, for example, an old person goes to live with her married daughter who has maybe a very large family and who is working in insurable employment. <Col N="1377" /> When she goes to live with the family this necessitates, in many cases, that the wife will leave her employment to look after the old age pensioner.  At the present time, unless the two of them are living alone, with nobody else in the house, as far as I can see they do not qualify for the increase in the old age pension.  Where it can be demonstrated that the prescribed female relative had to leave employment in order to look after the old age pensioner, I submit that the increase should be given even if the two of them are not living alone in the house.  This should be extended.  It is a good idea.  It takes account of the practicalities of looking after an old person but it is unduly restrictive as at present envisaged.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assistance scheme for deserted wives, I would refer to one point at which the conditions for a widow's pension are not adhered to, namely, where the allowance will not be paid if the deserted wife is under 50 years and has no qualified children. I do not see why it was necessary to depart from the conditions for widow's pension in this case.  The economic positions of a widow under 50 and of a deserted wife under 50, without any qualified children, are exactly the same, so why discriminate against the deserted wife?  If one bears in mind the fact that she is under the age of 50 years and has no qualifying children, it is possible that at some stage she did have qualified children but that these children grew up to an age at which they became unqualified; but her whole employment opportunities might have been disrupted because she had to look after the child while it was a qualified child and when it reached the age at which it was no longer qualified she had spent too much time at home, away from work, that she would be unable to acquire any useful and gainful employment.  I feel that there is no justification at all in this case for not paying the benefits to a deserted wife just the same as if she were a widow. I cannot see the reason for this discrimination at all.</P>
    <P>There is another rather ambiguous thing here in relation to the regulations <Col N="1378" /> which will be drawn up in regard to defining a deserted wife.  I should like to quote a sentence from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>I do not think that there can be desertion in the sense we are seeking to deal with, if the husband is contributing in any way towards the maintenance of the family.</P>
    <P>Literally that means that if he was giving one shilling a week the Minister would not envisage giving benefit.  I know the Minister did not mean it in the absolutely literal sense but this sentence reveals a rather incorrect attitude. It is possible that the husband could be contributing in some minimal way and there would still be a case for giving this benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>She could be living with him and getting nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow that but I do not think it answers my point.  Let us say the husband has deserted the wife and he was contributing a minimal amount taking the sentence in the Minister's brief literally he would not consider giving any payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would take that into the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not contained in the sentence I quoted but I am glad to get that assurance.</P>
      <P>I quote again from the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for persons in urban and rural areas are being increased by 10s 6d a week for the recipient making the maximum rate £3 12s for a single person and £6 8s for a married couple living in an urban area.  Outside urban areas the corresponding rates will be £3 6s for a single person and £6 for a married couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the reason for discriminating in favour of urban areas in this context.  I should like the Minister to explain why this differentiation was originally introduced.  People who are unemployed in rural areas in many cases will have more expenses than people who are unemployed in city <Col N="1379" /> areas.  It is fairly well known that the cost of necessaries in supermarkets is often somewhat less than the cost of necessaries in small grocery establishments down the country on which people in rural areas would have to rely.  In regard to the purchase of necessaries it is likely that the cost of living for an unemployed person in a rural area would be greater than the cost of living for an unemployed person in the city who can rely on supermarkets. In regard to transport also, the unemployed person in a country area is more likely to have to involve himself in heavy transport costs than the person in the city where everything is within a mile or so walking distance and transport costs might not be necessary.  I cannot see why unemployed people in a rural area should get less than unemployed people in a city area.  Housing, admittedly, is likely to be more expensive in an urban area but I should like to know if this differentiation has been analysed recently in the light of modern conditions and if the Minister is still satisfied that it is necessary to discriminate in this way against people who are living in rural areas and are unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister in regard to children's allowances says:</P>
    <P>The rate for the first and second qualified child will remain unchanged. As announced in the Budget statement, adjustments of the tax free allowances under the income tax code in respect of the third and subsequent child in families will offset the increases in the rates of children's allowances for families which are liable for income tax.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has raised this question of allowances under the income tax code, it appears to me that taking them as part of the whole system of family allowances they are to some extent regressive in that the more tax one is paying the more allowance one gets.  In other words, the more one is earning the more allowance one gets. This is a regressive form of children's allowance through taxes and I should like to have at least considered and analysed whether it is meritorious that the people who are earning large <Col N="1380" /> amounts of money and have children get much larger allowances in absolute terms than people who are earning very little and paying consequently not as much tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the staff of the Department of Social Welfare who are in a Department which in the context of public administration and particularly the administration of our social security system are in a very vulnerable and open position generally.  I make that comment because I share the concern which Deputy Tully expressed about some of the undue carping and the snide, unfair and unjust criticism which is made from time to time by public representatives and more particularly by those who seem to set themselves up as the conscience of citizens in relation to their transactions with the Department.  I in no way condone any sloppiness, undue delays or bureaucratic trappings which on occasion, and I would stress on very rare occasions, may surround some individual cases which arise within the Department.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy Tully.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is not propitious for Deputies to be critical of our communications media on a purely political reaction basis, but I must comment on some of the alleged expert interventionist action style comments made by one of the correspondents of a Dublin evening newspaper.  I do not know whether he is a member of the NUJ. I must confess that I found some of the comments were of such a nature that they put the public officials in the Department who were in communication with them in the dock.  They are not in a position to reply, or respond to what I regard as extremely personal and extremely unfair comments on individual problems which arise.  I want to put that on record because this is my view.  The Minister might contact the correspondent and try to get fairness and impartiality in dealing with complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A citizen may lose his insurance number or his employer may be negligent in that regard.  A citizen may fail to convey sufficient information to the <Col N="1381" /> Department or an officer of the Department may&mdash;and this does happen&mdash; lose a file.  These things happen and I do not think any citizen should be unduly servile or humble in his approach to the Department looking for his rights.  These are rights which any citizen has in relation to our social security system.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a greater measure of public education, public awareness and public involvement in the administration of our system of social security.  I want to stress this. While one may be critical, and rightly so, of some alleged expert intervention between citizens and the Department, in some respects the Department can be blamed for that kind of development. There is an appalling lack of initiative on the part of the Government. This is primarily a ministerial responsibility rather than the responsibility of the administrative staff.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers have failed, grossly and abysmally and disgracefully, to inform the public on a repetitive, day to day, coherent basis, using the communication media, as to what their precise entitlements were and as to the immense complexities as they must appear to many citizens in relation to their entitlements.  They should also explain to citizens why, in given circumstances, they are not entitled to benefits.  If this were done, a great deal of the burden of the work, the quite unnecessary messenger boy burden of work, which falls on public representatives would be removed.  We would give a better return to the taxpayers for the salaries we receive if we dealt with the legislative and regulatory aspects rather than driving ourselves, our constituents and the officers of the Department around the bend trying to resolve individual problems on an <i>ad nauseam</i> and perpetual basis.  That is not to say that a Member of this House does not perform a valuable and essential function by dealing with questions which are brought to his notice by his constituents.</P>
    <P>All our communications media should be used to inform the public. Even an elementary thing like a decent poster issued by the Department outlining entitlements to benefits and the <Col N="1382" /> way to look for those benefits would be helpful.  The forms which citizens have to complete in order to qualify should be simplified.  If this were done the public would have a higher regard for our Department of Social Welfare or, as I prefer to call it, the Department of social security.  Much more remains to be achieved before we can claim that we have a humane and effective system of social security in operation in the State.</P>
    <P>Having made those comments, may I now pass on to some of the aspects which the Minister dealt with introducing the Bill.  I strongly welcome many of the innovations proposed by the Minister and proposed in the Budget. This is a matter I have raised before. There are a number of serious anomalies with which the Minister has, as yet, failed to come to grips.  I do not know what kind of rabbit-like fixation, one might say, the Government and the Department seem to have developed in relation to the current social insurance limit of £1,200.  With the rocketing of wage increases in a relative sense compared with five or ten years ago and compared with the date when the social insurance limit was fixed this figure is out-dated.  Was it discussed seriously within the Department? Admittedly, there was a political unheaval and I am sure the former Minister had a lot on his mind besides the elementary matter of the social insurance limit of £1,200.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister comes to grips with this problem and increases dramatically the social insurance limit there is a distinct possibility that the whole infrastructure of the social security system will go out of plumb.  I would strongly urge the Minister to devote himself exclusively to this problem between now and the autumn when the Dáil will be resuming.  He should concentrate on bringing in amended regulations and applying them as speedily as possible.  I must confess to the Minister and to the House that I am in contact with many trade unionists and I am aware of the inevitable complaints about the blocking off of social insurance benefits when the limit is reached.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, people can opt for the voluntary health insurance scheme. <Col N="1383" /> I opted for it when my salary went over £1,200.  Unless the Minister gets down to bringing in amending legislation we will find ourselves in dire straits when the 1971 Bill comes before the House.  That is on the assumption that this House still exists in 1971 in its present political form.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, welcome the many innovations in the scheme itself.  The outstanding innovation, in terms of humanity and of Christian recognition that Christian marriages can become very unchristian depending on the people concerned, is that relating to deserted wives.  I commend the Minister's very courageous effort to have the regulations under this new scheme defined.  I fear one can only recommend to the Minister some social research on this matter: I doubt very much if Members have sufficient expertise and competence and public experience to be able to give the Minister very much advice in respect of the definition regulations in respect of deserted wives.  There is need for some urgent social research either within his Department or by the Economic and Social Research Institute on a short-term contract basis.  Undoubtedly, the Minister could receive far more elaborate and I think more objective criteria in that way than he seems to be groping towards in relation to his statement to this House.</P>
    <P>I find myself rather at a loss whether to agree or disagree with the Minister in regard to his statement that there is a point at which the conditions for a widow's pension are not adhered to and that is where the allowance will not be paid if the deserted wife is under the age of 50 and has no qualified children.  I do not know how one reaches that arbitary age limit.  The Minister goes on to say that the minimum age limit of 50 has been imposed to meet the situation and that it has been decided that it should also cover elderly deserted wives without dependent children, whose children have grown up and who, because of age and other factors, find it difficult to get employment.  Even in draft form &mdash;this may sound highly unusual&mdash; I think the Minister might circulate to Members of the House the regulations <Col N="1384" /> he proposes.  He said these had not yet been finalised and that he has a fairly open mind at this stage as to what the definition of desertion should be for the purposes of the scheme.  It might be useful if the Minister sent us the Department's internal views on an open basis and obtained the views of the House on the regulations, not necessarily in debate.  We could forward our views to the Minister and I think this would be a useful social exchange of views in regard to an intricate aspect of our social security system which could improve considerably the position in regard to regulations.</P>
    <P>Again, I find very considerable difficulty in giving any assistance to the Minister particularly in respect of what he calls permanent desertion.  I virtually defy anybody, apart from an arbitrary assessment by a social welfare officer or local inquiry agent, to define the concept of permanence in relation to desertion.  This is an area in which the Minister could find himself in all sorts of difficulties at local and national level.  That is all I propose to say on this matter except that I accept the statement of the Minister that it is an extremely difficult and very delicate question and one in which, as far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we shall give the Minister whatever little assistance or knowledge or awareness we may have in regard to particular questions by way of instances or case studies which all Deputies of the House have had.  I think that at least in the mid 1970s we shall get away from the utter humiliation of people approaching Members of the House in confidence about deserted wives and families and Members being obliged, again in confidence, to approach local home assistance officers and obtain an allowance for a deserted wife.  This is accompanied by all the emotional stress imposed on a deserted wife.  It is to the credit of the nation that at least we have evolved this system but it is also to our eternal discredit that it has taken the best part of 60 years even to recognise the need for the introduction of a scheme for deserted wives.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the <Col N="1385" /> Minister&mdash;I support Deputy Bruton in this regard&mdash;that not only should he raise the limit of £1,200 at present operating but he should also bear in mind that he has now, by increasing the contribution rates effective from 5th October, 1970, built in a further imbalance into our social security system.  I am quite well aware that Deputies have repeatedly demanded the introduction of a wage-related, graduated system of social security contributions and wage-related benefits in the normal western European pattern. I find that one is, perhaps, beating one's head against a very cold and inflexible wall.  Deputy Boland rarely smiled but when he did it was quite helpful and he did smile and assured us occasionally that this matter was the subject of immediate, thorough and very definite consideration by the Department, apart from implications relating to the health sector and the inter-twining of the £1,200 limit and the wage related system and that, by and large, he hoped to have progress to report before bringing the 1970 Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Here we are again now with a situation in which an employee from 5th October will be paying 15s 2d per week, a substantial increase for any employee from 12s 6d, the rate at present operating.  That employee will be paying on a flat rate basis and it is no joke.  It is no consolation to an Irish industrial worker, as I pointed out in the EEC debate, that I should go out to Dún Laoghaire and speak to an average wage earner in my constituency earning between £18 and £22 a week and say to him: &ldquo;For you it will be 15s 2d a week.&rdquo; It will mean a deduction of that amount of money from many of them who are earning as little as £15 a week.  This is a substantial social insurance deduction. Somebody earning £1,195 per week also pays 15s 2d.  There is a big difference between those in the lowest income group and those just under the £1,200 limit.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if this Dáil were to do nothing else during its lifetime than to revise the social insurance limit with all its implications for local government and for the health services, and <Col N="1386" /> to introduce a wage-related system of contributions, together with the other innovation of the deserted wives' allowance, it would be doing something of major importance.</P>
    <P>I raise this point because the contributions required for a stamp valued at 30s 6d, as it will be from next October, without being wage-related, present quite a temptation to employers and workers to avoid the payment of that substantial sum, the current amount being 25s 1d a week as against 30s 6d.  It is highly undesirable and not in the public interest that the Deputies should have to raise perpetually in this House a growing number of questions relating to the failure of employers or of employees to ensure that insurance cards are fully stamped.</P>
    <P>Only last Saturday morning in the constituency I represent, Dún Laoghaire, I met a construction worker who when he applied to the Department for benefit received the reply that the last insurance card received in that office was in 1954 and was, therefore, not entitled to payment or to credits.  I have come across quite a few such instances. I am aware of the statutory powers of the Department in that regard and of the legal entitlement of an employee whose insurance card is not properly stamped.  Particular vigilance should be exercised in this regard by industrial workers, especially those in casual employment, those in the construction industry, in hotels and the catering industry, in casual transport employment, in the distributive trades or employed in personal service industries.  The Department should, by way of public advertisement or television statement and so on, warn employees to ensure their insurance cards are properly stamped. Equally, the Department should be quite ruthless in dealing with employers or employees who, in collusion with an employer&mdash;this can equally happen&mdash;fail to fulfil their statutory obligations in relation to social insurance.</P>

      <P>I do not know what is the precise number of insured persons in the State&mdash;about 750,000, I would say&mdash;but even if there is only 0.5 per cent&mdash;and I am sure it is even less than that&mdash;falsification and failure to stamp cards, this is a matter which should be given urgent attention by the Minister.  One can hazard a guess that there are about 96,000 people employed in the construction industry, and it is not an unfair assessment that there are several thousand construction workers, whether they are on the &ldquo;lump&rdquo; or employers themselves, who are not preoccupied with social insurance contribution.  They are certainly not acting in the public interest. Instead of having perpetual wrangles in the House with the Minister in relation to this matter and instead of having particular files opened up when Deputies bring individual cases before his Department a more <Col N="1388" /> effective preventative system should be brought into operation.  In that regard legislation should be substantially improved, and I was aware of Deputy Boland's intimation to this House that he intended to introduce more stringent regulations and that, if he had any opportunity to do so, he would implement them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the innovation introduced by the Minister in relation to contributory old age pensions for those aged 65 and upwards, but it covers only about one-third of the people enjoying old age pensions.  I can understand the reason why the Minister has confined the scheme to those of the contributory group, that it would cost a substantial sum to extend it to the non-contributory group.  One must consider the implications involved here and the fact that from 5th October next people will have to pay 3s 6d for an insurance stamp.  I should like to see an analysis of the 120,000 non-contributory pensioners in terms of their occupations and the regions in which they live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this matter because it is important that we make sure that sufficient practitioners will be available to implement the new Health Act.  With this in mind the question was tabled to find out if accurate research had been carried out by the Department to ascertain the number of general practitioners who would be available.  From the reply and from the supplementaries that followed it would appear as if the Department are not fully informed about the availability of general practitioners, particularly in rural areas.  Prior to this question being tabled, a number of questions were tabled which related to dispensary appointments in rural areas, particularly along the western seaboard, to find out which positions <Col N="1389" /> were vacant, which were permanent appointments and which were of a temporary nature.  Figures for these were not available.  It would appear, therefore, that no accurate figures are available regarding the number of general practitioners who are in active practice at present.  I do not think this can be disputed.  The latest figures available to the Minister were for 1966 so that when the Act comes to be implemented the figures will be well over five years old.</P>
      <P>Recent reports have come to light through different medical organisations which show that the same number of doctors are not entering the general practitioner field now as ten years ago.  It is of the utmost importance that we should know, when implementing this Health Act, the number of doctors who can be called on and the degree of activity which each doctor can give.  The figure here is for 1,300 active general practitioner's in 1966 and in my opinion it is not reliable enough because from the Minister's reply there does not appear to be any statistical solidarity for the figure.  It appears to have been obtained as a result of a routine spot survey of some sort by two doctors. The Minister stated that there were probably only 12 fewer doctors in 1969 than in 1966.  We have to remember that doctors are not entering general practice in the numbers they were some years ago.  As well as that, in regard to the 1,300 general practitioners mentioned there are different degrees of activity for each general practitioner.  This is very important because some practitioners provide a 24-hour, seven days a week service, others a five-day week service, while others would be working on a month on month off basis, where they would be in semi-retirement.  Other doctors would be doing occasional locum surgeries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know, therefore, the number of fully active general practitioners who would be available for the health services.  That is in relation to the whole country but in the rural areas we do not know what the number of registered general practitioners is. Dublin city, Dublin county and areas adjacent to large urban complexes will <Col N="1390" /> be catered for reasonably well in regard to general medical services under the new Act but it must be remembered that the most important section will be the front line troops, who will be the patients and the practitioners.  If the scheme cracks up at this level, then it will be a failure. In many areas the new health service will not be implemented.  A couple of weeks ago, in reply to a question by me, the Minister said that he hoped to introduce the choice of doctor scheme on the 1st April next.  I contest this. I do not think the Minister is in a position to promise a choice of doctor service in rural areas.  I do not think that the Department have carried out sufficient research into the number of vacancies, the population, or the number of doctors per head of the population in the more remote areas.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to institute, between now and April, a register of general practitioners which could then be compiled annually.  This would serve three functions.  It would give us immediately the number of doctors in active general practice.  It would give us the number of doctors who are writing prescriptions and in this way would combat what the Minister referred to before, the forging of general practitioner prescriptions.  Thirdly, it would form the basis for accurate statistics in the future.  There is no doubt that we will have great difficulty getting doctors into the remote areas for different reasons.  There are many factors involved.  One is that it is very difficult to get a settled general practitioner to pull up his roots and plant them in another part of the country. As well as that, the social amenities in these areas, as well as the emigration, are not attractive.  When people emigrate from one part of the country it is difficult to get other people to replace them.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have a pool of general practitioners available in order to operate the health services.  Bearing this in mind and also the recent figures produced by some universities that certain students, potential doctors, have not been able to obtain places in medical schools, I would call on the Minister to introduce a State grant or scholarship which would enable suitably <Col N="1391" /> qualified students who had passed their pre-medical examination to enter medical school and proceed with their medical studies immediately.  Then on completion of these studies and their immediate post-graduate training they would be in a position to give back approximately three years to the State practising in outlying areas.  This would serve two purposes.  A student would receive the medical training he and his family desire and he would then be of great service to the country, repaying the cost of his education by working for two years after he became fully qualified.  This is a system which has already been operated by other people. This system is carried out in this country by an organisation from Great Britain that recruits students here in their second medical year.  The organisation pay the fees and give a living allowance to the student who must in return give five years service to that organisation.  The organisation recruit approximately 50 students per year, most of them being Irish.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a lack of communication between the universities in this country, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Health as regards medical education.  I would ask the Minister for Health to set up a committee to carry out an investigation as regards the logistics that would be necessary for the implementation of the health service in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has said that we are producing too many doctors.  However, there are very many areas throughout the country where there is no dispensary service available or any service available for persons in the lower income group.  I have put down questions to the Minister asking for information regard the number of dispensary posts, permanent and temporary, in Counties Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Sligo and Leitrim, to name but a few places.  The Minister did not answer my query.  However, the figures are available in some form to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The percentage of medical card holders in the country is 30, and in some counties that have not got full dispensary appointments the figure <Col N="1392" /> goes as high as 40.  The number of persons who will qualify for medical services under this Health Act but who will not have the services of a doctor will be very high.  The Minister should instruct the officials in his Department to investigate the number of students entering medical school, the number qualifying and the number who enter general practice, plus the number of areas in the country where there will not be a choice of doctor.  When those figures are available the Minister will be in a position to consider the advisability of a State grant or scholarship which I have suggested to him and which I believe is the answer to the problem that is facing his Department.</P>
    <P>This problem is indeed great.  The Minister is introducing a Health Act and while, statistically, he has sufficient doctors there are not enough doctors in the country areas.  I have come here not merely to criticise the Minister but to offer a solution and what I have suggested has worked successfully for organisations outside this country who have been able to recruit doctors from the universities.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that choice of doctor to replace the dispensary doctor is unrealistic because the manpower is not available and we must consider some way of rectifying this matter.  If we are producing a sufficient number of doctors, why are they not going to practices in rural areas?  It is possibly that the conditions offered are not attractive enough, particularly where the doctor has a family and must consider the matter of education for his children, and also the fact that the post can be terminated after one year or 18 months will not entice a doctor to accept those posts.</P>
    <P>The advantage of offering a State gant or scholarship to the student is that he does not have the restrictions imposed on him that perhaps a married doctor would have and, consequently, he would be prepared to work in the remote areas or in the islands off the west coast.  I held a dispensary post in rural Ireland at one time and I am aware of the difficulty of attracting medical personnel to outlying regions.  I consider the solution I have offered the Minister worth investigating.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> I do not agree that we are producing too many doctors and I do not think that this should be stated here in the House.  Any student in this country who wishes to enter medical school should not be excluded from doing so because the Minister for Education has suggested there are too many doctors, particularly when the facts are that there are not sufficient doctors in rural areas.  We should offer an incentive to doctors to work in those remote areas and I think it is a sad day when the Minister for Education can get up and say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a definite need to increase the number of doctors in rural areas.  The Minister is well aware that there are many areas at present that do not have any form of general practitioner service and there are many sections of the population who only have a fill-in type of medical service. The Minister is introducing a health service and not only will there not be a choice of doctor but there will not be enough doctors to run the service efficiently.  People in rural areas who are without medical services read with amazement statements that we have too many doctors in this country.  I would call on the Minister to investigate fully the whole matter of medical education in Ireland.</P>

      <P>As a layman on this subject, I should be very grateful if the Minister would tell us and medical practitioners throughout the country whether it will be possible in the scheme he now proposes that general practitioners' services in the remote areas will be available.  Can the Minister let us know if he is happy about the situation now obtaining?  My information is that no matter what inducement is given to dispensary and <Col N="1394" /> other doctors they are not prepared to work in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to reject everything Deputy Byrne has stated and to inform the House that my Department are taking full cognisance of the problems involved in providing choice of doctor and are fully alive to the situation. Moreover, the Deputy has grossly exaggerated the position in the country with regard to the number of doctors who are now available.  There are approximately 900 general practitioners in the country districts.  We have made inquiries from county medical officers and we find that between 1966 and 1969 some 106 doctors joined the service in those areas and 131 doctors have left.  There is therefore a reduction of 25 or 2.8 per cent of the total number of doctors in the areas outside Dublin.  That is not by itself a matter of crisis character but naturally we have regard to the position in the future.</P>
      <P>We also examined the whole position with regard to district medical officers and general practitioners in private practice throughout the country and in Dublin.  It was found that approximately 306 out of 1,295 doctors registered will reach the age of 70 by 1981. That does not take account of those who might die within the period.  We do not have the numbers of those, but it indicates that there is an entry of doctors into the general practitioner service.  I think 106 doctors entered the service in the last three years. Although there has been a slight reduction, there is nothing like a crisis at the age when doctors retire, although admittedly quite a number of doctors are 60 years or coming to 70 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent survey in Great Britain showed that there was one doctor to every 2,430 of the population.  Here the proportion in Dublin city and county is 1,990 and in the rest of the country 2,331, so that the average for the whole country is 2,220&mdash;that is to say, general practitioners per 1,000 of the population.  Comparison is dangerous because the British report does not take account of part-time doctors whereas we include part-time doctors. <Col N="1395" /> One cannot, therefore, make an absolute comparison, but one can say that the ratio of doctors to population both in the country and in Dublin is certainly not unsatisfactory in relation to the position in Great Britain.  I have pointed out that we in the Department are aware of the position; we are not sitting back and doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the question of the Minister for Education's views on the number of doctors who should be trained.  The Minister for Education has not suggested that fewer doctors should be trained in this country. We train about 250 doctors a year, of whom something under 100 are required for service in this country.  The medical profession, the nursing profession and the priesthood are our three great vocations and I would not want to disturb them in the least.  We do not propose to do that, even though the cost of training doctors who are going to leave for service abroad and taking people who come from abroad to be trained as doctors is very high. I know the Minister for Education has not taken any decision to alter this in the future.</P>
    <P>In so far as the future position is concerned when the choice of doctor scheme comes into operation, as Deputy Byrne well knows, the permanent district medical officers will be guaranteed their income and will retain their positions.  They will be guaranteed their income with the usual twelfth round increases.  Temporary district medical officers will be able to partake in the choice of doctor plan for a period and so far as those areas where there is not even a temporary district medical officer are concerned the service is being performed by doctors in neighbouring districts. I have not had any complaints of note that the service provided by these doctors is totally inadequate.  From time to time complaints come to me and occasionally there are Parliamentary Questions but I have no serious complaints from remote rural areas where service is being provided by temporary district medical officers or by permanent district medical officers in the contiguous areas.  With regard to seeing what we can do in rural districts, <Col N="1396" /> we intend to examine all the possible propositions.  Deputy Byrne should be aware that we have offered extra pay for working in remote rural areas and this now exists in the Gaeltacht areas and some other areas.  We intend to offer positions in the towns in the western areas on condition that the doctor who is appointed will do a stint in a rural area.  We intend to examine every possible plan to maintain the general practitioner service in the country.</P>
    <P>I regard the general practitioner service as absolutely vital for one reason which may not be apparent to the House.  About one-third of all the general practitioners' duties relate to the mental condition of patients.  There is not the remotest hope of being able to appoint in Great Britain or America enough psychiatrists to do the work of general practitioners.  In many cases the first examination of a person who has some kind of mental trouble or difficulty will be by the general practitioner who will then refer the patient if necessary to a psychiatrist, a psychiatric social worker or some other person who will be more suitable to examine the patient's condition.  For that reason alone the value of the general practitioner service is very, very great, quite apart from the medical service offered and all the arguments can be adduced in regard to that matter.  Deputy Byrne may be satisfied that I have not failed to read the voluminous report from the Royal College of General Practitioners in regard to the future of the general practitioner service which is not only a problem here but a problem in other countries.  It is even becoming a problem in countries with large urban populations with massive practices.  It is not unique to this country.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the apprenticeship of newly-graduated doctors, helping them to do further training and encouraging them to go out into country districts, are all matters being pursued by my Department, as is also the very important question of ensuring refresher courses for general practitioners. We intend to study that just as soon as we have completed the arrangements for choice of doctor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> I am sure Deputy Byrne will approve of my action in this regard.  I notice we have had a great number of commissions of inquiry whose reports have been implemented since they were published.  We have had reports on the mentally handicapped, mental illness, child health services, the care of the aged and the future of the hospitals, but at the moment there is no important committee dealing with medical health services.  I decided two months ago, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to have an inquiry, probably in the form of a working committee, into the future of the general practitioner service in this country because the reports I have read from other countries do not relate to conditions here.  Whilst we can get a good deal of advice from the research work done by the Royal College of General Practitioners, we have particular problems here.  I decided therefore to have an inquiry set up in connection with the start of the choice of doctor scheme.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we are going on assembling more information of the kind that will be utilised by this inquiry committee.  We have assembled a good deal of it already; we are making further inquiries about this; we are <Col N="1398" /> marking and examining areas where doctors are scarce and we will go further into the examination of the ages of doctors in the service.  In that way I hope we shall be able to come up with some favourable policies leading to the advancement of the general practitioner service here but bearing in mind that it is going to be difficult to attain.  If anything like three-quarters of the Todd Report is implemented there is going to be more and more encouragement for doctors to specialise, in which case we shall also have to look at the possibilities of developing group practice not only in Dublin but in the main towns of the western areas.  That will be a further subject for examination, particularly examination with the Medical Union and the Irish Medical Association in so far as there are implications arising from group practice in relation to the choice of doctor scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope I have now satisfied Deputy Byrne that we are fully alive to all the questions he raised.</P>
