    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has considered Ireland's position in relation to EEC entry especially taking into account the House of Commons statement by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, that if conditions produced in negotiation were not acceptable Britain could rely on her own strength outside the communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in the light of the information contained in the British Government White Paper entitled <i>Britain and the European Communities&mdash;An Economic Assessment</i> the Government has reassessed and reconsidered the attitude of this country to the EEC; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.  As I stated in reply to questions addressed to me in this House on 4th February, a White Paper on the implications for Ireland of membership of the European Communities is being prepared.</P>
      <P>If the circumstances envisaged in Question No. 1 arose they would create an entirely new situation for all the countries concerned and the Government's policy in that situation would be determined in the light of its assessment of the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say if it is still the policy <Col N="870" /> of the Government to &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo; in the event of Britain's application not succeeding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never necessarily that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  The Parliamentary Secretary was not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the situation envisaged in the Deputy's question were to arise the Government would consider the position then in the light of those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary is, in fact, saying is that since most of our trade is tied up with Britain we would obviously have to stay out if Britain decided to stay out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not necessarily follow.  If the position were to arise it would be assessed at that time in the light of the circumstances then obtaining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed in the White Paper to take into account the facts disclosed in the British White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The considerations expressed in the British White Paper do not necessarily apply to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper being prepared here is already fairly well advanced and some of the considerations mentioned in the British White Paper will obviously be dealt with in so far as they affect us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask about consideration but the facts disclosed in it in reference to consumer prices <Col N="871" /> and also prices for agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that it would be correct to state that everything in that White Paper can necessarily be accepted as fact.  There is great divergence of opinion and the British Prime Minister was at pains to point out in the House of Commons when introducing the White Paper that quite a lot of the figures given in the White Paper were necessarily speculative and we, of course, would be in that position too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the economic assessments involved in the British White Paper be considered in our own White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic assessments in the British White Paper affect Britain only.  The considerations which underlie them will be considered in so far as they may or may not affect this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that in the event of Britain withdrawing her application it would be unrealistic for us to pursue ours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated in reply to that question that if that situation were to arise the Government would consider the position in the light of the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the terms of reference for those preparing the Government's awaited White Paper on entry into the EEC include costing estimates as detailed as those contained in the White Paper presented by the British Government in the House of Commons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the British White Paper <Col N="872" /> in relation to membership of the EEC; if it is a fact that food costs will increase from 18 to 20 per cent in the event of this country gaining membership; if a housewife with £10 per week to spend on food will require an extra £2 10s per week in order to purchase the same requirements; and if he will make a statement on this important aspect of EEC Membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is intended to issue a White Paper dealing with the possible cost of this country's entry to the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in this House on the 4th February, it is intended that the White Paper will give a full statement of the implications of membership of the European Communities to the extent that this can be done without prejudicing our negotiating position. Subject to that proviso, quantifications will be included where they would be helpful in assessing the implications and where realistic estimates can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what exactly were the terms of reference, and is the Taoiseach in a position to say when this White Paper will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already stated that it is hoped the White Paper will be published at the end of next month.  There is no reason to change that estimate of when it will be published.  There are no precise terms of reference in relation to the White Paper.  It will attempt to bring up-to-date the economic implications of our application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be more or less a similar exercise to that engaged in by the British Government in the past few weeks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about terms of reference now and not what will be in the White Paper.  Can it be assumed that the terms of reference are identical to the terms of reference of the committee which produced this White Paper for the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said, there are no precise terms of reference.  The White Paper will attempt in so far as it is possible to do so with accuracy to deal with the present economic implications of our application for membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the White Paper be confined to the economic implications?  Will political implications be included?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal and constitutional implications were dealt with fully in the White Paper issued in 1967.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper which it is hoped to issue at the end of next month will deal primarily with economic considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>While admitting that we must not give away anything about our negotiations&mdash;and we would not be giving much away by saying how the cost of living would be affected here&mdash;could we take it from the Parliamentary Secretary that the probable effects on the cost of living will be included in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate what will in fact be in the White Paper.  Obviously that is one of the considerations that must be touched on but it is difficult to give precise figures.  They can be misleading.  As the British Prime Minister pointed out last week, many of the figures in the British White Paper are speculative and if we attempted to give similar figures they could be equally speculative and misleading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there need be no speculation as to the constitutional changes necessary since they would be directly related to the terms of the Treaty of Rome.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary now telling us definitely that there need not be any constitutional changes on our becoming members of the EEC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>My Department's review of the rates of maintenance allowances payable in respect of boarded-out children will be completed very soon, and any appropriate recommendations arising from that review will then be conveyed to health authorities.  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that determination of <Col N="875" /> the rates of allowances is a matter for decision by each individual health authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies according to counties.  It was varied in April, 1963, in the case of some authorities.  The rate was revised again in 1965, 1966 and 1967.  It is a varying picture.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In relation to the counties that were fixed in 1963, would the Minister agree that the rate is now very much out of date and would require to be brought up to date immediately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>As I stated in my reply to questions on the 11th instant, I am making available to all health authorities in the coming year special <Col N="876" /> assistance, additional to the statutory and supplementary grants now payable, which will ensure that, despite the very considerable increase in the estimated cost of health services for the year 1970-71, the increase in the health rate will not exceed 2s. in the £ in any area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, before any major development of the Mater Hospital, Dublin, occurs, he will re-examine the unsuitability of the site in the matter of (a) inaccessibility arising from traffic congestion, (b) noise and (c) fumes and air pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Before arriving at any decision as to the relative suitability of different sites for a particular hospital development many factors have to be considered and it would be most unusual if all the advantages lay with one location.  The matters mentioned in the Deputy's question have been taken into account in examining the suitability of the Mater Hospital site and I am satisfied that no further technical examination of the site is required at this stage.  The Deputy will also remember that the Minister for Local Government announced in the Dáil last week that he will soon be taking specific action with a view to ensuring better control of matters such as emissions of smoke, dust, grit or gas which affect general environmental amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, it is a matter for the developer concerned to apply to the appropriate planning authority in the first instance for outline permission in connection with a proposed development scheme, and at a later stage for detailed planning approval.  Any proposals would be considered by a planning authority in the light of the development plan applicable to their area.  The nature and extent of any proposed development must be reasonably known before an application is made.  That stage has not yet been reached in the case of the hospital development which it has been suggested should take place at the Mater Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated recently in reply to a similar question, a change in the practice of excluding married women from permanent appointments in medical posts under local health authorities could involve a major policy decision, since the same practice in regard to the employment of married women is followed in appointments to every class of office throughout the local authority service.  This practice will no doubt come under the scrutiny of the commission that is being set up by the Government to inquire into the status of women in general.  Pending the report of the commission there appears to be no pressing need for a review of the current practice in the local authority service.</P>

Health authorities may, subject to my approval, extend these concessions to particular study occasions not covered by the general authorisation when they are satisfied that the value for the public service which any of their nurses would get from participation would justify the grant of the concessions.

      <P>Proposals are before my Department for the acceptance of tenders for 16 rural cottages in the west Cork area.  A non-traditional form of concrete panel construction is proposed for 13 of these cottages.  The panels which it is proposed to use have been undergoing tests and are currently the subject of correspondence between my Department and the manufacturers.  The other three cottages are to be of traditional construction but the estimated cost of these cottages would be entirely excessive on the basis of the tenders which are proposed for acceptance and my Department has been seeking ways and means of securing economies in cost.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for discussions between officers of my Department and the county council on the proposals to try to reach finality on them as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he has held up our housing programme which is exceptionally limited in west Cork by refusing to sanction the tenders, having regard to the fact that we advertised several times and contacted contractors in west Cork in an effort to get them to tender for the erection of such houses and that there is no possibility of getting the prices reduced? The council has endeavoured in every way possible to get better prices but it is not possible because it is accepted that the price for building local authority houses compares more than favourably with the price of private housing in the district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very wrong to sanction prices which are as excessive as these are without making every possible effort to secure economies in cost.  I think the Department are right in trying to ensure that these houses are built at a reasonable cost.</P>

Surely, there is an obligation on the Minister to take cognisance of that fact?  Am I right in saying the Minister is mainly interested in depriving us of the moneys from public funds which would go towards the building of these houses?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has any information in regard to the number of cases in which by reason of current legislation it has not been possible to adopt children of a mixed marriage; and if he will examine the present <Col N="898" /> situation with a view to introducing amending legislation to enable children of such a marriage to be legally adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no figure available because people would not be disposed to make an application in respect of a particular child if they knew that the application could not be accepted. Nevertheless, it is possible to draw conclusions from the known facts.  The only children eligible for adoption are orphans and illegitimate children and accordingly, when the question refers to children of a mixed marriage, it can mean only orphan children of mixed marriages.  &ldquo;Orphan&rdquo; is defined as meaning a child both of whose parents are dead.  Furthermore, a child to be eligible for adoption must be placed in the adoptive home before it reaches the age of seven years, unless the prospective adopters are close relatives.  Taken together, these provisions mean that the number of children who could possibly be affected must be extremely small.</P>
      <P>The number actually, as distinct from potentially, affected would be smaller still&mdash;in fact much smaller&mdash; because, even if an orphan is eligible for adoption, there is no presumption that it is available for adoption.  It may have relatives or others willing to look after its upbringing and its interests might not be served by formal adoption which involves its discarding its identity, and possibly other rights, as the child of its deceased parents.</P>
      <P>In practice, therefore, the number of children to whom the question relates must be insignificant.</P>
      <P>I cannot, at the moment at all events, see any prospect of altering the present position without grave risk that the administration of the adoption laws could become an area of the controversy and perhaps legal actions in the courts, all of which could have a very disturbing effect on the general body of adopters and could greatly damage the success of adoption generally.</P>

      <P>While appreciating the difficulties pointed out by the Minister, may I, nevertheless, ask him, <Col N="899" /> in view of the fact, as he has said, that an insignificant number of children are involved&mdash;I do not particularly concur with the word insignificant&mdash;if he would urge the Adoption Board to treat any such instances in a very sympathetic manner because of the highly anomalous situation which exists under the 1952 Act as amended by the 1964 Act, section 12, which causes a great deal of unhappiness and difficulty in a very small number of cases?</P>

      <P>We are dealing here, in the context of this country, with the orphan children of a mixed marriage. I do not believe that, in fact, any such case has arisen.  It is a possibility that such a case could arise but the number involved must be insignificant.  When this Bill was being brought before the Dáil there were consultations between the various religious bodies and I am satisfied that in this controversial field the provisions of this Bill came as near as could be devised to meeting the expressed views of these different denominations in connection with this issue.</P>

If a specific instance is brought to his notice, would he consult with his Department and endeavour to <Col N="900" /> resolve such an anomalous situation? It would be quite tragic if an orphan child of a mixed marriage could not be easily adopted because he or she happens to be an orphan of a mixed marriage.  The Minister must agree that there is an anomaly here and I do not think the House ever intended it to develop.  I do not want to overstress the point in view of the small number involved.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Section 10: In page 7, before section 10, the following new section inserted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A health board may, with the consent of the Minister, pay an allowance to its chairman in respect of expenses (other than expenses referred to in section 9) incurred by him in relation to the business of the board.</P>
      <P>(2)  A health board may, with the consent of the Minister, pay an allowance to its vice-chairman in respect of expenses (other than expenses referred to in section 9) incurred by him in relation to the business of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The amount of an allowance under this section and the nature <Col N="921" /> of the expenses in respect of which it may be paid shall be such as may be approved by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This arises out of an undertaking given by me on the Seanad Committee Stage to provide for the making of some allowances to the chairmen and vice-chairmen of health boards.  I cannot go further than the chairmen and vice-chairmen because it would have very wide implications for members of vocational education committees, county committees of agriculture and all sorts of corporate bodies of one kind or another.  This amendment will cover inevitable expenses of an entertainment nature incurred by the chairmen and vice-chairmen.  It was pressed on me very strongly by Senators from all sides of the House, and I understand from the Minister for Local Government that he has something in mind in relation to local authorities generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the amendment but I am surprised the Minister has not gone further.  I suppose he feels he has gone as far as he can. Local authorities in general are allowed to pay certain expenses to members and there is a very real chance of people who would make excellent local authority members being precluded from such membership by this new legislation simply because they could not afford to be members, being precluded from receiving some compensation.  I honestly feel the Minister should have gone a bit further.</P>
      <P>I was puzzled when the Minister mentioned vocational education committees and county committees of agriculture because members of these bodies receive travelling expenses. There must be a misunderstanding. Maybe I misunderstood the Minister but if he means what I think he means he is under a misapprehension.  I should not like to see people being precluded from membership of such bodies because they could not afford to be members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure this matter will arise for consideration in the next two years.  The Deputy is aware that members of health boards will have subsistence and travelling allowances as is the case with members of <Col N="922" /> local authorities.  This refers to entertainment expenses which chairmen and vice-chairmen will incur.  We are not interfering with the system of subsistence and travelling allowances which will apply to health board members. If the Deputy wishes me to introduce through this Bill a completely novel form of payment of allowances to these people, of some specific sum representing disturbance and compensation for losses caused to them in relation to their ordinary work, avocation or job&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Tully is making too much of this.  All the expenses and all the allowances which hitherto have been paid will be paid in relation to membership of the new boards.  That was always my understanding.  Now, in addition, a system is proposed which will allow reasonable sums to be paid for necessary entertainment.  What happens in the Dublin Health Authority is that, where there is anything in the nature of an official opening or entertainment, the canteen fund is used.  I think it is entirely wrong that a fund, built up with the daily pennies and shillings of the workers, should be used for entertainment of this kind.  It should be perfectly straightforward and an acceptable item of expenditure that a reasonable sum would be allowed for entertainment.  It would raise all kinds of difficulties if, over and above the subsistence expenses, other sums were to be paid.  Why, for instance, should it be related to the lowest wage or to the average wage?  Why should one person who has substantial means and a substantial income have to forfeit that for the day and accept a lesser sum simply because somebody else is paid less?  It would seem to introduce into public bodies a consideration which would be better left out.  This is a welcome measure; we should be grateful for it.</P>

      <P>Section 21: In page 13, the following subsections added to the section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Whenever an officer of a health board is suspended under this section, the chief executive officer may, if he thinks fit, make with the consent of the Minister an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the suspended officer.</P>
      <P>(7) Any sum paid under subsection (6) shall be repayable by the officer to the health board and may be deducted from any moneys payable by the board to him.</P>
      <P>(8) Any sum paid under subsection (6) shall not be reckoned as salary or emolument for the purposes of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This to some extent is an advance on present procedures.  Again, I think it is <Col N="924" /> in line with what the Minister for Local Government would agree with.  It enables an <i>ex gratia</i> sum to be paid to an officer of a health board who is suspended in circumstances in which it is felt that it would be unfair and wrong not to do so.  The payment would be made at the discretion of the CEO, with the consent of the Minister, and, if necessary, would be recoverable later from the recipient, either from remuneration for the period of suspension or, if that is paid, from superannuation benefits or contributions.  It is to cover the cases where a person might be suspended and where it would be thought wrong to deprive the officer of all remuneration whatever.  I think it is a humane proposal.  There will be occasions when it will not be applied.  It will be a matter for the CEO and the Minister for Health to decide whether to do it.</P>

      <P>We welcome this amendment.  In the past, there have been many cases where people under suspension got into very serious financial difficulties, with consequent embarrassment and deep suffering to their families.  Sometimes, unfortunately, periods of suspension can be quite lengthy.  It is wholly in accordance with natural justice that, until a decision is taken in relation to an officer, adequate means would be paid to that officer so that he and his family might be maintained in a reasonable degree of comfort.  This is a very humane proposal and one which is to be welcomed.</P>

I do not know how that could be overcome.</P>

      <P>Section 31: In page 16, subsection (2) (b), line 23, &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the discussions <Col N="926" /> in the Dáil and Seanad in regard to the allocation of a local contribution between the contributing local authorities.  Section 31 (3), as passed by the Dáil, provided that this would be determined by regulations made by the Minister for Local Government.  The point was made during the Dáil debate that it would be preferable to follow the precedent of the Health Authorities Act, 1960, and allow the contributing authorities to agree to the proportion between them, if that were possible, and, in the absence of agreement, to allow the proportion to be determined by a person appointed by the Minister.  These amendments are designed to make this change.  If the members of the various local councils concerned with the particular health board agree on the basis of allocation, this agreement can come into effect with the consent of the Minister.  If they do not agree, then a person will be appointed to make a determination on the allocation of expenses.  Pending the making of such an agreement or determination, there will be a provisional allocation, as specified by the Minister, which will be subject to adjustments after the agreement or determination is made. Subsection (6) of the amendment arose from a discussion in the Seanad in which a Senator wished to spell out in detail all the considerations which should be brought to mind by the arbitrator in making his decision.  I said that they were of so many and varying kinds that all we could do would be to give a general direction that he would have to consider the relevant factors in relation to this and that these could be mentioned by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Local Government, or specified to him.  Such factors will include, for example, the present proportions in which local authorities meet health expenditure; previous systems for divisions of costs, that is, on a valuation basis or in proportion to numbers of patients.  Those who have been members of local authorities will know immediately what I mean when I give those as examples of &ldquo;relevant considerations&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) the transfer of the holder of any health office under the dissolved <Col N="929" /> body to an office under the relevant health board which, in the opinion of the Minister, is similar to that health office,</P>
    <P>(e)  the transfer, with the consent of the Minister for Social Welfare, of the holder of any public assistance office under the dissolved body to an office under the relevant health board or a relevant local authority which, in the opinion of that Minister, is similar to that public assistance office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment also relates to matters discussed in the Dáil and the Seanad. Virtually everybody on all sides of the House suggested that the administration of home assistance should be carried out by the health authority because of the link between home assistance and hospital services and health services in general.  With the proposed delegation to the health boards of responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the assistance services it is clearly preferable that it should be possible to transfer the assistance officers to the health boards instead of to the local authorities, and this is the main purpose of the amendment.  The amendment will also make it clear that in the case of health officers the decision on the office to which the person will be transferred will rest with the Minister for Health while, in the case of the public assistance officers, it will rest with the Minister for Social Welfare.  It makes it easier to ensure that there is complete co-ordination between the payment of home assistance and the general administration of the health services.  The local authorities will also have to move for the delegation of this activity under section 24 of the Bill which we discussed during the Dáil debate and which I made clear would enable this delegation to be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our only regret is that the Minister did not go the whole way with us and leave the administration of public assistance where it is at present &mdash; with the health authorities.  What the Minister has now done is to say: &ldquo;We will take it away from you, give it back to the local authority but they may hand it back to you.&rdquo;  This seems an unnecessary exercise and I think it <Col N="930" /> was done primarily out of a desire to discourage health authorities from making representations to the Minister for Health to have public assistance treated as part of the Health Vote and, therefore, entitled to a subvention of at least 50 per cent from the State.  It has now been taken out of the hands of health authorities and handed back to the local authorities so that public assistance will in future, as in the past, be treated as something to be paid for entirely out of local rates and not carrying any of the subsidies which health services would carry.</P>
      <P>This is unfair.  At present between 64 per cent and 77 per cent of people who are in receipt of home assistance are people who are receiving some other welfare benefit from the State and they do not receive public assistance unless they are unable to provide, by their own industry or other lawful means, the necessaries of life.  Here we have a situation in which local rates are clearly being used to subsidise what are statutorily recognised as being totally inadequate State welfare payments.  Instead of treating these as we ought, as health subsidies, we are putting them back to be handled as part of the sanitary expenses of the local authority, as part of the expenses which must be paid in order to relieve the community of the diseases which are associated with poverty and destitution.  This is an entirely wrong concept and, while we accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the amendment, we are sorry it is something that has to be done because of this totally erroneous approach to the whole problem of relieving destitution and misery in our midst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial portion of home assistance in the Dublin region, as much as 30 per cent, is in respect of what are health services &mdash; the provision of meals-on-wheels, home help, the provision of many aids for elderly and disabled people living on their own. Surely these are health charges and should be carried as such and should rank as health services with equal status as institutional services?  However, this is not being done; they are to be regarded as sanitary services, matters for the local authority which may then delegate them back to the <Col N="931" /> health authority and because of that we have to go through this extraordinary Gilbertian procedure of transferring a health service to a sanitary authority and then allowing the sanitary authority to declare that the health authority may conduct it in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be complications in this.  If, as Deputy Ryan says, it subsequently goes back to the health authority the question of whether they qualify for the grants will come into it again.  As it stands, there is one thing which possibly might support leaving it with the local authority and that is the question of local knowledge of people who require assistance. All members of local authorities are aware of the occasions on which people have asked for public assistance and have pointed out that though they asked for it they did not get it or they did not get enough.  Occasionally representations have been made by local authority members which have resulted in this being rectified but what is likely to happen if this passes completely from the local authority is difficult to visualise at this stage.</P>
      <P>In connection with the grants made last year for the assistance of bodies dealing strictly with old people and which will be in operation again this year, can the Minister tell me how it is proposed to deal with those; are they being taken over by the new health authority or will they be left to the local authority?  I am not too happy about the whole set-up because it appears where there is dual responsibility somebody goes to the wall and it is usually the person who has the least amount of money and who needs help.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In regard to what Deputy Ryan said, I have already told the House that the Minister for Social Welfare is examining the whole of the social assistance code in relation to an examination of the operations of the Department of Social Welfare.  We have also to examine the Devlin Report which proposes very much closer co-ordination between the Departments of Social Welfare and Health.  I could not possibly have taken the action suggested by Deputy Ryan at this stage but I think the whole operation can proceed smoothly as a result of the use of section 24 of the Bill and these two amendments.</P>

      <P>I understand that under the relevant Acts they can be transferred, and I made that absolutely clear both in the Dáil and Seanad, but a joint consultative council will be appointed when the health boards are being organised.  I anticipate that, in relation to, for example, clerical officers, who do local authority work and those doing health authority work, it will be possible in many cases to find out who would prefer to be transferred and who would not.  It will be possible to re-allocate their duties in the case of clerical officers.  The joint consultative council will examine all these matters.  Many of them will have to remain wherever they are because of the general decentralisation of health services everywhere and the whole arrangement can be carried out without undue dissatisfaction.  We promise that nobody's conditions should be worsened as a result of the change.</P>

    <P>This amendment arises out of an undertaking I gave on Committee Stage in the Seanad which would leave it open to the Minister for Health to decide with what bodies he should consult in regard to any particular aspect of the regulations which he would be framing under section 40 with regard to Comhairle na nOspidéal.  There is separate provision for consultation with various bodies on the establishment of the regional hospital boards and I agreed to make it clear, through this amendment, that I would naturally consult with bodies representative of persons concerned with provision of hospital services, medical education and so on, before framing the regulations for Comhairle na nOspidéal.  That will come before the Dáil later for discussion.</P>

      <P>This is a very obvious amendment.  In relation to the operations of Comhairle na nOspidéal we had consultations with the authorities of University College and Trinity College in relation to teaching appointments in the Dublin hospitals and the teaching authorities are anxious that their position should be safeguarded. They agreed that the proposals in the present amendment would meet their requirements.  The effect will be that Comhairle na nOspidéal must consult the teaching authorities before regulating the number and type of teaching appointments and that they cannot be given functions on the selection of consultants who are whole-time professionals except with the consent of the relevant teaching body.  It was decided that Comhairle na nOspidéal would decide on the number of consultants and the type to be appointed in order to get integration in relation to the provision of specialists, but that it would be wrong if this could automatically apply to teaching appointments where there were full-time professionals to be appointed, that that would be transferring too much of the administration of the medical schools of the universities.  We have put in this amendment very enthusiastically.  It is entirely reasonable.</P>

The fact that the Bill was debated so long without its being inserted is a very sound reminder to us of the wisdom of having a Second Chamber to ensure that something as vital as this is not overlooked in such a comprehensive measure as this Health Bill.  The teaching colleges are entirely justified in the representations they have made.

I did this with some reservations because I felt they would have the necessary number of meetings but there are a great many things in this Bill where you can take the pragmatic view that people will do the right thing or you can take the view that there must be certain minimum provisions. Therefore, having agreed that the health boards should meet 12 times a year I could not possibly insist that Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regional hospital boards would meet on a specific number of occasions in the year.  Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 will exclude them from the general provision in regard to the regional health boards.</P>

This the Minister tells us, and so we understood, will allow health boards to provide the medical examination in schools other than national schools.  We appreciate the problems there would be about recruiting staff and in providing facilities for the minimum examination and the new scheme which the Minister has in mind, but let us hope this will be fulfilled and that they will then be able to extend into the regions where children are now being deprived of facilities where at one time they were not so deprived.</P>

      <P>A Senator made the observation that if a private hospital was changing its charter the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests might have been making available a very valuable endowment fund to this hospital.  If the functions of the hospital were to be altered in a particular way the commissioners might be satisfied and might continue the bequest but if a very drastic change were to be made the governing body of the hospital would know the views of the charitable commissioners as to whether certain bequests would continue.  For example, if a hospital which engaged entirely in looking after dying people changed its functions and started looking after a number of different classes of patients they should at least ask the charitable commissioners whether the gift was to be used only to help dying people or whether it could be used to help anyone else. This is a matter of law about which I know very little.  Anyway, there is no reason why they should not consult with the commissioners.</P>

In order to spend sums on some of the provisions in this new Bill, the Esti- <Col N="949" /> mate for my Department for 1970-71 will have to be taken in April and so the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will ask the Opposition to agree to take the past Estimate immediately, knowing that there will be a full debate on health policy immediately after Easter, so that I can get provision for sums to be spent on the payment of the chief executive officers and other new services. Secondly, I think about May or June, I will introduce the resolutions for the final formation of the regional health boards, hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal and if we can get those through, then, by October, the chief executive officers will have been appointed by the Local Appointments Commission and the health boards will start to meet to plan their work without having any legal power and to plan the whole formation of the board; and then the final arrangements for giving the health boards and the other boards full authority should commence on 1st April, 1971.  I am crossing my fingers but I think we are really keeping up with the schedule fairly well.  Administratively and financially, it would be almost impossible to introduce the health board administration in the middle of a financial year, as anybody who knows anything about accountancy in a local authority will appreciate.</P>

      <P>Before progress was reported last Thursday I had given some housing figures.  I have since obtained more up-to-date figures released in the last day or so which I want to give in case comparisons might be made using the figures already given rather than those now available.  These figures are under the following headings: schemes in progress; schemes about to commence; schemes in formulation; sites acquired or listed for acquisition.  There is very little difference between the position as it was on 31st December and the position as of 31st January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deal now with corporation schemes in relation to the waiting list programme: schemes in progress &mdash; total number of dwellings, 1,798; schemes about to commence, 48; schemes in formulation for acquired sites, 4,699; sites acquired or listed for acquisition, 5,580. In addition there is the purchase house, private sites programme: schemes in progress, 1,182; schemes in formulation for acquired sites, 2,205; sites acquired or listed for acquisition, 4,000.  This <Col N="951" /> gives a total of 19,462 sites which will be developed or are in course of development for the Dublin housing programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean to say that there are 19,000 persons waiting for houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This means that the corporation have made provision for the acquisition of land and are making plans for the development of 19,462 dwellings.  The housing list of Dublin Corporation is somewhere in excess of 4,000.  I explained in detail the reasons for the present size of that list.  It is obvious from the figures I have given that Dublin Corporation have taken a very active interest in housing development.</P>
      <P>The programme in regard to waiting list cases&mdash;798&mdash;should be stepped up considerably.  If that is taken in conjunction with private purchase schemes development by the corporation, the figure is almost 3,000.</P>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion in regard to future development in Dublin city.  The development has been lopsided.  For the last 12 or 13 years no houses have been built on the south side of the city.  That meant that the north side had to absorb waiting list cases.  This creates very many problems.  We received in this morning's post an issue of <i>Industry</i> in which it is suggested that industrial development and the building industry go hand in hand; that there are new factories, new housing; that Ireland is forging ahead; that the last ten years have seen the country going from strength to strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many industrial workers housed in the Ballymun estate.  I would suggest that a special scheme should be developed on the south side of the city so that transfer of workers can take place to ensure that they will be adjacent to their places of employment in the heavy industries located on the south side, such as, the CIE works, Roadstone, Killeen Paper Mills, the industrial estate at Ballyfermot, the large industrial estates at Bluebell and Walkinstown.  Many of the workers in these industries live in flats in Ballymun. <Col N="952" />  This is unnecessary and undesirable.  It means that workers spend two hours per day travelling to and from their employment.  This represents ten hours a week or 520 hours or 21 days a year.  This is a complete waste of a man's life.</P>
    <P>There are problems involved.  There is space available and the workers have indicated by their applications to the corporation and elsewhere their desire to be near their place of employment.</P>
    <P>This would reduce absenteeism.  It would reduce traffic congestion and it would mean that workers would be home earlier and could spend much more leisure time with their families.  The loss of family life as a result of this lopsided and jungle type of development is obvious.  I might mention that no consideration is given to workers in relation to employment.  It is on the basis of need and rightly so but, nevertheless, this factor of development should get comprehensive consideration.  This loss of 21 days which the workers spend in buses or on bicycles or in cars is absolutely undesirable and unnecessary.  I hope the Minister will consider a special scheme and that he will endeavour to have a survey made of the number of industrial workers who are living in Ballymun and who wish to reside adjacent to their employment.</P>
    <P>The other factor is the number of persons employed in the industrial estates on the south side who are either on overtime or shift work.  This makes the position very inconvenient.  Many shift workers had to give up good employment on the south side because of the inaccessibility of the industrial estate from Ballymun.  Due to the fact that our transport system ceases to operate at an early hour they are unable to get to or from their employment by public transport.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are problems but I would hope that the Minister would develop a scheme as big as the scheme at St. Michael's in Inchicore, or bigger, to absorb the number of people requiring transfers, and that he would <Col N="953" /> make available on the north side to people who are employed on the north side the vacancies that occur in the Ballymun development.  I do not think that is beyond the imagination or the capacity of the Minister or Dublin Corporation.  It would have to be in excess of Dublin Corporation's housing programme and guarantees would have to be given to the corporation that the full subsidies would be paid for the people so transferred to make it a special scheme for industrial workers and ensure that they are close to their employment.</P>
    <P>There is a comment in this publication that, since the beginning of 1969, of the Government's Programme for Economic Expansion the volume of output in manufacturing industries in Ireland has grown at an average rate of 7 per cent, the increase for 1968 being somewhere in the order of 11 per cent and that the employment afforded by these industries has increased from 142,000 in 1958 to 181,000.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the increase in the volume of employment in this area, at the moment 15 or 16 new industries are being developed with the extension of the Ballymun industrial estate. I am quite certain that many of the workers there will have to travel this extremely long distance to and from their employment.  There are many sites available in the area surrounding the Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Bluebell and Inchicore areas in which we could have some constructive type of development which would assist these workers. I trust that the Minister will give consideration to this fact.  It is an important fact because of the laxity on the part of the local authority or the Department or whoever was responsible for this lopsided development in Dublin city.  For a period of 13 or 14 years we had no large-scale accommodation developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I was explaining the necessity for the development of buildings on the south side to ensure that the industrial workers on the south side would have housing accommodation near their work.  I have already suggested to the Minister that a scheme should be undertaken on the same lines as the scheme at St. Michael's at Inchicore.  This is an exceptionally good scheme and it has been praised widely because of the type of construction that has taken place there.  In the various magazines that have been sent out dealing with the building development in the area we see very complimentary articles about that development and I should like to say that we need more and more of this type of development.</P>
      <P>I want to explain in some detail what I have in mind.  There is a large volume of industrial workers employed in the Ballyfermot industrial estate, in the industrial estate at Bluebell, in the CIE industrial estate in Inchicore, in industrial estates in Walkinstown.  This is a ring of industrial estates in which we have an ever-increasing volume of employment and, with the development of another 15 or 20 factories in progress at the moment, including the Fiat motor assembly works costing £425,000 or so, and the recent development of the central factory at a cost of £6 million where the total employment capacity will increase to approximately 800 men at full production, large-scale housing accommodation will be required in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar scheme to that at St. Michael's will have to be implemented to ensure that workers can live close to their place of employment.  A worker living in Ballymun and working in the industrial estate at Ballyfermot or in CIE at Inchicore spends an hour approximately travelling to work and another hour travelling home in the <Col N="955" /> evening.  Traffic congestion in the city at the moment is appalling.  That represents 10 hours per week, or 520 hours in a year, which adds up to 21 days spent in travelling to and from work. That is undesirable.  Lopsided development should be rectified and special consideration should be given to developing schemes on the perimeter of the city at Bluebell, Walkinstown, Inchicore and Ballyfermot to obviate people having to travel from the north side to the south side and <i>vice versa.</i> Workers should live close to their place of employment.  That is not an unreasonable hypothesis.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the engineers in either the Department or the Dublin Corporation.  If a survey were carried out the Minister would have at his disposal all the requisite information.  Many of the workers employed on the south side, but living on the north side, have told me of the grave inconvenience they suffer and the amount of time they spend travelling to and from work to say nothing of the loss of family life because of distance from employment.  In addition, there is the problem of the overtime worker and the shift worker.  These are very important people in our economy and it is imperative that we should consider them in the most sympathetic manner possible.</P>
    <P>There is a very excellent magazine produced by the Ballyfermot community association.  I do not know any itinerant settlement so successfully developed as Labré Park.  Everyone connected with that development deserves full credit and much of the credit must go to the Ballyfermot community association.  I have here in this magazine an article &ldquo;Who moved Labré Park?&rdquo; The article says that when plans were released for the setting up of Labré Park objections came from everywhere; nobody wanted to have an itinerant camp near him.  The Ballyfermot Tenants Association, as it then was, met the city manager and discussed the situation.  The city manager unfolded a complete plan for Labré Park and said what he intended doing with the unsightly roadside camps.  The association were in full <Col N="956" /> agreement with this.  In fact, the association made several suggestions at the meeting which were adopted.  Now, suddenly, Labré Park is in Bluebell and not Ballyfermot.  The article asked: &ldquo;I wonder has this anything to do with the fact that Labré Park is an example for the rest of the country?&rdquo; Everybody was quite happy to site the camp in Ballyfermot, before it proved successful.  It now seems Ballyfermot is no longer good enough for Labré Park.  This is a very important development and it is up to all of us to ensure that itinerants are treated in the manner suggested by the Minister in his directive to the different local authorities.  Another directive could be issued now to ensure that local authorities, who have been somewhat slow, should get a move on as soon as possible in regard to this problem to ensure that it is solved without any undue delay.</P>
    <P>Waste disposal presents a problem. Tips have been located adjacent to housing estates and there have been complaints about the inconvenience caused by decaying matter and escaping gases.  The health authority should be very vigilant.  Other methods of waste disposal will have to be considered, such as incineration and so forth.</P>

      <P>This is the third day of this debate and I am the fifth speaker.  I assure the House I will not, as some have done, speak for two and a half hours.  I listened to two speeches from representatives of Fianna Fáil, the Minister for Local Government and Deputy Dowling.  Both seemed to me to be engaged in an apologia of our housing situation.  They gave us long-winded explanations as to why houses were not built.  No matter what statistics are quoted and no matter what paper projections are made the fact is that for several years Fianna Fáil built no houses.  The result is that there is a backlog not only in Dublin but throughout the county.  On every Estimate for the Department of Local Government we have had these paper projections and had these projections been translated into action we would have plenty of houses and plenty of flats.  Unfortunately, they <Col N="957" /> were not projected into action.  It is quite obvious to everyone that something has gone seriously wrong with planning in this city.</P>
      <P>A Planning Act was passed to ensure that schemes could be effectively implemented through having the infrastructure essential to the carrying out of schemes.  I do not know what the planning authorities have been doing in Dublin but in my county, at any rate, they have not been concentrating on projections for the future.  They have been concentrating on holding up practically every effort at building new houses or the reconstruction of older houses.  It seems to me, from what I hear and read, that planning in Dublin has fallen down badly, that they have not made provision for the sewerage and water schemes necessary for any expansion in housing, limited though it may be.  Somebody in this city ought to take a serious look at the situation.  I am aware that there are several places in Dublin without a proper water supply.  The place where I stay when I am in Dublin has very inadequate water pressure.  At times, there is no pressure at all.  A number of people have told me that in many other places in the city the same situation obtains.</P>
      <P>There is no use in the Minister for Local Government, or his very able and courteous Parliamentary Secretary, coming in here and talking as if all the arrears in housing will be made up when there is not adequate water supply and sewerage in every part of the city.  They say the waiting list of 20,000 in Dublin will disappear and that people will not have to wait until they have two or three children before they have a chance of getting a house. The simple fact is that they have not got the infrastructure on which to build those houses.  The Minister and Deputy Dowling, who is well briefed by the officials in Dublin Corporation, made announcements here, but they will not be able to implement what they said. The sooner the people of Dublin realise that the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with housing the Minister said he intended introducing a new idea.  As far as I can gather, he is going to opt for a smaller-type house. <Col N="958" /> He will encourage people to build a smaller-type house by directing grants towards smaller houses.  This would favour the building of smaller houses rather than larger ones.  The idea is to catch the popular vote.  I wonder if the abolition of grants for the bigger-type house is a good idea? I am old-fashioned enough &mdash; perhaps I will be accused of being too conservative &mdash; to believe that if you are going to have a flourishing community you have to encourage private building as far as possible along with public building.  That is self-evident.</P>
    <P>Public building in this country has failed to keep pace with the demand. Therefore, if you are going to change your grant system and obliterate private building, as undoubtedly you will if you remove the grant for a certain type of house, you will have a bigger backlog of housing than you ever had.  I suggest that the Minister have another look at this.  If he likes he can increase the grant for the smaller house, but let him retain the existing grants which encourage people to build at present.  In the last year or so I have seen far more private building in this country than has taken place in the last four or five years.  Of course, you must accept the fact that costs are going up all the time.  When the cement strike is settled, costs will go up again.  In addition, wages have gone up and other charges have been soaring over the past few years.  That is why I ask the Minister to give all the encouragement he can to private building, because it will help in some small measure to keep the situation stabilished.</P>
    <P>I have always had the greatest courtesy from those I had to deal with when trying to obtain housing grants. However, there is one thing to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  It is the amount of unnecessary expenditure and delay caused by the lack of communication between the Department and the local authorities.  I do not blame the officials concerned, but it is well known that the delays are appalling when the Department write to a local authority to find out what the valuations are or when they write concerning all the other factors they have to take into consideration when <Col N="959" /> grants are given.  Very often the reply comes back from the Department that a correct answer has not been given and the local authority have to write again.  An amount of money would be saved by having a liaison officer between the two.  A great deal of time and expenditure could be saved if, once a week, all the Department's queries were dealt with by a special Department official.  It would be an economy to pay his expenses and even a special allowance for staying away for one or two nights.  It would do away with all this futile correspondence which is leading to protracted delays in the payment of grants.  This is a simple suggestion which the Minister might perhaps consider.</P>
    <P>I want to say something now about pollution.  There are two forms which are exercising the attention of every government in the world at the moment.  One is air pollution and the other is water pollution.  I want to deal, first of all, with air pollution.  I do not believe anything has been done in this country so far to deal with air pollution, the greater part of which comes from lorries belching gas from their exhaust pipes.  In Sweden, which is an up-to-date country, they have already made it mandatory for exhausts to have some sort of defumigator on them. There are many heavy lorries on the roads at present.  Anybody who has been caught in a traffic jam and has to inhale those gases for a quarter of an hour suffers considerable discomfort and injury to health.</P>
    <P>I suggest there should be some remission of taxation given to owners of heavy lorries who put containers on them to stop this expulsion of foul air into the atmosphere.  Those lorry owners already pay heavy taxation to the State.  I am sure most of them pay £100 in the year on each lorry and if they were given some relief in taxation it would encourage them to do something about this problem.  This would then ensure that the atmosphere would be kept clear of those fumes.  I would suggest that this should also apply to the CIE buses because they are probably just as bad as anything else in <Col N="960" /> sending out this gas, mostly in the built-up areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to water pollution, I understand the Minister has set up some sort of board to study this, but it has already reached dangerous proportions.  There is not a river in Ireland today in which pollution has not taken place.  This is causing damage to fish which is harmful not only to the amenities of life but to the tourist industry as a whole.  I believe in Dublin the river Tolka is highly polluted.  I have listened to questions being asked by Dublin Deputies here on both sides of the House about what the Minister proposes to do about this and the Minister's answer is always the same, that there is adequate legislation to deal with it.  In other words, the position which exists to deal with the situation is that the matter is reported to the medical officer of health and the medical officer of health is to take action.</P>
    <P>Whether they are a long time or a short time in this House, most of my colleagues have had experience of the rapidity with which any action is taken by the Minister or the medical officer of health to ensure against pollution or any other nuisance.  The discussions go on for an interminable time.  In this country someone must be made responsible for pollution.  The Minister for Local Government has overall command and should be made responsible for pollution.  The fish life in rivers has already been seriously affected.  Unless action is taken soon it will be still more seriously affected.  Vegetation will also be destroyed.  In highly industrialised countries in Europe rivers are completely polluted.  The upper reaches of the Rhine in Holland are in such a state that no fish or vegetable matter can survive in them.  Several of the lakes in Switzerland are polluted.  Lake Geneva is totally devoid of vegetation in any shape or form.  It is no longer possible to bathe in that lake.</P>
    <P>We are largely dependent on tourism in this country.  The Minister for Local Government must defend the country against pollution.  The administrative factors existing at the moment are valueless.  Pollution, both in the air and water, is advancing rapidly.  The <Col N="961" /> first signs of pollution are appearing around Dublin.  The disease affecting salmon is obviously due to pollution. Scientists have carried out exhaustive examinations without being able to pinpoint the cause of the disease.  The fact that the disease has occurred now when our rivers are becoming polluted shows that pollution has a bearing on it.  The Minister for Local Government should act quickly.  He could rectify the situation now at moderate cost but if the problem is left, as so many things are in this country, unsolved <i>ad infinitum</i> it will become a really large issue affecting the daily lives of the people and eventually costing a small fortune to clear.  The finances of this State are not in such a happy position that we can afford to risk wasting money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at his disposal as a result of overall taxation from lorries, private cars, tractors, etc., a certain amount of money in the Road Fund.  This may amount to £10 million of £11 million per year.  This money is sent to Dublin.  The reason given for that is that individual counties would not have sufficient revenue to maintain the servicing of their roads but that by sending it to Dublin an equitable division of it is made.</P>
    <P>Parking in Dublin has become nothing short of a public outrage.  As a Deputy, I have an advantage in having free parking space in Leinster House.  The average person who comes from rural Ireland to Dublin has no chance of getting parking space unless he leaves his home early in the morning and arrives in Dublin at about 8 a.m.  Such a person must park outside the city.  Dublin buses are full and travel very slowly as a result of parking on each side of the road.  Such parking narrows the roadway making it difficult for traffic to move.  It is often as quick to walk as to take the bus from the outskirts to the city centre.</P>
    <P>Parking meters have been introduced.  They have been used in London and in other capital cities for the purpose of organising traffic.  Traffic congestion in Dublin is caused by lack of parking facilities.  The throughfares are narrowed to half their width by parked vehicles.  Cars are parked <Col N="962" /> throughout the business hours of the day on both sides of the streets.  The Minister has the Road Fund at his disposal.  £3 million of that Fund is retained for &ldquo;other purposes&rdquo;.  I am not clear what the &ldquo;other purposes&rdquo; are.  If the moneys in that fund are taken from motorists, taxi drivers or lorry drivers it seems fair that it should be expanded for the benefit of those from whom it was collected.  The Minister should build overhead and underground parking places as is being done in other large cities.  There are thousands of men unemployed, many of them in Dublin.  Would it not be wise to employ these men on the erection of parking structures, two or three storeys high?  I believe the money is already in the Road Fund but, if not, perhaps it could be raised by loan as local authorities are empowered to do.</P>
    <P>There is a large parking space adjacent to the Pro-Cathedral, Marlborough Street.  From 9.30 a.m. until after business hours this space is full. Why not build overhead parking spaces there?  Thousands of cars could be fitted in.  There is another space at the back of George's Street, where Pim's used to be, where further parking accommodation could be built.  People would be happy to pay for parking space in the city.  They would be happy to pay 5s per day for parking in order to save time and enable them to conduct their business.</P>
    <P>Moneys are channelled from the Road Fund to the different counties in proportion to their contributions.  The local authorities have no say whatever in how that money is expended.  It is expended on main roads.  Whatever expenditure is incurred and whatever construction takes place are decided by someone sitting in the Custom House.  If I go home from here, as I do, through Bray, I find, outside Bray or down in my own county, if I go as far as County Wexford, thousands of pounds are being expended rooting up roads, cutting across country, mutilating valuable land and grazing, bulldozing useful timber in an attempt, it appears, to turn this country into a country of autobahns.  Is that money well spent?  Could we not save thousands of pounds by taking off corners, <Col N="963" /> by using luminous paint and so on? The other day I motored along by one place where the road is absolutely straight.  There was nothing wrong with it except that it may have been a little narrow, but there was sufficient verge on each side that could have been taken in.  Instead, they have rooted up the whole road and have gone into a field on one side and the road is not even as straight as it was previously.</P>
    <P>I believe this scheme was planned by some expert from the United Nations who came here but surely we ourselves can decide what roads we want and plan how to spend our money.  If I were to object to any reconstruction going on in my county or any other Deputy in his own county, what would happen would be that the money would be allocated to another county and be spent just as foolishly there.  These things should be considered.  I always try to be constructive and advise the Government on how they can save money but before sitting down I must say with regret that I think that after 13 years of Fianna Fáil Government the country is heading for financial ruin.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy for Deputy Esmonde.  As he said, his speeches are constructive but surely he does not expect to influence the Minister for Local Government, no matter how constructive his speeches are.  I am sure that no Opposition Deputy contributes to the debate with a view to influencing the Minister or his policy but does so because local government is exceptionally important. Housing, water and sanitary services, planning regulations and so on which come within the scope of the Department of Local Government are very important, and there is a natural obligation on Deputies to contribute to the debate if not to influence the Minister, at least to influence public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never engaged in personalities here and would be the last to do so but I think we now have in charge of the Department of Local Government a person who is suffering from a personality defect which I think is <Col N="964" /> incurable.  He is incapable of holding a rational discussion or listening to the views of Opposition speakers.  With him you cannot do as you could do with many others who oppose us politically &mdash; sit down at a table, exchange views and benefit from such dialogue but this Minister is incapable of and unwilling to listen to arguments by the Opposition.</P>

There <Col N="966" /> may be arguments in favour of doing this.</P>
      <P>We come now to roads and we are told that all major roads in the country will be taken over from local bodies, that roads will be designated as national primary and national secondary roads and that in future all matters dealing with roads deemed to be national primary or national secondary will be determined by the Department of Local Government and that local councils will have no say whatever. It is evident from such instances, and there are many others, that there is a movement afoot here slowly but steadily to wipe out local authorities.  We must address ourselves to that question.</P>

      <P>The Cork Health Authority received a recommendation from Waterford County Council, which was sent to all councils throughout the country, requesting a 75 per cent grant for health services from the Central Fund.  We defeated that recommendation on my proposal.  That does not bear out Deputy Cunningham's contention that we are asking for national funds or national taxation to take over the maintenance of our health service, our roads, our housing and so on.  We should have more outspoken comment from the Government as to whether they propose to go ahead with their policy of wiping out local authorities or whether they have regionalisation in mind.  We have had a number of regional boards set up.  I cannot see what good can accrue from some of them.  We have a board dealing with the tourist industry and we have a great deal of overlapping so far as boards supposedly dealing with industrial development are concerned.  However, I want to focus attention on the question of undermining the powers and functions of locally elected representatives.

      <P>I do not want to be too hard on Deputy Crowley.  There is a tendency now to disregard the recommendations of local authorities.  Deputy Esmonde referred to recommendations sent from local councils to Dublin and which are answered with futile arguments <Col N="968" /> pointing out some alleged technical difficulty.  This correspondence is costly.  All engaged on it receive a high rate of remuneration.  It does nothing but frustrate the efforts of local representatives.  We on Cork County Council have intimated by way of resolution, proposed by me as chairman, that we should get greater powers than we have at present.</P>
      <P>Why should we ask the Department's approval for the building of a cottage or for a small water or sewerage scheme when we are satisfied locally that it is necessary?  Our local advisers are surely just as competent as the people in Dublin; being on the spot they know more about the requirements of particular districts than the people in the Custom House or in O'Connell Bridge House.  There should be a change in that direction.  If local bodies are to continue they should have greater powers.  I am hopeful that in three or four years time a change will come about here.  I cannot see the errors and omissions that took place last year recurring.  If I had my way the position possibly would be far different than it is today.  However, we must accept what we have at present. I have no doubt that if we had a different Government the views and recommendations of county councillors in Cork, irrespective of their party affiliations, would be heard and this wastage would cease.  All these letters, all this correspondence, all these hold-ups by the Department should be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal has been said regarding housing and I want to move beyond housing at this stage because the subject has been reasonably well dealt with by previous speakers. Naturally, I shall have something to say on it later.  I shall move to another important item, nationally and locally, the matter of planning.  As far as south west Cork is concerned, planning is a major question.  In pursuance of legislation enacted by the Oireachtas, development plans had to be drawn up. We all agree that such plans are essential but we find that in the implementation of these plans a great deal of hardship can arise to numbers of people in different parts of the country, particularly in areas such as south <Col N="969" /> west Cork where there is such an extended mileage of seaside beauty spots.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we are trying to maintain as much uniformity as possible between national and local requirements.  We are told by the national planners that we must have planning, that our beauty spots must be kept unspoiled because otherwise they would not attract the money derivable from tourism.  However, there is a conflict between local and national plans. I have made the case locally, and I am making it nationally here, that although it may be necessary to preserve many isolated sections of our coastline, at the same time the owners of such land are entitled to compensation.  There is not a Deputy here, particularly from a coastal constituency, who has not again and again had representations from some parties who had been offered exceptionally high prices for small parts of such land.</P>
    <P>In south west Cork and in west Galway, it is not unusual to find a small farmer being offered £1,000 for a little plot of land which is not of any great advantage from the agricultural point of view.  One can imagine a person of that kind being offered money which would elevate him from impoverishment to a state of affluence.  It is a significant sum in that part of the country and, indeed, we have not grown so rich that £1,000 could not be deemed insignificant in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer particularly to the peninsula areas of west Cork, to the peninsula where I live, to the peninsulas of Sheep's Head and Berehaven. There we have land of the lowest quality, rocky land, land unsuitable for agriculture, from which little or no income has been derived during the years.  There are many people who are willing to buy such land at exceptionally high prices on which to erect houses.  Thereby, such people would contribute to local taxation, to rates and would help to maintain the population of an area which has suffered very much from depopulation in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that if it is against the national as well as the local interest to have such land acquired <Col N="970" /> and built on, permission should be withheld.  In such cases, however, I submit there is an obligation on public funds to buy such land and to hold it if it is deemed necessary to preserve such land as a tourist area.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte explained why this land should not be sold to prospective buyers.  It is true that many of them are not from this country. However, some of them are: some people from Dublin and Cork cities come along to the west Cork coast and pay good money for individual plots.  I shall give a specific case of a woman and her daughter living on a small piece of land in the remotest part of this country.  She was offered an enhanced price for this piece of land and Cork County Council were of opinion that building permission should be given.  However, Bord Fáilte stepped in and said: &ldquo;No, this is a lovely little spot and we must preserve it&rdquo;. This woman was offered £850 for this land but Bord Fáilte objected because they said a building should not be erected there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I am not able to transmit as clearly as I should like or as clearly as Deputy Geoghegan needs.  There is no question of the woman being wronged.  The point is that legislation is against her.  There is nothing illegal about the action taken by Bord Fáilte.  It is legal and above board.  They went along and said to the county council: &ldquo;We think permission should not be granted.  If it is, we will appeal to the Minister and the Department.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I assume Bord Fáilte have good grounds for that assertion.  Then, in my opinion, Bord Fáilte should buy this piece of land themselves.  It would be unfair to deprive the owner of this land from a right to getting £850 which is there for her, subject to planning approval.  That is only just one instance.  We have several others.  Undoubtedly, we must have a big number, say, from the area of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan&mdash;Galway west&mdash;which, in many respects, resembles the south-west Cork coastline.</P>

      <P>None of us would like to see our land being sold out to foreigners or to any others if it means hindering one of our major industries, tourism.  We are all anxious, if it is at all possible, to preserve our coastline, to have it for our visitors, and to boost it in foreign parts in order to attract more people to our shores.  At the same time, we must look at the position of the holders of this land or the owners of this land.  My view is that a sizeable fund should be established in this country to buy those parts of the coastline which we feel should be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Book of Estimates for this year has on its cover the figure of, I think, £354 million.  If we, as a nation, want to take the £4 million from the £354 million and, say, have a pool of £4 million or £5 million, we could purchase <Col N="972" /> our coastline and hold it for our own people for their use and enjoyment if they think it is fit and suitable for such a purpose.  That is the answer I see to this major problem.</P>
    <P>I believe there is an obligation on the Government, with the help and co-operation of local authorities, to take cognisance of this fact and to make money available for parts of our coastline which, in the opinion of our planners, and which, in the opinion of our tourist boards, should be preserved. Otherwise we are going to have the many representations that we from my part of the country have at the moment.  We are going to have representations from people who are getting enhanced prices for their land, subject to planning permission.  If I were to put myself in place of one of these men, say, with a family of five or six children, getting that thousand pounds there for what some would term a handful of rocks, I would, indeed, be making similar representations to try to get my money in order to be in a position to have a little capital to help my family along educationally and otherwise.  If I were to remain speaking here until this House rises tonight at 10.30, I could not over-emphasise the importance of this question.</P>

      <P>If the Chair will permit me to recapitulate what I have said on this planning question and to illustrate the position in the major county in the country and, of course, the most important county, County Cork, I would point out that our development plan is to be amended. Now, Members are slow to set down amendments that may interfere with tourism: we are all mindful of that fact.  There is a strong consensus of opinion&mdash;I have expressed this view to a number of my colleagues on the council and they all seem to agree&mdash; that if public money were provided we could buy this land.  Otherwise, it is, indeed, very difficult to deprive the landowners of their heritage in getting the enhanced prices.  I do not think it is necessary to further labour that matter.  It is an exceptionally important matter.  We must have planning.  We must try to co-operate with organisations such as national boards&mdash;An Foras Forbartha, Taiscí Stáit, Bord Fáilte, and so on.  So far as I know, all of such boards&mdash;particularly the three I have named&mdash;say &ldquo;Do not give permission&rdquo; but they never say anything about compensating the owner. It may be all right to mention provisions in the Bill which would not need the present situation, that is where councils would be supposed to buy land in certain instances.  I am a firm believer that if we want to preserve this land then we must pay for it <Col N="974" /> and that it is unfair to deprive these poor people of the opportunity of making a sizeable return from their land, as is happening at present.</P>
      <P>Perusing the Minister's statement briefly, certain points come to mind. However, it is all right for Ministers to bring in statements here which have been prepared with the aid of a whole host of civil servants, and so on.  It is all very well for Ministers when they have the help of civil servants in writing up their briefs.  Deputies, however, have to think for themselves.  Our sequences cannot be as great and our statements cannot be as nicely put as are ministerial pronouncements.  I must say to the Minister and to his Department that, if the Department have built all the houses they claim to have built and have provided all these additional funds, their public relations system is definitely a very poor one.  I believe that any private firm, if it were carrying out its work as the Department claim they are carrying out their work &mdash;in an efficient and capable way&mdash; would surely be able to project a better image to the general public.  I do not know of any local authority in the country that is not dissatisfied at present with the Department of Local Government&mdash;and that is not confined to supporters of the Labour Party or supporters of the Fine Gael Party: it is equally true of many local councillors supporting the Government Party and it is equally true on a national basis.  I base that statement on reports of local authority meetings which I read in the local and national press from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say, so far as Cork is concerned, that we are anything but satisfied in County Cork with our housing allocation in recent years.  The Minister, I think, tells us in his document that local authorities provided 4,338 houses in the year 1968-69.  I do not like being local in dealing with national questions, but, just for the sake of illustration, take the part of the county council area where I come from, the Cork County Council West, which is a separate housing and sanitary services authority.  It is made up of two electoral districts&mdash; those of Skibbereen and Schull.  Over the past ten years, we have built in that <Col N="975" /> area, with a population of some 40,000 people, something around 130 houses but certainly not more than 140 houses. In the light of the Minister's statement in relation to Dublin city&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an exaggeration about 40,000 being the population of the Schull and Skibbereen electoral areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the population?  Men, women and children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Including them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, the last time we heard of the Dublin Corporation, Dublin city population was something in the nature of 647,000.  It is evident, then, if that is correct, that there is some discrimination in the allocation of public funds for housing. From the frequency of my visits to Dublin I am aware of the difficult housing situation that exists here; from the questions put down here, particularly by my colleagues in the Labour Party, from other sources and from press reports I am aware that the position is most acute.  My own small district has received little satisfaction from the Department of Local Government.  So far as the West Cork Committee is concerned we are mindful of the obligations the Minister has to other parts of the country, to places such as Dublin and the bigger urban areas and, consequently, our demands are very moderate.  In a recent survey of the district we concluded that if we could get money for 90 houses this year we would be satisfied; if we got money for these exceptionally urgent cases we would be quite satisfied to leave the others over.</P>
      <P>We are not unmindful of the fact that money does not grow, that it must be found through taxation of one kind or another, but we believe that a decent house is an essential for any family.  All are entitled to this and we are falling down on the job when this cannot be provided.  So far as Cork is concerned we are meeting nothing but frustration from the Minister for Local Government and from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Water and sanitary services go side <Col N="976" /> by side with housing but the position in our district could not be worse.  We are left with schemes which were formulated and planned at a great deal of public expense, with high fees for consultants and so on, these schemes having been drawn up at the direct request of the Minister and his advisers. We received circular letters from the Department that, first of all, charged us with being rather lackadaisical in formulating water and sewerage schemes and in improving sanitary services generally.  I referred previously in the House to the leaflet we got regarding the woman coming from the well with two buckets.  I do not know which of the boys in the Department drew this picture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting a tremendous amount of money for water schemes in Cork.  Bandon is getting £250,000 and Clonakilty got £300,000. The Deputy should get his statistics right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case these leaflets arrived and got us all going. As regards the Clonakilty area the Deputy has just mentioned, the regional scheme was planned for the Clonakilty district at a cost of £500,000 directly as a result of representations, or commands if you like, from the Department of Local Government.  The scheme was approved for advertising and we had competitive tenders from all the big contractors in the south of Ireland because it was such a substantial scheme.  I do not know how much it costs a contractor to prepare a tender and submit it for such a scheme but I assume it costs a sizeable amount.  We received tenders which were deemed to be reasonable but they had to be scrapped because money was not available; the scheme had to be phased out over an extended period into five or six different phases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had not got this direction from the Department this scheme would never have been planned because it was the opinion of the members that that kind of money was not available and indeed we were surprised with this egging-on which we got from the Department knowing how much such schemes would cost.  What we were <Col N="977" /> doing in Cork prior to the Department's notification about extending water supply schemes was trying to provide schemes for the built-up areas and encouraging those in rural districts to avail of grants for private water and sewerage schemes.  Most people would have been quite satisfied to avail of the private water and sewerage schemes.  I would not have gone into all this detail but for Deputy Crowley's interruption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We sent a simple resolution to the Department asking that we be given discretionary powers to decide locally which schemes should be implemented and which should be left over until funds were available but we did not succeed in getting anywhere with this.  We have every reason to be disappointed so far as housing, water supply and sewerage schemes are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards group schemes I, together with my colleague Deputy John O'Sullivan, asked the Minister, at the request of the West Cork Housing Committee, for his reasons for not allowing the group water schemes inspector to attend meetings of the committee.  The Minister would not <Col N="978" /> allow the inspector to attend such meetings because he does not like bodies that have not a Fianna Fáil majority and certainly the West Cork Committee have not such a majority.</P>

      <P>There is a question also regarding the erection of cottages. There is a limited number for west Cork but we are told that the prices are too high.  The cost of building in west Cork may be higher than in other parts of the country, particularly inland areas.  The council members, together with their technical advisers, considered that the prices were reasonable and I cannot see why the Minister should not approve the schemes.  Otherwise, the position of people having to live in houses not fit for habitation will prevail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is telling us that these prices are too high and that if we cannot do any better the people must remain without houses.  I should like to mention the local improvements scheme grants which are now transferred from the Department of Finance to the Department of Local Government and, through the Department of Local Government, to the county councils.  In Cork county we get an annual grant of £25,000 which is entirely inadequate.  Everybody knows that £25,000 spread over a county extending some 115 miles or more is inadequate.  Indeed, at a recent meeting of the county council the manager suggested that applications should not be received for some time because <Col N="979" /> there were too many applications awaiting attention.  That is an outrageous position.  This amount of money is entirely out of proportion to present day values in so far as a county as large as Cork is concerned. The Minister referred to the fact that in some counties the total allocation was not expended.  If that is so I am very surprised.  Assuming that the statement is correct, why are additional moneys not given to big counties such as Cork which is crying out for more money to complete additional schemes?</P>
      <P>The estimates meetings of the county council will be held within the next month or two and we want some information from the Department for those meetings.  Time and again Cork County Council have made representations requesting that notification of road grants be made available prior to the estimates meetings.  That is the unanimous viewpoint of the councillors but if the pattern of previous years continues it is unlikely that we will have notification of such grants before May or June.  In recent years, we have had the peculiar position that a great deal of money was taken from the Road Fund by the Minister and transferred to the Exchequer.  That practice is neither fair nor just.  The Exchequer is doing reasonably well from the motoring public.  The number of vehicles is increasing and consequently the income from petrol, oils and other incidentals used by motorists is increasing, and that is not to mention turnover and wholesale tax on these commodities.  I assert that the moneys collected through road taxation should be devoted entirely to road maintenance and upkeep.  Money is decreasing in value while costs are increasing and in order to avoid redundancy there is a need for additional funds year after year to help stave off this inflationary trend which we now have and which we are likely to have for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that I did not think the Minister would take much interest in what is said here during the debate but, at the same time, every man has an equal right in this House. <Col N="980" /> All of us have been elected by the people to try and improve standards as well as to endeavour to influence opinion and as far as possible to influence decisions made in this House. However, for some years past all has not been working smoothly here.  It is easy to understand why when one realises that the same party have been in power for so many years.  As a result, they are likely to grow stale and to become arrogant as well as indifferent to public opinion.  It is no harm to let the general public know that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever is in charge the Department of Local Government has a very responsible position and the Minister, by virtue of being in charge at present, has that responsibility.  No matter what is said about elections we all agree that once a Government is democratically elected they are entitled to govern but it is also agreed that people are entitled to offer criticism and that public representatives are entitled to express their views regardless of whether they are different from the views of the Government. However, it has been seen of late that while Government Ministers may take dictatorial action they are very reluctant to act when, for instance, a number of people having established themselves as a group, take over buildings and then say to Government Departments that they are going to stay in those buildings.  I am a believer in the democratic processes and whether I like or dislike a Government I realise that once they have been democratically elected they have certain rights and certain obligations.  When certain things arise I do not like to see the Government acting weakly or rather cowardly.  The Government are there to assert their authority.  They are there to listen to reasonable protests and representations.  I have never been nor <Col N="981" /> never will be a believer in intimidation or anything that flows from it.  I believe in free discussion between public representatives, local groups and local bodies, on the one hand, and ordinary citizens on the other.  It amazes me to read in the paper some of the happenings to which there is only a weak reaction by the Government, particularly when vital principles are at stake.</P>
      <P>In dealing with any Estimate I like to refer to the credit side as well as the debit side, but it is difficult so far as local government is concerned to find anything to the credit of the Government.  I have little communication with the Minister, and his Department is not the best either at communication.  This is something which I hope will be rectified some day.  When an ordinary citizen writes to the Department of Local Government inquiring about a housing grant or anything else he is entitled to an answer.  He does not get that and it is difficult even for a Deputy to get it.  However, without approaching any TD a citizen should be able to get this information within a reasonable time from the Department.  When a Member of this House writes to the Secretary of the Department he is also entitled to an immediate reply and he should not have to wait a week to know what the position is on behalf of some constituent who more than likely has already made inquiries without result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I do not like the subtle methods being employed at the present time to centralise local government, to take away from local councillors rights and privileges which they hold as elected representatives of the people.  If there is to be a change and if there are good grounds for abolishing the local authority system as we know it is should be done openly and above board and not through the system that is in vogue of chiselling a piece away here and another piece there so that in the end there is so little left that it will possibly be easier to abolish the system altogether.  I have worked with local authority representatives of every political persuasion, people who have given a great deal of their time to improve the conditions and standards of the people in their districts.  I should like the Department <Col N="982" /> of Local Government to show appreciation of the excellent work they are doing by giving them more autonomy.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government and myself have been colleagues in County Dublin for many years.  I wish to thank him and his Department for their co-operation with me in my constituency.  County Dublin has increased in population by about 41,000 in ten years.  Last year alone there was an increase in population of 8,000.  One can, therefore, understand the urgent need for sewerage and water services.  Often when I pressed the Minister hard in this connection he would say: &ldquo;I am a Minister.  I have to be fair to every constituency in Ireland.&rdquo;  While he agreed the need was great and even though he represented the county he was completely impartial.</P>
      <P>The demand for sewerage and water services in County Dublin has increased enormously.  The treatment works at Lucan which the Minister opened two years ago cost almost £1 million.  The north Dublin regional water scheme had to be embarked upon because the city was bursting at the seams and people were going out to the county.  I hope our economy will continue to prosper so that such schemes can be continued.</P>
      <P>Due to the industrial revival carried out under the auspices of the Fianna Fáil Government there is a greater demand for housing.  It is a different situation from 1957 when there were 1,800 houses idle.  To deal with my own constituency first, north and south County Dublin, 701 dwellings and 58 sites for private housing have been provided by the county council during the last three years; in addition 362 dwellings are under construction and 17 sites for private housing are being developed in the following areas: Crumlin, 38 dwellings; Malahide, 60; Lusk, 13; Lucan, 16; Portmarnock, 22; Coolmine, 96 dwellings and ten sites; Tallaght, 110, and five single houses.  This makes a total of 350 dwellings and 17 sites which will cost in the region of £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tenders have been sanctioned for the following schemes to provide 183 dwellings and 115 sites for private <Col N="983" /> housing: Rush, 54 dwellings and 82 sites; Ashtown, 46 dwellings and 8 sites; Ballymun-Santry, 60 dwellings; Portrane, 16 dwellings and 25 sites and seven single houses.  The total cost of these works will be £450,000.</P>
    <P>Documents are being prepared for a further 339 dwellings and 153 sites as follows: Dundrum, 96 dwellings and 9 sites; Clondalkin, 49 dwellings; Tallaght, 135 dwellings and 64 sites; Rathcoole, 54 dwellings and 24 sites; Skerries, 56 sites and 5 single houses. The estimated cost of these is £1 million.</P>
    <P>This is my second term of office as chairman of the council.  We are grateful to the Department of Local Government for the way they have dealt with the schemes we have submitted during the last three years.  In the last three years we have acquired land as follows: Rush, Kenure Park, 90 acres at £25,500; Ashtown, 5½ acres at £14,300; Portrane, 51½ acres at £34,500; Skerries, Station Road, 6½ acres at £12,108; Clondalkin, 70 acres at £72,500; Tallaght, 106 acres at £125,000; Rathcoole, 8½ acres at £5,950; Lusk, Minister's Road, 8¼ acres at £5,000; Limekiln, 50¼ acres at £58,000; Carrickmines, 144 acres at £186,000; Naul, 4½ acres at £3,903; Ballyboghill, approximately 1¼ acres at £1,275; Tallaght, 42 acres at £67,000; Sandyford, 109½ acres at £201,816; Rolestown, 17½ acres at £10,200; Balscadden, approximately 6¼ acres at £1,228; Turnapin, 8 acres at £3,000; Skerries, 31 acres at £40,396; Balbriggan, 22¼ acres at £24,750; Dundrum, 39½ acres at £87,750; Portrane, 12¾ acres at £7,100; Ballymun-Santry, 5½ acres at £17,000; Clondalkin, 18¾ acres at £32,560; Balbriggan, 6¼ acres at £7,000; Lucan, 23 acres at £29,611; Garristown, 5½ acres at £4,350.  That 894 acres, which is land for potential building, cost £1,076,797.</P>
    <P>Under the SDA loans scheme 367 houses at a cost of £794,303 were built in 1967-68; in 1968-69 376 loans were given which amounted to £938,121; in the year 1969-70 399 loans were given up to 31st December, 1969, amounting to £1,140,929.  The SDA loans provided a means for the ordinary man to buy his own house.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> In 1967-68 four reconstruction loans, amounting to £1,971 were given; in 1968-69 four reconstruction loans, amounting to £2,341 were given; and in 1969-70 six reconstruction loans, amounting to £2,590 were given.  There were 131 applications for supplementary grants on new houses in 1967-68 amounting to £26,338; in 1968-69 there were 238 applications for supplementary grants on new houses amounting to £46,044; and in 1969-70 there were 528 applications for supplementary grants on new houses amounting to £110,972.</P>
    <P>In 1967-68 124 reconstruction grants, amounting to £14,348 were given; in 1968-69 93 reconstruction grants, amounting to £12,091 were given; and in 1969-70 123 reconstruction grants, amounting to £15,893 were given. Under the small water sewerage supplementary grants&mdash;these have nothing to do with the major schemes&mdash;78 grants, amounting to £3,065 were given in 1967-68; 54 grants, amounting to £2,449 were given in 1968-69; and 22 grants, amounting to £1,551 were given in 1969-70.  The reconstruction on one elderly person's home in 1968-69 amounted to £3,960; in 1969-70 £2,780 was spent on one person's home.  A grant was given for essential repairs to an old person's home in 1968-69 amounting to £86.</P>
    <P>These figures give the House some idea of how Dublin County Council is trying to cope with the ever-increasing demand for houses.  It must be remembered that they have to provide roads and other essential services as well.  There is still a great demand for houses in industrial areas like Tallaght and Balbriggan where more and more new industries are coming in.</P>
    <P>Dublin county council has lost several members of their technical staff due to private enterprise being able to pay more than the council. I know the Minister is aware of the situation and I will not, therefore, labour that.</P>
    <P>In 1963 the north Dublin regional water scheme was started; yet today many people are crying out for more and more water.  We have received complaints about the water supply in many of the new housing estates and while these complaints are justified <Col N="985" /> we are hoping to remedy the situation through the north Dublin regional water scheme on one side of the city and the south regional water scheme on the other.  We have no magic wand to provide these amenities for the people overnight but, if the people would have a little patience, the Department, the council and the council's staff are doing their best to have these matters expedited.</P>
    <P>Rates in County Dublin have gone up by 11/- in the £ this year.  We are faced with the expense of providing amenities that might have been provided 20 years ago.  There was no money available to do them at the time.</P>

      <P>The population explosion which has taken place in the city and county of Dublin during the last ten years was not anticipated. When people come to a place and stay there, more accommodation is required and we have to meet that position and it is a very expensive matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must express my thanks to the Minister and his Department for the help they are giving us.  We have a big waiting list and the demand will increase with the years.  We hope during the coming year to finish at least 400 houses in County Dublin and there are another 300 in the pipeline.  If we can maintain progress at the rate of <Col N="986" /> 400 houses a year we will soon wipe out the backlog.  The big industrial revival has created a huge problem in regard to housing.  Although I have been an alderman of the city for a few years, I shall not deal with the position in the city; Deputy Dowling has dealt with that; I shall deal with the county exclusively.</P>
    <P>I have discussed with the Minister the matter of the B rental scheme and know his views on it.  The majority of those that I have spoken to from Coolock.  Kilmore and Ballymun, have not any objection to the B scheme as such.  Their objection is to an assessment after 13 or 14 weeks.  If a man or some member of his family is on overtime, that is taken into account in the assessment.  I would suggest that a social welfare officer or some other official should deal with this matter once a fortnight, so that if a man's earnings had gone up by £2 or £3 in one week that could be assessed immediately.  The big problem is created by the delay in the assessment which means that the tenants have to meet a big debt.  I must pay this compliment to the officials of the revenue department of Dublin Corporation: they have been most helpful and considerate and have tried to meet the wishes of the tenants and of their public representatives.  If an assessment were made every week or every fortnight a great deal of trouble would be eliminated.</P>
    <P>This would cut two ways.  If a man were ill, it should be sufficient proof to produce a medical certificate to that effect.  This should entitle him to a rent reduction.  If there were that kind of give and take arrangement, much of the bitterness, which has been magnified by many people, would be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of roads out of the city.  I have been for almost 12 years a member of local authorities.  I do not suppose I would ever have stood for election for a local authority but for the fact that I wanted to deal with the question of roads, housing and various other matters from within.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the north Dublin road.  The Minister has contributed a good deal.  I understand that the <Col N="987" /> latest information that the Department has in relation to the Santry bypass is that the consultants have recently submitted to the Dublin County Council a report on the roads requirements between the city and the airport; that this report has been examined by the county council but has not yet been submitted to the Department: that this matter was dealt with about three weeks ago and it is hoped to get the manager to submit proposals to the Department as soon as possible; that simultaneously with the examiniation of this report, the council are looking forward to the land acquisition involved and are preparing a compulsory purchase order in order to avoid delay, should they be unable to obtain land by agreement.  It is very difficult to obtain land by agreement in County Dublin.  It is understood that the consultants' scheme envisages a bypass on the east of Santry along the line of an existing motorway; preservation as far as Coolock Lane; that the bypass would be of dual carriageway standard and would later be extended to Turnapin Lane and then join up with the projected bypass at Swords.  It is hoped that there will be no delay in the council's examination, recommendation and submission of proposals but deficiency of staff in the council may cause some holdup.  I am very pleased to get that report from the Department and the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have often referred before to the roads leaving Dublin, and especially from certain parts of the city.  They are really only prairie tracks.  They are too narrow.  Where I am living in Santry the traffic is chock-a-block.  When buses and cars are held up on their way to the airport they try to pass one another.  Really we need a four, five or six lane road to take the traffic from the city on the north side.  A lot of work has been done on the Naas Road. We are very proud of that road but the Naas Road and the Belfast Road to the north are too narrow.  A number of accidents have happened due to people trying to pass one another and running into oncoming traffic.</P>
    <P>I wonder would it be possible to give us a roads engineer or adviser <Col N="988" /> so that we can get this problem solved. From Pinnock Hill to Turvey Avenue is a very dangerous road.  There is a white line on the centre of the road from Swords almost to Turvey Hill. The result is that if you are following slow traffic and if you are in a hurry, you are tempted to cross the white line, although it is illegal to do so.  If a man is going to a wedding or a funeral or trying to keep an appointment he may be held up on the road there.  I am not talking about myself. The Parliamentary Secretary looked at me when I mentioned funerals, but I always go in time.  The same applies to the Bray Road.  We are trying to solve that problem too.  One of my colleagues has raised this matter on a few occasions.</P>

      <P>It is in County Dublin.  One of the great headaches for every councillor and for the administrative staff of the council is the unfinished housing estates.  In a large number of unfinished housing estates the developers have not co-operated with the members of the council.  When Deputy Blaney was Minister for Local Government he consulted with the members of the council and his advisers told him to put section 35 into the 1963 Planning Act.  I thought it was a cure for all ills, but when it was tested it was found that the legislation was not retrospective and there are certain estates which we have had to develop at our own expense with a vote from the council.  I know I cannot advocate amending legislation at the moment but I want to say in passing that something should be done to amend section 35.  The case of the Donnelly Estate in Castleknock has been going on for about four years and still has not reached finality.  His solicitor has said that we have not got any power in this matter.  We have asked our legal adviser to give us another résumé of the case.  In fact, we have gone to another legal adviser.  It was thrown out of court because the Act did not cover it. We have got a lot of legal advice on this case.  This type of thing holds us up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> The great majority of our developers are very anxious to meet the requirements of the council and they are easy enough to deal with but we also have the problem of open spaces which are provided for under the Planning Act for recreational centres. In a few cases we came up against, the solicitors to the developers claimed that theirs was a private open space and that the county council had no rights to it at all.  The result was that when we wanted to take over these open spaces we had to pay for them. I admit that the developer had to buy this land and if we take nine or ten acres to keep as an open space in justice we should pay for them, but I should like to see a clearer legal definition of the position.  A very small percentage, about .001 of the developers, have challenged us on this.  The others were only too delighted to give the spaces.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to public lighting.  We had sub-standard lighting in county Dublin and this year we have decided to try to improve it.  We are trying to improve the public lighting in the various estates and housing areas of the county.  The Minister and the Department give a 100 per cent grant for public lighting on main roads or new roads.  We appreciate that very much and any of the roads we have developed under this scheme are really very good.</P>
    <P>Pedestrian crossings on main roads are of very little use.  I have raised this at our own council meetings.  There is a pedestrian crossing at Palmerstown. This is a very busy road to the west. There are no lights for pedestrians to use, with the result that if you are crossing at night you cannot be seen and you have to take a chance when a car is coming.  We have a pedestrian crossing at Santry which is used by children.  A few thousand children use it every day.  They have got into the habit of pressing the button themselves.  I should like the Department to give a direction on the lighting of these pedestrian crossings because some of our engineers are resisting it. This would probably prevent fatal accidents.</P>
    <P>For 11 months of the year the <Col N="990" /> residents' associations in county Dublin want everything from us and for one month when we are striking the rates they abuse us.  We get all the abuse possible for about one months of the year and for the other 11 months they are pressing every councillor, no matter who he is, for more and more services: amenity schemes, parks for children, parks for clubs, grants for clubs.  This is all part and parcel of a growing population, especially in housing estates.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in swimming pools.  Private enterprise has provided some swimming pools.  I know it is a big problem but I am more concerned with housing and other things.  I believe the Minister for Local Government should be relieved of all responsibility for grants for swimming pools. He has quite enough to do in other directions.  At the same time, swimming pools would be a tremendous tourist attraction.  They would, of course, be first-class amenities for the local people and, if a local committee were organised, I believe local people would be quite prepared to contribute to the cost of these pools.  I have never known a local association that did not do its very best in matters of this kind.  We have bought a great deal of land in County Dublin for sportsfields.  The more we provide the more people want but that is their prerogative and their right.</P>
    <P>We have not yet adopted a general plan in County Dublin but I hope that we will do so within the next three or four months.  Only when we have adopted a plan will we know exactly where we stand.  Development generally, both industrial and private, depends to a large extent on how fast we can provide the various sewerage and water schemes required.</P>
    <P>The development of Skerries has been on the stocks for a long time.  I would need a magic wand to get all the money I want for County Dublin. The tourist industry is worth over £100,000,000 and, inside the next ten years, it should be worth £200,000,000. There is need for various facilities, such as toilet facilities on our beaches.  I have never known the Department to delay in important matters.  Nevertheless, <Col N="991" /> we have our problems.  We have the problem of beach guards.  There have been tragedies along the Dublin coast.  It is no longer easy to get these beach guards and I was wondering if the army would co-operate.  There is a social aspect to this.  It is impossible for one man to look after two or three miles of shore.  There is, of course, the fact that children today are learning to swim and that will in time help to reduce tragedies.  The Minister and his Department have been most helpful to me and it would be ungracious of me not to acknowledge that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a county not as favourably circumstanced as Deputy Burke's.  I come from a county which has lost 84,000 in population since 1901.  That reflects, in my opinion, on successive Governments in the last 50 years.  They have done very little for a county which did much to achieve our independence.  My county has the highest rate of any county&mdash; a rate of 107/- in the £.  Yesterday the auditor in Castlebar told me that the rate next year will be something in the region of 117/- in the £.</P>

      <P>We have the biggest road mileage of any county in the country. At the moment we have 1,717 miles of road, and we have only 940.5 miles of tarred road.  Several suggestions have been made to the Minister to divert the main road and the arterial road grants for three years to help us to black-top some of our roads.  Our young people, in particular, are becoming very discontented.  Because there are no amenities they are leaving the county.  My constitutency is 98 miles long, a little more than half the distance from there to Dublin.  Therefore, you cannot call Mayo a county.  It is in fact a region.  I sincerely appeal to the Minister if he cannot give us an increased grant to at least give us some extra money which would help us to alleviate the hardship of some of the people in that county.  I do not <Col N="992" /> believe in any other county there are 1,717 miles of untarred roads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that as a result of the poor surface on the roads in our county the cost per mile is much greater than it would be where you have solid ground.  We have a great amount of rock and this is no help to us in the construction of those roads. Every member of the Mayo County Council is anxious that we get some increased grant so I would appeal to the Minister to do something about it.</P>
      <P>We have in our county a greater housing problem than in any other county in Ireland.  In Mayo 4,700 houses are condemned.  This is as a result of a survey taken by the technical staff in the county.  I believe the present grant of £900 is not sufficient. When the increased cost of materials and labour is taken into account that grant should be increased by at least £200.  We have a certain number of factory workers, CIE workers and other workers of this type who are anxious to build houses of their own but who cannot avail of this £900 grant except under certain conditions.  I hope the Minister can see his way to increase this grant and make it a general thing for workers as well as for farmers. This would be a great asset and a help to young people who are anxious to settle down in this country and try to make a living in it.  The first thing they must do is to provide a house for themselves.  Workers up to a certain income should be able to qualify for that £900 grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Mayo County Council as well as in other counties we have essential repair grants of which £80 is received from the Department and £120 from the local authority.  However, this £120 will do very little today.  If this grant could be increased by at least £40 it would mean that it would be the same amount as the money we are contributing for essential repairs.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider this.  This is a terrible hardship on older people in particular who, <Col N="993" /> not through their own fault, but because of sickness or something else, have failed to keep up with essential repairs.  Some of those people have not any financial support except social welfare, the St. Vincent de Paul or something else like that.  I would be greateful to the Minister if he would seriously consider this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>In my county we pay £120 for essential repairs and £80 is paid in the Parliamentary Secretary's county.  I am a member of the local authority and I know this is what is given.  However, I know that in doing this the Minister would have to make it a general thing throughout the country.  We have in my county a great number of small farmers and we have something in the region of 400 applications for the small farm scheme house at the moment of which the Department have sanctioned 15.  This to my mind is the type of house we should have been building for the past four years.  It was Government legislation which said that those houses should be built.  I believe that those houses should be built to help large families in small holdings who can never provide a house for themselves.  Those people would get an opportunity of having a home.  I have seen in my own locality houses where there are only two or three rooms and boys and girls have been mixed up together.  This should not happen in this modern age.  When we send up schemes for sanction I hope the Minister will give approval to as many of them as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see how the people in Mayo, particularly the people in the small towns, will be able to pay rates in the next two to three years.  Health alone cost us 45/10d last year.  I know I might be departing from Local Government but, if you will allow me for the moment, I want to say that I cannot see how the small towns in our county can exist if something is not done to completely eliminate <Col N="994" /> this health charge from the rates. It should be eliminated from the rates after seven to eight years.  This year the health charges will be 47/10d and I think our health charges alone are as high as the entire rates in some counties in the country.  As a result of our small valuations and the amount we can take in on the rates, something will have to be done eventually for the west of Ireland or our small towns will die. Our towns have dwindling populations and a trend towards emigration.  The county development planners and the technical advisers have stated that the emigration trend in County Mayo will be even greater unless something drastic is done in the near future.  The problems of our people in County Mayo are great.</P>
    <P>We have water and sewerage services.  About three or four years ago every householder was circulated with a document concerning a water supply for the household.  Every local authority was advised to carry out a survey of the county with a view to providing regional water supply schemes for the whole country.  We employed technical staff, consulting engineers, <i>et cetera</i> at a cost of approximately £77,000.  The Department decided that the regional schemes were not feasible.  We had to borrow money to pay the technical staff and engineers.  There were a few minor extensions to the water supply schemes.  Everybody was encouraged to avail of group schemes.  The programme for water and sewerage services fell short of the requirements. Sufficient money was not available. There is a desperate shortage of water in the homes.  Our grants are too small. The majority of our people are without running water.  In many cases people are interested in group schemes and are prepared to pay the local contributions. Perhaps the Minister would sanction such schemes as soon as they come to his Department.  We would then have a chance of getting water into rural homes in our county.</P>
    <P>We have heard of schemes, we have read reports and statement, and we have been told of events which might help us.  I see very little happening in my constituency which might help the people there.  Some time ago a statement <Col N="995" /> was made that the Department of Lands were to come to Mayo.  They have not come.  We now hear that industries are to be established in the county.  Unless something like this happens the people in our small towns will not be able to pay the rates demanded of them.  Some people have large old buildings with high valuations.  They will not be able to pay the rates if all our young people emigrate.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the driving tests, I appeal to the Minister to adopt a system which operates in England and on the Continent whereby someone wishing to have a driving test can go to the nearest place where a test will be carried out and does not have to wait for a driving test centre in his own county.  The centres in my area are Tuam, Ballina and Castlebar.  Some times young teachers qualify and are anxious to take up appointments.  Such young people must have a car and are anxious to undergo driving tests.  The Department are very co-operative in this.  It would help if such a person could be directed to the nearest place at the earliest stage where his test could be held.</P>

      <P>This system applies in England and should apply generally here.  A public statement on this matter should be made.  We are allocated about £40,000 a year for local improvement schemes and the onus is on the local authority to allocate this money where they wish.  In my county they decided to allocate it entirely to roads, but it is the opinion of the local authority that more money should be available for drainage where people cannot benefit from arterial drainage and never can benefit.  If the Minister could say that a certain proportion of the money allocated from his Department which was always spent on drainage, should be spent on drainage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think so in this case because normally the Minister always allocated money from his Department for drainage.  At least one-quarter of that money should be allocated to drainage.  We have a problem about planning in our county.  Sometimes we have disagreements between the planning officer and the council and I should like the Minister's views on this matter.  We had many cases in which we had to invoke section 4 for people building houses or engaging in developments.  As a local authority we considered those people were justified and we had to invoke section 4.</P>
      <P>A farmer who was developing his farm and who had no other place to build a machinery and grain shed, was denied planning permission for the site he selected even though it was inside his own fence and inside a line of trees along a tarred road but at the same time the Department of Posts and Telegraphs built a post office in Claremorris six feet away from an arterial road.  Why is it that a Department may build within six feet of a tarred road when a farmer who is an asset to the community is deprived of planning permission?  I would ask the Minister to deal with appeals in a proper manner so that those who are trying to make a living and rear families should not be deprived of planning permission merely because a planning officer may think such-and-such a development should not take place.</P>

      <P>In any case, I appeal to the Minister to help in any way possible to alleviate the desperate situation in our country, especially if he could divert or allow the diversion of main road or arterial road money to drainage.  I know this has been refused by the Department but it would certainly help to relieve the position in a major way.  Finally, I appeal to the Minister to remember when we send him our housing programme for sanction that we have 4,700 unfit houses in our county and to give sanction as early as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I Congratulate the Minister on his very comprehensive introductory speech on this Estimate.  I am not often moved to congratulate the Minister for Local Government but in view of the fine statement he presented to us, and which was prepared by the departmental staff, our appreciation should be put on record.  The second point I want to make at the outset is that the Department of Local Government is one of the most effective and efficient Departments.  While my involvement with the Department in recent years has been confined to the annual review of housing, particularly under the National Industrial and Economic Council, I think, in the light of my contact with other Departments&mdash;notably Industry and Commerce and Labour&mdash;that the level of expertise, departmental competence and general openness within it, bearing in mind that it operates in an extremely sensitive political area, makes it in every way more effective and it gives far greater hope for the future of Parliamentary democracy and development than some other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tend to forget in this House that the past ten years, whether the Opposition like it or not, have been a period of extremely significant and major growth in the construction industries. Housing developments is certainly not as good or as effective or as massive as we want it to be&mdash;this is our main criticism&mdash;but nevertheless it has been an area of major development.  The <Col N="999" /> building industry which is so closely allied to the Department of Local Government is now the second largest industry in the country accounting for ten per cent of our total gross national product.  Employing some 75,000 people last year&mdash;I am sure it has gone up by about 4,000 or 5,000 now&mdash;it accounts for seven per cent or eight per cent of the total number employed.</P>
    <P>I do not ascribe that growth or development to any level of competence or ability on the part of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Blaney, when he was Minister for Local Government, had my respect and admiration for a great many of his attitudes.  He was one of the finest Ministers for Local Government we had, apart from the late Deputy T. J. Murphy.  They were probably the two best Ministers for Local Government the country has had.  The Department have reflected the fact that the economy has developed and must develop at an ever increasing pace if we are to emerge as a major developed country in the future.  It must be put on record that if tonight one were to look down on this country from a satellite one would get a very puzzling and, in many respects, a rather shocking picture of the way we live, the way our environment is developing and the way it has been developed in the past ten or 20 years. A man from outer space looking down, or a politician from inner space looking in, would report that between one city and another, between one town and another, there are anomalies.  If one looks at the private home of the Minister for Finance or goes out to Raheny and looks at Deputy Blaney's home and looks at the pleasant landscape around the home of Deputy Kevin Boland in Rathcoole one will find some quite distinctive homes in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not destroy the praise he gave the Minister before he came in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1000" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every intention of continuing.  Even the constituency I represent, the dormant, affluent suburb of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, could be regarded as having such a landscape, although I shall have some sharp comments to make about that and its problems later on.</P>
      <P>One is very conscious also that there are many areas where the very poor quality of Irish housing is evident. There are many thousands of homes which have not even got such an elementary facility as a piped water supply.  I do not have to tell the Minister that.  The Buchanan Report tells us that in the rural areas in 1966 only four out of every ten houses had a piped water supply as against 97 per cent of all houses in towns.  The report also said that much progress had been made and that the cost of extending piped services presented formidable problems, as it does.  Anybody looking down on Ireland would say: &ldquo;Fair enough, five out of every ten homes have got the elementary human facility of a piped water supply and sanitary facility.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If one looks at the urban areas one sees sprawling estates with no environmental harmoney.  One sees, ringing each one of our cities, a patchwork of identical ticky-tacky industrial and housing estates with drab urban centres, particularly in Dublin.  Limerick has an urban centre which is only now slowly coming out of the trough of general depression in that city and, indeed, parts of Cork up to quite recently were in a slum and tenement condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is fitting that we in the Labour and Opposition benches, while we have congratulated the Minister on an exceptionally fine opening statement, should point out to him that our desire is to see the standard of Irish life raised to a far higher and more civilised level.  I appreciate that this will cost a great deal of money and require a great deal of long-term urban planning but this is what a Department of Local Government and its Estimate is all about.  We must ask ourselves how do we go about this task.  It is my opinion&mdash;and I do not think this is divine inspiration, it is a <Col N="1001" /> fairly universal opinion round the country particularly among rural Deputies and councillors&mdash;that the local government system itself seems not to be in a position to adapt itself to the new demands now being made upon it for the future development of the national economy and for the expansion of the social services and of the health services, many of them administered within the traditional framework of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>This is one aspect in which I would strongly fault the Minister in relation to his speech.  It is regrettable that in a speech which ran to 70 pages there was not one mention of the Taoiseach's indication that there would be a recasting of ministerial responsibility in respect of physical planning and development, apart from a vague indication that this is in the pipeline.  We are entering the 70s and it is time the Government made up their minds. There is a strongly held belief throughout the country that we need a more progressive and meaningful system of local government, not just the Department of Local Government, for the development of a more democratic system of government.  It is time that we took a sharp look at the whole system of local government.  It may not be particularly fashionable with some Deputies, indeed it may be that some members of my own Party may not agree, but at least we do not have a hard-line policy attitude of total intransigence in these matters such as one finds within Fianna Fáil where the front bench speaks and the rest of the Party stay silent for five years, but I feel it is time we changed the whole system of local government based on the old inheritance of the British colonial system of the last century. It is very deficient in many important respects and at county council level, at urban council level, at town commission level, it does not have the necessary dynamism to cope with the major problems of housing, planning, development, pollution, urban renewal, conservation and so on, the massive problems facing local government on a regional and general basis.  I, therefore, suggest to the House that it is time we considered development on a <Col N="1002" /> regionalisation basis.  I know it is not particularly fashionable.  I know that Deputies Boland and Colley are suffering from an eternal throb and a lot of old hat.  They require the old-fashioned style republic of having a town council in every commissioner's area while at the same time maintaining a virtual oligarchy in their Departments.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of thinking we find, if one would classify it as thinking. The Department of Industry and Commerce want a factory in every town but they end up without a factory in the country.  Bearing in mind that the health services have been finally and irrevocably reconstituted on a regional system of administration, the Minister should indicate to us in his reply that the local government system in general will be realigned and reclassed accordingly.  It is appalling that though we have this regional system in respect of the health services we have something different in regard to local government generally and a national departmental administration system in respect of unemployment and social welfare.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest to the Minister to get rid of the confusion there is at the moment.  He has spoken about re-organising the road services on a national general basis.  We have proposed reconstitution of his entire Department in regard to replanning. We have had proposals on replanning in the Buchanan Report and we have recommendations by the Devlin Committee.  Earlier today we passed the new Health Act which will be administered on a regional basis.  Yet the Minister sits quietly by not sure of the kind of Santa Claus he will finish up as.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must take into account&mdash;I throw it out tentatively&mdash; would be complete realignment of the local government system on a regional basis as outlined in the new Health Act.  By that I do not mean that the local authorities themselves would be abolished.  If there is one way of getting rid of the kind of professionalism which is so resented throughout the country, whereby everybody is crucifying Dublin all the time as being responsible for the sole administration of the country, it is by passing down <Col N="1003" /> power to the regions of the country, particularly to the west and south.  The only way to get rid of this national complex which we have is to develop regional local government on a more effective basis.  I, therefore, suggest that the Minister might try to do this. I know we are to have a White Paper on the structure of local government. This would not mean that the existing borough corporations&mdash;Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Waterford, Limerick and so on&mdash;would be abolished.  I simply mean that there would be greater devolution of regional services.  Beyond that, I do not wish to develop this theme unduly.  I do, of course, urge on the Minister to consult closely with the trade unions concerned.  There has been a great deal of nonsense talked about participatory democracy and then we get a White Paper from the Minister, drafted by the officers of his Department, involving no changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consult widely and generally.  The proposals in the Radcliffe Report on the metropolitan regional concept have received considerable support in Britain, notably within the British Labour Party. They have been welcomed by many councillors and Members of Parliament and consideration is being given to them.</P>
    <P>Having made these points.  I want to deal with another phenomenon which we tend to ignore very much in our discussions here.  It is the failure in the country and in Dublin to appreciate that a great deal of our housing and planning problems and urban renewal problems, particularly those that have come about in the greater Dublin area, are not entirely the fault of the Minister.  We have not been altogether fair in our criticisms of the Minister.  It is a fact that in Dublin we have had quite a phenomenal growth in population. Although I am not in any way congratulatory to the Minister, it must be put on record that the population of Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire, including their environs, has increased from 640,000 in 1959 to 780,000 in 1969, an increase of 22 per cent.  In the same period, the population of the other cities and towns has increased from <Col N="1004" /> 930,000 to 977,000, a mere increase of 4 per cent.  It is only in that demographic context that one can try to come to grips with the problem.  The trouble is that the Minister has failed to face up to the housing problem or to come to grips with it in the Dublin area and Fianna Fáil can be faulted that they have not come to grips with the problem.  They seem to give the impression that they are almost ashamed of what has happened.  I get this feeling particularly when I meet Deputy Boland in by-elections in the country&mdash;a reluctance to admit that he lives and works in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Migration has continued and the greater Dublin area has developed a dynamism and now comprises 800,000 people.  On that basis we certainly have a problem to come to grips with.  I urge the Minister, since they did not do it originally, to try to come to grips with the Wright Report and the general recommendations contained therein.  The report recommended a central planning agency for the whole of the Dublin region.  We must realise that had we done certain things, by and large we could have solved some of the serious problems in Dublin in relation to urban renewal, housing, major planning developments and so on; in relation to consumer expenditure in the supermarkets and right down the line; the major problems of health; placing of hospitals, and so forth&mdash;all of them within the infrastructure of the greater Dublin region itself.</P>
    <P>The second point in that regard I want to make&mdash;and faulting the Government&mdash;is, of course, the cursory and in my opinion, rather disgraceful comments made by the Minister.  I exempt his departmental staff.  I am aware of some of the happenings, in terms of attitude, within the Cabinet.  I refer to the quite disgraceful passing-by in his statement on the Buchanan Report.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be a particular advocate of regionalism, as such. However, I suggest to the Minister that this kind of cavalier attitude on his part towards the Buchanan Report is uncalled for.  For example, in page 47 of his brief, the Minister refers to proposals&mdash;proposals of cost, and so on; various evaluations, perhaps, due <Col N="1005" /> to take place.  This is a report which is now well-published, which is available to the Government and which has been on the Cabinet agenda month after month and on which no decision has emerged.  Nevertheless, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>...the Government is not in a position to say whether or not, or to what extent, the recommendations in the Buchanan Report might be relevant in such a programme.</P>
    <P>Whatever that means.  It is, I think, a kind of polite, Civil Service jargon interpreting the indecision of their own Minister.  They, being exempt, are trying to comfort him within the vocabulary of a Minister's speech.  Indeed, I think it is fair to say that at least the Minister did put in his speech what Buchanan generally proposed. He said, on page 45:</P>
    <P>Having considered alternative extremes and various in-between courses reflecting different degrees of concentration and dispersal the consultants recommended, first, that there should be a special expansion programme for the Cork and Limerick areas as counters to Dublin and to improve the country's international capacity to attract industry and absorb migration. Secondly, they recommended that a special measure of expansion should be promoted in six regional centres to exploit regional potential. Thirdly, in areas remote from these centres, the consultants envisaged that local growth centres would be designated and a concentrated effort made to develop commercial, administrative and industrial services in them for the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>That is what one would call an elementary, rational, coherent and constructive assimilation of the massive work that went into this report and the various appendices which had been made available.  Yet the Minister, the Taoiseach, notably Deputy Colley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who wants his weaving-shed in every town and village, cannot make up their minds.  As a result, I would strongly suggest to the Minister that regional economic development in this country is being seriously impeded by that <Col N="1006" /> kind of obscurantist thinking within the Cabinet itself.  I think, therefore, there is a good deal of fault to be found with the Government in failing to make up their mind in that matter.</P>
    <P>Having placed the initial aspects on record, I want to go on to the housing section of the Minister's statement.  I want to start off by congratulating the Minister on that section.  I know it is very fashionable in this House generally to denounce Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government&mdash;in that respect, he is his own worst enemy in terms of defending himself &mdash;in respect of the housing record of the Government.  I think it must be placed generally on record that, by and large, there has been continuous development of new house-building in the country.  Where the Labour Party and where I am quite sure the Opposition parties strongly differ from the Minister is that it is not, as yet, by any manner of means, as massive and as great in development as we want. I think this in fact is the issue.  It is not a question of bandying across the Dáil Chamber or in any municipal authority statements such as &ldquo;You built so many houses in 1957&rdquo;.  Quite frankly, I was 20 years of age then and completely unfamiliar with the gyrations of the various Ministers for Local Government at that time.</P>
    <P>There is the reality of the number of new dwellings completed: in 1966-67, 11,000; 1967-68, 12,000; 1968-69, 13,000 and 1969-70, 14,000. That is the data issued by the Department of Local Government, housing administration section, in January, 1970, the latest general information available.  Here are the figures for the number of &ldquo;starts&rdquo;, dwellings begun or authorised, in terms of information available: 1968-69, 14,400 roughly, starts begun or authorised; 1969-70, a total of up to some 17,000.  I would be politically dishonest if I did not admit that those figures for housing development are impressive.  I do not think we should be unduly preoccupied on the Opposition side of the House in saying that this is not so.  However, in terms of what is needed, in terms of meeting the explosion in the Dublin area, in terms of meeting a basic human need &mdash;ranking only second to food in this <Col N="1007" /> country&mdash;then the record is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>We in the Opposition benches wish to assure the Minister that even his best efforts will not go unrecognised on our part but most certainly we shall keep lighting a fire under him to make sure he does even better in future.  This is the purpose of politics.  Therefore, I would point out to the Minister, taking the figures I mentioned there of 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 houses&mdash;that, on page 9 of his own White Paper <i>Housing in the Seventies,</i> he states, in effect, that, by the mid-1970s, &ldquo;if the projections for losses of dwellings and for increases in the number of households materialise, needs will be nationally about 15,000 to 17,000 houses a year&rdquo;. The population in 1971 will provide a check on these projections.  Therefore, we can say that the Minister, at this point of time, is running 3,000, 4,000, maybe 5,000 houses short in terms of meeting the country's general requirements.</P>
    <P>This has also been commented on by a number of economists.  There is one particular quotation which I should like to place on record from Michael Greene of the Federation of Builders, perhaps an unduly carping comment in some respects but nevertheless true in terms of its analysis.  He stated, for example, that in 1946 our stock of dwellings in the country was 662,000. By 1961 this had increased to only 676,000 despite the fact that 128,000 new dwellings were completed in the period.  He stated that the small increase of 2.1 per cent can be accounted for only by the fact that many of the houses built contributed to the replacement of the existing stock of dwellings. He further stated that if a similar rate of stock replacement is assumed for the period 1962-69 then the net addition to the stock of dwellings has only been in the order of 11,000.  Considering, he said, that in 1961 75 per cent of our dwellings were pre-World War II and 58 per cent were pre-World War I, the problem of replacement of the stock of houses, not to mind increasing it, is most likely to become even greater.  I certainly concur with this view.</P>
    <P>With the growth in the marriage <Col N="1008" /> rate, with the increase generally in the population, we will still have, at the current rate of expansion, a rather serious and very difficult housing problem.  One aspect of this matter irritates me.  It is what I call the political statistical aspect&mdash;the bland tossing across the Chamber of &ldquo;5,000 people in Dublin need houses&rdquo;, or 7,000, or 10,000, and there is very little consideration generally for the number of families and people directly involved. I know it is a mere statistical point but one has got to examine it to appreciate the full dimensions of the housing problem generally.</P>
    <P>If we take the lowest possible figure for Dublin, 5,000 families on the general application list&mdash;a figure that has been mentioned so often that it has become accepted whether it is correct or not&mdash;and if we say each family consists of four persons, this means that in the Dublin Corporation area there are 20,000 persons in need of housing as defined under the Act.  In the Dún Laoghaire area which I represent there are 450 families on the housing approved list; this means there are 1,800 people, on the basis of four per family which is the minimum figure, in urgent need of housing.  In County Dublin the Minister has admitted that the record is rather disappointing.  There are&mdash;and I am quoting the Minister&mdash;1,400 families on the approved housing list and, again on the basis of four per family, we get a figure of 5,600 persons in need of housing.  On a very simple statistical exercise there are at least between 28,000 and 35,000 persons in the greater Dublin area in urgent need of housing and I would stress that I am using data provided by the Minister's own Department.</P>
    <P>While one must recognise the growth there has been in housing in Dublin, nevertheless, the dimension of the current serious problem is something which the Minister has tended to ignore on a number of occasions even if it is only on a political defensive basis that he does not want to be caught out.  If he admitted the true situation as he did in respect of Dublin County Council we would all have a far greater respect and understanding of the problem.  Though we see a prob- <Col N="1009" /> lem in the dimension of between 28,000 and 35,000 people in need of housing, it is only when those of us who are in public life, the social workers, the housing staff of various local authorities, the engineering staffs on the local authorities who must inspect housing conditions, as well as the clergy who are continuously making representations to relieve the critical situation that exists, have to witness the appalling family frustrations that one becomes quite irate about the general situation.</P>
    <P>It is time we stopped the pretence of having a very Christian concern for the housing situation.  I have met many families where internal family dissension and frustration exist; where husband and wife do not live together because there is no room for them to do so; where there is a high infant mortality rate arising from such housing conditions; where problem families exist because there is overcrowding and so on and where we have what can only be classified as rent exploitation particularly in respect of flats.  It is only when one comes into first-hand contact with these conditions that one appreciates that our scale of social priorities must be rather cockeyed.</P>
    <P>When I witness in the greater Dublin area the fact that money is never scarce for office blocks; never scarce for exotic supermarkets in our suburban areas; never scarce for the plush hotels of whatever political complexion you want in terms of their erection; when money is not in the least scarce for the large supergarages erected throughout the country, one begins to realise that the social priorities in terms of revolution of attitudes of the present Government are rather sparse and the social conscience is rather marginal in terms of general impact.  Should the Minister care to take a morning off I will bring him to his own constituency&mdash;from Shankill to Dundrum, to South County Dublin; I shall bring him to Dún Laoghaire, to Rembrandt House in Monkstown; I shall bring him to No. 2 Crosthwaite Park, a tenement slum in Dún Laoghaire, and I will introduce him to some of the housing conditions in that constituency which would certainly stir the conscience of his party if it does not stir the consciences of the <Col N="1010" /> local authorities themselves.  I would strongly urge the Minister to be frank with us in his reaction to these comments.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect on which I should like to congratulate the Minister&mdash; and it is only fitting that it be placed on record&mdash;and that is his deep and very laudable concern as a Member of the Cabinet for the integration of the itinerants into the community.  The very obvious personal concern of the Minister in this respect must be placed on record.  Having regard to the statements made by him, and particularly his adamant attitude that a Government Department or a voluntary committee cannot make proper arrangements for the education of the children of such families unless they have a permanent place to stay, we can say that whatever about housing in general as far as the itinerants are concerned the Minister's heart is in the right place and he has my admiration and thanks for his attitude in this respect.  I support him in his condemnation and denouncement, and as he classifies it &ldquo;a grave dereliction of duty&rdquo;, on the part of those local authorities who have not yet provided sites to cater for the needs of itinerants in their areas despite the very generous financial assistance offered by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>Passing to the aspect relating to building societies the Minister was a little coy and unduly quiet in relation to his proposals affecting building societies.  The Minister did point out that these societies enjoy certain arrangements in regard to income tax and dividends payable by them which makes investment with them quite attractive.  He went on further and said the public had a right to expect that the concessions the building societies enjoy will be used in the interests of the community.  It was for this reason that the Minister announced last June that the Government proposed to review present taxation arrangements with a view to favouring societies who invest their funds in the way most likely to help our housing programme, that is, those societies who invest not less than 90 per cent of their total advances for house purchase loans not exceeding £6,000 or any other sum that <Col N="1011" /> the Minister for Local Government may fix from time to time.  The Minister stated that the review was in progress and that it was intended it would also deal with the associated question of the societies' infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I welcome that statement on the part of the Minister because we have tended to underestimate the general growth of building societies.  After 33 years of fairly intensive growth, the country's five big building societies have assets of almost £60 million in the State and, if one is to judge by their rate of growth during the past 20 years, there can be no doubt but that by the end of the 1970s their assets will exceed the £100 million mark.  Therefore, it is only right and proper that the State should have a sharp look at the role of these societies.  In many respects they should be made accountable to the public, just as they should be made more responsive to the social needs of the community so that some of the nonsense which is heard from their spokesmen from time to time in relation to the activities of the Department of Local Government might be disregarded.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would be less cautious in his attitude towards them because, after all, there are four years in which to write off the electoral storms.  If the Opposition Parties are buttered up with donations from the directors of the building societies for the next general election campaign or for any other campaign that may develop&mdash;I can assure the House that the contributions to our party from that direction were rather sparse&mdash;I am quite sure that the Minister would be well able to recover his points over four years.  Should the Minister introduce these regulations as a matter of urgency I have no doubt that he would have the support of every Deputy on this side of the House.  I have been appalled at the cavalier treatment by the building societies of house purchasers and borrowers.  I have had many letters from constituents, particularly in the dormitory suburb area of Dún Laghaire-Rathdown where there have been bitter complaints about the attitude of building societies in relation to interest rate changes.  The time <Col N="1012" /> is long overdue for the Minister to take action on interest rates.</P>
    <P>A further aspect with which I should like to deal in relation to new houses is one for which I am not quite certain that there is ministerial responsibility but, nevertheless, one which is part of the housing costs generally: legal charges.  While the Minister for Justice may be involved in the legal end, I would urge the Minister for Local Government to work very closely with the Minister for Justice on the question of legal charges for the building of new houses.  It is a disgrace that the State has not acted in the common good and with much greater vehemence in this matter.  It is wrong that the Minister for Local Government should urge greater productivity in the construction industry, that the Taoiseach should urge trade unionists to accept a seven per cent ceiling on wage rounds and that the Minister for Finance should impose rigid credit restrictions while a legal operator can collect his fee of two per cent irrespective of the growth in the cost of housing, that he can collect his legal fees on what I would consider a restrictive basis&mdash;a basis which, in my opinion, means that he is skimming the cream off the inflation in the cost of housing generally.  The fact that the Minister for Justice happens to be a solicitor should not inhibit the Minister for Local Government in any way in making representations to him on this matter.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of auctioneers' fees.  This is an element of housing costs over which the State should exercise some control.  If the Government wish to have a judicial inquiry&mdash;I understand the current one is costing more than £200,000&mdash;and if they wish to spend money in a better setting, they could have an impartial judicial inquiry into legal charges in respect of auctioneers' charges with relation to house sale and purchase as well as having an inquiry into the development and growth of ground rents.</P>
    <P>These are three areas in respect of house property where a very searching and useful piece of public investigation might be carried out.  I am certain that an investigation of this nature would <Col N="1013" /> yield more interesting results than some of the investigations being carried out at the moment.</P>
    <P>Likewise, within the local authority system there should be a statutory formula available for a standardised legal procedure in respect of the vesting of property.  This could reduce substantially the exploitation of home owners by those who cash in on the various aspects of house ownership.</P>
    <P>I consider the Minister to be rather partisan in his statement in regard to differential rents.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Those who call for the &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; of the differential rent system and favour the charging of fixed rents are, in fact, arguing that old age pensioners, widows and other persons on low incomes should only qualify for the same subsidies, and thus pay the same rents, as those who are fortunate enough to be earning good incomes.  This clearly would be unjust.</P>
    <P>How wonderful is the Minister's insight into the differential rents system. It is hardly necessary for me to comment on this kind of elementary statement on the social responsibility of wage and salary earners.  As the Minister is aware, there is no general call for the abolition of the differential rents system and, indeed, the Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...In this sense, those who argue against income-related rents are arguing against the building of houses for many people who so badly need them.</P>
    <P>This is what I would call the kind of elementary political propaganda which the Minister could usefully have left out of his speech.  He knows that it was only put in for that purpose and as a general blind to the fact that there are considerable administrative difficulties of an understandable nature in the administration of any differential rent system.  I should like to see the Minister getting his Dáil pay cheque on the 1st March and being told that in relation to 1969 he got slightly more than he should have got and that therefore he will have so much docked or else he will not get any pay in the <Col N="1014" /> following March.  In this computerised age it should not be beyond the competence of the Department of Local Government and the Dublin Corporation to devise some reviewing system for differential rents so that no one family will suddenly find themselves with an amazing accumulation of arrears and be put out on the side of the street with all the social problems involved.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister refers to the scarcity of land. He indicates that the Dublin city and county authorities and the Dún Laoghaire borough authority had acquired at 31st March, 1969, a reserve of sites for nearly 30,000 private and local authority dwellings, that a number of sites had already been made available to private builders and that steps were in train to release more sites in the coming months.  There must therefore be some 3,000 to 4,000 acres of land in the possession of these authorities and there is no reason why this land should not be developed as quickly as possible in order to alleviate the housing problem in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In regard to the scarcity of land the Minister says that he is trying to find some means whereby speculation in scarce serviced land would be discouraged and the increase in the value of land, attributable to the provision of services and the designation of land for development by planning authorities to meet the needs of the community, would be recouped to the benefit of the community and not be turned to private profit.  The Minister knows this speculation has been on a big scale.  Admittedly, credit restrictions have put a stop to it.  He says the problem is very complex, that the obvious solution of bringing all such land into public ownership would present serious constitutional, financial and administrative problems.  We are aware of all these considerations.  He says that other measures to deal with the problems were being studied.  Could I ask the Minister what other measures are being studied?  Some of the land speculators are closely associated with his own party and some of them closely associated with one of the Opposition parties, <Col N="1015" /> and I do not think we should be unduly sensitive about that.  It is high time the Minister introduced, as was introduced in Britain, a land development tax which brought in something like £1 million in the first year and will bring in double that in the current year.  Admittedly it has not been the glorious success in Britain that everybody thought it would be because of the tremendous legal and administrative difficulties involved in such a tax, but it would curb the sharks of Dublin who have made substantial capital gains through the purchase and sale of land on the open market with virtually no State control and tacit acceptance on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I would support the Minister's statement in regard to homes for the elderly.  It is disgraceful that provision for elderly persons has not been effectively encouraged in our local authorities.  I suppose some local authorities feel the people are so old anyway that by such time as they would get suitable accommodation from the local authorities they might not be in a position to vote at the next election for the members concerned. The grant schemes should be more fully publicised by the Minister so that the old folks associations, parish organisations and so on throughout the country would know what financial assistance was available.  This would be welcomed by old people living out their days in substandard dwellings throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in his statement that he intends to provide an increase of £50 in the State grant for smaller houses and that the local authorities may pay an additional amount up to £50 to persons eligible for supplementary grants.  The Minister must be living in dreamland if he thinks £50 is an adequate sum for this purpose.  The builders would not be impressed by it.  The Minister should at least double that sum.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his approval of 17 different types of houses.  I understand he has five other types under consideration at present. I share his concern about the cost of building and the length of time it takes. <Col N="1016" /> Houses built under Continental systems take from three to six months in some cases and six to nine months in most cases and if we were to adopt a more industrialised system of component unit building we would be able to build houses at a faster rate.  The Minister should keep a sharp eye on local authorities and the various Government Departments because there can be no excuse for the lengthy delays which occur especially when demand for houses is so great.</P>
    <P>If industrialised building and the greater use of component units is to be of any benefit to building houses more quickly the possibility of craftsmen being trained to carry out a range of operations must be examined.  I realise I am treading on rather sensitive ground here but it is time we faced up to the realities of modern construction techniques and practices. In the wet fixing area of bricklayers, plasterers, masons and tilers I am sure one general craftsman would be capable of doing these four jobs.  The situation is developing where bricklayers now do tiling work and more trade unions will have to develop an effective system of dual training in the construction industry.  Such a system would provide an industry which is very short of craftsmen with qualified men.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some points made by Deputy Dowling during his three hour speech.  I want to stress that I am not making them in a by-election setting.  He referred to the Dublin south-west region in a very laudable sense and I would like to take issue with him on this point.  I do not think the Dublin south-west region is a model of town planning or a model of industrial estate planning and housing development.  We can learn very many lessons from this region.  There are about 200 manufacturing and distributing enterprises of various sizes between Tallaght and Chapelizod.  In spite of that there are deficiencies in the telephone services; there are transport problems for the workers living in Ballymun and working out in Tallaght as well as for those working in the Chapelizod area; there are also problems relating to sewage and other effluents; and there are <Col N="1017" /> problems relating to planning, particularly in regard to the construction and extension of roads.  These are all relatively small problems but anyone approaching Dublin from that direction sees one of the worst eyesores, in terms of industrial-cum-housing-cum-social planning, of any capital city in Europe. There is an inadequate finish to the area in terms of work still to be done by Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation.  There are monstrous advertising hoardings and petrol stations which make the area unsightly.  The Government's policies in relation to town planning and industrial estates are no credit to them in south-west Dublin although I do welcome the employment and housing in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister should stop acting in a kind of Gilbert and Sullivan fashion about the city commissioner of Dublin Corporation.  He should accept the responsibility for appointing him and report accordingly to this House.  He should at least be frank about the situation otherwise this codacting will go on for the next four years.  Having been critical of the Minister's decision to abolish the city council I must confess that had I been one of the councillors I would not have voted for self-immolation at that point in time.  The Minister rather cleverly walked them into it.  While the councillors showed a justifiable reaction in respect of the excessive rates increase for 1968 they fell into the trap neatly laid by the Minister, Deputy Boland.  I am quite sure that councillors will not fall into the trap of dissolving themselves in future.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuous charges on the part of the Minister that there is a coalition operating in Dublin County Council, may I assure him that since I came to Dublin 14 years ago I have heard nothing but the coalition between Paddy Burke and Mark Clinton?  I can assure the Minister that the coalition exists between the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party on Dublin County Council and is there to be seen in all its manifestations from the annual rigging of the election of chairman to the rotation of the office. If one wants to be honest one might as well say that that is the coalition <Col N="1018" /> that is in operation.  Deputy Tunney confirmed that this evening and he has more intimate involvement with Dublin and the county council than I have had in recent years.  It is important to have the record right.</P>
    <P>I want to comment briefly on the question of pollution.  The Minister's statement is rather sparse and ineffective.  There was an attempt made by the Labour Party as far back as 1929 to deal with this problem when the late Senator Tom Johnson introduced in the Seanad the Town and Rural Amenities Bill, which was passed by the Seanad but, when it got to the Dáil, the Government said that they were preparing their own Bill, and they finally did so in 1933 or 1934.  The Labour Party most certainly have been very conscious of the need to preserve the environment.  In that respect the Labour Party have been to the fore. While An Foras Forbartha has done very good work in relation to conservation and in the development plans produced by it and the various studies they have carried out, in no other field has there been more sharply shown up the need to rationalise the work of An Foras and the Department.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure what kind of power politics go on between An Foras and the Department.  I am quite certain that there is a great deal of joint empire building going on.  I should like to get to the bottom of it.  An Foras is in a vaccum in respect of a good deal of its work that is costing a good deal of money.  Generally speaking, the work it has done to date deserves the height of praise and support but in such matters as pollution there should be greater co-ordination between An Foras, the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and the Department.  The Department have a good deal to answer for.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment in a very careful manner on the relationship between the Department and the alleged prospect of pollution arising from the establishment of a smelter industry.  The Minister made no reference to this major matter but did say quite recently in reply to a question that I had down that under the Smelting Act, 1968, smelting of ore or ore <Col N="1019" /> concentrates requires a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that such licence may include such conditions as the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks proper and specifies in the licence.  I would strongly urge on the Minister that there should be a formal, contractual and, if necessary, statutory obligation entered into between the Department or, with the consent of the Department, the local authority in Cork, and the smelter authorities, so as to ensure that no pollution could possibly arise.  There is need for caution.  There is need to prevent fall-out.  In such a major and far-reaching development, it is not just good enough to lay down planning permission conditions.  There is need for a more rigorous form of control.  I have no doubt that the Smelter Corporation of Ireland will fall into line.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the smelter industry comes, it will go to Cork.  I am rather amused by some of the red herrings that have been produced with regard to Limerick.  To the best of my knowledge, it is reasonably certain that it will be based in Cork. A study has been made by the scientific personnel in UCC.  Any such group has every right to do this, even though the companies concerned may react to criticism which justifiably may be made.  If the criticism is proved wrong, so much the better in the public interest.  It is very necessary that before any smelter is set up, means of monitoring dangerous fall-out should be established.  At least, the people in Cork are now fully aware of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>One could offer congratulations in respect of the comprehensive articles by Val Dorgan published by the <i>Cork Examiner</i>.  If the <i>Cork Examiner</i> published more feature articles of that kind, it would improve its general content and many more of us would decide to read the paper.  That article outlined the need for safety measures and care.  The Government and the Minister seem to be acting rather tardily and rather ineffectually.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on his obvious interest in road safety and on the work his Department have <Col N="1020" /> done in introducing more effective safety measures.  I wish to refer in particular to the blood test regulations. Under the law, it is now an offence to drive or to attempt to drive or to be in charge of a car while the level of alcohol in the blood exceeds 125 milligrammes.  The legislation provides for breath, blood and urine tests.  Unfortunately, for reasons which are very well known, the operation of these provisions has received a temporary setback.  I would suggest to the Minister that within six months he should provide for a reduction in the level of alcohol.  Experience in Britain following the introduction of the Road Safety Act and information available from the British Medical Association and available generally in Europe, would suggest that a reasonable case can be made, without hysteria, for a reduction, certainly, to 100 milligrammes.</P>
    <P>I may not be very popular for suggesting that there might be a tightening in that regard.  I appreciate that the Minister has left it rather loose but I would remind him of a very well-known report and the events which led up to the Road Safety Act, 1967, in Britain.  If I may just put this on record I think the Minister will subsequently appreciate the attitude in &ldquo;The Drinking Driver&rdquo;, a report of a special committee of the British Medical Association, published as far back as 1965. A tremendous amount of work was done since then.</P>
    <P>The report says that there was in 1965 adequate scientific evidence to support legislation making it an offence in Britain for a person with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80 mg/100 ml to drive a motor vehicle on the public highway.  Certainly that is rather disquieting.  It also referred to some previous reports which showed that at 60 mg/100ml drivers are twice as likely to be responsible for causing an accident; at 100 mg/100 ml six to seven times as likely, and at 150 mg/ 100 ml 25 times as likely, when compared with drivers having less than 10 mg/100ml in their blood.  Some of the evidence given recently following on the 1965 report in Britain might show the necessity for a review.  I am not saying it is necessary now but I <Col N="1021" /> have no doubt that the Minister should have another look at it towards the end of 1970.</P>
    <P>The number of car owners in my constituency is very great.  I do not think it is unfair to say that if one drives on the Bray Road on a Friday between the hours of 11 o'clock and 2 o'clock in the morning&mdash;and I have had to do so on many occasions&mdash;one virtually takes one's life in one's hands. There is the current mess in relation to the breathalyser.  It has got off to a peculiarly inauspicious start.  The Minister is responsible for this legislation and I would urge him to keep it under sharp review.  He has my general sympathy in trying to resolve the impasse but no doubt the breathalyser will be back in full operation again.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out to the House that the British Minister for Transport reviewed the first two years of its operation and said that for the first year after the introduction of the drinking and driving legislation casualties fell by ten per cent, in the second year these gains virtually held, and the total number of casualties was ten per cent lower than the year before the legislation came into force.  The British Minister went on to say&mdash;and this was a rather interesting statement made last December&mdash;that if anybody wanted further proof they had, since 1966, had post-mortem figures of the blood alcohol level of drivers who died within 12 hours of a road accident and before the Act no less than 28 per cent were found to be above the level of 80 milligrammes but since the Act this figure has fallen to 15 per cent. It was still of course much too high. Nevertheless the figures were better.  On the basis of those figures alone it can be said that in Britain the legislation is working rather effectively.  I would urge the Minister to try to compile some statistics of the blood alcohol concentration in serious accidents on the roads.  I am sure that if we had that for fatal accidents in the case of drivers who died within 12 hours of road accidents some of the figures would prove rather frightening.</P>
    <P>I have not had the opportunity due to the time factor to develop some other points.  I should like to ask the Minister a final question.  Is it his intention <Col N="1022" /> to revise the internal system in his Department relating to planning appeals?  Even within the confines of the current legislation it should be possible for the Minister to be more forthcoming publicly in relation to such appeals.  It is noticeable that the number of appeals received by the Minister showed a substantial increase and went up from 1,229 in 1966-67 to 1,897 in 1968-69.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that in political circles&mdash;and perhaps here he may be his own worst enemy in terms of sharp reaction and in terms of general attitudes&mdash;there is a great deal of disquiet at the manner in which some appeals are heard, not by the departmental staff but by himself: at the final decisions and at the delays which can arise and give rise to political allegations from time to time.  It would lead to a healthy administration of the Planning and Development Act if some public statement were made and was not just available to public representatives if they write in for it. Reports on appeals upheld and appeals disallowed should be available to the press and there should be much more information elaborating the grounds for such decisions.  This would allay many of the fears which are felt.  I do not particularly support the idea of sending off these appeals to a &ldquo;clatter&rdquo; of lawyers sitting in a general appeals court.  This may be part of the Fine Gael policy but I do not think it would solve anything and it would probably cost a fortune, like the current tribunal which is costing £200,000 and sitting for weeks on end.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These are my comments on the Minister's statement.  Before he arrived into the House I thanked him for giving us a very comprehensive statement.  The debate on the Estimate is furthered by such statements.  I know <Col N="1023" /> that people allege that we politicians suffer from verbal diarrhoea.  I do not subscribe to that.  We are spending enormous sums of the taxpayers' money and it is quite impossible to deal with all the manifestations and the problems of the Department of Local Government in a short time.  It is one of the key Departments ranking, in my opinion, next to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Minister's statement was very welcome and I look forward to hearing his reply on the aspects which have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will commence my contribution to this debate by speaking on the housing section of this Estimate.  I am happy to note that the target of 13,000 houses per annum, as outlined in the White Paper of 1964, has been exceeded.  We could have built fewer houses.  We could have been contented with building fewer houses were it not for the fact that the country had made such remarkable progress in all fields during the past decade.  As the population increases, the standard of living improves and the numbers in employment grow, so also the number of new houses required grows, apart altogether from the number of houses required to replace those falling into decay.  When forecasting housing demands we must always bear in mind the progress made, particularly in industry and in those spheres in which more employment is provided for our younger people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that expenditure on housing over the past year has increased from £64 million to £72 million.  That investment shows the importance attached to housing both by the Government and by the private sector.  Private building should be encouraged and I welcome the Minister's proposal to increase the grant in the case of those building houses with a floor area of 1,000 to 1,249 square feet.  I am secretary of a local public utility society in south Kerry.  Large-scale private house building is taking place there at the moment.  Indeed, it has been taking place there over the past few years.  I would say, without fear of contradiction, that 90 per cent of the new house grant applications <Col N="1024" /> which I process come into the category of the 1,000 square feet to 1,249 square feet.  We have a certain percentage of building in the 800 to 1,000 square feet.  We have a very small percentage exceeding the 1,250 square feet.  The Minister is, I think, very wise in removing the grants, the tax concessions and the rates remission on houses costing more than £6,000. People who can afford to build these luxury homes should be able to afford to build them without the aid of a grant and these people should, of course, be well able to pay the full rates right from the start.  The money saved in this direction can be usefully used to provide more houses for the more needy section of our community.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the differential renting system.  I have been advocating this system for years.  Such a system is vital in any democratic society if we are to ensure the provision of houses for the needy section of our community at a rent that section can afford to pay.  Tenants of local authority houses, who enjoy large incomes, should subsidise the rents for the poorer section and the more needy section of the community.  I should like to see more homes provided for the elderly.  I should like to see local authorities providing more mobile homes. As the standard of living improves and life expectancy increases we will find ourselves in the position of having to cater for more and more elderly people and we must be prepared to provide homes for them.  Mobile homes should be provided for those who are at present living in unfit dwellings.  I know of many cases in which, through no fault of the local authority or of the Department, long delay is experienced in providing houses because of the difficulty in acquiring sites.  In Sneem it is very difficult to provide suitable building sites because of the rocky nature of the terrain.  In many cases it is difficult for the local authority to get proper title to a site.  I know cases in which it has taken two to three years to put a title right.  Mobile homes should be provided for people while they are awaiting council houses.</P>
    <P>The essential repair grants scheme is working very well.  The Department <Col N="1025" /> officials are very efficient in dealing with these applications.  In many cases the occupants have houses repaired at no cost to themselves.  This is a scheme which should be encouraged.  Special consideration should be given to the payment of reconstruction grants for houses which have corrugated iron roofs.  I have come across cases in which no other roof could be put on, except corrugated iron, because the walls would not support any other kind of roof.  In these cases it would be almost as cheap to build a new house. I should like the Minister to give very special consideration to that suggestion, particularly in the case of those who could not afford to provide themselves with new houses or to reconstruct their existing houses to the point at which they could put on another type of roof.  You have not got that many cases but I meet with a few every year and I think those should get special consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal and the arrangement whereby tenants of local authority dwellings have the option of buying new private houses with the aid of loans from local authorities of up to 90 per cent of the market value of the new houses.  More important still is the fact that this concession applies even where the income limit exceeds £1,200 per annum.  This scheme should get more publicity.  I feel if it got more publicity it would encourage more people in local authority houses to erect and to purchase private houses. This, of course, would mean that more houses would become available to the local authorities for people who could not provide those houses themselves.</P>
    <P>A certain priority for housing should be allowed in rapidly developing areas, particularly in industrial areas and in areas where you have large numbers of young people employed.  There is no doubt but that some local authorities some years ago probably underestimated the demand for houses due to the fact that when they were fixing their priorities for four or five years hence they did not visualise the rapid development which would take place in their areas, particularly as regards the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  They did not visualise <Col N="1026" /> the industrial development which would take place within their districts.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to raising the limit for new house loans over and above the present ceiling of £1,200.  This, to my mind, would encourage more people to build private houses.  There is no doubt in many industries you have a large number of workers earning by way of basic pay and overtime in the region of £1,200 a year.  As well, some scheme should be devised whereby employees in various industries and large business premises should be encouraged to save a certain amount of money every year for the provision of houses of their own.  This could be done by the formation of a local association with the aid probably of representatives of the workers and some local public utility society and perhaps other personalities in the district.  Some organisation should be set up at local level in every town to achieve this aim of encouraging young people to save money for the provision of homes of their own.  As well as that, perhaps some tax concession could be granted to those people and this would also be an encouragement to them.</P>
    <P>As regard sanitary services, we are making fairly good progress with regard to the provision of piped water supply when we take into account the demands for other services.  I personally favour group water schemes in as many areas as possible.  I am glad to note from the Minister's opening speech that he intends to make more inspectors available to encourage and to assist in the development of local group water supply schemes.  This is probably the best and the cheapest way in which we can provide piped water supply to a large number of homes in many rural areas.  I know of a number of cases where group water schemes have been very successfully carried out and at a reasonable cost per household.  When those schemes are initiated locally you generally have great local enthusiasm, members of the local group put a lot of effort and voluntary work into the operation of this scheme and in addition the grants are very encouraging. Therefore, I would strongly recommend <Col N="1027" /> that every effort be made to increase the number of group water supply schemes.</P>
    <P>I also think that perhaps sewerage schemes should be carried out on a group basis in many areas.  This could possible be done in villages where you have not got sewerage schemes already. I see no reason why the sewerage could not be drained into communal septic tanks in villages and the local authority would then take over responsibility for the maintenance of those communal tanks.  This idea should be developed and encouraged and those schemes initiated.</P>
    <P>As I am speaking on sewerage schemes, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a sewerage problem which exists in Killarney and which has existed for some time.  It is of vital importance not alone to Killarney and south Kerry but to the nation as a whole that a new scheme should be got into operation as quickly as possible in Killarney having regard to the damage which could be caused to our tourist industry should anything happen in Killarney as a result of the existing sewerage system.  Every effort should be made by the local council and the Department by working in close co-operation to ensure that this proposed scheme is carried out speedily.</P>
    <P>Existing sewers, particularly in rapidly developing urban areas, should be extended and a certain amount of priority should be given to this type of work in order to provide more serviced land, particularly in urban areas where serviced land is running out.  I have no sympathy at all for urban areas where there is sufficient serviced land at present but in areas where serviced land is running out priority should be given to the extension of the sewerage schemes in those areas.</P>
    <P>Before I leave sanitary services, I should like to thank the Minister for making arrangements whereby the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will give assistance towards the cost of headworks in high-cost group water schemes, schemes serving predominantly agricultural participants.  There <Col N="1028" /> is no doubt but that in some rural areas considerable cost is incurred in the provision of headworks for such schemes.  In certain areas the cost of rock-boring prohibits a group scheme from getting under way.</P>
    <P>The itinerant problem is one which every local authority should examine. The local authorities have a responsibility for the itinerants.  Kerry County Council are definitely playing their part. They have provided 15 sites and have catered for 19 families.  In one area alone nine families had been settled in different sites.  I hope that all these families will soon be adequately housed. We have a great responsibility for the provision of housing and education for the itinerants.  We should remember that in the end we must all die and we can not bring our spare money with us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that plans are to meet the needs of people and cannot remain static.  Planning must be a continuous process.  In any county planning must be adapted to suit the needs of that county as they arise.  Planning will play a very important role in local authority work in future years.  Local authorities, by virtue of the powers invested in them, can become development corporations and associations within their own districts.  They can create an environment for the establishment of industry and amenities and for the encouragement of tourist development.  Initiative in all these fields should come from the local authorities.  The local authorities in Kerry are fully alive to, and aware of, their obligations and are playing their part in providing the necessary environment for economic development in the country.</P>
    <P>There seems to be difference of opinion as regards the operation of planning control.  All agree that there must be planning control.  There must be amenity areas and areas of limited development.  Single rural houses or cottages could be fitted into any part of our amenity areas.  I would not like to see too many of them but a house here or there, well screened, would not spoil the beauties of the countryside in scenic areas.  Planning authorities should not refuse planning applications merely because the proposals contained in the <Col N="1029" /> application would contravene the development plan or would, in the opinion of the planning authority, contravene such plan.  Each application must be considered on its merits.  A broader interpretation should be taken of county development plans which are in a draft stage at the moment.  In some counties councillors thought it fit to bring in resolutions under section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, to try to force the manager to grant permissions in certain cases where they thought that such development proposals would not seriously interfere with the amenities, or with the traffic, or with any feature of the development plan.  In practically every case a public notice was issued saying that such a proposal would materially contravene the draft development plan and the council sought the sanction of the Minister for the contravention of this plan.  The planners and the managers acting in an executive capacity should interpret the draft development plans on a broad basis.  It should not be necessary to issue these notices and to seek sanction for the contravention of the development plan.  Such action holds up a certain amount of development.  If there was more co-operation there would not be so many resolutions under section 4 of the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>There is concern in Kerry in places where it is not intended to issue any more planning permissions for development where such development would mean opening new entrances or exits on to a principal road.  Planning authorities are favourably disposed towards granting permission where the proposed development would not mean a new exit on to a public road.  In many cases they would give favourable consideration to a large number of applications for housing development adjacent to a main road provided there is only one entrance from the main road.  There is a certain risk involved in allowing exits to main roads with fast-moving traffic but I wonder whether the risk is less when you have six cars coming out of one entrance than when you have one car coming out of each of six entrances.  Personally I think the tendency for motorists, when they see a car coming out of an <Col N="1030" /> entrance and moving on, is not to expect another car to come from the same entrance, particularly when it is a private entrance.  I think the policy should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with ribbon development but I think the reason for refusing applications for sporadic developments along main roads is that it would tend to create a traffic problem. At the same time the tendency to give permission for development along main roads in respect of a large number of applications using one exit does not make sense to me.  The policy should be reviewed by local authorities.  It would force people seeking planning sites in rural areas to move to the county roads and this is a very dangerous practice because most of these roads are very narrow, have not recently been improved and tarred and have dangerous bends.  Traffic on these roads, particularly in the early morning or late at night, tends to create a far more serious hazard than on the main road.  Traffic moving at 30 or 40 miles an hour on some of the county roads is more dangerous than traffic moving at 50 or 60 mph on main roads because the county roads are so narrow.</P>
    <P>It must be very difficult for the Minister and the Department to deal with the large number of planning appeals which runs to about 2,000 per annum at present especially when we realise that these appeals are in respect of the most contentious applications, because it is only awkward cases that are sent to the Minister for decision.  This number of appeals probably is not very alarming when we consider that 88 per cent of planning applications are granted.  That is a pretty high figure and we should not decry the planning authorities for the 12 per cent refused.</P>
    <P>In my opinion planning authorities should allow new houses wherever there has been an old house.  If we are to repopulate the rural areas we must be very careful about this.  I refer particularly to the Ring of Kerry and certain other scenic areas in south Kerry.  I believe this area was every bit as picturesque 100 or 200 years ago when we had a large number of houses <Col N="1031" /> there.  I cannot see why old houses should not be replaced by new ones.  In a number of cases planning authorities have refused applications to replace old houses.  Granted that many of the old houses have become derelict by now, if we are to repopulate these areas&mdash;and there is a growing demand for new accommodation particularly for holiday homes in these areas&mdash;we could safely allow a house to be built where there was an old house without spoiling the area.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Desmond about regionalisation when he said that county councils and urban councils lack enthusiasm.  They are most enthusiastic about development of their districts.  I am afraid that if we regionalise local government it may lack the drive and enthusiasm inherent in the present system.  Particularly in southern and western counties it is well known that an area without a local councillor is left behind as regards development, improvement of roads and provision of other local government services.  This could happen on a greater scale with regionalisation.  I can see the advantages of regionalisation in certain sectors, particularly in planning and development, but as regards local government as a whole we should go very slowly and carefully.  I agree entirely in regard to regionalisation of the health services.</P>
    <P>Local government is a different matter.  In health we are dealing mainly with applications for services but in local government we are dealing with a positive development and with the creation of the environment for various types of development.  I know that some councillors are very cautious about regionalisation in local government and I feel that they have good reason to be cautious.  We should move very slowly in this matter.</P>
    <P>In regard to traffic, it was very interesting to hear in the Minister's speech about the Carlow pilot scheme for the school warden service.  This is a very interesting development and very much in order, particularly for boys' schools, although I could not see it working very well for girls' schools or <Col N="1032" /> schools catering for girls and junior boys.  However, it is well worth developing and perhaps more thought and planning could be put into it.  It is a very good idea for the Garda to train young boys to act as traffic wardens in and around schools.</P>
    <P>I feel that greater attention should be paid by urban councils to road plans, particularly to the planning of new roads.  I am afraid that in some of our towns, especially those which are developing rapidly, the business life of the town centre could become choked within the next few years if something is not done very quickly to alleviate the traffic congestion which is now apparent even in mid-winter.  Top priority should be given to putting the road plans contained in the draft development plan into operation.  Apart from providing for the easy flow of traffic it would open up areas for housing and other development.  I should like to see higher grants being given for the improvement and tarring of county roads.  I also feel that local authorities should provide more money in their rates estimates for this purpose, even though it would mean a higher rate.  I feel that the public would not mind paying for better roads, particularly in the remoter rural areas. In many areas now where we have electricity and water it is very desirable that we should have good roads to carry vehicular traffic.</P>
    <P>The financing of local authorities is a thorny problem.  The burden on the rates is fairly grave in towns and villages but we must remember that the contribution of the State has increased considerably.  It is worth noting that the rates contributed 52.3 per cent in 1938-39, 39.7 per cent in 1956-57 and 33.3 per cent in 1969-70.  This means that the contribution towards financing local government over the past 30 years from rates has dropped by approximately one-fifth while, at the same time, State grants have increased from 39 per cent in 1938-39 to 42 per cent in 1956-57 and to 50 per cent in the current year.  We must also take into account the substantial increase in the agricultural grant, particularly in the last decade, and also the fact that the first £20 on land valuation has now <Col N="1033" /> been completely derated and also that there are concessions and remissions of rates.  At the same time the urban dweller is hard hit in this regard.  I do not mean the business man or the person engaged in commercial activities.  I am thinking of the person with a low income who provided a house for himself and is probably paying back a loan to the county council. This is the type of person to whom we must give special consideration when the rating system is being reviewed.  I am glad to hear that a White Paper will be issued regarding the proposed overhaul of the local government system and its financing.</P>
    <P>I feel that bank overdrafts are a great <Col N="1034" /> source of worry to some councils at present.  In some cases the cost of paying the interest on these overdrafts means that a substantial sum goes on the rates.  We should examine the possibility of State grants, particularly those in respect of roads and health services, being paid to the local authorities on a monthly rather than on a half-yearly basis.  This would alleviate to some extent the impact on the rates of bank overdrafts.</P>

      <P>Pursuant to the provisions of section 70 of the Land Act, 1923, the appointed day for the purposes of that Act shall be such day or days as may be fixed by the Land Commission. Different days may be fixed for different provisions and different purposes of the Act and for different holdings or groups of holdings and different parcels or groups of parcels of untenanted land.  Accordingly, therefore, no single appointed day was <Col N="917" /> fixed for the purposes of section 24 of the Act, the practice of the Land Commission being to fix an appointed day in respect of each individual estate to vest in them pursuant to the provisions of that section.</P>
