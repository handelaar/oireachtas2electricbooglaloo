      <P>I received that Interim Report late last evening.  I only had time to read it hurriedly and contact, for a brief moment, the Attorney General.  I was not able to give him the Interim Report at that time but I conveyed it to a member of his staff. It seems to me that the apprehension which the Committee have about privilege is not a real one having regard to the advice of the Attorney General and the advice of the Deputy's counsel. There was, however, another suggestion in the report about the power of the Committee to require witnesses to attend and produce documents. These two matters are now being considered by the Attorney General and I have not yet received his report, but I hope to receive it by Question Time and then I can indicate to the House what his attitude is.</P>

      <Col N="1085" /> The Dáil, according to order, went into Committee on Finance to consider Supplementary Estimates for the year ending 31st March, 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach. </P>
      <P>This is, in effect, a debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate and at this time of the year is used for the purpose of a general debate on Government policy.  Traditionally an Adjournment Debate at this time is devoted to a review of the economy generally during the year and a forecasting, so far as this is possible, of the likely economic trends during the year ahead.  I propose to follow precedent on this occasion also.</P>
      <P>The year 1970 can be regarded as a mixed year for the economy both as to the actual experience of the economy and the feeling evoked by those events.  There are four main heads under which economic policy and performance are generally considered: the growth in output, which serves as an indicator of the rise in living standards; trends in employment, which tell us what progress is being made towards halting emigration; the balance of payments account, which sets out the extent to which we are achieving balance in our trading with other countries; and movement in price levels, which shows whether domestic monetary stability is being attained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first of these heads, growth and outout, it is now estimated that our 1970 overall growth rate will be in the region of 2 per cent.  This compares with a rate of over 3 per cent in 1969 and an annual rate of some 4 per cent during the sixties.  Viewed in this light this year's figure will be regarded as unsatisfactory whereas ten <Col N="1086" /> years ago a 2 per cent rise was regarded as a rather high and ambitious target.  It is a measure of the success we have achieved in the past decade that we should have so raised our sights and that we should be eager to resume quickly a more rapid rate of expansion than that experienced in the current year.</P>
    <P>The main causes for this temporary setback were the prolonged industrial disputes in the cement and banking sectors which resulted in lost output in other industries adversely affected by these disputes plus a substantial number of man days lost in the affected industries themselves.  Apart from the economic damage which protracted stoppages of this nature cause, they also engender social problems and damage our economic reputation abroad.  These destructive consequences are now widely recognised and, rather than indulge in futile recriminations, I would hope that we, as a people, can profit from this experience.</P>
    <P>A healthy democracy requires that all sections of the community should have freedom to pursue their legitimate interests by every legitimate means, but the well-being of democracy also requires that this freedom be exercised in a mature and responsible manner, with a proper regard for the rights and interests of others so that freedom for the many is not subverted into the tyranny of the few.  In this field of industrial relations we have had to learn this lesson from painful experience, but I would hope that the lesson has been learned.  The Government, for their part, have sought and will continue to promote the development of a balanced and enlightened attitude amongst all groups and, if the earlier months of this year had their black spots, it is only fair to recall that recent weeks have shown some positive developments to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of employment the experience has likewise been mixed. On the positive side employment in industry in the first half of the year was 5.000 above the level for the first part of 1969.  A large part of this increase was due to our industrial development programme and, since many further projects were and are <Col N="1087" /> in the pipeline, a further rise in employment from these sources can be expected to have taken place in recent months.  While there are reasonable grounds for satisfaction with these figures, this satisfaction must be tempered by the knowledge that a further fall in agricultural employment took place during the year and the target for new industrial jobs must be in the region of 10,000 to 12,000 per year if we are to bring involuntary emigration to an end.  In 1969 the target was reasonably well attained and we had some 11,200 new industrial jobs, but it is interesting to note that, although the growth in industrial employment was slower this year than it was last year, the available indicators suggest that emigration was somewhat lower this year.</P>
    <P>On the balance of payments, the available data show that the external trading position improved slightly during the year.  Imports and exports both show marked increases in the first ten months of the year in comparison with the same period in 1969.  Imports were up by £46 million, but exports rose at a more rapid rate and showed a heartening increase of £50 million.  It is worth noting that industrial exports accounted for over half of the total value of exports, reflecting thereby the extent to which our economic progress in recent years has been depending on industrial expansion.  Agricultural exports also recorded a healthy increase.</P>
    <P>Tourism presented the least happy picture.  A variety of reasons, both economic and political, have been put forward to account for tourism setbacks and I do not propose to engage now in a <i>post mortem</i> exercise.  I should like to say, however, that whatever effect general political events may have had on the flow of tourists, I see no reason why tourism, as such, should be turned into a political football. I would have thought that all parties could agree that the way to welcome tourists to our shores is not by lamenting or bickering over experiences in the past.</P>
    <P>The overall outcome for our external trading this year is likely to be some fall in the balance of payments deficit from the £69 million level of 1969.  This improvement is welcome and can be <Col N="1088" /> taken as another sign that 1970 was a moderately successful year.  A further improvement will be necessary in 1971 because deficits in the region of £60 million to £70 million are too much to be sustained for any period of years.  Some deficit may be expected to continue while we are pushing ahead with industrial and commercial development, especially when foreign firms are investing here, but it would be preferable to halve the recent level of deficit before a satisfactory result could be claimed in this field.</P>
    <P>The fourth, and final, general economic indicator is that of prices.  In many respects this is the area which has caused most concern in recent times. Earlier this year I told the House that I regarded inflation as the most important economic problem facing the country.  I do not think there is anybody who would pretend for a moment that we were happy with a situation in which prices rose by about 8 per cent per annum, as they have done in the past 12 months.  I pointed out at the same time that one important cause of inflation was the rapid growth in pay and other forms of income and that any success in moderating inflation would require, as an essential prerequisite, moderation in the size of income increases.  The summer and autumn months brought little grounds for optimism on this score and when the newly formed employer/labour conference failed in its initial attempts to produce an agreement the Government was compelled in October to announce legislation aimed at bringing about an orderly development of incomes in a manner which would lessen inflationary pressures.</P>
    <P>At all stages, both before and after the announcement of this legislation, I and other members of the Government, made it clear that our preference was to see an acceptable voluntary agreement and that our action was made necessary in the absence of any such agreement.  Consequently, when we were asked by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to suspend our proposals &mdash;rather, I should say, to modify the provisions of the Bill&mdash;in order to facilitate further negotiations, we readily acceded to their request.  The result of these further discussions is that the <Col N="1089" /> preparation of a voluntary agreement acceptable to all parties has now reached an advanced stage and there are reasonable grounds for expecting that a satisfactory outcome can be attained.  Such an outcome seemed impossible two months ago and it is a tribute to the responsibility and painstaking efforts of both the unions and the employer bodies that such progress has been made.  This augurs well for the future of industrial relations and I believe it will be possible to develop a mutual understanding which will enable problems to be resolved in an enlightened and peaceful manner.</P>
    <P>The overall picture which emerges is a mixed one.  Although the rate of progress may not have been as rapid or as extensive as we wished it would be, there are nonetheless solid achievements which can be recorded.  Despite the cement strike, for example, the level of house building for the year should approach the 14,000 mark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it should and it likely will.  That will be much more than double the figure reached ten years ago.  I think, as well, it will be close to the figure reached in 1969. In other areas, satisfactory progress has also been made.  There have been substantial improvements in social welfare benefits.  There have been further rises to record levels in the numbers of students in post-primary and higher education and improvements in hospital facilities and other health services. It is these barometers of our social progress which are our best indicators of whether or not there has been any true economic progress.  They remind us that the object of economic expansion is not to head some international league table for growth or to have the strongest balance of payments position but to provide the basis for improving the material wealth of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the general economic trends in the economy it is proper that reference be made here to the opening during the year of negotiations on our application for entry to the EEC.  Apart from its economic implications, membership of the EEC will also have <Col N="1090" /> social, cultural and political consequences&mdash;the House has already had an opportunity of debating this matter specifically; that debate is not yet concluded so I do not think I need at this stage dwell too long on the implications of our application for membership of the EEC.  However, I should say there are grounds for believing that satisfactory entry terms can be agreed, in which case we shall likely find ourselves embarking on the course of adapting to a very different climate in our trading and other relationships with the member countries in a short time.  It is important that, in shaping our policies and actions in the coming months and years, we should recognise the likelihood of membership at an early date.  We are now at the stage of entering substantive negotiations.  The Government intend to keep the House and the people fully informed as to progress.  In the meantime, arrangements are going ahead for the issue of a series of informative documents commencing as quickly as possible in the new year, to assist in the making available of necessary information.</P>
    <P>With regard to the outlook for 1971, viewed in the wake of the October budgetary measures as well as the settlement of the bank dispute, the underlying trends in the economy appear more encouraging as we approach the end of the current year than they did earlier in the year.  There has been an improvement in the balance of payments. Exports, particularly industrial exports, continue to be buoyant.  Unemployment is being contained.  I think then we can look forward to 1971 with guarded optimism.  Nevertheless, the usual caveat follows that we cannot afford to be complacent.  The favourable trends at the end of 1970 and the increased momentum of the economy will continue throughout 1971 only if a climate favourable to growth is maintained. Price rises must be kept in check if our external competitiveness is to be maintained.  Otherwise, if there is a deterioration, the competitiveness of Irish industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> other exporting countries which we have experienced in recent years will continue.  Any such continued deterioration would have grave consequences for our prospects of achieving a steady increase in employment <Col N="1091" /> and a rise in living standards.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the economy has the underlying capacity and strength to grow at a satisfactory rate in the coming year.  While uncertainties always exist as to the most likely course of future events, it is clear that a prerequisite for substantial expansion is that prices and income increases be contained within tolerable bounds.  There are grounds for cautious optimism that this can in fact be achieved.  This would enable a proper balance to be restored and would diminish the risks that are now apparent in the economy.</P>
    <P>If the danger of inflation can be avoided, and the upward momentum strengthened, we can secure the foundations for even greater economic growth and social advance in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In more ways than one, the year coming to an end has been an eventful one.  So far as the situation in the Six Counties in the north of Ireland is concerned, we can all welcome the period of relative calm which has obtained there in recent months and express the hope that this situation will not only continue but improve.  I should like, again, to express the hope &mdash;which I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House will share&mdash;that the pace of the reforms still to be implemented by the Northern Ireland Government will be quickened in 1971 and that the quality of these reforms will not fall short of expectations and of what we know to be necessary.</P>
    <P>When this point is reached&mdash;and my earnest hope is that it will soon be reached&mdash;we will, I believe, have entered a new era in North-South relations and in our relations with the British Government and people.  Such a relationship can only be beneficial to all sides.  Failure to achieve it now can only result in a situation even worse than any which we have experienced before.</P>
    <P>So far as events during the year in this part of the country are concerned, the Dáil has had a number of opportunities already to debate these events, political and economic, and most recently we had a wide-ranging debate on the Vote of Confidence at the <Col N="1092" /> beginning of last month.  I see no purpose now in covering this ground all over again.  The Dáil reaffirmed confidence in the Government on that occasion.  As recently as two weeks ago, that confidence has been reaffirmed by the people, as the outcome of the by-elections in Donegal-Leitrim and South County Dublin firmly demonstrated.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one topic which I should like to deal with briefly and that is the statement issued on behalf of the Government last Friday week, 4th December, 1970, on the possibility of invoking Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940.  In view of the amount of ill-informed comment, I want to state again that a decision to introduce Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act has not been taken by the Government nor has a decision been taken to use the powers of internment which this piece of legislation gives.  I want to refer again to the Government's announcement relating to this matter on December 4th and to my statement here in the Dáil on 9th instant and that is that until the Government become satisfied that the threat&mdash;about which we received the most reliable information&mdash; has been removed, then the possibility of introducing Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act remains.  Until the Government are satisfied beyond any possible doubt that that threat no longer obtains and that plans for the perpetration of such acts of madness have been finally abandoned, only then will the possibility of invoking Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act disappear.</P>
    <P>This threat of kidnapping is not something that the Government dreamed up.  We have had experience of this in many countries, in South America, North America and more recently in Europe and in a number of these cases they resulted in the deaths of the unfortunate victims.  One can only hope that commonsense and reason will prevail over what can only be acts of sheer lunacy.  No matter how high the price in terms of popular support will be, the Government will not shrink from what it knows to be the only and proper and responsible course of action to take in the national <Col N="1093" /> interest.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that nobody has been interned and it is not the wish of this Government to intern anybody; but if such a solution is forced upon us the Government, knowing where their duty clearly lies, will not flinch in the face of it.  The year now ending has been a testing time for the Government and the country also.</P>
    <P>The problems facing us in the new year are not likely to be less formidable or complex, but no matter how formidable or complex they may prove to be we have no reason to face them other than with full confidence in our ability and capacity successfully to overcome them.  The Government's confidence in their own and in the country's capacity to solve these problems is substantially reinforced by the strong evidence of a true sense of responsibility and maturity which was so clearly shown by the people during the year that has now passed.  The people have shown that they were quite capable of looking at all these difficulties and events, of putting them in proper perspective and of arriving at their own independent and responsible judgments on them. They were not, and could not be stampeded, no matter how great the pressure or how gross the misrepresentation.  I think this is a lesson which the parties opposite would do well to learn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The truest remark the Taoiseach made, I suppose, was that this was a mixed year for the economy and certainly for the country.  This must be one of the most extraordinary end of session debates the country has ever had.  The events that have occurred during the year have had their repercussions and reactions in a variety of ways and undoubtedly affected the economic well-being and welfare of the people.  The effect on the economy, especially on the tourist trade, has been quite serious.  No amount of talk or any comment that was made on the situation could alter the simple facts.  The facts are that a situation developed in which tourists from other parts of the world were fearful of coming here and in many cases cancelled their bookings. That affected industry to such an extent that in a recent interview given by the President of the Hotels Federation <Col N="1094" /> he expressed alarm at the prospects which faced the hotel industry.  He expressed alarm on two fronts: there were not sufficient guests to fill the hotels and there was not money available to meet the commitments hoteliers had entered into.</P>
      <P>This situation did not arise by chance.  It happened because of developments inside the present Government resulting in dismissals and resignations. These dismissals and resignations occurred because of internal conflict, not external factors, not because of criticism expressed or speeches made by Deputies on this side.  This was an internal matter generated with complete and wanton disregard of the public interest.  It is a tribute to the stability of the foundations of the State that it was possible for this Dáil and the country to live through that period and it is no tribute to the Fianna Fáil Government or Party.</P>
      <P>For a long time there has been concern about the apparent weakening of respect for the authority of the Dáil and the tendency of the Government to by-pass it by making major announcements of Government policy. Whether these are major announcements is sometimes hard to know, because no sooner are they made than they are reversed or rescinded or deferred. To take the most recent one first, last Friday week an announcement was made about the Government's intention to invoke Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act. That announcement came after the Dáil had adjourned.  It was made through the Government Information Bureau or through an announcement by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government and circulated through the normal media.  It naturally aroused concern and comment.  Most people were anxious to find out how this situation had developed, what had occurred to urge the Government to take such rapid action in such a panicky fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our duty, therefore, to examine what has happened over the past 12 or 18 months.  No one is more deeply devoted than we are in this party to the maintenance of the institutions of State, to respect for the Army and the Garda and to the prevention of crime. This situation did not develop overnight. <Col N="1095" /> Some months ago an event took place in Mullingar in which an armed group discharged volleys at a funeral. What action was taken?  What directions were given to the Garda in respect of this?  If the Garda reported the matter what action was taken on their report?</P>
    <P>Property was burned in Meath and other areas over a period.  Again, what action was taken to apprehend the culprits?  Everybody regrets the circumstances in which people meet their deaths, whether it is through their own fault or being involved in those incidents. A few weeks ago a funeral went through Dublin.  Shots were discharged outside the GPO.  What action was taken by the Garda?  What instructions were given to deal with that form of activity?</P>
    <P>In one specific case a person was apprehended, brought before the courts, convicted and sentenced but was afterwards released.  On whose recommendation was that person released? Numerous cases going back for eight or ten years on a whole series of incidents were recorded in this particular way. The convicted person was released. There are only two ways in which people can be released.  They either appeal to the court at which they were convicted or to a higher court and get the conviction quashed or the Minister for Justice, acting on behalf of the Government, remits the sentence.  In the particular case I have mentioned, so far as the country is aware, it was the latter which operated.  The Garda authorities were opposed to the release in this case.  In another case, because of a defective warrant, the convicted person got out.</P>
    <P>That is a brief history of the events of the past 12 or 18 months where people were either apprehended, convicted and released or when they were seen to do something the Garda, not because they did not want to do their duty, did not apprehend them.  We may as well be frank about this.  It will be said that the Garda were told to do their duty but a nod is as good as a wink.  The Garda knew, because of the political implications, the Government did not want action taken.  In the case <Col N="1096" /> I mentioned the person who was convicted was released on Government intervention.</P>
    <P>Over the last 12 or 18 months there have been cases of burning of property and property attacked by people, possibly believing they had some political authority or national duty to perform. No action was taken.  If one group take the law into their hands it is the beginning of anarchy, and it does not matter how people argue, or what sentimental slobbering goes on to justify those activities.</P>
    <P>Some of those incidents which took place considered in isolation may not be of great gravity, but when they are pieced together and when you go a little further each day or on each occasion and no action is taken then, of course, respect for the ordinary law of the land is weakened.  The Government, during that time, took no positive action.  Nobody is suggesting that the exising law in present circumstances is not adequate to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste went to a meeting in Wexford and made certain comparisons between what has happened recently and what happened some years ago.  He said he took the trouble to look up the newspapers to see what happened in 1957.  His memory is either defective or his research was very limited.  What happened in 1957? When we were in Government in 1956 we had the responsibility of dealing with this.  The ordinary machinery of the District Court was employed and functioning.  Early in 1957 Fianna Fáil came into office and later in that year they introduced Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act.  The Minister for Health commented on the fact that people were killed.  He did not say that when Fianna Fáil were in opposition they gave tacit approval to this. He did not tell that two members of his party attended one, if not two, funerals in 1956 and subseaquently they became Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is not enough to be against crime when you are in Government and give tacit approval to it when you are in opposition.  That is the difference between the attitude which was adopted by us and that adopted by the present Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> When we were in Government we did our duty and when we were in opposition we did not criticise or oppose those who had the same responsibility to ensure that the people's rights were defended and vindicated. On this occasion we have seen this series of events over a protracted period where no action was taken or if action was taken and a conviction secured the person was released.  It is difficult in those circumstances to believe the Government have approached this in a responsible, national manner.  If the Government have not confidence in the courts or in the Judiciary they have hardly anyone to blame but themselves. All the appointments, with a few microscopic exceptions, were made by the Fianna Fáil Party.  As one paper rightly pointed out, judges are paid to do their duty.  If they do not do it then this House and the country have a remedy.</P>
    <P>The real danger in the Government's approach is the fact that the announcement that was made, like all Government announcements recently, is not really meant.  Since the announcement of the threat or the intention to introduce Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act, the Government have been at pains to say they do not intend to do it unless they are forced to do it.  Some two months ago the Government announced a policy in respect of prices and incomes, a policy in respect of the problems that were affecting the economy and causing so much concern.</P>
    <P>This announcement was accompanied shortly afterwards by the introduction of a Supplementary Budget.  Within a few days it was announced that there was to be a thaw in the arrangement in respect of the price and wage restraint. We discussed for some weeks in this House a Prices and Incomes Bill.  Side by side with that we discussed the Finance Bill to implement the Supplementary Budget.  What has characterised the Government's attitude to all this?  They say one thing today and reverse it or modify it tomorrow.</P>
    <P>We have consistently argued that a prices and incomes policy to be successful must be secured by agreement. The Taoiseach announced this morning <Col N="1098" /> that it is a tribute to the two sides involved in these discussions, the employers' representatives and the trade unions, that it looks likely that an acceptable agreement will be reached. We have consistently argued that this is a matter that must be achieved through negotiations and discussions, and that you can lead people but you cannot compel them in this field.</P>
    <P>We have also said&mdash;and this must be emphasised&mdash;that the time to get agreement in these matters is not in the middle of wage claims and wage demands, or salary negotiations.  About 18 months ago the then Minister for Finance announced that there was a crisis situation.  He announced that at the end of one of the most serious strikes that ever affected the economy here, the maintenance strike.  That was the time to seek an agreement and to get an arrangement which would operate a prices and incomes policy which would be acceptable to all parties, but what happened?  Political expediency intervened and the short-term political advantage of winning an election was put in the forefront, and the national advantage of a long-term agreement on wages and prices or prices and incomes was jettisoned.</P>
    <P>Since then we have had the fantastic experience of a Government in which one member has been conspiring against another, or one group has been set against another.  Now, of course, an effort is being made to try to get an agreement, but that is not the way to run an economy.  A sudden switching from doing too little to doing too much, or threatening to do too much, is obviously an ill-thought-out policy. In fact, it is a policy of thinking out from day to day what may be acceptable or what can be got away with. Under pressure of public opinion, and particularly trade union opinion, many parts of this arrangement have been abandoned or jettisoned.</P>
    <P>We are now rapidly approaching the position in which the crisis that existed in October will have vanished.  Legislation is not necessary except in one sphere, a most important sphere.  Legislation was passed through this House, and has now gone to the Seanad in the shape of the Finance Bill, that will <Col N="1099" /> have a most serious effect on the finances of many companies.  Every single report of every company in this country that has issued in recent months, with a few isolated exceptions, shows a decline in profits and difficulties in marketing, some of them of crisis proportions.  There is the case of the situation in Clara.  There is the case of some boot and shoe companies. This morning we had the serious announcement by Nítrigin Éireann. These can be multiplied.  It does not matter whether the company is a State, a semi-State, or a private company. The graph the whole way shows a decline in profits, a decline in exports in some cases, or a decline in competitive capacity</P>
    <P>In that situation to impose, as has been imposed in the Finance Bill, an obligation on companies to reopen their accounts and to go back over accounts that have already been closed to make available for tax purposes a sum of money that will absorb in some cases up to 24 per cent of the profits&mdash; perhaps in some cases even more&mdash;is placing on them an obligation that will put many of them into serious difficulties. That has happened because of the fact that in this proposal which was initially introduced as a package deal, the Government have abandoned, or postponed, or deferred, one portion of it but have proceeded with the other. That has been pointed out to the Government not by this party or by Deputies in the Labour Party, or by any other politician, but by the Confederation of Irish Industry and by the representatives of the different organised commercial groups.  In that situation it is obvious that the Government have no idea what they are trying to do, and no idea of where they are going.</P>
    <P>We believe that this must be approached in the only way in which it is possible to get agreement, that is, by direct discussions between the representatives of industry and the representatives of the trade unions.  Of course the Government have an obligation to provide leadership and to indicate what should be done.  The cement strike lasted for months and it is quite obvious that the figure of <Col N="1100" /> 14,000 houses cannot be reached this year. That is obvious for two reasons: one because of the protracted cement strike, and the other because of the fact that the maximum loans now available from the Local Loans Fund amount to £3,000 and in many cases houses are costing double that.</P>
    <P>We are given here the statistics for the number of loans issued this year by the Dublin County Council and there was a catastrophic decline in the number of loans accepted because of the inability of borrowers, or people anxious to avail of the SDA schemes, or whatever scheme they operate under, to avail of that facility.  In those circumstances the Government decided to introduce and persisted in passing a proposal yesterday that will put a tax on mobile homes.  No words are necessary to describe the approach to that matter.  It is crazy economically; it is crazy socially.  It is bad from the point of view of the people involved; it is bad from the point of view of the local authorities trying to deal with the problem; and it is bad in the national interest.  It is again evidence of a bureaucratic mentality that applied a blanket system and took in all mobile homes without differentiating between those used for holiday or luxury or part-time residence during a limited period and those used as substitutes for houses.</P>
    <P>This situation has now deteriorated to such an extent that the criticism that is being made of the Government is not coming solely from this side of the House or from the Labour Party or from outside.  Deputy Haughey recently went to a meeting and he said that the time has come to climb out of the mud on to firm ground.  Who put the country into the mud?  Who but his own colleagues.  One can sympathise with Deputy Haughey's comments. He is obviously working his passage home, even via Brussels, but that is not a situation that other Government Ministers or those who still stay in the Government can regard with tranquillity.  The Tánaiste said and I quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 7th May:</P>
    <P>It is the strength of a great party that it can purge itself and I think <Col N="1101" /> it is perhaps rather unfortunate in a way that we have not demonstrated this more often because there has not been the reason for it. </P>
    <P>In his speech in Wexford&mdash;I quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 12th December, 1970&mdash;he said:</P>
    <P>There should be no complacency arising from the by-election and at a general election the people would expect Fianna Fáil to have overcome all internal conflict by ensuring that there were no silent dissidents biding their time. </P>
    <P>He, of course, was aware of what had happened and aware of the comments that had been made by some of his colleagues.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach's and the Government's concern at the situation was because of the statements that were made by a number of Deputies who have given their votes in the House, if not their verbal approval, to the Government. When the recent arms trial concluded Deputy Blaney&mdash;I quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 24th October&mdash;when asked if he wanted Mr. Lynch to resign said:</P>
    <P>I couldn't care less what he does.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said:</P>
    <P>I have been in the past a potential candidate and I am not ruling out any possibilities at this stage. </P>
    <P>That was in reference to his interest in being Taoiseach.  He declined to comment on the future of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, saying that it was a matter for Deputy Gibbons and the Taoiseach but he did say:</P>
    <P>I think this whole affair has done this party a great deal of damage. </P>
    <P>This is not criticism from opponents of Fianna Fáil.  These are comments by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  How they vote is a matter for them, but is it any wonder that people are concerned and are anxious about the future?</P>
    <P>We have advocated here repeatedly that action should be taken to investigate thoroughly public expenditure. We have advocated the establishment of a Dáil Committee to investigate the expenditure and activities of State companies.  I notice from a statement made by the Minister for Transport and Power that it is still <Col N="1102" /> the subject of consideration by the Government.  There have been notable examples in recent months, particularly CIE.  It is the one that comes more frequently before the House than any other State company and in regard to which there is an overwhelming case for an investigation by a Dáil Committee. There is now the question of Nítrigin Éireann.</P>
    <P>The only people who can bring in the legislation and have the power to pass it are the Government.  If legislation is brought in to establish a Committee it will get willing support from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an even more fundamental question of Dáil business. There has been a lot of discussion about the inability of the Dáil to get through the business that has been ordered.  Reference has been made to the idea of establishing Dáil Committees. Most of us who have sat on Dáil Committees over the years realise that many Committees perform useful functions in examining specific questions and in reporting and recommending either amendments of the law or action in other spheres, but there is a limit to the committee work that can be done. Most of those who talk on this, either from the sidelines or even Deputies, have no experience of committees or have only limited experience.  Some of us have sat on many committees dealing with many different topics, either Public Accounts or Select or Special Committees established to deal with specific problems.  These committees can do useful work.  There is a strong case for a Committee on State and semi-State companies analogous to the Public Accounts Committee.  There are vast areas of legislation of a technical character that can be examined critically and dealt with in Committee.</P>
    <P>However, committees can only function if it is possible at the same time to carry on in the Dáil other Dáil work; and it is not possible to have a proliferation of Dáil Committees and, at the same time, expect the Dáil to work effectively.  It might be possible to establish a system under which, instead of having Deputies designated to a particular Committee, Deputies of the whole House would be entitled to <Col N="1103" /> come and go.  I am not sure whether that is possible under Standing Orders, but I believe the time has come when a small all-Party Committee should be set up to consider and make recommendations. It is idle to imagine that we can suddenly change a system and that a whole wave of reforms can be introduced that will put everything right.  A small Dáil Committee should be set up.  This is a problem that affects all parties and affects Government and Opposition alike.  It is not possible to get through legislation and Estimates in the time available with the volume of public business being done, if at the same time Deputies, or some of them, exercise their right&mdash;to which they are entitled, of course&mdash;and if they try to outdo each other in making lengthy speeches.  There is no doubt that a Deputy is entitled to talk at length, but if business is to be got through it will not be done by dragging it out through excessively long speeches.  Most of us who have been here for some time know that this is not common only in this Dáil, in other Dáils Deputies indulged in this sort of thing too and eventually had to abandon it.  It is a mistake to imagine that problems can be solved by excessively long speeches.  At the same time, there is a variety of problems not being discussed because of the overloaded timetable.</P>
    <P>The time has come when in the interests of getting business done there is a case for an all-Party Committee to make recommendations on revised procedures, on the establishment, where practicable, of Dáil Committees and possibly the introduction of some limitation, except in designated debates or in particular circumstances, on excessively long speeches in normal debates.  That would be in the interests of getting business done.  We cannot expect to discuss every topic at length or to imagine that merely because people are talking at length that they are, as the late Deputy Bill Norton said, distilling their thoughts and conferring on us some sort of wisdom that we have not had in the Dáil until the advent of some new intellectual process <Col N="1104" /> that in some way or other is superior to anything that went before.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary democracy can only function if it is used and modernised to deal with the situation as we find it. Undoubtedly the establishment of particular committees to deal with State enterprises and State companies is probably the most urgent, but there are other ways in which it could be done.  It should be possible to get, through an all-Party Committee, recommendations that would make the present system more efficient and more expeditious.  The parliamentary system of government, with all its defects, has been described as the worst until you try the others.  On the whole, this Parliament has functioned effectively and efficiently.  It could be more efficient if we put our minds together in order to change the system to meet the demands of the present.</P>
    <P>The debate which is normal at this time of the year is coming at the end of, in many ways, one of the most extraordinary years this country has ever had.  It is a reflection on the Government and on the lack of real purposeful leadership that a situation has developed in which we have enacted very little legislation, discussed very few major Estimates, primarily because of the amount of time devoted to discussing the internal problems of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  The recent by-elections showed, as the other by-elections this year showed, that if the trend continues, and there is every reason to believe it will continue, whenever there is a general election there will be a change of Government.  So far as this party are concerned we have put forward our policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never been prepared not to accept responsibility for forming a Government or of accepting responsibility to do our duty either in government or in Opposition.  We do not connive at disregard for the law when we are in Opposition and give verbal approval to the maintenance of the institutions of State when we are in Government. <Col N="1105" /> I said before, and I want to repeat, that this Parliament and this country are not the property of any political party. We are only here as the temporary servants of the people for whatever period we are here.  We have an obligation to hand on these institutions and act as trustees for those who will come after us.</P>
      <P>We have behaved in a most responsible and restrained manner throughout the whole of this crisis that has besmirched the name of the country, a crisis that has prevented people coming here and which has produced serious problems for the small hotelier and for guesthouse owners, for industry and other sections, and which has resulted in a situation in which there are thousands of people not only in the city of Dublin but in my constituency and in nearly every constituency looking for houses, looking for homes, looking for proper health services, looking for their ordinary right to live as Irishmen and Irishwomen in Ireland. They are concerned at the way things have gone.  They do not want to see this country deteriorate to the extent that the Taoiseach says that kidnappings, such as happened in South America or elsewhere, are a possibility. If that situation develops it is because of the subservience of the Government to the Tacateers and the Tacateer influence.</P>
      <P>We want to see this country continuing to prosper and continuing to provide the peaceful attraction that would make it possible to get all the people of Ireland to live together in harmony and peace.  We welcome the change that has occurred which recognises the traditional policy we have preached and practised of trying to secure through agreement and cooperation common ground that will make it possible for people, irrespective of their religion or of their political beliefs, irrespective of their backgrounds, to live together and to give allegiance to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been far too much slobbery talk and sentimental verbiage about one form of Republicanism or another, the type of confused thinking that was displayed in speeches by some Fianna Fáil Deputies, in some speeches made by some of them in the heat of <Col N="1106" /> the moment when they were knocking around the Four Courts, or even in this House, or at political gatherings. The plain truth is that the majority of the people want the institutions of this State to continue to serve their interests, to make it possible for people to get a better standard of living, to get better economic and social conditions, to get a situation in which the elected representatives of the people will put the people's interests first and party and personal interests last.  So far as we are concerned, we have never failed to do that.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have not secured sufficient votes to implement that in practice is not our fault, but it does not mean that we are going to lower our aims or abandon our principles or waver in our determination to vindicate and assert what we believe are sound policies.  We are prepared to seek public support for it and to cooperate generously and reasonably with those who are prepared to go along the same path.  We are confident on the pattern of results established this year, where we have seen increased support in every by-election for our candidates and our policy, that whenever the general election occurs&mdash; the quicker the better&mdash;it will be possible to provide a Government which will command respect because of its personnel and its capacity and, above all, because of its patriotism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start off by saying that I believe all Deputies and all parties in this House believe that they have been sent here for the purpose of improving, as far as possible, the standard of living and the development of the State.  Where we differ is in the ways in which we do this and the ways in which we accept our responsibility for doing what is considered to be the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach at the commencement of his opening speech referred to a number of items and I propose to deal with them during the course of my address here.  Before I do so I should like, Sir, with your permission, to make a rather unusual comment in view of the fact that a precedent was established elsewhere.  The Leader of the Seanad, Senator Ó Maoláin, yesterday <Col N="1107" /> claimed, according to reports in the papers this morning and on the radio last night, that because this House was held up and did no business the Seanad could not meet.  He said the Opposition was responsible for the delays.  It was not the Opposition who initiated the arms trial; it was not the Opposition who dismissed Ministers; and it was not the Opposition who caused all the hullabaloo we have had over the past 12 months.  I agree with Senator Ó Maoláin that no business has been done in this House but the responsibility for the ordering and carrying through of business is surely a matter for the Government of the day. No amount of whitewashing by Senator Ó Maoláin or anybody else will remove the guilt for this from the Government. I know it is not usual to refer to the other House here but in view of what was said there I think we are entitled to defend ourselves against unwarranted attacks by people who must know they are not stating facts. I leave the matter at that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred, perhaps rightly so, to the upsets and losses which occurred to the economy of the country and to individuals and firms as a result of strikes, particularly the bank strike and the cement strike.  May I repeat what I have said here on a number of occasions : to lay the blame for strikes in every case, as appears to be the popular thing to do, on the backs of the workers is not quite correct, particularly because it has been proven time and again that strikes in most cases have been caused by the unreasonableness of management.  If anyone wants proof of the truth of that statement all they have to do is check with the original offer made by management and the final offer made by management.  In 99 cases out of 100 it will be found that the final offer made is very much closer to the original demand made by the workers than the original offer.  Employers here have built up a system of horse trading where wages are concerned which is no credit to them.  They offer the least possible amount they think they can get away with, and indeed in many cases they offer much less than that, and then they bargain and bargain and <Col N="1108" /> bargain and eventually after the workers in the firm, the general public and in many cases the management themselves, have suffered severe losses they eventually come up with a realistic offer which is accepted and the strike ends.  Is it possible to get across to them that this is a very stupid thing to do?</P>
    <P>As a trade union official I have negotiated with a number of English firms and while I do not propose to say that the English businessman is a better businessman than the Irish businessman, it is far easier when you make a case for an increase in wages, if it is a realistic one, to have it accepted by the English employer than by a native employer.  I wish employers would learn that the idea of bargaining with losses to everyone is not the way to carry out negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that the employment figure this year is up on last year.  Might I remind him that unemployment is substantially up on last year and that even with the bit of manoeuvring which the Department of Labour and Social Welfare did the figure is still over 60,000.  The Minister for Labour, a few months ago in reply to a question from me, said that these 60,000 people are unemployable.  I asked him why the jobs which he was bragging about having in the country, but which could not be filled, were not being filled by people who lived here and were on the unemployment register. He explained that the people on the register were not the type of people who would fit into the job.  I am sure he was not suggesting they were all craftsmen's jobs.  What he was saying was that people on the unemployment register here need have no hope of the Government ever doing anything for them because the Minister for Labour and the Government think they are unemployable. This is a deplorable situation.</P>
    <P>In addition to that the Department of Labour and Social Welfare have carried out a manoeuvre which, while benefiting some people, has reduced considerably the number of people signing on at the employment exchange. They have introduced what they call a retirement pension at 65.  This means that people who are over 65 years of <Col N="1109" /> age and have an average number of stamps on their cards can, if they are unemployed, decide not to seek employment again, retire and draw the same amount of money from the local post office as they would from the employment exchange.  This has effectively reduced the number of people on the unemployment register.  I would be grateful if the Taoiseach, when he is replying, would tell the House how many people were actually unemployed last week or the week before.  I think the Taoiseach should answer this question in the House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said, although he offered no evidence to prove it, but I accept his word if he is giving his word, that emigration this year is lower than last year.  No comparison was made and I am always suspicious when a politician, particularly a member of the Government, refers to something without giving comparative figures.  The Taoiseach said it appeared that the number of people who emigrated this year was lower than last year.  The evidence we have does not bear out the Taoiseach's statement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to imports and exports.  When he says there has been an increase in industrial exports would he tell the House if the £23 million or £24 million of that represents mineral ore?  Is the big increase in industrial exports in fact mineral ore? Is it not true that this has been brought about by the action of people in this country, who have not asked for Government grants or anything else, and that manufacturing industry is not exporting to the extent we are led to believe they are?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to what is happening about Nítrigin Éireann.  I quite agree it does appear extraordinary that the Government were not aware of what was happening or, if they were aware of what was happening, made no attempt to try to protect Nítrigin Éireann by preventing the dumping&mdash; it is a strong word&mdash;of fertilisers from Britain and the Continent.  Surely the Government should have been aware of this?  Surely it was brought to their notice and, if it was, why did they not do something about it?  Must we wait <Col N="1110" /> until Nítrigin Éireann come along and point out that they are in the same position as a number of companies which have recently gone burst and the Government say they are very sorry but they cannot do anything to help because the amount involved is too big and the company has to close down?</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan and Deputy Treacy asked some questions yesterday about the boot and shoe industry.  I do not know whether the Government are really serious, but they seem not to be aware of the fact that the boot and shoe industry is being killed by imports, not alone by valid imports but by illegal imports as well in the Taoiseach's own city of Cork.  Is the Taoiseach aware that a Polish ship at present in port, as far as I know, has been freely selling boots and shoes at £1 per pair?  Is he aware of that and, if he is, why is something not done about it?  It is a case of thousands of pairs and not a couple of pairs.  Why is this allowed?  It is bad enough to have, under the Free Trade Area Agreement, imports of boots and shoes and other things strangling our own industries, but when we have this blatant smuggling under the noses of those who should prevent it, surely it is time the Government wakened up and did something about it?</P>
    <P>Where tourism is concerned we have had the sort of inept appeal: &ldquo;Don't hit me now with the child in me arms.&rdquo; No one should say a word about tourism because it is such a great money spinner.  It should not be attacked by anybody.  Is it not a fact that, despite everything that has been said, the arms trial and the unrest in this part of the country did more to damage tourism than all the riots in the Six Counties?  Is it not true that people abroad heard of this and is it not equally true that as recently as a couple of weeks ago the Taoiseach's reference that he proposed, if certain things happened, to reintroduce the Offences Against the State Act brought plane loads of newspaper correspondents here to watch the civil war? I do not know whether they brought special insurance, but the whole thing is becoming utterly ridiculous when, <Col N="1111" /> even as close as Britain is, they do not know there what is happening and think apparently that at any moment the Whole country will blow up.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been careful, following his original announcement, to say that the Offences Against the State Act has not been reintroduced and it is not proposed to reintroduce it unless certain things happen.  I am amused at his suggestion that the kind of kidnapping that occurred in places like Canada, Brazil and Spain could occur here.  We all know that the neighbour a mile down the road cannot do a darned thing here but we know all about it.  That is the pattern in towns, cities, country districts, or wherever you are.  We are a very small country in which everybody knows everybody else's business and to suggest that what happened in Canada, Brazil and Spain could happen here is just too ridiculous for words.</P>
    <P>With your permission, Sir, I should like to read the sections of the Act because it was passed in 1940 and a great many people seem to be unaware of what it lays down.  Because of that I think it should go on the records of the House now so that those who want to can read what, in fact, the Offences Against the State Act provides.  In section 3 of Part II subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>If and whenever and so often as the Government makes and publishes a proclamation declaring that the powers conferred by this Part of this Act are necessary to secure the preservation of public peace and order and that it is expedient that this Part of this Act should come into force immediately, this Part of this Act shall come into force forthwith. </P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach suggest we have reached that stage?  Subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>If at any time while this Part of this Act is in force the Government makes and publishes a proclamation declaring that this Part of this Act shall cease to be in force, this Part of this Act shall forthwith cease to be in force. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> The Government must put it into operation by declaration in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and also, by declaration in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> revoke its operation.  But the real trouble is that subsection (1) of section 4 provides:</P>
    <P>Whenever a Minister of State is of opinion that any particular person is engaged in activities which, in his opinion, are prejudicial to the preservation of public peace and order or to the security of the State, such Minister may by warrant under his hand and sealed with his official seal order the arrest and detention of such person under this section. </P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>Any member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant any person in respect of whom a warrant has been issued by a Minister of State under the foregoing sub-section of this section. </P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>Every person arrested under the next preceding subsection of this section shall be detained in a prison or other place prescribed in that behalf by regulations made under this Part of this Act until this Part of this Act ceases to be in force or until he is released under the subsequent provisions of this Part of this Act, whichever first happens. </P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides:</P>
    <P>Whenever a person is detained under this section, there shall be furnished to such person, as soon as may be after he arrives at a prison or other place of detention prescribed in that behalf by regulations made under this Part of this Act, a copy of the warrant issued under this section in relation to such person and of the provisions of section 8 of this Act. </P>
    <P>In other words, he is entitled to be told that a Minister has ordered his arrest. That is all that will be stated because the particular form of the order is here and it gives no information as to why the person has been arrested.  I could go on, but it certainly appears to me that is is asking this House, and this Parliament should know this, to give to Ministers, some of whom I would not <Col N="1113" /> trust, authority to arrest any person they may wish to arrest.  All they have to do in their peculiarly twisted minds is to get the idea that the person might do something with which they might disagree.  How ridiculous can we become? This might be all right in war time but it is certainly not all right in 1970.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said, and I agree with him, that we have the courts to deal with these people.  We, in this party, are entirely opposed to bank raiding, post office raiding or to anything which is not allowed by the law of the land.  There is a rather odd situation in that the courts have failed to deal with the people who have been brought before them.  There is a fundamental right for any accused person to be tried by a court of law, and having been tried, to be sentenced.  In one or two cases in which sentences have been imposed they have been dealt with in such a way that the thing becomes somewhat farcical.  One man has been released and people have said he was released because he spilled the beans on someone else.  Another man was arrested for driving a getaway car and the judge who tried him suggested that he was not really at fault at all; he had been persuaded by somebody or other to drive the car and he did it on the spur of the moment.  Again, how stupid can we be if we accept that kind of thing?</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what the Taoiseach calls the necessity to introduce the Offences Against the State Act.  So long as the law of the land is there and the courts are capable of dialing with these matters then these matters should be dealt with under the normal law.  There is one other thing laid down in the Offences Against the State Act. I refer to the tribunal by which appeals will be heard.  It is provided in the Act that there will be three members of the tribunal, one of whom will be an Army officer.  I have great respect for the Army.  I have great respect for Army officers.  I do not think a judicial court is the place for an Army officer. I believe this is one of the things which did cause a lot of trouble before.  We do not want military tribunals or this sort of thing happening in this country, and there is no reason for it so long as <Col N="1114" /> the courts are there to deal with them. If the courts will not deal with them, we should change the people operating the courts.  If the judges are either afraid or too tender-hearted to deal with lawbreakers, we should change the judges.  But the one thing I do not want to see happening, and which this party does not want to see happening, is gardaí doing their job as they see fit and finding, when they bring people to court and produce evidence against them, that those people get away scot free.  This is what is causing the trouble &mdash;completely disillusioning men who are risking their lives to uphold the law.  This is a matter on which there can be no doubt in anyone's mind in this House.  Every sane-minded person should be prepared to back the enforcement of the law of the land as enforced, first, by the Garda and then by the judges and justices who are appointed and well paid to do their job.  I would suggest that when people come before the court for serious breaches of the law those breaches should be dealt with as serious breaches of the law.  Nothing makes the people who take them in there so disillusioned as the fact that it is being treated as a trivial matter and that law breakers are allowed out as if they were first offenders, many of them people who have broken the law again and again and again.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that, of course, the prices in this country were going up.  He said they went up by 8 per cent in the past year and that it was the increases in wages that was forcing up prices and would continue to do so if we did not try to be more moderate about it.  Before referring to the Prices and Incomes Bill, I should like to give four tables which I have here and which will prove that what the Taoiseach is referring to is not quite correct.  Take the industrial wages in a number of countries, the 1970 gross hourly wages converted on the basis of local purchasing power. The German <i>International</i> for November, 1970, says that the percentage increases in real wages between 1964 and 1970 in the following countries were as follows: Germany, 32; Netherlands, 25: Belgium, 27; France, 29; Italy, 34 and Ireland, 24.  So much for the case that <Col N="1115" /> wages are forcing up prices in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to exports, the percentage increase in exports in a number of countries in 1968-69 is as follows: Japan, 23.75; Belgium/Luxembourg, 23; Austria, 21.25; Netherlands, 19.5; France, 18.25; West Germany, 17; Switzerland, 16.5; Sweden, 16; Italy, 15.25; Denmark, 14.5; United Kingdom, 14; Norway, 13.75; Ireland, 11.6 &mdash;the third last from the end of the table; Canada, 9.5; USA, 9.5. The source is <i>Vision,</i> November, 1970.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the annual rate of erosion in currencies in 1969-70 is as follows: Belgium, 4 per cent; Denmark, 5.2 per cent; France, 5.4 per cent; Germany, 3.6 per cent; Holland, 4.1 per cent; Ireland, 7.4 per cent; Italy, 3.7 per cent; Japan, 7.5 per cent; Sweden, 5.8 per cent; United Kingdom, 5.3 per cent; USA, 5.7 per cent.  So, with the exception of Japan, the erosion in currency in this country, which is .1 per cent under Japan, is far higher than, nearly double, that of the remainder of the countries I have named.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that there is no increase in the standard of living of so many people in this country?  Is it not true that, no matter what happens, because of mismanagement at State level, the people of this country are now worse off than they were last year or the year before?</P>
    <P>Let me give one final quotation which is very significant in relation to the GNP and market prices per head of population for 1968, the latest available date: Sweden, $3,320; Switzerland, $2,790; Denmark, $2,540; France, S2,530; Norway, $2,360; Germany, $2,200; Belgium, $2,160; Netherlands, $1,980; United Kingdom, $1,860; Finland, $1,710; Ireland, $1,033.  I suggest that this proves that, with the possible exception of Spain and Portugal, which are not included, we are definitely at the bottom of the league. Incidentally, this is with the compliments of the Confederation of Irish Industries, <i>Economic Trends,</i> 8th December, 1970.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Prices and Incomes Bill, which is on-off&mdash;it is like Mahomed's coffin, suspended between <Col N="1116" /> heaven and earth&mdash;I feel that the Taoiseach is now caught in a cleft stick.  He has promised the ICTU that he would defer it.  The constituent members of the Congress said, in effect, &ldquo;We do not want it deferred; we want it withdrawn.  We will sign an agreement, which will operate, on condition that it is definitely withdrawn.&rdquo; The Taoiseach discussed the matter on a second occasion with them.  There has been no change on the union side. They have instructions to sign a reasonable agreement which will be accepted by them, by the employers and by the Government, on condition that the Prices and Incomes Bill is withdrawn.  The employers apparently want something written down in legislation.  When the negotiations took place and the agreement was made, this was not part of the agreement. The agreement was made without any guarantee being asked that it would be written into the law of the land and most certainly the trade union movement will not accept State control of this particular item.  Therefore, the Taoiseach, who says he has not had an opportunity of making up his mind, must do so pretty quickly because unless it is clear, almost immediately, the constituent unions of the ICTU will feel free to negotiate&mdash; and rightly so&mdash;on their own for wage increases.  They cannot wait any longer.  After all, some of their agreements expired on 1st October, 1970. They were, in fact, in the course of negotiating new agreements when the bombshell was introduced.  They are not prepared to wait any longer.</P>
    <P>I think it must be agreed that trade unionists in this country have been terribly patient in waiting for people to make up their minds.  Nobody can blame them if they are not prepared to wait any longer.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Prices and Incomes Bill was a drastic mistake in the first place.  I referred to it as &ldquo;Colley's folly&rdquo;; my words have been proved correct.  It was introduced because, apparently, Professor Chubb said he could not reach agreement. Extraordinarily, the same gentleman was able to come back a few weeks afterwards and was prepared to preside <Col N="1117" /> over a further conference.  Did he or did the Government jump the gun? Surely these things should be dealt with in a reasonable way?  The agreement has now been made.  Most trade unionists will say it is much less than they had hoped to get as compensation for the fantastic cost of living increases; nevertheless they are prepared to accept it but if the Government do not withdraw the Prices and Incomes Bill the sky is the limit and on the Government's head be it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Offences Against the State Act says that whenever a Minister of State is of opinion that any person is engaged in activities which in the Minister's opinion are prejudicial to the preservation of public peace and order, he may take certain action.  I wonder would it be considered that if people go on strike against a Prices and Incomes Bill, which is brought in and passed here against the wishes of the trade union and labour movement, it is prejudicial to good order?  Could these people be arrested and interned? Is this a two-edged weapon which the Government are attempting to use against the workers?  It appears that this is what is at the back of it, not the so-called kidnappings or threats to murder to which the Taoiseach referred today.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach can be very devious and his Ministers appear to be prepared to take extraordinary steps.  It appears that something like that might be at the back of their minds.  If they think the threat of internment will frighten the trade unionists they have another think coming.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said 14,000 houses would be built this year.  I wonder where he got the figures.  Was he referring to local authority houses, SDA houses or to all houses?  Perhaps somebody has done a quick count around the country and any house that looked new&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In regard to housing, I am rather perturbed about the delay in the Department when a local authority applies for sanction for a housing scheme and for permission to borrow from the Local Loans Fund to build. If the Department think they are fooling anybody they are not.  Every local authority interested in building houses has been frustrated by the delay which occurs.  A scheme is sent up to the Department; they will ask questions or send it back if they want a slight change in design.  I understood this had been done away with years ago.  I was told about three years ago in this House that in order to streamline local authority housing the Department had agreed that in future all the planning, up to the question of final sanction, <Col N="1119" /> would be left to the local authority. Yet, I find that if the scheme is sent up to the Department they send it back for checking because the ceiling is half an inch too high or a room half an inch too big or the chimney flue is too big or too small.</P>
      <P>After it has gone back and forwards for several months it is eventually sanctioned, tenders are invited, one is accepted and sent to the Department. They then write and ask: &ldquo;Could this not be changed?  Why is this so dear?&rdquo; After about six months the scheme may have to be readvertised and will cost a couple of hundred pounds more than it did originally.  When it is finally sanctioned the Department are asked for permission to borrow from the Local Loans Fund and then we have all the usual cod that goes on until finally, about 12 months later, it may be possible to get permission to build. This is no credit to the Government.  I am quite sure this is a direct instruction from the Government and that no Minister for Local Government, whether we like him or not, is doing this deliberately.</P>
      <P>Last night we had a very intelligent intervention from Deputy J. Lenehan on the matter of caravans being used for houses.  The number of caravans used by people who have no other place to live is enormous and the number is growing because sites and houses are so expensive.  Many newly-weds are buying caravans and using them as temporary homes until houses become available.  Deputy Lenehan made a point which I took up but which we could not proceed with at the time.  His statement was that the Minister for Local Government had announced that the Department were prepared to pay the full cost of traditional housing for itinerants.  This is not correct.  If a local authority wants to build a house for an itinerant they are told they are building a house for a person and they get the normal grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was wrong for the Minister to make a statement that could be misunderstood by people like Deputy Lenehan.  It would be much better if he stated clearly the type of housing <Col N="1120" /> accommodation to which he was referring. This point should be cleared up as soon as possible because there is a great deal of dissatisfaction among people who felt they were covered and who are not covered by this particular section.</P>
    <P>The officials in the Department must be driven crazy by the failure of the Department to pay grants.  Perhaps it is because they are short of staff or short of money but whatever the reason people who have been building or repairing houses or adding water or sewerage, cannot get a hearing from the Department of Local Government. There is something wrong when this happens.  I have a letter here from a man who says he has been waiting six months.  Last May somebody inspected his water and sewage job and he was told that if he fixed up a few little things it would be all right.  He did as he was asked but he has not heard a word since from the Department.  Are there not sufficient inspectors or sufficient clerical staff?  Is it the old idea that if you do not inspect the job, you do not have to pay and so the Government will save money for a period.  This problem should be dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>I know a man who built a house and was promised the higher rate of grant. He was promised £400 and because the local authority were giving the same amount he proceeded to build.  He had to borrow some money but eventually he finished the house.  When the final inspection took place he was notified by the Department that as his wages had increased in the meantime he was not now eligible for the higher rate of grant.  This means the man is £200 short.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  If he was officially informed of his position and proceeded on the basis of the amount of money he was to get, he is entitled to get that money and the position should not be changed.  I mention these matters because we were given the impression by the Taoiseach that everything in the garden was lovely.</P>
    <P>I must mention some other points which should also be dealt with because they prove that the Taoiseach and his Ministers are not doing their <Col N="1121" /> jobs.  We had the question of an increase of wages which was granted during the year to employees of local authorities and State employees, the first part of 50s granted from the 1st April and the second of 34s from the 1st January next.  Is the Taoiseach aware that local authorities did not get from the Department of Local Government the necessary money to pay their share by way of grants of that 50s and 34s?  Is he aware that local authorities had to do one of two things? They either had to lay off a considerable number of employees, as I fear will happen in your constituency, Sir, or they will have to make up the money themselves, as they did in my constituency. My county council provided all the extra money needed.  Instead of having to provide for £17,000 they had to provide for £34,000 because the Department of Local Government did not back up their grant and they knew well the result of the wage increase would be that money would be short. This is the sort of thing which should not happen if the Government were doing their job and facing up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened in regard to employees of the Office of Public Works who will be laid off next week because there is not enough money in certain maintenance schemes to carry on.  The money was budgeted for, a wage increase occurred and as the extra money was not provided we are told those people will have to be laid off.  There is one very interesting thing in this.  While all the outdoor staff, the men who are actually doing the job, are being laid off, I am not aware of any layoff which is likely to occur in regard to clerical staff, engineering staff or managerial staff.  It only applies to the fellow with the shovel.  It is too bad this has happened.  The Departments concerned should face up to their responsibilities and make the necessary money available.  There is no point in giving them a wage increase and because of the fact that you lay them off reducing the amount of money which they will earn for a 12 month period by at least 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has been very noisy, not alone in the House but <Col N="1122" /> around the country, about the new health scheme.  Some questions have been asked about the way it is to be administered, particularly the question of one particular health committee who apparently have found they were able not alone to decide the site of the office but also to do a number of things which no other health committee has been able to do.  Of course, the fact that an election was in the area and there were more votes to be got in the town they were taking it to than there were in the town they were taking it from seems to have been the qualifying criterion here.</P>

If he does not know how to negotiate he should get somebody who will do the job for him.</P>
      <P>Recently I received a letter concerning a case in the Monaghan constituency, which is represented by the Minister for Health.  Part of this constituency comprises a portion of County Meath which was formerly represented by me.  The letter I received stated:</P>
      <P>This meeting is totally dissatisfied with the strength of the representation made by Mr. Childers, TD, on Oliver Halpenny's behalf.  We strongly protest against the gross dishonesty of members of the Department of Justice in misrepresenting the facts of the case.  Passed unanimously by the Fianna Fáil cumann in Drumconrath, County Meath. </P>
      <P>This was signed by the Secretary and sent on to me asking me to raise it in this House.  I have raised it in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mr. Halpenny referred to was a young garda who got first place in the passing out examination.  He was their best recruit.  He came of a very decent family and had everything in his favour.  Subsequently, as an all-night guard, he was in a room which was covered by an armed military sentry outside.  Somebody came in and alleged that he had dozed off.  He was <Col N="1124" /> summarily dismissed from the force. The Minister for Health was asked to make representations on his behalf. Apparently the Drumconrath cumann of Fianna Fáil are not satisfied with the representations he made.  Maybe this would suggest to him that he could raise the matter again.  Mr. Halpenny was treated disgracefully.  The fact that this happened to him and the fact that misrepresentation was made, as the secretary of the Fianna Fáil cumann so rightly suggests, calls for an investigation into the matter.  He was protecting the Taoiseach and some people alleged he had a gun and he fell asleep with it in his hand.  This is a terrible thing to have happened to a young man at the start of his career.</P>

When Deputy Seán Flanagan was Minister for Health a couple of years ago, in answer to Deputy Carter, he said that it would be 15, 20 or 25 years before the new scheme could come into operation, but when Deputy Childers became Minister for Health he reduced the number of years to ten or 15 and said that some sections might come fairly quickly.  I imagine when the time comes, like the case of the doctors' fees, it will be deferred because agreement cannot be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to social welfare benefits I believe there is a great shortage of staff in the Department of Social Welfare. I want to make it clear in regard to this and the other Government Departments I have referred to that I have received nothing but courtesy and co-operation from the staffs of those Departments, but I cannot expect miracles.  If I ask the Department of Social Welfare, or the Department of Local Government, or any other Department, to do something and the people who should do it are just not there, I cannot blame them if it is not done.  The person who is waiting for the payment will blame them and will probably blame me and other public <Col N="1126" /> representatives because it is not done properly.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that it appears that what was formerly regarded by young people down the country as a plum job is no longer so regarded.  Everyone used to want to get into the Civil Service. Nobody seems to want that now.  Is the reason that the pay is too low or are the conditions too bad?  Whatever the reason, surely it should be corrected.  I am told that senior officials are wasting their time doing jobs which could be done by people who have just left school, if the thing were handled properly.  The only people who are really suffering are the people who are waiting for payments from the Department of Local Government or the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is very annoying to get a letter from somebody who says he has not got his benefit for five or six weeks and, on checking up, to find that there has been a small slip-up.  I am not blaming the officials.  They cannot do it if they have not got the staff.  It is only fair to say that.  Over the past 12 months we have been promised on at least half a dozen occasions that the £1,200 limit for insurability will be raised.  All we have been able to get is a promise.  First of all the Minister said it would require legislation.  Then he said he would make an order.  Then he said it was being investigated.  The last time I asked him about it, about three months ago, he said it would be done soon.  I asked him how soon was soon and he said he felt it would be within a couple of months.  The couple of months are up and we still have not got it.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised at this.  Unless again there is a shortage of staff, there is no reason why £1,600 should not have been introduced as the limit because the number of extra people who would be paying insurance would make a big difference.  There are many people who want to be included mainly for retirement pensions or because they want to hold on to their claim.  In fact they would be paid sick pay.  I believe that the number of claims which would be made on the Department would be relatively small and, for that reason, I think the Department are losing <Col N="1127" /> money.  I would ask to have this matter dealt with fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two other matters concerning the Department of Social Welfare on which the Minister should take a stand.  One is related to the question of appeals.  It has become the practice that if somebody who has been working gets married, works after marriage, qualifies for maternity benefit, has a baby, stays out for a few months, is anxious to resume work again in her old job but it is not available, and signs for unemployment benefit, she is refused benefit and if she appeals it seems to be the standard practice that she is refused on appeal.</P>
    <P>I asked a question about this a few weeks ago because I understand it is fairly widespread.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary who is directly in charge of this section talk to these people?  I am not prepared to accept the statement made by the Minister. In answer to me he said that the job of an appeals officer was a statutory job and that he could not interfere. That is a lot of arrant nonsense.  If that is so, an appeals officer can make up his mind to do anything at all no matter how crazy it is, and carry it out.  I believe this should be stopped.</P>
    <P>The second thing which I think is wrong is that when people who are drawing disability benefit are complained about by some of their neighbours who do not like them, even if it is an anonymous letter or a complaint made without any substance whatever, the first thing the Department do is to stop the payment.  Perhaps months afterwards it is discovered that the unfortunate person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not.  The Parliamentary Secretary would want to check on that because I am aware that it has happened recently.  The fact that there is a name on the letter does not mean that that person wrote the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently there is a <Col N="1128" /> loophole in the change to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred.  That should be corrected.  A person is entitled to live.  When one goes into a house to see a person who has been in receipt of disability benefit or unemployment benefit for a number of years, and who probably has a wife and family as well, and whose benefit has been stopped, one sees the utter misery of that family with no income whatever for a period of weeks and sometimes of months.  Eventually there is an apology and the payment is made.  The person who gets it is supposed to sing a song of praise.  They do not feel very much like singing.  Usually they owe all the money they get and, if the local authority have given them a couple of pounds to keep them going in the meantime, they have to pay that back. That is the way it goes.  These things should be cleared up by the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister and they should be dealt with fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>One of the things which came up in the House recently was the question of Christmas cards.  I do not believe that personal matters affecting Deputies should be raised here but, if we reach a stage where in one Department it is difficult to get any action because the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are busy and have important things to do, and it is admitted that the staff of that Department are engaged on sending out 17,000 Christmas cards, not to people who would be affected by the activities of the Department but to the constituents of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister I think this is a scandal.  The £600 paid for the cards is a relatively small amount compared with the amount of valuable time wasted which is paid for by the State. We all send out a certain number of cards.  We buy them and we post them. We write them ourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be certain exceptions.  A number of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries stated that they were not doing this and I give them full credit for it.  Nor would I complain if a limited number of Christmas cards, or any other type of <Col N="1129" /> greetings, were sent out by Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to business connections where that is the thing to do.  For a Member of this House to prepare and post at public expense 17,000 Christmas cards for the purpose of trying to gain an advantage over a Parliamentary colleague is wrong.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary pays for it himself I will be glad to get it and I will send him one. There have been various complaints here.  Some people have complained about the cost of postage.  I would not complain so much about the cost of postage, but I would complain about the way it was introduced.  It is wrong that the postal services should be told they must pay their way.  Costs have gone up in every other Department and they are not expected to pay their way. This is an attempt to cut down on the employment in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the same in relation to phone costs.  I do not know whether anyone else has had the same experience&mdash; there must be some reason for it; again, is it a shortage of staff&mdash;but the number of wrong numbers one gets at present, or the number of numbers where after dialling someone else comes in and says: &ldquo;Excuse me, you are on my line&rdquo; after one has been talking to somebody for two or three minutes, is ridiculous.  Whether we are talking to friends or enemies, or whether it is a <Col N="1130" /> business discussion or a private discussion, the phone service should be a private and confidential service.  If we want a party line we will ask for it.  I understand it would be a lot cheaper. We do not want a party line when we are dealing with confidential matters.</P>
    <P>Before the last general election I had the experience of dialling a number&mdash; perhaps I was wrong to do it but I could not resist the temptation for a minute or so&mdash;and listening to a member of a Fianna Fáil cumann arranging to nail another member who hoped to be a candidate in the general election.</P>

      <P>Recently telephone services have been breaking down.  A friend of mine in Balbriggan, which is only 20 miles from the city, tells me that they have been cut off from any telephone service except an intermittent one for the last three or four weeks.  I am sure the post office linesmen have also been doing everything they can to repair it, but it does not seem to be possible to fix it up.  He said, I suppose by way of a joke, that it was bad enough for the road between Balbriggan and Skerries to have fallen into the sea but in addition their telephone service was now cut off completely.  These are things the Minister might take an interest in. He would be much better employed at that than doing things such as acting as election agent for candidates who, like ourselves, do not always make the grade.</P>

      <P>The question of whether there has been a crisis in this country over the past six or 12 months has come up again and again.  It is common knowledge that the Taoiseach stated that, even if the courts discharged the two ex-Ministers, he felt that there was an illegal attempt to import arms.  He removed from office two senior Ministers, two capable Ministers, on that charge, the courts having cleared them.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach that, as far as that charge is concerned, he should either put up or shut up because what he has been doing is blackening those two people and saying: &ldquo;I know they were illegally importing arms&rdquo; and the court says they were not guilty of a conspiracy to illegally import arms.  It does appear from watching around the House here for the last couple of weeks that one of them seems to be making fairly good ground.  He was sailing against the wind for a good while and he did not seem to be making much headway&mdash;perhaps he said a few stupid things after the court case&mdash;but he is making headway now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be very interested to see the result of this inquiry which is being set up to investigate the £100,000 because, in my opinion, while that appears to be only a drop in the ocean of the money involved, at the same time it will be a pointer as to what actually happened.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach which does he want to do: does he want to find out what actually happened the £100,000, does he want to prove that there was no money misspent out of that £100,000; <Col N="1132" /> or does he want to nail ex-Minister Haughey who appears to be coming up the straight pretty fast behind him and who may, if he is not careful, be sitting on the seat in which the Taoiseach has been sitting for the last couple of years?</P>

      <P>The position as far as this inquiry is concerned is that it was suggested by Deputy Corish here&mdash;I am allowed to mention his name&mdash;<Col N="1133" /> that the Dáil should prepare and arrange for an inquiry by a special committee set up by this House.  The Taoiseach would not have that.  He said the Committee of Public Accounts is set up for this purpose.  It went before the Committee of Public Accounts and if my reading of the political situation is correct the report which that committee put in here yesterday evening means that they feel they are unable to deal with it and they want a special committee of the House constituted to deal with it with powers which the Committee of Public Accounts do not have.  The Taoiseach was asked whether he would introduce legislation for the purpose of allowing this to be done.  He was most apologetic this morning and said that after all he only got it last night and only had an opportunity of giving it to the Attorney General and was waiting for advice on it and it might take a long time.</P>
      <P>Why did it only come to the Taoiseach last night?  Because the committee was only set up a couple of days ago and it could have been set up much earlier if the Taoiseach so wanted.  It appears to be very nice timing, a nice political manoeuvre.  We all know that the Árd Fheis is coming along.  I wish I could find out what exactly the Taoiseach wants.  Does he want to clear Deputy Haughey so that he will be able to take over at the Ard Fheis or does he want to ensure that he will never again hold Ministerial rank?  I am not sure which it is, but it is one or the other.</P>
      <P>I had great admiration for both Deputy Haughey and Deputy Blaney in this House.  I felt they were very efficient as Ministers.  Outside I would not admire them so much because Deputy Blaney, particularly, has been preaching a particular type of Republicanism. Now we know what the Taoiseach considers to be Republicanism. We got that from the <i>Irish Independent</i> over the last couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>The question about this is not whether we want a Republic but whether we want to shed blood for it again.  Unlike some of the people who have been so noisy about Republicanism here, when this State wanted people to take arms in case the State had to be defended I was not afraid or ashamed to do so.  I hear people talking about Republicanism and about their desire to serve the State but they <Col N="1135" /> had not got that desire when they were needed.  Some of them who talk like this should look back a bit and see where they are lacking.  I am not now referring to the gossoons.</P>
      <P>The other part is that as far as the Labour Party are concerned we have always been in favour of a 32-county republic.  The leader of the revolution was James Connolly, the founder of our party.  It seems to be misunderstood by some people that this House, and the Seanad, under the signature of the President, are the people who will make decisions as to what should be done or what should not be done about the national boundaries.  If at any time&mdash; I want to repeat this&mdash;the Parliament of this State, the Oireachtas, decide that they are going to change their attitude towards the North of Ireland as to what they should do, then we will row in as we always did.  We will not come along and say &ldquo;No, you are not entitled to do that.  Even as a minority party we do not think you should do it&rdquo;.  The trouble with some people is that they want to have it both ways.  They want to be in Government and they want to have their salaries, as indeed did happen when the IRA raids were being carried on before and some people in very cushy jobs were sending gossoons out to carry out raids in the north but they were still in their own cushy jobs and were not interfered with.</P>
      <P>The same mentality seems to be operating among some of the people here.  They are great republicans provided they still have their jobs and can have it both ways.  Under the Exchange Control Bill which we discussed yesterday I was tempted to ask a question, but unfortunately forgot about it at the time.  It was when we were talking about how difficult it is to get large sums of money out of this country and convert it into the currency of another country where we are going to buy something.  How was it managed when they were buying the arms?  Somebody had no difficulty in doing that.  I hope that whatever committee is investigating this matter will do something about that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were accused in the newspapers <Col N="1136" /> and by a lot of people here, of rowdyism in this House over a protest last week.  I should like, Sir, to make this point which you are aware is correct. We had one speaker on his feet making a case and he was ruled out of order by the Chair.  He remained on his feet and the Chair was entitled then to have him named.  If it remained at that, each of these speakers on their own, there would have been no rowdyism in this House.  The rowdyism was caused by back benchers of Fianna Fáil who insisted on trying to shout and roar and hurl insults&mdash;they were the people who hurled the insults, not Deputy Paddy Burke or Deputy FitzGerald or myself, as was suggested&mdash;at the speaker or anybody else they could do it to.  It is important to remember that this House can be run without any rowdyism if the people who are so loud in their protests about obeying the Chair obey the Chair themselves.  It has been known in every parliament in the world for people to make protests and to be suspended for doing so and there is a procedure laid down in Standing Orders for doing this.  Any rowdyism caused here last week, I repeat, was caused by the rowdyism of the Fianna Fáil Members, including some of the Front Bench who could not keep their mouths shut but wanted to get in on the act to prove that they&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This protest brought to notice the fact that things were wrong, and we had the Taoiseach coming in afterwards and saying that he had not introduced the Offences Against the State Act.  This was the first positive statement he made.  Before that it was like the father who wanted to threaten the child and he cut a switch which he hung up and said: &ldquo;If you do that again it is there,&rdquo; and the result was that the child was afraid.  This is what the Taoiseach was trying and then he backed down.  He broke up the switch and threw it into the fire when the protest was made.  There is a statement <Col N="1137" /> in the second Budget which I should like to have clarified.  When that Budget was introduced a certain amount of extra taxation was imposed and since then a further amount of money has been required, £3 million, to help CIE.  I am not objecting to that but I would like the Taoiseach to tell us where the extra money will be coming from.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget speech said there was a saving of £7 million but where is that saving?  We have not yet been told.  I should like to know and I should like to know on what he proposes to cut back for the purpose of saving that £7 million.  I should like to conclude by saying that Fianna Fáil should remember&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Do not tempt me.  Fianna Fáil should remember that they have not a monopoly of patriotism and that on every side of the House you have people who are as good patriots as any people on the Fianna Fáil benches, and in many cases a lot better.  The only difference between the Fianna Fáil Party and members of the Labour Party, and I am sure of Fine Gael, is that we are prepared to admit that there are patriots in the country but we do not believe that burning or bank raiding or, if it goes to that, assault or murder, is showing patriotism.  Fianna Fáil may say that they do not believe in that either but can they say that all of their members do not believe that some of these things can be done with impunity and a blind eye turned to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After some of these things had happened you would be amazed at where you would see them and you would be amazed at the comments.  The man who by his action, either by burning hay, burning a house or blowing up some monument, does anything which will result in a charge being put on the rates of his fellow citizens is no patriot. The way to deal with him is to put him behind bars.  If he does not learn his lesson outside he should be put where the lesson will be taught.  The State should take over compensation for this type of thing because at present the insurance <Col N="1138" /> companies will take your premiums but when it comes to making a claim they will back out.  I also think that where people can be identified as having caused malicious damage it is not sufficient to bring them to court and fine them a couple of pounds or send them to jail for a couple of weeks; they should be made pay, even if it takes several years for them to do so.  Why should decent people be asked to pay compensation for the blackguards and that is all they are?  The sooner the State take a firm hand and decide that they will not allow this sort of thing to continue the better.  The State have responsibility to the citizens to protect them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice was not prepared to agree with me last week when I said, and I think my figures are correct, that in the last decade the number of gardaí has been reduced by 1,000, that there are 1,000 fewer gardaí now than there were a decade ago.  I got the figures some time ago and I hope to get the figures again in the new year to prove that what I am saying is correct.  At present they are overworked. They were promised a reduced working week and they were promised a whole lot of concessions, extra holidays for the time they worked and so on.  They have not been able to get that, not because they are employed full time trying to keep down the lawlessness which has occurred throughout the city and the country, but because they are at the behest of the banking organisations.  They stand outside banks for hours, protecting the property of those banks.  If anything happens to the bank the person who has lodged his money must get his money back.  I believe the banks do need control, but they should ask the State to provide armed military to guard the banks, who would be able to deal with the fellow who comes along with a gun.  The unfortunate gardaí with a baton tied to his hip can do very little against four or more fellows who come down with a sawn off gun to raid the bank.  If the banks want protection they should pay for it.  The gardaí would then be brought up to full strength and able to do the job for which they were trained and for which they are required.  If this were <Col N="1139" /> done we would have less of the petty lawlessness which we have, particularly in this city, and in many other places throughout the country.</P>
    <P>One thing which seems to be laughed at is the question of stealing of cars; it is called the taking of cars.  How many cars are taken in this city every night? Is it not a sad reflection on the way the State is operating here that an advertisement in a column in the evening newspapers has recovered more cars over the past couple of weeks than all the efforts of the law?  This is something which must be dealt with by the State.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to stand up here and give us one of his usual &ldquo;softly, softly &rdquo; speeches, saying nothing and taking not too long to say it.  It is not good enough for the head of a State who has been involved in so much trouble over the past 12 months and who appears to be heading into another period of serious trouble, and who has got numerous Votes of Confidence in this House, to think that the Members of this House are not entitled to be told what is happening and that any important announcement is made, as the former Deputy Dillon used to say, at a dinner or a dog fight of Fianna Fáil rather than in this House.</P>

      <P>Our balance of payments have improved somewhat over the last 12 months, but there is still a long way to go.  We must not become <Col N="1140" /> complacent, especially in. view of our anticipated entry into the EEC.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has said, this year has been a fair year with the usual ups and downs.  Over the last two years we have had many inquiries from firms about whether they can set up factories in rural areas.  The trend is to move out of big cities because firms have found with traffic congestion and so on they cannot carry on business in the heart of a city.</P>
      <P>The Opposition keep saying that Fianna Fáil have failed to solve the unemployment problem and the emigration problem.  When Fianna Fáil took over from the coalition Government in 1957 they made certain promises.  It is only right and proper that the progress which has taken place over the last 13 years be recorded.  In 1957, as everyone knows, there were approximately 100,000 people unemployed and emigration was running at the rate of 60,000 a year.  There are approximately 60,000 people on the unemployment list in 1970 and emigration is running at the rate of approximately 15,000 a year.  The population has increased by at least 100,000.  This is something about which the Government can be proud.  It is not enough; we know it is not enough.  But the Government will see to it that the position will improve further as time goes on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully dealt at length with this.  Everyone seems to doubt the facts, but the Taoiseach stated that the housing programme continued satisfactorily in 1970 despite the cement strike.  The Taoiseach stated that up to 14,000 houses will be built.  Everyone who travels around the country can see the large number of houses which have been built in the past decade.  It should be pointed out that the type of house being built has improved a great deal over the last ten years. The small house and the bothán are at last disappearing.  The Minister for Local Government is doing his best to help people to build their own homes.  This is the proper way to alleviate the housing problem.  Individuals should be given more and more help to build their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the Prices <Col N="1141" /> and Incomes Bill.  The Bill was brought in because unions and employers failed to reach agreement.  This party have always believed that wage agreements should be settled by free negotiation and free bargaining.  Despite complaints that a great deal of horse trading goes on, it is much better to have that than to have Bills here which make things mandatory.  Since the Bill was first introduced the two sides have met again and from what we hear they are making good progress in coming to a final settlement.  They have discussed their problems with the Taoiseach and the Ministers responsible and that is the way it should be.  I do not think we should dwell too much on the fact that this did not happen earlier.  As deliberations are near conclusion, we should wish both sides the very best.</P>
    <P>I hope unions will become much stronger in this country.  We have often seen unions making agreements and then finding it very difficult to get acceptance of that agreement from a minority of their members.  If the unions are to survive they will have to become stronger.  As negotiating discussions are at a delicate stage I do not think it would be proper to discuss the matter further at the present time.</P>
    <P>The year 1970 was a fair year for the agricultural industry.  It should be noted that cattle prices have never been higher.  In the years in which cattle prices were a bit depressed, the Opposition parties continually taunted us and told us it was the Fianna Fáil Government who were responsible for the poor prices and for the suggestion that farmers could not sell their cattle at a fair price.  Now, when prices are very good&mdash;even a suckling calf is making good money&mdash;no one on the Opposition benches lays the responsibility for this happy state of affairs at the door of Fianna Fáil.  The fact is that the farmers are now getting a fair return for their cattle.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months the Government have provided more money for the subsidisation of milk production. Very often the subsidy does not go back to the producer.  However, that is a problem it is very difficult to solve without giving more subsidy.  We shall be discussing this in greater detail <Col N="1142" /> when the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is before the House.</P>
    <P>We should always, when talking about agriculture at the close of the year, give thanks that our country has been preserved from all sorts of diseases.  So long as we can keep our cattle free from disease so long shall we have access to world markets.  The Department should ensure at all times through the medium of stringent regulations that disease is prevented from entering the country.  If it did enter it would be a calamity because we would lose our world markets, especially the market in the United States, and it would take years to recover them.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of debate on the Taoiseach's announcement that it might become necessary to re-introduce Part II of the Offences Against the State Act if certain people do not desist from carrying out certain threats.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure the smooth working of the democratic system and if any group, no matter how small, are out to upset that system, then it is up to the Government to safeguard the interests of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested that the banks could be guarded by armed soldiers.  We have always believed in an unarmed police force and we should try, I think, to hold on to that system. If the Taoiseach and his Government have certain information that certain people will carry out threats&mdash;be it shooting, looting or kidnapping&mdash;then it is, as I say, the duty of the Government to ensure by every means at their disposal that these threats are not carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully tried to suggest that this Act would be used to intern workers if they went on strike against certain legislation.  That, of course, is utter fantasy.  I can understand how the minds of the Labour Party are working at the moment; they are sore because the workers are not supporting them.  The great majority of the workers support Fianna Fáil and the present Government and the workers can rest assured that, so long as Fianna Fáil remain in power, that eventuality will not occur.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> Deputy Cosgrave appeared to be very perturbed by the shootings, raids and so on.  I do not want to be personal about a gentleman with whom I am very friendly, but a member of his parliamentary party not so long ago went on a bit of a shooting escapade. Deputy Cosgrave should tell us what he intends to do about him.  It is no harm to mention this matter.</P>
    <P>Last week we had the position here that the Dáil could not conduct normal parliamentary business.  It will be a very sad day when Parliament fails to function.  It is no good Opposition speakers coming in now and saying it was Fianna Fáil back benchers who caused all the upset&mdash;that they were responsible because Parliament did not function as it should.  Parliament was not allowed to function because Labour Party Deputies would not obey the Chair.  That seems to be becoming very fashionable at the moment.  I think it is a disgrace.  I cannot understand how any leader of a party which behaved as a certain party behaved here last week could ask the electorate to give him responsibility for forming a government considering that he himself will not subscribe to normal parliamentary practice and procedure.  Members of the Labour Party were suspended and the business of the House could not be conducted in a proper manner. If these people got their way everybody would be supposed to bow down before them and we would have minority rule.  The fault for what happened last week can be clearly laid on the Labour Party.  When the first motion to suspend Deputy Corish was moved nine members of the Fine Gael Party voted that he be not suspended. That was a little strange.  They did not vote on the second motion.  Their leader says he believes in law and order but he has not made any statement about these nine members and the way they voted.  I think he should because he cannot go out and tell the country he believes in law and order when nine of his own party vote that the Chair's ruling be not carried out.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about legislation not being enacted. How can legislation be enacted when Members take five or six hours to make <Col N="1144" /> speeches.  They seem to suffer from verbal diarrhoea and cannot stop once they start.  The leader of the party should have his say.  So should the shadow Minister, but it is beyond the bounds of reasonableness to have two or three members of the same party each taking five or six hours to say what they want to say.  It is impossible to get on with business in such conditions. Most of what they say is repetition. If business is not being done the fault can be laid at their door.  Look at the records and calculate the hours.  I do not want to curtail any speaker's right to speak, but there will have to be a responsible approach if we are to get on with legislation.</P>
    <P>The people returned Fianna Fáil at the last election.  At that stage the Labour Party announced they would &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;.  Since the election there has been some new thinking and we are now faced with the prospect of a coalition once again between Fine Gael and Labour.  Will they come out and tell the electorate before the election the terms of the coalition?  The Labour Party stated in Cork last Sunday that they would wait first and see how the people voted and then do what they liked.</P>

Will they tell them to use proportional representation and, after voting for the Labour Party, which candidates they will vote for next?  The same applies to Fine Gael.  They will have to say whether they want Labour. Both parties will have to make up their minds on their attitude to the EEC and to the nationalisation of our big firms and industries.  It is well known that <Col N="1145" /> Fine Gael are the conservative party in this country and are great believers in private enterprise while, on the other hand, there are members of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who state that the big concerns in this country should be nationalised.  Surely you will not ask people to vote for a coalition government without first settling these matters? It is really up to Fine Gael and Labour now.</P>
      <P>The two by-elections within the past month have shown that the people still staunchly support the Government. Their verdict is a fitting reply to the shouting and the taunting from the Opposition benches since last May about what the people would do to Fianna Fáil when they got a chance to express themselves through the ballot box.  There was a huge increase in the Fianna Fáil vote in the Donegal-Leitrim constituency and it is obvious that if there was a general election in the morning Fianna Fáil would get back their seat in the South County Dublin constituency.  The people have shown in no uncertain fashion that in a general election they would return Fianna Fáil to power.</P>
      <P>At the last election the Labour Party said that Fianna Fáil were depriving people of their rights.  Labour Party speakers were urging that there should be an equal division of wealth and said that Fianna Fáil were making the rich richer and the poor poorer.  Fianna Fáil believe in equal opportunity to acquire wealth.  Let me compare the Labour Party attitude on the equal division of wealth to a class of nine or ten children: the lazy scholar who would not bother to learn would get the same marks as the most brilliant child in the class.  Fianna Fáil believe in equal opportunity for every person to advance himself or herself as far as they can.  That is why Fianna Fáil have been returned to office time after time after time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not detain the House because I believe that as many speakers as possible should be given the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on showing <Col N="1146" /> that he is a strong Taoiseach.  He is as good a Taoiseach as this country has ever had.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It might be a sorer point in Tipperary than it is in Cork.  Deputy Meaney has challenged the Fine Gael Party to state clearly before the next election their attitude to coalition.  If Deputy Meaney can influence his Leader to give the people an opportunity soon of voting in a general election, we shall state our attitude well in advance.  He also asserted that nine Fine Gael Deputies voted last week in favour of uproar and unruly behaviour in this House on the subject of the threatened implementation of Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act.  Fine Gael decided on a free vote and, in a democratic way, nine Fine Gael Deputies availed of the opportunity to voice a protest.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the duration of this debate is limited because it covers the wide spectrum of Government activities during the past year.  Two days does not give ample opportunity to every Deputy who wishes to contribute to the debate in detail.</P>
      <P>The best way one might describe this Government is that it is one which is inclined to talk big and to act weak: what is introduced one day is dropped the next day.  The Taoiseach's explanation of his threat to implement Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act is just a bit of a joke.  I am not satisfied with that explanation.  This is there as a threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about agriculture and about the great disregard exhibited by successive Fianna Fáil Governments <Col N="1147" /> towards this vitally important industry.  I am glad to note that we have made some progress in industrial development especially as it provides job opportunities for some of those leaving the land and who can no longer be accommodated in agriculture. I am very concerned about the manner in which our farming community have been treated over a long number of years.  I have some questions on the Order Paper today on the subject of farm prices and farm incomes.  There has been a gradually increasing deterioration there in recent years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney mentioned that the price of cattle had risen to an all-time record.  This is quite so.  Were it not that cattle made a good price steadily in the past 12 months our farmers would be in a worse position today than at any period during the economic war here in the thirties.  Were it not for the price of cattle, our farmers today would have an appallingly low income in relation to the cost of living.  I am concerned particularly about the plight of our dairy farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps the fact that Deputy Meaney was given permission to discuss the price of cattle might be taken by the Deputy as a precedent but, as I would see it, this question and the observations would be more relevant to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that we should appear to be taking issue on this, but the fact that Deputy Meaney spoke for a total of 22 minutes would suggest that he could not have dwelt very long on any subject. I heard him for a time during which he did not make any reference to farming.  A passing reference to dairy farming and the price of cattle might be relevant but I cannot see the relevance <Col N="1148" /> of dairy farming and the price of stock on the Taoiseach's Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an Adjournment debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate. However, I shall deal briefly with the matter and confine myself to a passing reference.  That does not mean that I shall be pushed off this topic.  I do not intend that to happen.  I am concerned with the income of the farming community at present.  Both the ICMSA and the NFA have again decided, in order to attract Government attention to the plight of the farming community, to take strike action.  That is what I am most concerned with.  We all remember a time when the farming community some few years ago decided to march to this city.  No matter what we say about the farming community they are a law-abiding section.  I want somebody from the Government benches to enlighten me about this: on the previous occasion when the farmers demonstrated outside the gates of this House, and marched in front of the gates carrying placards, the black marias arrived and the farmers were arrested.  Could somebody on the Government benches tell us why no action whatever was taken by the Government since that time when there were protest marches outside those gates and people with placards demonstrating.</P>
      <P>Do the Government regard the farmers as second class citizens who will accept anything from the Government? I should like the Government side of the House to explain this position.  Will the Taoiseach say if there is one law for one section and another for a different section?  We have reached the stage in this country where, thank God, the farmers are better organised and will not accept in the future what they have suffered in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Meaney said it was the Government's duty to protect the Irish people and property.  I agree fully with the Deputy that this is the function of the Government and the job they undertook when they were given a mandate to govern 12 months ago last June but they have completely fallen down on this.  We are most concerned <Col N="1149" /> at the manner in which law and order are breaking down at present.  All over the country and in the south particularly the incidence of crime is rising, with armed mobs and thugs roaming the country carrying out bank robberies and other armed robberies and assaults.  People are living in a state of terror.  Take just one aspect of crime, the stolen car.  In the south, particularly, I notice that every day of the week you have six and 12 cars stolen to do particular jobs, robberies or something of that nature.  The cars are found but I have never seen the culprits found or anybody brought to court as a result.  This is what is so frightening.  I want to lay the blame particularly on the Government because I am convinced that there is too much interference with the gardaí in the carrying out of their normal duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact: there is too much interference with them.  I should like to pay particular tribute to the Garda but I am concerned about interference with them in carrying out their duties.  For this reason some members of the force do not know whether it is better to apprehend culprits and bring them to court or to leave them.  This is responsible for the breakdown of law and order.  I know of a case quite near me where the secretary of a Fianna Fáil cumann had the cheek when reprimanded by a garda to say that if he took action he would find himself transferred to some bog station.  While this is happening and while you have interference with the gardaí they will not be able to do their duty.  If they were allowed to do their duty they would be able to apprehend culprits and bring them to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to another alarming situation which seems to be another Government policy of recent origin, the closing of rural Garda barracks. This is happening against a background of the increasing incidence of all kinds of crime including crime which, five or six years ago, was alien to this country.  This is the most frightening aspect of it.  Crime now is of a well-organised type and yet you <Col N="1150" /> have rural Garda stations being closed down.  Listening to the Minister for Justice when my colleague Deputy Barry had a question to him on the Adjournment recently, one would think that this was being done to give a more efficient service to the people. That is a joke; the Minister cannot be sincere or honest when he says this is intended to give a more efficient service because if there is a garda in a village or at a crossroads he is a deterrent and gives a certain amount of security to people in the area just by being there.</P>
    <P>I know the case mentioned by my colleague although the debate will not allow me to go into detail about it and I know that in this area after 5 o'clock in the evening you cannot contact a member of the Garda: they are about 20 miles away.  This is not good enough.  The Minister for Justice himself will be protected and the people in this day and age expect more from him. He should reconsider his attitude towards the closing of rural Garda barracks and should strengthen the force instead in those areas.  This is the only way in which criminals can be deterred and, if crime is committed, in which it can be detected.  I share the alarm and concern of many at the high level of undetected very serious crime at present. I am not talking of armed robberies in Dublin or bank raids or the loss of life that has occurred but I am talking of a lesser type of crime that is increasing.  You have people roaming the country late at night carrying out these crimes in a highly skilled fashion. That is what I am concerned with.  If the Minister for Justice is serious about this he will discontinue his policy of closing the small rural Garda stations.  I want to confine myself to the rules of debate and I do not want to clash with the Chair.  However, I want very briefly to refer to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and to the Minister in charge of that Department.  The Minister introduced his Estimate recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that this Estimate has already been introduced and there will be ample opportunity to speak on that subject in detail.  Since <Col N="1151" /> Deputies may be anxious to speak on matters more strictly relevant to the present debate, I would ask the Deputy to be as brief as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <P>I will be very brief.  We are about to enter the EEC and, as far as agriculture is concerned, that is a major step.  I believe the Government have not done enough to prepare our farmers for entry into the EEC.  We have very hard-working farmers and, once we enter the EEC, I believe there will be a rich harvest for them.  However, I am concerned that members of the Government have gone out of their way to criticise people who have spoken against our entry into the EEC. There is no effort made on the part of the Government to enlighten the Irish people with regard to what is involved in membership of the Common Market.  The news media would be better employed in giving at various times some form of information which would enlighten the people who are against our entry into the EEC.</P>
      <P>My party believe we have no alternative but to go into the EEC once Britain go in.  I am convinced this is what we have to do.  However, in fairness to the people who have criticised our entry, and who are trying to get more information with regard to the attitude of the Government, I believe the only people who took a constructive step to enlighten our farmers was Macra na Feirme when they invited Dr. Mansholt to come to Tralee to speak to the farmers' organisations.  I had the pleasure of attending this talk and I was very impressed by him.  The people who thought that Dr. Mansholt was the type of man who devoured small farmers found out that he was a very Christian man and a very humane person.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should arrange for more talks like this so that the people who because of lack of information are so critical of our entry into the EEC will change their view.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly now to the crisis.</P>

      <P>The crisis within the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Government have been in a crisis since last May. The Parliamentary Secretary must be very naive if he considers there is no crisis.  The Taoiseach at the start of this crisis, on the subject of the resignation of Deputy Ó Moráin, when asked by Deputy Cosgrave if this was the tip of the iceberg or if we could expect further resignations, said he had not a clue as to what the Deputy was talking about.  I believe the Taoiseach has been dishonest in all this since last May.  I believe the only thing for this country is for the Taoiseach to dissolve the Dáil.  He should go to the country and give the people an opportunity of expressing their opinion in the ballot boxes.  I can assure the Taoiseach that, if they get that opportunity, we will have a change of Government.</P>

      <P>It is true I came back into the House recently but I was here from the beginning of proceedings this morning and I listened to all of the Taoiseach's speech.  I listened to it initially with a certain sense of outrage and anger that many of the things I felt should have been referred to at the end of an important session were being skated over and then with some sense of amusement at the enormity of his pushing under the carpet the real situation.  It then started an echo in my memory which I was finally able to place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> I wonder if the House recalls what the Taoiseach's speech reminded me of?  It was a comic song, a duet between Frankie Howerd and Joyce Grenfell. Frankie Howerd was the butler and Joyce Grenfell was my Lady Montmorency. As the song went on, Lady Montmorency was away on holiday and rang up the butler to find how things were going on.  The butler reassured her all the time that everything was absolutely fine.  In the course of the song it turned out that every conceivable evil had befallen the Montmorency home during my Lady Montmorency's absence, including the fact that it was burned down.  The butler kept suavely reassuring her all the time that everything was magnificent and in particular that the peaches were absolutely splendid.  As I heard the Taoiseach rolling blandly on through his anodyne speech I was reminded inescapably of Lady Montmorency's butler assuring her over the telephone that everything was absolutely splendid, even though the house had burned down, and that in fact the peaches were absolutely magnificent.</P>
    <P>The divergence between the real situation of Ireland and the summing up of it as delivered by the Taoiseach was so enormous as not even to be irritating any more.  It was just ridiculous and in the end was downright funny.  However, let us make a few remarks about what he said before going on to offer the House some thoughts on the three major events of this Dáil Session.  The Taoiseach addressed himself first to the state of the economy.  He discussed output in Ireland, as is conventionally done from the Government benches, as if Ireland existed in a vacuum.  In fact, under Fianna Fáil the economy has become more and more open with every passing year, and more and more defenceless against every change in the general economic climate of the western world.  It is true that we have had growth in the past decade, with a very remarkable and striking parallel, if anyone cares to look at it, with the growth of the western world, at a slightly lower level, but parallel.  When there was a general downturn we quickly had a downturn.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the level of <Col N="1154" /> economic growth in Ireland had anything to do with the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party when it so strikingly paralleled, at a slightly lower level, the growth rate of many western countries &mdash;and, in any case, when all of the first initiatives emanated from the Civil Service and not from the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;is surely a deception of the people.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the rate of economic growth and saying that the vaunted economic interventions of the Fianna Fáil Government, which are supposed to impress us, have in fact produced growths parallel to the growths of most west European countries, but at a lower level.  That is the point.  As an undeveloped country we need special interventions to guarantee at least a comparable level, and preferably a higher level.  The complacent claiming of the little growth we have seen, when we were towed along behind <Col N="1155" /> a west European boom, as being due to the brilliant economic interventions of the Government, who are noticeably short of any economic ideas, is misleading the people.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the balance of payments.  He pointed out that revenue from tourism was less healthy for a variety of reasons, economic and political.  It is a very short period since I can remember the Minister for Transport and Power on the front benches of the Fianna Fáil Party vigorously repudiating any suggestion that Irish tourism this year was not at least up to the standard of previous years.  I was particularly struck by the Taoiseach's phrase that in regard to tourism earnings he did not propose to hold a post-mortem at this stage.  That is an interesting word because in general a post-mortem occurs after death. I wonder which death the Taoiseach had in mind in this context?  We could speculate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn now to the Taoiseach's economic review.  He dealt with the matter of prices and said &mdash;I hope I am quoting him accurately: I wrote it down as he said it&mdash;that he had earlier told the House that inflation was the most important economic problem facing the country.  In fact, the exact opposite is the truth.  The diametrically opposite to that statement is the truth.  In the absence of Deputy Haughey, then Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach introduced the Budget in this House and he was assailed from the Fine Gael benches and from these benches on the grounds that the Budget was inflationary, and that the threat facing the Irish economy was an inflationary threat with which the Budget totally failed to deal.</P>
      <P>This was the substance of the charge made unanimously against the Taoiseach's Budget, the Budget of a Government of which he is the Taoiseach and which he himself introduced.  He read the speech in this House at the end of April.  Now, with this characteristic double-think, this characteristic bending of words to mean anything that their utterer wants them to mean, so that we end up by totally disbelieving anything that is said from the Fianna Fáil benches, we are blandly told that inflation is the most important economic problem facing the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was told so <i>ad <Col N="1157" /> nauseam</i> all through the first three-quarters of this year.  He sat on his hands and the Government sat on their hands.  In fact, when they introduced any economic measures they were such as to increase inflation.  The Opposition were unanimous and all of the experts were unanimous.  Everyone told him there was an inflationary crisis.  Far from doing anything about it, he introduced a Budget which made it worse by increasing the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is hypocrisy now to say blandly: &ldquo;Earlier I told the House that inflation was the most important economic problem facing this House.&rdquo; We told him.  He did not believe it and he would not act on it.  When the crisis got worse and worse, month after month, we went on telling him and then he took a panic decision designed to disrupt the whole structure of the ordinary trade union negotiation.  This history of gross economic mismanagement in the face of advice from every possible source is now dishonestly, in my view, presented to us as a previous warning to the House of the dangers of inflation.  The exact opposite to what the Taoiseach says is the truth.</P>
    <P>He also said that their preference is to see a voluntary agreement between the employers' side and the trade unions' side.  When this was being negotiated with considerable hope of success, the rug was pulled out and the statutory obligation of the right to free collective bargaining was introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  The talks had broken down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can say that lightly but I can assure him that if he reads the facts he will see that that is not the case.  The settlement now about to emerge is the settlement that would have emerged two months ago anyway.  If he likes, the Deputy may say that is not true.  He can take either side he likes.  He can take the trade union congress side, or the employers' side, or the side of Professor Chubb who was the fall guy in the middle.  He can talk to any of them and he will find out that the net result of all this hooha will be the building of a profound distrust, the undermining <Col N="1158" /> of the authority of trade union leadership, and exactly the same settlement that would have emerged anyway.  He can familiarise himself with that from any side he likes to ask but it is far from the Government's preference being to seek an acceptable voluntary agreement at talks proceeding in a voluntary way.</P>
      <P>Then the Taoiseach in the next sentence&mdash;this double-think every inch of the way&mdash;pays tribute to the responsible and painstaking efforts of the unions and employers.  If they were not quite extraordinarily forbearing this ridiculous action of introducing a wage freeze which was then abolished, which was then suspended, would have undermined all trust in all possibility of voluntary negotiation.  This foolish action&mdash;panicky, ill-judged, ignorant and now misrepresented to us&mdash;was the worst possible thing to have done if we were seeking an acceptable voluntary wage restraint in what everyone agrees is a difficult situation.  We first got a total freeze, then it was a partial freeze, and now it is suspended but not withdrawn.  God knows what will happen next.  Perhaps it will be withdrawn completely or perhaps it will be kept as a club behind the Government's back on the basis: of course you may have voluntary negotiations but if you do not negotiate voluntarily we will beat you into submission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn now to something the Taoiseach said about the Six Counties.  The Official Reporters may have got a more precise version but, as I wrote it down, he said that he welcomed the period of relative calm in Northern Ireland and that he looked forward hopefully to a quickened pace of reforms in 1971.  These are aspirations we all echo, but let us look for a moment at what Fianna Fáil policy has done to Northern Ireland over the last half-year.</P>
      <P>When we had an arms conspiracy it confirmed everything that Paisley and Craig and people like that had ever uttered about the Dublin Government: that they could not be relied upon to tell the truth.  Every bigoted, militant Unionist, the very worst strand of the Unionist Party was strenthened, was put in the ascendancy, was given a validation of their most bigoted ratings; and the sector which is surely the hope for any sort of progress in Northern Ireland was ground away.  All those people with a Unionist background, whether Presbyterian, Church of Ireland, Methodist or whatever, all those who were moving into a central position, who were deserting the old hatred and the old extremism, found themselves exposed to attack by their own Paisleyites.  The centre, the bridge, the common humanity, the common Irishness, regardless of whichever strand one came from, was ground away.</P>
      <P>Now we have the other side of it. We have the statement from the Taoiseach of approval for Mr. Chichester Clark, as I can only read it from the things he said in New York this year and the willingness to introduce internment without trial.  This can only grind away all those sections of what are conveniently called the minority, the Catholics who were trying to move away from traditional hatreds, trying to build a bridge to another community, trying to look on people as fellow Irishmen regardless of ethnic background or religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actions of Fianna Fáil, playing two sides of the road as usual, have been lo drive both communities back <Col N="1160" /> 50 years in thought: the process of regression to the attitudes of the bitter past.  Far from helping in the killing of hatreds and animosities, they have stoked the fires of these things, both by the arms conspiracy and the subsequent secrecy on the one hand and by the introduction of internment without trial on the other.  Both these actions will have disastrous effects in the North of Ireland on the building of a unified community.  If we say&mdash;and I take it that everybody says it sincerely in the sense that I do not think anybody is lying in this House&mdash;that we all want unity, surely we also feel that that unity must come not just in geographical terms but in terms of the healing of hatreds and animosities? How then can we defend the actions of a Government all of whose activities this year have served to deepen those animosities?  When the Taoiseach can blandly say that he welcomes the period of relative calm and looks forward to a quickening pace of reforms in 1971, his welcome may be perfectly genuine for all I know; but the activities of himself and of his Government this year have contributed to making the problem more intractable than ever and have played into the hands of extremists on both sides.</P>
    <P>That is in the real outcome of this panicky, ill-judged, foolish, contradictory, secret and frequently hypocritical action, playing both sides of the road, doing two things at the same time, making soothing noises at one time and having a large part of the Government participating in a conspiracy on the other hand or, in the case of internment without trial, making soothing noises that it has not been introduced while in fact threatening to introduce it and thereby implying that the ordinary legal process is not adequate to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, again blandly, like Lady Montmorency's butler, made reference to the Vote of Confidence in his Government in the Dáil.  It is interesting to distinguish between realities and forms.  In a formal sense he got a Vote of Confidence but the reality was that he got it from people who had expressed very shortly beforehand their profound lack of confidence in him <Col N="1161" /> and who were only doing it to ensure their own political survival so that they could live to fight another day.</P>
    <P>That was the Vote of Confidence the Taoiseach got.  He may call it confidence if he wishes: words do not revolt when distorted meanings are put on them.  It was as far from confidence as it is possible to go.  It is a distortion of language.  It was a formal vote from people profoundly disgraced who gave him that Vote of Confidence with their feet when it was not in their hearts.  It had nothing to do with confidence.  It was just a degradation, not just for the Fianna Fáil Party but for the whole country, for all of us, because we all participate in that shame to which the Taoiseach is pleased to refer blandly as a Vote of Confidence.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 4th December, a day on which the Dáil would not be sitting, a statement was made that Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, by declaration could be reintroduced if the necessity for doing so arose.  Let me say that we have made strenuous efforts over many years&mdash;the late Seán Dunne made them most recently in the last Dáil&mdash;to have this Act removed from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>It was brought in in 1940 at the beginning of a war, and I believe that our party in fact voted against it even in those circumstances.  One might advance an argument in the circumstances of possible invasion, in the circumstances of our neutrality in a wartorn world, that this was justified; but there is no possible justification 30 years later for such an enactment.  We have opposed this strenuously and we will continue to do so regardless of whether threats are made to reintroduce this or that section.  The whole of such special wartime legislation&mdash; emergency legislation, to use the euphemism&mdash;is undemocratic and unacceptable so far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has talked in the most general possible way about what the danger was.  Indeed, we are accustomed now to hear these generalities, which mean nothing, from him.  We got them at the time of the original crisis debate in May; we got them at the time of the confidence debate in October and we have had them again in early December. <Col N="1162" /> We expect him now to stand up and utter words which mean nothing. Somebody once said that words were invented for the purpose of concealing one's thoughts.  No doubt that was said cynically, but it is profoundly true in the case of the Taoiseach.  He stands up and utters a certain number of words for a certain period but they totally conceal his thoughts, and of course it is their objective to do so.  We know nothing about what the threat is that would permit this extraordinary thing to happen in these times, the extraordinary thing being the internment of people without trial.  It is somehow not so bad if it has not yet been done.  We just have a threat.  We have Government by threat all the time.  It is the new style.  Everybody has a style and Government by threat is the Taoiseach's style.  It worked with his own party and it may have worked with the Prices and Incomes Bill.  He hopes it will work with internment without trial. Of course, nobody takes his promises or assurances on trust any more.</P>

      <P>We are, therefore, left to speculate why this should be done at this time and against whom it is aimed.  Before coming to that speculation I want to add my comment to those of others in regard to the whole Judiciary of this country.  We have a <Col N="1163" /> system of courts and judges; we have a police force and we have a number of special branches of one sort or another, and we have a number of sorts of secret police, perhaps in conflict, but plenty of them, and we are now asked to believe that all this mechanism, after 25 years of peace, is unable to deal with the activities of&mdash;if it is Saor Eire&mdash;the activities of some 30 people.  Probably half the number dealing with this are members of the Special Branch anyway.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this assurance that the ordinary processes&mdash;the police, the courts, and the judges&mdash;could not deal with these things.  If it is true it is a very remarkable commentary on all of these institutions.  It is a very remarkable commentary on the degradation that could have been wrought in a legal system by the method we have adopted for so long in making political appointments to the bench.  I deplore the method of making appointments; I deplore the invasion of the Judiciary by political considerations.  But rotten and all as it is as the system of appointment, I do not think our judges are that bad.  I do not think the judges or the Garda are incapable of dealing with the present threat, whatever it may be.  They are perfectly capable of doing so were they permitted to do so.  I think there is another reason.  We have seen in the court cases of September, in the attitude of the Taoiseach right from the eruption of the crisis&mdash;Deputy Andrews asked &ldquo;What crisis?&rdquo;&mdash;from the eruption of a non-crisis in May, the total unwillingness of the Taoiseach to reveal facts in his possession.  We have seen this continuously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beauty of Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, is that you can put people in jail without their getting into a court and without having the right to state their point of view and their defence.  In other words, by shutting them in you shut them up. One motive for the introduction of internment without trial is to get people behind bars and out of the way lest they might sing too loudly and embarrassingly if they were brought to court. That is a very good reason for not bringing people to court, because you <Col N="1164" /> are afraid of what would come out in the course of the proceedings.  If the Taoiseach repudiates this as a scandalous imputation on my part he has a perfectly simple cure and that is to tell the House and the country more than he is currently telling them.  He is bound to have thoughts like this being uttered if he pursues the course of unnecessary secrecy about everything, a course of contempt for Parliament such as that he is now pursuing.</P>
    <P>That leads me to refer briefly to this matter of contempt for Parliament.  The Taoiseach threatened the introduction of Part 2 of this Act simply by making a statement outside the House on a day on which the Dáil would not be sitting, a Friday.  To make an announcement of this importance is profoundly contemptuous and the effort to sweep it under the carpet and say &ldquo;Oh, well, you may debate it on the debate on the adjournment&rdquo; is also profoundly contemptuous of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are using a technique which has honourable traditions and honourable precedents.  The continuance of Parliament as a forum where ideas are expressed is vastly more important than the small print of parliamentary procedure at any particular moment.  Parliament is a national forum.  That has been its evolution and role in different western European countries for over a thousand years.  We shall defend that role and use it in that way even at the cost of breaking the formal rules.  We shall suffer these expulsions and the absence of our Members for the prescribed period because where there is a conflict between the proper use of Parliament and the rules of procedure of Parliament we put the proper use first.  We accept procedure as a mechanism for getting on with the business, but we do not elevate procedure to being more important than the fundamental national reason for which that procedure has been evolved.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of the role the Labour Party played in getting this matter discussed.  The Fianna Fáil Party should be ashamed of the misuse of Parliament involved in the threat to introduce this outside Parliament and the refusal of the right to debate it.  I am also very proud of the part we had <Col N="1165" /> in using the technique of protracted debate in order to hold up the Prices and Incomes Bill.  If the Prices and Incomes Bill is not now implemented we shall claim, as a result of our use of parliamentary tactics, with pride some part of this outcome.</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;some part&rdquo;. The three great issues of this session over which the Taoiseach skated extremely lightly were the question of the arms trial; the question of the Prices and Incomes Bill and the question of internment without trial, under a wartime Act of 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>In regard to the arms trial there is a vast amount which has not been brought to light but which will be pursued. There is the interesting case of a question asked by my colleague, Deputy O'Connell, on 18th November, 1970, when he asked the Minister for Finance under what Act of the Oireachtas the Minister for Finance was empowered to waive Customs regulations on the importation of goods.  He received an answer which indicated that the Revenue Commissioners were bound to obey instructions from the Minister for Finance.  That was not the question; the question was under what Act of the Oireachtas the Minister for Finance had the power to issue that instruction to the Revenue Commissioners. There was no answer to that question because no Minister, whatever the psychological identification of party and State which Fianna Fáil has now attained, and no party has the right to issue any instruction to any public servant which is not in accordance with the law of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal more to be pursued and a great deal more to be said about the arms trial.  We can only deplore the amount of secrecy and the failure of the Taoiseach in his promise to this House last May that the full facts would be brought to light because they have not been brought to light. We must also deplore the instances of misleading the House by the Taoiseach and other Ministers which took place during that debate and which have never been explained away or apologised <Col N="1166" /> for.  They still stand as acts of misleading this House by Ministers. Deputy FitzGerald has listed six and I am aware of at least one other.  In circumstances where ordinary parliamentary traditions prevailed any one of those seven would have been sufficient to cause the dismissal of the person perpetrating that piece of misleading information.  In circumstances where normal parliamentary traditions obtained the seven together would have inevitably involved the dismissal of the whole Government and a general election. We are not now in circumstances where ordinary parliamentary traditions prevail.  We are in circumstances where a whole party of people, selected over many years for their reliability, are acting as lobby fodder and rubber stamp whatever decisions are taken by a Cabinet, in which they have the sort of touching faith we have just heard reposed by one of its Deputies.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Prices and Incomes Bill we have this ludicrous on-again off-again situation.  The Minister for Finance put down his foot with a great show of determination and promptly started taking it up again.  At this moment we do not know how far up. We are awaiting the Taoiseach's decision on that, which may indicate that no action whatsoever will be taken and that the whole proceedings were completely unnecessary.  The only other effect they could have had would be to make the ordinary process of free negotiation more difficult.  This would undermine the normal communication channels of existing trade union structure and undermine any sort of trust.  To have done that in any circumstances is totally impermissible. We, as a party, are very proud of our opposition to it.  To have done it and then undone it is not only impermissible but ludicrous.  It is an example of the sort of confusion and vacillation which has characterised so much of the work of the Government.</P>
    <P>On the question of internment without trial we now have the ludicrous situation where, according to the Taoiseach, we welcome the relative period of calm in Northern Ireland and look forward to the quickened pace of reforms in Northern Ireland in 1971, <Col N="1167" /> yet we in the South are behind the North in regard to many basic civil liberties.  We like to point a finger at the Unionist Government and accuse them of gerrymandering.  We cannot do that when we have the spectacle of a Government majority with a minority of votes.  We are masters of gerrymander. This Dáil is a gerrymandered Dáil.  If there is not a parallel arrangement between votes and seats under PR there is gerrymandering.  Fianna Fáil have a majority of seats with a minority of votes as a result of a careful gerrymander of which the Fianna Fáil Party are proud.  How then can we reproach the North for gerrymandering? We have the spectacle all over the West of Ireland, where the identification of party and State is such that we cannot point a finger of scorn at Unionists who fiddle housing distribution and local government jobs.  We are masters of that all over the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the basic civil liberty and who gets put in jail we have opened the road for the Government of Northern Ireland, if they choose to follow it.  We are behind them in this respect; we are worse than they are in this respect.  We have had this Act on the Statute Book since 1940 and we are now threatened with internment without trial.  We are told this is not so because it has not actually happened yet.  It is just hanging over us.</P>
    <P>In this respect we are worse than Northern Ireland at this moment.  We are losing the right to point the finger at Stormont, and the Taoiseach and his Government, who are responsible, are losing the right to welcome in 1971 the possibility of improved conditions in that part of our country.  The Taoiseach should be more concerned with reforms in the Republic in 1971 because that is where his jurisdiction lies.  He might now devote his mind a little to that because the results of his actions and his statements have been to drive both communities back into their traditional positions, to increase animosity and destroy any prospect of any real unity of hearts and minds.  He talks about reforms in 1971.  That is the same hypocrisy.  It is the same double think. <Col N="1168" /> If he wants that why does he not pay attention to things down here, where he can control things, and make the situation better instead of worse, as he has been doing?  This is why I listened to the Taoiseach with incredulity, later with anger and, ultimately, recalling my Lady Montmorency's butler&mdash;though the house is burning down the peaches are magnificent&mdash;with rueful amusement. With every passing day the Taoiseach loses any little tatter of credibility that may have remained with him.</P>

      <P>Once more we have had to listen to this sort of cynical speech by Deputy Keating.  He seems to have set himself up as a judge of Fianna Fáil and of the country.  In the Donegal by-election support for the Deputy's party was cut by 50 per cent. At the same time the voters endorsed the policy of Fianna Fáil and of its leader.  Deputy Keating irresponsibly stated that the Taoiseach is no longer believed or trusted by anybody.  Will the Deputy believe 15,500 people who voted for the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil in the Donegal by-election? Labour polled 800 votes, half the number they got in the general election.</P>
      <P>We heard a great deal about the tremendous beating we would get in that election.  What happened?  We won Donegal hands down, an overwhelming victory and, in Dublin, we had a moral victory.  That is the fact whether Deputies opposite like it or not.  Fine Gael were only 1,000 votes ahead of us in No. 1 preferences.  With all the cockcrowing on the Opposition benches one would think Fine Gael had slated us. We showed the Opposition what we could do and we will show them again when the next general election comes, in our own time.</P>

The life of the Taoiseach has been threatened.  As everybody knows, there is a security guard on him and on senior Ministers.  If this kind of thing happened in certain other countries a state of emergency would be proclaimed immediately.  The Taoiseach does not want a security guard and neither do the Ministers, but they <Col N="1170" /> are forced to accept because of information received.  Some of this information came from London, some from Dublin and some from other parts of the country.</P>

The Fianna Fáil Party have not been informed as to the information received and neither has the Opposition.  The reason for secrecy is very obvious.  I doubt if any Deputy will question that.  Opposition Deputies may for the sake of political expediency. Fair enough, but no one would seriously suggest that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice should say who gave the information, what the information was and how well it was backed up.  Some Opposition Deputies said that the explanation had better be good.  This was stated by two members of the Fine Gael Party.  Who are they to say that it had better be good?  Who is the governing party?  Who is the party with a majority?  Who is the party who got a mandate from the people?  Fianna Fáil.</P>

I have since received the advice of the Attorney General, which is that it would be desirable to have the matter of privilege for the purpose of the Committee covered by legislation and that it might be possible to have the other matter, that is the compelling of witnesses, also covered.  I am awaiting a draft of legislation and, if it is approved, I shall undertake to have it circulated so that it will be available to the House first thing in the morning. The Government have not, of course, yet considered it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the expectation of the early introduction of the new service under the Health Act, 1970, most vacancies for district medical officer in recent years have not been filled on a permanent basis.  If the postponement of the introduction of a new form of service is likely to be of long duration, I should like to discuss these vacancies with the medical organisations. I would point out that where a vacancy is filled on a permanent basis through the Local Appointments Commission, an existing temporary holder of that office can be appointed only if successful in the competition held by the commissioners.</P>

In view of the fact that he stated in this House recently that <Col N="1186" /> there would be a probable postponement of the health services does he not consider that it is time for him to act and to give the medical officers a permanent appointment so that they may enjoy all the emoluments which go with such appointments?</P>

The Deputy also knows that permanent positions have not been filled because doctors were unwilling to take up the posts.  I am establishing a national advisory board on general practice to investigate this whole problem of general practitioners in this country, a problem which incidentally can be found elsewhere. I am not going to make any immediate decision in regard to filling those posts because so short a time has elapsed since the Medical Association and the Medical Union by an overwhelming majority refused to accept the choice of doctor arrangements we made.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The exclusive fishery waters of Belgium, Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands extend to three miles from the baseline.  Those of France and Italy extend to 12 miles from the baseline, with provision for the exercise of traditional fishing rights in the six to 12 mile zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolution of the Council of Ministers on 30th June, 1970, defined the broad principles of a common fisheries policy for the Community.  In the resolution, the Council adopted the principles of article 2 of the Commission's proposal for a European fisheries policy, which provided that the member states shall have equal conditions of access to fishery waters situated in maritime waters under their jurisdiction. A regulation adopted by the Council of Ministers on 20th October established a common policy for the structural aspects of fisheries.  This regulation gives effect to the proposals referred to in regard to equal conditions <Col N="1192" /> of access.  Under the regulation common access to fishery water within a three-mile zone seaward of baselines may be restricted in exceptional circumstances and in respect of certain types of fish to the local coastal population only.  This restriction would apply where the local coastal population is essentially dependent on coastal fishing and during a five year period from the coming into operation of the Community regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations which exist at the moment apply to the Community as it is formed at present.  As the Deputy will be aware, at every meeting since this regulation came into force, even though we had no right of consultation because we are not yet a member.  I brought forward the problem created for Ireland by this regulation. The Community have responded not only to us but to the other applicants by making arrangements for an examination of the regulations at expert level and by arranging for discussions when we are clearer on how the implementation of such policy would affect our countries in discussions with the Community.  We will then be in a negotiating position, negotiating into the European Community in the knowledge of this policy and trying to make arrangements to meet the really difficult situation created by this regulation for our fishermen.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy in relation to a Conference on European Security, as I already told the Dáil, is that we welcome all effective measures to reduce tension and promote security and co-operation in Europe.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is creating a real problem in looking for confidential information after every meeting I have.  I could not possibly run this office if I am to go on television with <Col N="1194" /> every detail of what happens.  The meeting the Deputy refers to was a meeting of The Six to inform the four applicants of decisions taken in Munich at a meeting of The Six.  This was information given by them to us in confidence. They asked, and we agreed, that no statements would be made by individual Ministers afterwards so as to make possible the exchange of information which takes place at such a meeting.</P>
      <P>The fact that I spoke at the meeting did not change the nature of the meeting. It was a meeting to inform applicants of what had gone on at the Munich meeting.  The fact that I spoke on this subject only means that I dealt with certain aspects of the European Security Council.  I dealt with them within the limits of the policy which I have announced in the Dáil.  Having agreed not to say what people said at the meeting, I do not feel free to say it now.  I will tell the Deputy that I said nothing at the meeting that is not part of Government policy, and Government policy on the European Security Council was given in the Dáil&mdash;in answer to a question by the Deputy, I think&mdash;and was given by me in other places.  If the Deputy wants a statement on that policy he can have it at any time.</P>

      <P>What I think about the Security Conference&mdash;if the Deputy looks up the record he will find that <Col N="1195" /> he got an answer to this before&mdash;is that it should be properly prepared.  There should be no prerequisites which would make it impossible to hold the meeting. There should be every chance of success because failure would be worse than not having tried.  As far as Ireland is concerned, we could not accept existing national boundaries.  The Deputy should remember all this.  In relation to the progress to be made I felt, and I feel now, that there should be much more progress in the bilateral arrangements being made in Europe by Western Germany.  They have already made agreements, political agreements, with Poland and with the USSR.  I feel that there should be much more progress in intra-German affairs and in a settlement of problems in Berlin before one could assume that a Security Conference would have any measure of success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority of State-sponsored bodies to dispose of land derives in each case from the particular legislation relating to each body. Generally, the legislation does not specify any particular procedure to be followed, except in the case of the disposal by Córas lompair Éireann of land on abandoned railway lines.  In that case, the Transport Acts provide that land may be sold by public auction to any person but that sale by private treaty may be made to certain specified categories such as tenants of the railway land, owners or tenants of adjoining lands, a local authority or public utility undertaking.  In the case of other bodies, the manner of disposal of land is a matter for the board of the particular <Col N="1199" /> body having regard to the circumstances of each case.</P>

      <P>There already is a special Christmas fare applicable to everyone.  It is applicable inwards from 18th to 24th December and valid for one month and it is a substantial reduction on the normal fare for the rest of the year.  The Deputy is asking me to isolate Irish people from that and give them a further reduced fare.  This is just &ldquo;not on&rdquo;.  There is already a reduction in fare compared to the normal fare and this applies to everybody coming in over the Christmas period.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power what proposals, if any, are before his Department for the development of Drogheda port, County Louth; and if they include the transfer of the wharves jetties, etc., to the right bank of the Boyne at Mornington, Drogheda, near the mouth of the river.</P>

      <P>I have received from the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners a copy of a long-term plan outlining the views of the commissioners as regards the future development of the port.  The plan envisages the construction of a new wharf and other developments at the mouth of the Boyne.  No application for a Harbour Works Order involving any specific development work has, however, been submitted to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what is the next step following that, or, if it is a long-term plan, does this mean it is just a notice of intention which may take ten or 12 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to keep us informed.  The commissioners have given us their ideas as to the lines of long-term future developments at the port.  At this stage it is not a specific proposal from them.  When they have their minds made up on a specific proposal they will then seek authority from me to make a Harbour Works Order.  It is in the initial stages at present, but I await a specific proposal from them and we can deal with that on its merits then if and when it is received.</P>

The survey being undertaken by the ESB, Dublin Port and Docks Board and the Dublin Corporation in Dublin Bay and the estuary is a two-year survey at a cost of about £16,000 which, when completed, will give full details of the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the water in the bay and estuary.

      <P>I am informed by the Dublin Port and Docks Board that the long-term development plans of the <Col N="1207" /> Dublin Bay area have been unavoidably held up due to illness of three of the senior personnel engaged on the plans and that because of this circumstance it is not possible to say now with any precision when the plans will become available.  As I indicated in reply to a previous question by the Deputy in the matter, the plan when available will be referred to the planning authority&mdash;Dublin Corporation&mdash; and when the views of the authority and of other interested parties are available they will be considered by me in consultation with the Minister for Local Government.  The matter will then be submitted to the Government for any necessary decisions in the context of local regional and national planning considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

As I said on an earlier occasion, the fullest publicity will be given to the proposals in order to enable the public and Deputies to express their views on the matter.</P>

Section 18 of that Act inserts the latter conditions in the Fourth Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, by the addition thereto of a new paragraph, number 9.  Eligibility for retirement pension may also be affected by the provisions of the Social Welfare (Retirement Pension and Invalidity Pension) (Transitional) Regulations, 1970 (Statutory Instrument No. 224 of 1970) which provide that contributions under the former National Health Insurance Acts may be taken into account in certain circumstances, and by the Social Welfare (Retirement Pension) Regulations, 1970 (Statutory Instrument No. 225 of 1970) which specify the periods which are regarded as periods of retirement for pension purposes and also provide for payment of reduced rates of pension where the contribution conditions are not satisfied in full.</P>

      <P>The figure mentioned by the Deputy was suggested in 1949 as additional assistance in the case of a single person in receipt of blind pension and the local authorities were informed that payment of higher rates would be approved on request.

The thing to remember is that while the cost of living has gone up by a certain percentage in the 11 years the Deputy is referring to, blind pensions have been increased by three times the rate of the increase in the cost of living.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister's answer because all the information is in the Minister's Department. Is the Minister aware in respect of this particular case that the relevant medical cerificates were sent on various dates in May from Clonakilty but apparently were lost in transit?  They were then asked to be re-issued.  When they were re-issued and sent, no action was taken on them until a reminder by trunk call.  It was then promised that the benefit would be sent and the benefit sent was for one week only. After ten weeks this widow secured one week's benefit in respect of the six weeks her husband was ill before he died.  Is the Minister further aware that in respect of her widow's pension she was told she had not applied when in fact she already had an acknowledgment from them?  It was not until someone went into the Department and forced them to look for it that they found it.  This widow is now left week after week, month after month, with no assistance, which she is entitled to, because of the incompetence of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>During the bank closure it was not possible to pay interest on those National Loans Which are managed by the Bank of Ireland. When banking services resumed I asked the Bank of Ireland to issue the warrants for the interest payments as quickly as possible in the order in which they became due.  Thus the payments which became due in the period May to September were to be issued before those falling due in October and November.  A notice was published in the Press on 22nd and 27th November, 1970, showing the latest dates by which the interest payments due on the various loans would be made.</P>
      <P>As set out in that notice, the payments due on 15th October, 1970, will be made on 16th December, 1970, those due on 15th November, 1970, will be made on 4th January, 1971, and all arrears of payments will be overtaken by 29th January, 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The life annuity scheme was launched at a Press conference held by the Minister for Lands on 31st January, 1967.  In conjunction with this a full statement on the scheme was circulated to all national and provincial newspapers.</P>
      <P>The scheme was featured in the Land Commission exhibits at the RDS Spring Shows in 1967 and 1968, at which publicity material was available.</P>
      <P>This publicity material&mdash;a specially prepared booklet and a leaflet&mdash;has, since then, been widely distributed to inquirers about the scheme.</P>
      <P>Details of the scheme are included in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries publication <i>Specially for the Farmer</i> and in the Department of Social Welfare's <i>Guide to the Social Services.</i> The National Farmers' Association have been kind enough to feature particulars in the current edition of their yearbook.  <i>Decade of Challenge.</i></P>
      <P>The scheme was the subject of two television programmes to the production of which the Land Commission contributed relevant material and information.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Land Commission inspectors are constantly on the lookout for cases suitable for participation in the scheme.</P>

      <Col N="1244" /> Given the nature of the publicity involved, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be extremely difficult to estimate the cost.</P>

The formulation of resale proposals has been deferred pending completion of proceedings for the acquisition of the Monaghan estate, possession of which is expected shortly. When the Monaghan estate has been acquired a composite scheme of division of all the lands, aggregating 134 acres, will be prepared.

Those houses have been deteriorating during the past four or five years.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that this is poor economics?  In view of this, very soon nobody will go into those houses.  What steps does he propose to take to have those vacant houses allocated to people who are entitled to them?</P>

      <P>The course of pedagogical training in the National College of Art for the art teachers' certificate is, and has been for a very considerable time, a one year's course. Eligibility for entry to the course is conditional on the attainment of first-class passes in specified subjects at examinations conducted by the Department of Education.  These examinations are taken by students during the course of their studies at the National College of Art or at the Schools of Art at Cork, Waterford and Limerick and at a number of technical schools.</P>
      <P>The induction course to which the Deputy refers is a general introductory course for all students attending the National College of Art irrespective of whether they propose to proceed to teaching or to the practice of the arts. This preliminary course was a two years course but in the 1969-70 session a new course covering one year was introduced at the instance of the College Advisory Council, on which teachers and students were represented.</P>

      <P>The accommodation position at each of these schools was reviewed at the beginning of the present school year in the light of actual enrolments.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Does the Parliamentary Secretary not realise that the Cavan Vocational School is completely overcrowded at <Col N="1259" /> the moment and that a number of rooms have had to be hired in the Poor Clare Convent which is right across the town?  Irrespective of the position of what the Parliamentary Secretary called the unauthorised classes, there is not room in the Cavan technical school for all the pupils at present enrolled there.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of that position? If I might anticipate the next question, how does the Parliamentary Secretary expect 50 pupils or students to be transferred from Belturbet and Virginia to a building that is already grossly overcrowded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might deal with the question itself, as the Deputy is already aware two mobile classrooms were approved in August last on the basis of the CEO's projected enrolment of 368 in Cavan Vocational School. This was later reduced by the CEO to 310 for 1970-71.  The actual enrolment turned out to be 283, due to circumstances of which I think the Deputy will be aware.  At that time it was felt that the accommodation was adequate. I can appreciate the Deputy's concern, but he might understand why it was that what was to be sanctioned was not sanctioned.  In any event the case will be reviewed in the near future to ascertain whether the accommodation will be adequate for the 1971-72 school year.</P>

It is because of the change in the circumstances in this whole area that this situation has arisen.  I appreciate that <Col N="1260" /> it is not possible to plan a building programme even of prefabricated classrooms in a changing and fluctuating situation where school enrolments appear to change for one reason or another.

Notwithstanding this, the committee went ahead and instructed the headmasters in Belturbet and Virginia to organise leaving certificate classes in those schools.  The committee were notified by letter of 16th July that they were liable to surcharge for any expenditure <Col N="1261" /> incurred in the provision of these courses which were unauthorised.  In reply to a request to me to receive a deputation, the committee were notified on 19th October that I had confirmed my Department's original rulings and that no useful purpose would be served by my receiving a deputation.</P>

      <P>The annual capitation grant paid to St. Anne's school, Kilmacud, in each of the past five years was as follows: 1965, £3,620; 1966, £3,930; 1967, £3,910; 1968, £4,510; 1969, £5,480.</P>
      <P>This school was last visited in May, 1970.  While inspectors' reports on all schools are of a confidential nature I can say that the report of the inspection in question was fully satisfactory.

      <P>Page 37.  It says:</P>
      <P>In the case of the girls' reformatory at St. Anne's, Kilmacud, which is also certified as an industrial school, payment is made on the notional number of 40, regardless of the number of girls actually detained there at a particular time.  We found, however, that St. Anne's were reluctant to accept girls who were known to practise prostitution or who, on conviction for an offence, were found to be pregnant.  On the occasion of one check of a number of girls in the school we found that only three girls on the roll were committed by the court as delinquents. It is obvious therefore that St. Anne's is not fulfilling the purpose for which it was originally founded. </P>
      <P>I may say that the management of the school&mdash;and possibly there may be room for discussion on this&mdash;are anxious to get girls at the early stages. Apparently the general practice of the courts up to this has been to give them the benefit of the Probation Act for the first and second occasion so that in many cases by the time they come to St. Anne's they may be somewhat more hardened than would be desirable. All who are interested will be pleased to know that consultations are under way.  Of course everybody will appreciate that the courts are independent in the discharge of their duties but consultations are under way as to how best the courts and St. Anne's can implement the interests of the girls committed to them.</P>

      <P>Diet charts which are kept in these schools are available for inspection in the schools.  Inspections which have been carried out have revealed that the scale of diet is satisfactory and is being adhered to. The very substantial increase in grants to these schools which was made in 1969 has enabled the schools to improve the scale of diet accordingly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will find in the reply to one of his later questions that these rules and regulations about which he has only recently become aware are very old.  In fact much of what they recommend is a minimum requirement and much of what is being provided at present is far in excess of these minimum requirements. I appreciate the Deputy's point but the practice now is that dietary charts are kept in the schools themselves.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 115 and 116 together.  The Deputy's questions derive from Rules and Regulations for Certified Industrial Schools which were framed many years ago and which in relation to the matters raised by him are no longer being operated.  For example, with the exception of four institutions, three of which cater solely for boys, all industrial school children go out to local schools for their education and there is now no industrial training for such children.  In the case of schools which cater for delinquents, the emphasis is on rehabilitation through education by means of a specially prepared curriculum. No industrial school now keeps a punishment book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one thing to say that the rules do not apply because the children go out to school&mdash;that may be a reason for the rule about the amount of literary instruction not being applicable any more&mdash;but I do not understand about the punishment book.  Is it suggested that no punishments are inflicted in industrial schools any more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so suggested. Apparently for one reason or another, which I cannot explain to the Deputy here, they are not and have not been kept for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think this is a very serious abuse?  These rules were laid down to protect the children in various ways.  Rule No. 12 was laid down to protect them from unsuitable or improper punishment.  It states that all serious misconduct and the punishments inflicted for it shall be entered in a book to be kept for that purpose which shall be laid before the inspector when he visits.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary explain to the House how his inspectors have failed to insist on this and how they have allowed this practice to fall into disuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy earlier, many of these roles are a carryover from the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> They relate to minimum standards which were in operation from Dickensian times.  I can assure the Deputy that at visitations and inspections the inspectors go into all aspects including the treatment and discipline of the children.  The keeping of a book, which I think the Deputy will accept might not always be infallible, has been disregarded for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope we could get away from this negative Dickensian approach.  I am not suggesting that it is the Deputy's approach.  If it seemed to be necessary and desirable in the interests of the children or to prevent more punishment, I am sure it could be reintroduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is negative about it?  The purpose of the book is to ensure that no punishment can be given which the inspector will not be aware of?</P>

      <P>It is one of the effects of the book.  We are concerned <Col N="1275" /> with human nature as well as statistics. I certainly have never heard of a punishment book and I do not think the Deputy had either until someone directed his attention to this.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply is not worthy of the Parliamentary Secretary. <Col N="1276" /> We are dealing with a serious matter here.  We want to know whether the inspectorial system has worked.  We have concrete evidence that in one instance it has not.  We are entitled to know how often these inspections take place.  It is not a major problem.  There are 29 schools.  How many inspectors are there altogether?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on the question.  There are 28 industrial schools and three reformatory schools.  The information which the Deputy seeks in relation to this question and all the other questions he has down today could keep one section of the Department going for quite a long period.

      <P>The managers contact and inform the inspectors about them.  I think the Deputy asked what proportion of the children discharged in 1968 and 1969 have, in fact, been contacted in person by managers since their discharge.  Unfortunately, pen and pencil records of each contact made, informal or otherwise, are not kept, and the Department are not notified on this basis, but they do, in fact, keep contact and we are satisfied to that extent.</P>

Once it is charged in relation to any child, be he 100 yards or half a mile outside the limit in any area.  Deputies know it would have to be charged for the whole country.

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that by charging the children just outside the three miles limit he is not mulcting the Department in any way?  In fact, he would be giving extra money to CIE, money they need, and at the same time he <Col N="1279" /> would be improving the position for both CIE and these unfortunate children.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The support price for feeding barley is one of the factors <Col N="1286" /> taken into account in fixing the guaranteed minimum prices for pigs.  The total cost of implementing the guaranteed minimum pig prices is, at present, over £3 million a year but it is not practicable to segregate the barley factor or estimate the cost per province.  The price for malting barley is determined in negotiations between growers and buyers and is not subsidised by the State.  No doubt it is reflected in the price for beer, stout and spirits.</P>
      <P>A direct State subsidy is paid to provide a floor price for oats in the western counties.  In 1969-70 a subsidy of £13,395 was paid to An Bord Gráin towards losses incurred by the board in disposing of oats purchased under this scheme.  It is not possible to apportion this subsidy on a provincial basis but the western counties comprise the province of Connacht, the three counties of Ulster and counties Clare, Kerry, Longford and Cork (West).</P>
      <P>As an exceptional measure the State provided a subsidy of £1,400,000 over the last two years towards losses incurred by An Bord Gráin in disposing as animal feed of surplus millable wheat of the 1968 crop.  Similar losses on subsequent wheat crops have been covered by wheat levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of subsidies paid for grain and milk in the five counties of Connacht is very little out of the Exchequer.  The south and the east benefit.  In view of all that has been said down the years&mdash;particularly from the Fine Gael benches&mdash; about saving the west would the Minister do something now to help, because the west is being depopulated at an enormous rate?  No fewer than 8,340 have left Mayo since 1961. Would the Minister give larger subsidies to the people of Mayo, in particular, <Col N="1287" /> and, indeed, in the five western counties of Connacht?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware I have announced price increases in the four major livestock commodities &mdash;cattle, sheep, pigs and creamery milk. This is the second round of support for all of them this year.  For next year's feeding barley crop growers will receive an increase of over 10 per cent in the floor price.  In consequence, the minimum prices for pigs will be further adjusted in the autumn of 1971.  In all, these measures will cost the Exchequer about £10 million in a full year, over £3 million of which will go to creamery milk suppliers.  The House will appreciate that the task of finding this extra sum by way of taxation is not going to be an easy one.  I might mention also that liquid milk producers have received two increases this year worth an additional £750,000 a year for them and that the beet acreage will be increased by 6,000 acres next season.  Farmers will also benefit from the higher guaranteed prices for cattle and sheep in Britain.</P>
      <P>I think I can claim with justification that these measures represent a sound basis for further sustained progress and that our farmers can plan their programmes for 1971 with confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the future, as in the past, farmers <Col N="1289" /> can count on the Government carrying out their declared policy on agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the multitier price system for milk, there is a farmer in Deputy Creed's constituency with 63 acres the price of whose milk has gone down since 1968 from 2s. 1d. to 1s. 8d. a gallon because he specialises in milk.  The price has fallen.  This is as a result of the policy which is in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, in the recent readjustment of the multitier price system, certain anomalies which I thought existed in the previous structure were corrected.  In particular, in the area between 20,000 and 30,000 gallons, the producer gets what would appear, on superficial examination, to be a disproportionate increase in the price of his milk compared with other areas of milk production.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> In regard to Question No. 133, the Second Programme targets published in 1964 were based on the assumption that EEC membership, with all its implications for markets and prices, would be achieved by 1970.  Even though this basic assumption did not materialise remarkable progress was achieved, although increases in output involved a higher use of inputs than had been originally anticipated.  The cattle target has almost been achieved. An output of 1.5 million head was set as the 1970 target and we now estimate an output of 1.45 million head of cattle this year.  For cows the programme envisaged a rapid expansion in the herd to about 1.7 million in 1968. The figure in 1968 was, in fact, 1.6 million and this year has reached 1.7 million.  Up to the early 1960s cow numbers remained static at about 1.25 million head.</P>
    <P>The output target for milk was 760 million gallons.  By 1969 an output of 671 million gallons had been reached, an increase of 150 million gallons on 1963.  Had price and market conditions been favourable, as they would have been had we gained EEC entry, there is little doubt that the targets set would have been reached.</P>
    <P>In the case of pigs the 1970 output target of two million pigs was, in fact, exceeded by 1969.  The main reason for the disappointing trend in sheep seems to have been the relatively greater attraction of other enterprises but with good prices and improved incentives now available there is reason to expect that the period of decline is coming to an end.</P>

This has been surpassed in the years 1968, 1969 <Col N="1293" /> and 1970.  A considerable increase in barley output to 600,000 tons was aimed at in the Second Programme and it now looks as if the output this year will not be far off this figure.  The target for sugar beet was 1.2 million tons. The output for 1970 is expected to reach the one million ton mark.  The target for the output of potatoes is 600,000 tons.  In 1969 the output of potatoes was 495,000 tons.</P>

There has been no increase to cover the increase in costs during 1970, also, in 1970 the bottlers of liquid milk for distribution got increases equivalent to 8d per gallon.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have this question under consideration at present.  Question No. 141 refers to the compensation paid for reactors under the brucellosis eradication scheme.  The existence of a maximum limit on reactor prices has been accepted since the start of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme in 1954.  Its purpose was to safeguard the Exchequer against excessive demands. The maximum is reviewed from time to time and is set well above the highest price that could usually be expected on the open market.  In practice the market values as agreed to with the herd owners of reactor cattle taken up under the bovine tuberculosis scheme and the brucellosis scheme are well below the current maxima and are not affected by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not normal procedure to pay value for something you buy?  Why is it necessary to have an upper limit in this case?  In most cases where a Government Department is buying something it does not have an upper limit written into regulations as <Col N="1295" /> to what it might pay.  It pays value: whatever an independent assessor decides. Is it true that the Minister has not confidence in his own inspectors to value these animals properly and has to put some sort of rein on them because he is afraid they might not do their job properly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little substance in Deputy Bruton's declaration. It must be obvious that in the determination of the value of a reactor, either in the brucellosis or the bovine tuberculosis schemes, there must be some form of regulation.  The number of complaints received by the Department of Agriculture about this particular subject is very low and by and large the farming community are satisfied, when they are unfortunate enough to have reactors in either category to dispose of.</P>

      <P>The increase in the staff on the agricultural side of the Department, omitting Fisheries since transfer from Lands, from 1,995 in 1960 to 2,865 in 1970&mdash;that is an increase of 44 per cent&mdash;was necessary to cope with the increased number and complexity of schemes.  There is not therefore any correlation between the growth of the Department staff and the growth of agricultural production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The application in this country of the present EEC regulations on dairy products would involve the replacement of our existing arrangements for supporting the creamery milk price by the mechanisms of the common organisation of the market in dairy products, in the application of which appropriate measures would have to be taken in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present policy in relation to the pricing of creamery milk will need adaption to EEC conditions?  The Minister is going in the opposite direction to the EEC policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary I would think in our context it is of the most vital importance that the smaller dairy producers get as much assistance as the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government can give them in order to keep this particular type of milk producer in business until we accede to the expanded European Community, in which case they will then be in a position to get a far more favourable price for their products.  If we varied our milk price structure by the means which Deputy Bruton seems to suggest it would lead to a situation where you would have a very much smaller number of larger producers and the smaller producers would be forced out of business.  That is why the Government concentrate their assistance in the matter of milk price supports to the lower producers.  There is a sensible and logical reasoning in this.  I would also point out to Deputy Bruton that in the most recent review of the multitier price structure a certain degree of simplification was introduced in the the area between 14,000 and 30,000 gallons and it is by no means immutable. As developments take place, and as we approach accession to the EEC, further changes, as they become appropriate, can be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another popular misconception.  It is true that as one ascends the scale in gallonage the need for assistance from the taxpayer diminishes.  This is reasonable and defensible; but it is not true to say that any producer, no matter how big a producer he is, did not benefit from the last increase.  All producers benefited from the earlier increases on the first 30,000 gallons.</P>

As I have said in my reply, the farmers on their own initiative are improving the quality of the milk, and the quality of the creamery milk supplies is rising very satisfactorily.</P>

Athlone is in a different position and I am satisfied as to the adequacy of the generous incentives already available there.  As I told the Deputy in reply to previous questions, the attraction of industry to Athlone has been receiving the special consideration of the Industrial Development Authority and I expect to be able to announce shortly the first result of their efforts.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the redundancy in the Athlone firm is as grievous for Athlone as the redundancy which unfortunately took place in Clara?  I fail to see why the Minister could not make the gesture towards Athlone which he has seen fit to make to Clara.  It leads one to the conclusion that it is political expediency because, Clara happens to be in his constituency.</P>

      <P>It does not sound like that.  The position is that the town of Clara was completely dependent upon this industry and this was the reason for the designation.  As I indicated to the Deputy previously and as I indicated to deputations from the town of Athlone, I am fully satisfied, because of the normal incentives offered by the IDA and because the IDA were concentrating on trying to specially assist Athlone, that something good will emerge.  As I have stated in my reply, I expect to be in a position very shortly to announce the first result of IDA'S efforts to attract industry to Athlone.</P>

It is natural that, because of the designation of Clara, the allegation may be made against the Minister who is also Deputy for the constituency that he has given particular attention to Clara. As a matter of fact, there are questions coming up which would give another impression.  If Deputy Treacy knew the situation in Clara&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know.  In regard to the reason for designation, this arose because of the disaster that could befall and would befall the town of Clara arising from the closing down of the jute industry on which the town originally was built up and upon which the town has been depending for over 100 years.  That is the type of criterion.  I appreciate the Deputy's view in relation to, say, Clonmel, a town that he has mentioned; but the closure of an individual factory in Clonmel does not put the whole town out of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 to 161 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The firm in question made an announcement on 8th December, 1970, to the effect that, because of the market situation for their products, they had been forced to decide upon a major curtailment of manufacturing activities in one of their factories.  It was implicit in the statement which I issued on the same date that I had prior information about this matter.  It was, of course, desirable that I should be in a position to take appropriate action as early as possible with the object of alleviating the situation for the workers affected. As I indicated in the statement to which I have referred, I have declared Clara to be a designated area for the purposes of the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  The effect of this is that any new industrial projects locating in that area will be eligible for the maximum rate of grant allowable.  In addition, the Industrial Development Authority have decided to construct an advance factory and steps to that end have already been taken.  I am not in a position to state the amount of employment which may be given in this factory.  In any case all the new employment is unlikely to be provided in one factory.  While I am not at liberty to go into detail I can say that a number of proposals for new <Col N="1311" /> industrial projects for Clara are already under urgent examination by the Industrial Development Authority and there are expectations of an early and favourable decision concerning one of them at least.</P>
    <P>It is correct that my Department has maintained close contact with the firm in question in recent years.  This was done because jute was recognised to be a problem industry and the aim was to safeguard, as far as possible, the position of the industry and the workers.  As I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question on 18th June, 1970, the steps taken in that connection included special arrangements negotiated for jute products under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, grants by the Industrial Development Authority towards the cost of adaptation and diversification projects carried out by the firm concerned, financial assistance under the technical assistance scheme administered by my Department, facilities for the importation of materials where necessary, and assistance in the field of marketing.</P>
    <P>I should point out that this particular factory was operating at a high level of production and employment up to recently.  Although special attention was being paid to the industry the fall in demand for its products recently has been more rapid than could have been anticipated.  The redundancy which is arising in the industry has not been caused by free trade conditions or entry to the EEC.  Jute goods have not been subject to a reduction of protection under the Anglo-lrish Free Trade Area Agreement and we are not yet members of the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain that on both sides of this House we are all sorry to see a situation arising whereby there are 278 people losing their jobs, but will the Minister not agree that his Department have been slow in taking the initiative in regard to this industry? As far back as April of this year, Deputy Colley, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, said he was in close touch with the situation in Clara.  He went on to say that he had been in touch with this firm for at least two years in connection with the long term plans for the industry.  Surely the <Col N="1312" /> Minister will agree that if his Department have been in close touch with this firm for the last two years in connection with their long term plans they should have been in a position to have known that this firm was in difficulties.  I am certain the Minister will agree that long before now this advance factory should have been built and that this is a case of closing the stable door after the norse has gone.  These people will lose their jobs for a period and this will cause unemployment and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already heard the Deputy say this when I received a deputation of a number of workers and people from Clara accompanied by him.  I replied to him indicating that the information with regard to the closure of Clara was conveyed to me at the end of October.  The actual date was 26th October.  The jute industry operates in Clara and in Waterford. There was a question of the closing of one of those factories and up to that particular date, when I was told of the closure of the Clara factory, there was a possibility of Clara being maintained.  If I, or the IDA, went ahead with an advance factory previous to that date the complaint now by the Deputy would be that Clara was closed because I or the IDA had already put the seal on it by encouraging people to get out by putting an advance factory there.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>As I explained in reply to a question last month, this firm's difficulties are due to a cyclic recession in the British market which it supplies and an upturn in trade is not foreseen before next spring.</P>

      <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement provides that in the year commencing 1st July, 1970, a review may be carried out by the Irish Government to determine which industries <Col N="1317" /> have encountered or are threatened with difficulties as a result of the operation of the agreement.  This review is being conducted in my Department and discussions with the British Government will follow, as provided for in the agreement.  Until this procedure is completed I think it would not be desirable to indicate which industries, if any, may be found to be in difficulties or threatened and what protection may be required for them.</P>

We have already dealt with the situation in Clara.  In Birr two shoe factories were closed in the last two years and the gum factory was also closed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am making every effort to supply the Controller of the Patents Office with adequate staff, but the Deputy will appreciate that suitable staff has to be recruited in competition with commercial interests.</P>

      <P>The bank protection duties on which members of the Garda Síochána are at present engaged are not new duties. What has happened is that there has been an intensification of this normal police duty because the Commissioner who, with the advice of his officers is in the best position to judge in matters of this nature, is satisfied that banks have recently become a prime target of organised gangs and because the efforts of these gangs involve a serious threat to the lives of innocent people.  I fail to see how the State could charge banks for a service performed by the police, an aim of which is the protection of life and the maintenance of law and order in an area in which law and order is seriously threatened.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any exceptional hardship caused to members who give special attention to banks during opening hours in the course of mobile and foot patrols.

      <P>Has the Minister considered, or discussed with his colleague, the Minister for Defence, the suggestion I made that, instead of having unarmed gardaí with just a baton, an armed military guard could be substituted?</P>

      <P>I should like to answer the supplementaries asked by the last three Deputies who, I believe, put them seriously and genuinely, unlike the Deputy who originally put down the question.  If I may take one of the points raised by Deputy Enright first, gardaí are not on duty outside banks to protect the private money or property of the banks or their customers. They are on duty to protect the lives of innocent people who may not necessarily be connected with the banks at all.  The Garda have reason to believe, or feel apprehensive, that certain serious crimes are liable to be committed in the immediate vicinity of banks.  The Garda have a duty to the public, in so far as their resources allow, to try to prevent crimes on the basis that prevention is very much better than having to solve crimes afterwards when, possibly, a life has been lost.  It is because the gardaí are carrying out part of their normal duty that they are at present on duty in the vicinity of banks for part of the day. There is no question of banks being given special protection for their own private interests or their own private property.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Gibbons has, I think, brought out the point quite correctly that there is a very important and definite distinction between the type of duty gardai do in the vicinity of banks at present and the type of duty that is done in connection with sporting events.  Gardaí on duty inside a sports-field are there at the specific request of the organisation involved and, because they are there at the request of the organisation, the organisers must pay for every garda on duty inside.  The House will be aware that on occasions, in the case of big matches and things like that, numbers of gardaí are on duty outside the grounds; these are on public duty and they are not paid by the organisers because they are not there at their request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is similar in the case of banks.  The gardaí are on duty in the vicinity not because the banks have asked for them to be there but because the Commissioner and senior officers apprehend the distinct possibility of very serious crimes being committed in or near banks if gardaí are <Col N="1326" /> not on duty.  The banks, to my knowledge, have taken pretty elaborate precautions to guard their own property. It is their duty to do that.  It is not the duty of the Garda to protect the private property of banks as such. Every bank has an elaborate alarm system wired to the nearest Garda station. That is a matter entirely within their own jurisdiction.  It is quite separate from the matters referred to both in the questions and in the supplementaries.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that anybody who wants gardaí to do private protection duty will have to pay for that protection but, where there is an apprehension of serious disorder or crime, it is the duty of the State, acting through its police force, to do what it can to prevent serious crime and that is what the Garda are doing.</P>

      <P>Agreement in principle has already been reached in this matter but legislation is required both here and in Britain to give effect to it.  Our draft legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I understand, however, that on the British side there has been a serious practical problem of finding parliamentary time to deal with their Bill and, on that account, I am not in a position to give any estimate as to when the matter can be brought to <Col N="1332" /> finality.  I may say that the British authorities are fully aware of our anxiety to have this matter dealt with and I know that they too are anxious to deal with it as early as they can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Most parking fines are fines-on-the-spot.  There are also fines for dangerous parking, and other violations of parking bye-laws.  In the time available it was not possible to provide the information sought about the latter type of parking fines.</P>
      <P>The total amount remitted to my Department in respect of fines-on-the-spot in the year ended 31st March, 1970, was £123,048.  As I mentioned in answer to a parliamentary question on 17th November, there are no final figures available for the amount collected in fines-on-the-spot this year, because of the bank strike.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question is based on a recommendation in the recent Report of the Committee on Reformatory and Industrial Schools Systems.</P>
      <P>That recommendation is, of course, entirely valid but I cannot accept that it implies that avoidable delays are a feature of the present system.  The report does not say anything to the effect that they are a feature and I have no evidence that they are such in fact. There may at times be delay but it does not follow that it is avoidable.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that while it is desirable, as the report mentions at section 10, paragraph 13, to deal with an offence while it is fresh in the child's mind, and while the committee obviously meant this to apply to the sentencing and not merely to the initial charging, there may very often be a serious conflict between this very desirable objective and the other very desirable objective of not passing sentence without as full an inquiry as possible into the child's background.  Moreover, of course, the offender has to be detected first of all and this in itself may take time.</P>

      <P>I understand that the council's policies for the development of Tallaght, including the provision of community facilities, will be set out in some detail in the revised draft development plan for the area which the council are considering and which should be going on public display early in 1971.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Dublin Corporation have acquired substantial areas of land at Tallaght for housing and other development and it follows that they will be closely concerned with the planning and development of the area in order to accommodate the large population that will eventually be living there.</P>

    <P>It will be the responsibility of the county council, as planning authority, to determine land-use policies for the area and to reserve whatever land is needed for the provision of community facilities, including open spaces for recreational and amenity purposes; but in view of the direct involvement of Dublin Corporation in the development of the area it seems likely that the <Col N="1340" /> corporation will also be involved in the question of facilities.</P>

      <P>Christmas cards were not provided officially for the Minister in 1966, 1967, 1968 or 1969.  The cost of 2,000 cards on order for 1970 is approximately £150.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Parliamentary Secretary the cost was :&mdash;1966, £69 5s 0d (700 cards); 1967, £84 2s 5d (700 cards); 1968, £85 (700 cards); 1969, £81 18s 6d (700 cards).  The cost of 1,000 cards on order for 1970 is £120 approximately.</P>
      <P>Postage was arranged by the Department but the actual cost involved cannot be calculated as the charge for the Department's postal services is a fixed sum, and the items are not paid for individually.  The same arrangements for postage will apply this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions on planning applications are primarily a matter for the planning authority concerned.  When considering applications, they are required <Col N="1346" /> to have regard to the proper planning and development of their area and to the provisions of their development plan.  I am involved in individual cases only where an appeal is made to me against a decision by the planning authority.  I have no information about the cases referred to by the Deputy but in any event it would not be appropriate for me in view of my appelate functions to comment on the merits of these cases.</P>
      <P>On the general question of development in open country along the national roads network, however, I would like to say that there are compelling reasons for discouraging such development and for supporting the policies of planning authorities who have included objectives for the protection of the network in their development plans.  The national route network comprises less than 6 per cent of our total road mileage but the roads included in it carry a very large proportion of our traffic.  With the growth of motor traffic and increased economic activity, the demands on the capacity of the national network is certain to increase rapidly and very substantial investment will be required to improve the network to the desired standards of safety and design.  The vital national importance of the network has been recognised by the decision in principle which has been taken by the Government to transfer responsibility for the network to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>It has been established beyond question in this and other countries that frontage development involving the creation of new access points on the main roads carrying heavy and fast traffic reduces the capacity of the roads for the purposes for which they are primarily intended, has a severely adverse effect on traffic safety, and tends to negative the value of the public money expended on their improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy refers to the alleged frustration of people who wish to live in rural areas, but it is not clear to me that these people could not secure suitable alternative sites fronting on to roads other than the comparatively small mileage of national road which <Col N="1347" /> traverses County Laois and thereby save themselves and their families from the hazards involved in living alongside heavily trafficked routes.</P>
    <P>The total mileage of national primary and secondary routes in County Laois is only 102 miles, out of a total road mileage in the county of something over 1,300 miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The general speed limit of 60 m.p.h. applies to roads which are not otherwise subject to speed limits.  In September last, after receiving from An Foras Forbartha the findings of a study carried out by them of the effectiveness of the general speed limit during its first six months of operation, I decided to retain the limit and to have its effectiveness studied for a further period.  I requested An Foras to continue their study of the measure and to co-ordinate this study with international studies of a similar nature being organised by OECD as part of the 1971 OECD International Co-operative Road Research Programme. As I announced at that time, I will re-examine the question of the general speed limit in the light of the results of these further studies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, the letting agreement which a tenant signs on taking up occupation of a local authority dwelling requires him to notify the local authority of any change in his household income.  Where a tenant fails to comply with this requirement, the local authority could adjust the rent appropriately with retrospective effect when the facts become known to them.  A decision to change this arrangement, which seems reasonable to me, would be for the local authority who are responsible for the administration of their rent schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so, would it not be a good idea if local authorities inserted notices in the Press to that effect, because people are not aware of this fact at times?  They find bills due in respect of rent increases of which they were not aware.  It might be a good idea to remind tenants regularly, say twice yearly.  Would the Minister recommend that to the local authorities?</P>

    <Col N="1349" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure that the tenants are not now aware of their obligation&mdash;for their own sake&mdash;to inform the local authority of changes in income.  Some tenants may have been unaware of this at the introduction of the differential rents system and might have overlooked it.  This may have given rise to some difficulty, but I think that at this stage most tenants are fully aware of this obligation and of the necessity for them to inform the local authorities.  The increased income will come to light in any case in the annual review and it is in their own interests to inform the local authority when there is a substantial increase or decrease so as to ensure their rent is related to the actual income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people do not know this.  Many people get court orders before they know where they are&mdash;the eviction order is followed by a court order at a very short interval. This is a serious problem for them and twice-yearly notices inserted by the housing authorities would obviate all the difficulties that arise.  If that recommendation went to the local authorities it would serve a very useful purpose.</P>

There was some difficulty in some of the regions thrashing out representation and other minor matters which delayed the committees in getting down to the real work which they were asked to do.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if any tests have been carried out, and if so when and where, to determine the level of air pollution arising here from the following chemicals which can be present in motor vehicle fuels: boron, barum, nickel and their compounds, lead, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides; if these tests have shown the necessity for remedial action; and if such has been taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 231, 232 and 233 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> Tests have not been carried out in this country to determine the level of air pollution arising from stationary sources.  The measurements of air pollution taken on behalf of my Department or by sanitary authorities relate to the level of pollution in the ambient air.  These testing arrangements were initiated in 1958 and recording stations are now functioning in the following six areas&mdash;Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway and Limerick.  The arrangements record the pollution of the atmosphere by smoke, sulphur dioxide, dust and grit.  They do not monitor the level of air pollution arising from chemicals which may be present in motor fuels.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the provisions of the American legislation referred to.  Similar legislation is not envisaged here at present.</P>
    <P>As regards remedial action and new legislation, I would remind the Deputy that regulations which are designed to control atmospheric pollution will come into force on 1st Janauary, 1971.  If it is established that further controls are desirable consideration will be given to their introduction, by legislative proposals or otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give me some details as to the actual siting of those testing stations?  Is the Minister not aware that the most severe air pollution can be a very local thing? It could be within a few feet of a very heavy traffic road.  That is where you should carry out your tests not, say, out in the middle of Leinster Lawn or somewhere like that where you are well away from it.  The big problem is local air pollution, not general pollution. What is the Minister doing to measure that?</P>

I regret the inconvenience caused to subscribers.  It is expected that a major extension to the exchange equipment which was ordered early last year will be brought into service in about six months' time.  In the meantime everything possible will be done to ensure a satisfactory service.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will make immediate arrangements to ensure that transmission signals from Radio Telefis Eireann are strong enough to be received in any part of the Six North Eastern Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that it is not practicable to provide full and satisfactory television coverage of the Six Counties from transmitting stations located on this side of the Border.  The BBC have had to provide no fewer than eight stations within the area to ensure adequate coverage for BBC I transmissions.  The signals from some RTE transmitters are receivable over a large part of the Six Counties, apart from places shadowed by mountains, but satisfactory reception is possible in many places only if viewers are prepared to erect special &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; type aerials as is done by many viewers here who receive external programmes.</P>
      <P>The transmission of stronger signals from existing RTE stations would not, I am advised, help materially.  An additional station would improve reception to some extent.  There are, however, difficulties in the way of establishing such a station which is not provided for in the plans included in the last European Regional Broadcasting Agreement.  Consultation with and the consent of the other signatories concerned would be necessary.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the matter is being examined very carefully and every effort will be made to reach a solution.</P>
      <P>Reception in the Six Counties of RTE sound broadcasts will be improved when the present Athlone transmitter, which is due for renewal, is replaced.  I have urged the Authority to expedite the replacement.</P>

      <P>I made this charge this morning and I repeat it here now because this is disgraceful before the Irish people.  It is political prostitution between the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, people who said they would go it alone in 1968.  Deputy O'Leary was one of the henchmen at that time and Deputy Tully-they had their great party policy which they said they intended to implement.  They got their answer in Donegal and they got it in the last general election when they tried to bring in the personality cult.  One or two of them did get through.  How, I do not know.  It is one of the mysteries of political life. I doubt if some of them will be back in this House again.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to look at some of the men within the Labour Party who are admired by members of their party-men like Deputy Cruise-O'Brien. His personal attacks on the Taoiseach have been unwarranted and certainly shameful and disgraceful because he and his party-and this is a widely held opinion and almost too obvious to mention-do not represent the majority of the rural people of this country.  They do not represent the majority opinion of this country.  Therefore, they have to attack the Taoiseach because they feel that he represents everything that is decent in this country, everything that is decent in politics and Government.  I can understand their antagonism because it is a very sore point with them.  We have had troubles in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1369" /> Party this year, we have had personality differences, we have had slight turbulence; but Deputy Tully has never seen trouble in this party like what they will have in the Labour Party in a very short time.  There are people in this country who call themselves socialists, and who are sincere socialists, but they are not sitting on those benches over there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is a very socially-minded party.  It has always been that and the Taoiseach, as he told Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was on more occasions than one nearer the breadline than many members of that Party.  They seem to forget that the working-class people back the Fianna Fáil Party because the first man who ever did anything for the working class was the then Taoiseach in 1932, Éamon de Valera.  He was the first man to give them adequate housing, to bring up the status of the agricultural worker.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully knows it. He is inclined to get embarrassed about it, because his own party have fallen down on these lines.  One could say they are more concerned with cheap publicity at the expense of parliamentary democracy than they are with the government of this country.  Three times this year the Taoiseach has given these people the chance to debate what they want to debate.  They have tempted us on each occasion to have a general election.  We gave them two by-elections as training ground and they came back panting, flushed and dead. These people again last week kicked up an unmerciful row in the Labour benches.  First of all, their leader&mdash;he is their leader for the moment, there is no doubt about that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With this atmosphere in the Labour Party they have to cover up and attack the Fianna Fail Party.  A number of gentlemen stood up last week.  One was the Labour Party leader, Deputy Corish.  The other was probably the only sincere extreme socialist in the Labour Party, Deputy Dr. Browne. Then we had my personal good friend, Deputy Coughlan, who stood up just to show that there was temporary unanimity in the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>On Thursday morning we had Deputy Cruise-O'Brien making a pointless protest and getting put out of the House.  When this happened it dawned upon me that this was a publicity stunt for their conference in Cork. This was the whole point of it.  Many of the Labour delegates in Cork believed that the members of the Labour Party in this House had given them a chance of becoming a party of their own and not a hind leg to another party.  It reminds me of a sick calf in a field bawling for its mother.  They have the cow over there and there is the sick calf over there.  Their policies were rejected by the people last year.

      <P>I mentioned this morning the knifing that was going on behind Deputy Cosgrave's back.  This is well known.  It was significant that Declan Costello was sent to Donegal town and there was no mention of Deputy Cosgrave from the platform. At the time some of these things seemed unimportant but then one reflects that Deputy Harte was demoted because of his actions within the Fine Gael Party, that he was one of the people willing to knife Deputy Cosgrave and one of the people rejected at a recent parliamentary party meeting when 11 or 12 people were knocked out of the way in the defence of Deputy Cosgrave.  There was no mention of a welcome back for Declan Costello from Deputy Cosgrave.  That was an amazing feature.  Yet he has been lauded by many Fine Gael people in many areas.</P>
      <P>It is none of my business why he did not do it but I just want to point out that they have been talking about our differences during the year; let us have a look at theirs for a change. There are some very serious differences in the front bench of Fine Gael.  The Chief Whip has his own problems in that regard, trying to keep some of them quiet and trying to make sure that the constituency of Donegal does not go out on its own little wing.  I do not know whether a disgraceful display which took place in Bally-shannon was a deliberate Fine Gael action in the by-election in Donegal but certainly it was authorised by one of their Oireachtas Members.  It was the nearest thing I have ever seen to a Fascist rally.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I can assure him it is no problem for me. There are 20,000 Fianna Fáil votes in South Tipperary; if the Deputy could say the same about the Labour vote in Limerick he would be all right.  The figures for agriculture under the present Taoiseach have risen, and this again cannot be denied by Opposition Deputies.  There is still a great deal to be done, but we are doing it as quickly as we can, provided we are given ample time to bring in legislation and are not interrupted to discuss motions of confidence in the Taoiseach whenever the Opposition decide they want to.  The Government have been more than lenient with the Opposition in allowing them to discuss matters.  The Opposition have their own problems but they have been trying to centre them on the Taoiseach and on the Government.</P>
      <P>I object very strongly to the personal attacks which have been made on the Taoiseach by Deputy Keating and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  The cynicism of those two gentlemen disgusts me. Their self-righteous attitude is disgusting, and sometimes amusing.  According to themselves these two gentlemen would be the saviours of democracy, but from what I know of their past there is not too much democracy there. I do not want Deputy Coughlan to stand up for them or anything like that, but I would suggest he should listen very carefully at his own party meetings when he hears talk about internment and anything like that because I believe there was a gentleman called Kenneth Kaunda in Africa who did a similar type of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year Deputy Coughlan said something about the Springboks and <Col N="1377" /> he was slammed straightaway, but when Deputy Browne mentioned abortion, contraception and divorce not a word was said about it until a special meeting was called.  But poor Deputy Coughlan was slammed the moment he opened his mouth.  This is discrimination against rural Deputies.  The Labour Party at the moment is based around a little centre in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davem said scandalous accusations were made against the Taoiseach by Members of this House.  The most scandalous references to the Taoiseach were made by members of his own party.  No member on this side of the House called him a felon setter.  It was members of Fianna Fáil who said that.  The hardest things said about him were said by members of his own party.  All the insults buried at him were by members of Fianna Fail.  All the snubbing and backbiting that went on went on in the Taoiseach's own party.  I do not recall ever hearing the leader of a party being subjected to such abuse for such a long time.  Those <Col N="1379" /> who have abused him professed loyalty and followed him into the Division Lobby and voted for him and, having done that, they went out through the door, interviewed members of the press and television, and said that their vote was one thing but they were keeping their fingers crossed behind their backs. I had a great deal of sympathy with the Taoiseach at the time because I felt he was only being left there until it suited certain people in his party to get rid of him.  I have not got rid of that feeling and yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> quotes remarks made by Deputy Haughey in Brussels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The report was that Deputy Haughey would be a Minister in the next Fianna Fáil Government under the present Minister for External Affairs.  I understand from people I know on the Continent that when Mr. Mansholt was over here at the end of October he said exactly the same thing when he want back to Brussels: he had been assured that Mr. Lynch would not be Taoiseach for many more months, that Deputy Dr. Hillery would take over and Deputy Haughey&mdash;this was the assurance given to Mr. Mansholt&mdash;would be in the Cabinet under Deputy Dr. Hillery.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey had no choice but to deny it.  I doubt if Irish politics and Irish democracy have ever been subjected to so much scorn as in the last year.  People are losing faith in the country and in this institution. They judge us on the standards of some Members on the Government side of the House.  We are accused of having no integrity, no standards, no concern for the people whom we are <Col N="1380" /> supposed to serve.  The final blame for this rests with the Taoiseach.  That is the fact.  He is the Leader of the Government and of the House.  If standards are low it is the Taoiseach who must take the blame for those low standards.  Of course, we are all blamed.  What is done on the Government benches rubs off on us.  That is regrettable.  Perhaps we deserve it because we did not fight harder or abuse the Government more to make them set their standards higher.</P>
      <P>What pleased me most in the last 12 months was the loyalty of the gardaí and the Army.  I am, however, now beginning to wonder if it will last. I did not see the postal vote in the by-elections but it is usually 80 to 85 per cent for the Government&mdash;not necessarily Fianna Fáil&mdash;and 15 per cent for the Opposition.  This time in Donegal the postal vote had risen as far as we were concerned; we were getting a far bigger percentage of the gardai and the Army votes.  However, as I said, what pleased me most was the manner in which the gardaí and the Army behaved over the last 12 months.  I want to put that on the record of the House.  It is well known &mdash;it does not need someone like me to bring it home to the people&mdash;where the thanks for this should be placed. When the first change of Government took place 38 years ago the instructions issued to the gardai and the Army were very clear: they did not serve a party, they served the Government. Their acceptance of that principle was amply demonstrated last May and since; the lesson had been well learned and passed on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davern asked did the Opposition parties want to see someone shot before measures were taken. Of course someone was shot: Garda Fallen lost his life early this year and the people who shot him have not yet been apprehended.  We are told it is necessary now to reintroduce the Offences Against the State Act.  The Government turned a blind eye to events in O'Connell Street when people produced guns and fired shots. As Deputy Cosgrave said last week, this party have always held that there should be one Army and one Army only.</P>

      <P>They spoke to reporters and told them this.  If the Taoiseach had let me finish I would have said that it might be the policy of the Government to ignore these people and pretend they were unimportant because more harm might be done by arresting them.  I do not know.  The Taoiseach has not said so but, if that was the policy of the Government, then it was a wrong policy.  Someone must govern and in this case the Government did not.  This House should have been engaged during the past 12 months primarily with the question of our candidature for EEC membership but, because of the arms trial and, more recently, the Prices and Incomes Bill, the matter of EEC membership has been pushed out of the limelight.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for that. The Minister for Finance said that there would be absolutely no retreat from the Prices and Incomes Bill. Deputy Haughey appeared on television and said he did not agree with it and, lo and behold, the Minister for Finance. Deputy Colley, found, the following week, that he could retreat from it. Whatever about the control of prices, I think the control of incomes is a very difficult matter.  The incomes of those who contribute most to inflation cannot be controlled.  The fact that the Bill is now put into cold storage does not help to raise the confidence of the people in the Government.  To function <Col N="1383" /> properly, a Government must have the confidence not merely of the people who voted for them but also of those people who voted against the party comprising the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very real victory. In the past two years, questions have arisen with regard to our relationship with the Six Counties; whether we should give them <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> recognition; whether we should encourage minority groups up there to arm themselves or pretend they did not exist, as seems to have been the policy for many years; whether we should direct propaganda at them to show that our point of view is not terribly different from theirs&mdash;that we are on the one island, and that whatever differences there are among us can easily be resolved if we work on them.  I do not think that the fact that the majority of the people in the Six Counties are Protestants while the majority down here are Catholics would hinder the working of this country as a 32-county Republic.  The fact that the majority of the people in the Six Counties are, as they term themselves, Unionists, while the vast majority of the Irish people down here are not is something that only time will whittle away.  We must show them that, by becoming part of a 32-county administrative area, we are not asking them to sacrifice something that is extremely attractive and valuable to them for a catch-penny or a shoddy article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of life in this country is <Col N="1384" /> something which people in many countries would be very happy to share with us.  I think the people in the Six Counties have, to a large extent, inherited their loyalty to what they call Unionism, this allegiance to England&mdash; some of them for material reasons; some through a genuine desire to be united with the Government in England.  However, to many more of them, I think it needs on our part only an intelligent and well-organised show of goodwill not alone by the Government but also by the Opposition parties and by the people throughout the country. We do not offer them a lowering of their standards in a material sense.  We must guarantee them the same standards, at least, as they are now enjoying. I would hope they would accept that we want them to share with us a raising of standards and a better way of life.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said recently that the Fianna Fáil Party never ran away from their responsibilities as the Coalition Governments did.  After the two recent by-elections he said the results signified that the country still supported Fianna Fáil.  He must, then, believe his party will be returned to power.  If he holds this general election, therefore, there will be no question of running away but simply a question of asking the people for a renewed mandate after the events of the past six months.</P>

      <P>It is very important that we should review the affairs of the Dáil in the past Session and consider what the Taoiseach, as head of the Fianna Fáil Government, has done by way of introducing constructive legislation. I see the present Dáil system as unwieldy.  A few days ago we saw such a rush of business through the Dáil with no time given for debate that it seems as if we are only a rubber stamp for legislation.  We serve no other purpose. <Col N="1385" /> We have no power or responsibility. Nothing is happening.  The Dáil meets for a few months in the year.  I have not seen much time given to the discussion of legislation before this House.</P>
      <P>In the last session we had a discussion of a Supplementary Budget, the prices and incomes policy and then the threat of the Offences Against the State Act.  I do not know what has taken place in the past year: even since the last election in 1969 there has been nothing constructive before the House.  We had useless debates brought on by the Taoiseach and the Members of his party attacking each other.  We were witnesses to this spectacle.  It should be obvious that there is need to reform the Dáil.  The initiative came from the Labour Party in suggesting reforms.  It is not sufficient to meet two or three days in the week and not good enough to decide to wind up a debate quickly with no proper time given for discussion of important matters.  As a minimum, the Dáil should meet five days a week and it is wrong that we should decide to close tomorrow evening and not re-open until the end of January or February.  That is exactly what will happen.  We should now raise our voices and say that something must be done.  The initiative lies with the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Legislation should not be bulldozed through the House without proper examination.  We should consider this situation early in the new year.  People have lost respect for this institution because they think it is a rubber stamp.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government negotiated the Anglo-lrish Free Trade Agreement with Britain.  We were told what a wonderful thing it was.  I remember Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party saying that we were reactionaries because we said this agreement spelled danger for the Irish economy.  We were told the agreement offered us unlimited opportunities and that we stood to gain immensely from it.  A few days ago I looked up the figures for imports and exports and I was astonished to see that since 1966 we have done far worse than we did from 1960 to 1966 as a result of the agreement.  The Taoiseach knows that there is no benefit in the agreement.  The agreement has resulted in dumping, redundancies and unemployment.</P>
      <P>It was disclosed in reply to a question to the Taoiseach in the House that the number of people at work in 1970 was 100,000 fewer compared with 1951.  This is startling, and I should like the Taoiseach to comment on it in his reply.  In the last year we have seen nearly 4,000 redundancies as a result of dumping and the adverse balance and the unfair treatment we get under the Anglo-lrish Free Trade Agreement. We were told there were safeguards and guarantees in this agreement. I had occasion to accompany a deputation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on behalf of the workers from Clara.  All he could say was that he had talked to the management of the jute factory and they would do nothing about it.  There are 300 workers redundant there and that, no doubt, represents 1,000 people.  They are now without employment and there is nothing for them but the emigrant ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have redundancy in the shoe trade as a result of foreign shoes being dumped here and we have no redress. We can timidly tell them that perhaps <Col N="1387" /> this is a little unfair but the Taosieach and his Ministers know we have no redress.  This is the agreement which the Fianna Fáil Government concluded with Britain.  It ensured us nothing but unemployment, redundancy and emigration.</P>
    <P>I read the Taoiseach's speech on the Vote of Confidence Motion a while ago.  He went back to the first Fianna Fáil Government and tried to outline their progress.  It reminded me of what you would hear in Russia where there is not another party.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach spoke at length about our social services but I should like to bring to his attention the fact that expenditure on social services per head in the Republic is less than half what it is in Northern Ireland.  Is he aware that we spend £65 per head compared with £138 per head in Northern Ireland? The Taoiseach should bear that in mind When talking of reunification, because that is an essential barrier to unity.  Our social services are far from adequate; they are the worst in western Europe.  People are living at or below poverty level.  The Taoiseach refused to comment when I asked him to define poverty, but whether the Taoiseach knows it or not people are living in poverty in this country.  We see it daily.  The social services are far from adequate.  There is no reason for the Taoiseach to boast that we have a wonderful country because nothing is being done by him in this field.</P>

      <P>I am talking about today. I want the Taoiseach to contradict that if he can.  They receive less than half of what they receive in Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Social Welfare says that we are not in a position to determine how our social services compare with those in Northern Ireland. When I asked the Minister if he would state what it would cost to bring our social services up to the level of those in Northern Ireland he said there was no way of determining this.  I am giving him this figure.  This has been worked out very well and it shows that our expenditure on social services is less than half that spent in Northern Ireland.  I will quote the source of this information for the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Third Programme for Economic Expansion says that the main emphasis must not be on economic development alone, that there must be a purpose behind this, and that is social development. On page 8 of this document it says:</P>
      <P>We must avoid a situation where the pursuit of material progress becomes the exclusive goal of economic endeavour. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have asked the Government to consider a proper, comprehensive health service.  It was only in 1965, when the then Taoiseach, Mr. Séan Lemass, found that people wanted a proper health service, that he decided he would have his Minister for Health publish a White Paper on the health services, which was published in 1966. We were then promised everything in this document but now at the end of 1970 the free choice of doctor scheme has not yet been introduced despite all the announcements by the Goverment that they were committed to this.  There was haggling going on for years.  I asked the then Minister for Health, Deputy Flanagan, what was being done about this or would there be a possibility of a breakdown in negotiations. <Col N="1389" /> He said there would be no breakdown, that it was definitely going ahead.  Now we find in December, 1970, on the eve of the implementation of the free choice of doctor scheme that it must be postponed.  In fact, when it comes to health services we find our people are treated as second-class citizens. may not have coloureds here but we have second class citizens.</P>

      <P>The number of people at work in Ireland in 1956 and at the latest date; and the reasons for any decline. </P>
      <P>The Taoiseach replied:</P>
      <P>The total at work in 1956 was 1.125,000.  In 1969 the figure was 1,069,000 at work. </P>

The Taoiseach knew he was not a proper Minister but now the Taoiseach has Mr. Boland's successor acting just the same.  He thinks by emulating his predecessor he will achieve a place of importance in your party.  He will not give honest or proper answers to questions asked in this House.

Half a million people paid tax under the PAYE system besides paying indirect taxation of 17 per cent on cigarettes, 62 per cent on petrol, 43 per cent on the pint of stout and in addition turnover tax on those items.  This is an indication of the indirect taxation of which this Government are so fond.  Taking direct and indirect taxation we have the highest taxation rate of any country in Europe and when that is compared with our social services a deplorable state of affairs is revealed.

I mentioned the Anglo-lrish Free Trade Area Agreement which is reflecting so adversely on the Irish economy.  It is obvious that if this is continued further we will have massive unemployment.  The signs are very evident.</P>

      <P>We have seen vacillating leadership and a vacillating Government. The Minister for Finance stated-and I love the way he said it-that there would be no negotiations and that it was definite that the Prices and Incomes Bill would go through.  He said there was no question whatsoever of any negotiations or any back-tracking. The heading in the Sunday Press of 18th October reads: &ldquo;We will not bargain-Colley&rdquo;.  In an interview with John Murdoch it is stated that he &ldquo;told me emphatically yesterday that there would be no bargaining on the Government's new anti-inflation proposals.&rdquo; The report goes on:</P>
      <P>I asked him: &ldquo;Does the Government intend to have any talk with the workers or employers on the new legislation?</P>
      <P>He told me: If we were asked by either group to listen to their views on it, obviously we would listen.  But I would like to make it clear that this legislation is not putting up a bargaining position. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> I am showing that we have a vacillating Government because in a very short time they decided that this repressive legislation could not be forced through. On so many occasions I have seen Fianna Fáil trying to assume dictatorial powers.  This is one of them.  It was only because of the fact that there is an effective Opposition here that those attempts by them were thwarted.</P>
    <P>The Prices and Incomes Bill was brought in despite the fact-and this is interesting-that they said in their Third Programme that there must be free collective bargaining.  In chapter 11 on industrial relations the Minister for Labour said there was no attempt to introduce any change in the present system of free collective bargaining but, despite that, they tried to bring in that repressive legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The unions told the Government that they would not be party to any national agreement unless the Prices and Incomes Bill were withdrawn. They were determined, and we in the Labour Party on their behalf were determined, that there should be free collective bargaining and that there should be no attempt to bargain at gunpoint.  That was exactly what was attempted by the Minister for Finance. The Taoiseach is a shrewder politician than the Minister for Finance.  He saw that when he was guided by the Minister for Finance he had made a few mistakes and he decided that the &ldquo;bull in the china shop&rdquo; antics of the Minister <Col N="1397" /> for Finance would not work.  He decided, firstly, that they would back down on the question of what they would allow by way of increase and secondly, he has admitted that they will withdraw the Bill because he knows that if we are to have proper democracy, proper industrial relations, we must have free collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>I was concerned at the Taoiseach's statement the week before last.  He said there was a threat of a plot and unless this threat were removed he would introduce Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act.  This is another attempt by the Fianna Fáil administration to bring in dictatorial measures.  If this were allowed and if we were to sit down and not raise our voices in protest against this we would see freedom lost in this country.  We would see, in fact, what is happening in the Communist countries of Europe happening here with freedom of speech abolished.</P>
      <P>I read Part 2 of this Act because when it was introduced in 1940 I knew nothing about it or its significance or its implications.  I saw when I read it that any Minister can have a person arrested and interned if, in his opinion, that person has said anything that he thinks is a breach of the peace.  Any Minister can do this.  He need not consult his colleagues.  He does not have to consult the Taoiseach.  There is no one excluded from this.  If I said anything outside against the Minister for Local Government he, if this were brought in, could have me interned without trial.</P>
      <P>This is what this Government wanted to re-introduce and the Taoiseach was annoyed because we raised our voices in protest against it.  He refused point blank to have a debate on it despite the fact that we thought it was a definite matter of urgent public importance. His reply to Private Notice Questions is interesting.  I quote from Volume 250 of the Official Report, column 486.  When asked among other things why he did not make a statement in the Dáil on the matter, why he waited until the Friday to make it, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is no obligation on the <Col N="1398" /> Government to make in the Dail a statement such as that referred to in the questions, it was hoped to do so last Thursday&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is important.</P>
    <P>&mdash;but this did not prove possible because of the need to give the matter careful and extended consideration and to take appropriate action quickly. </P>
    <P>To take appropriate action quickly. He knew it before the Thursday.  He said he would have made a statement on the Thursday but he had to take appropriate action quickly.  The action he took was on the Friday.  There is something wrong in the Taoiseach's statement.  I should like the Taoiseach to explain that because there is a contradiction there.  The Taoiseach, in some way or other, was not telling the truth.  The Taoiseach has a duty to explain this.  He had to take appropriate action quickly and he did not do it until the Friday.  We know that Mr. Boland, an ex-Minister, had said that the Special Branch were dreaming up plots to justify their existence.  This was a former senior member of the Government who said this.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not explain.  He said there was a threat and added: &ldquo;if this threat was not removed...&rdquo; What does he mean by that?  I am reminded of Hitler's days in the 1930's which I read about in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and the way they dreamed up plots to justify taking dictatorial action and opening up concentration camps.  There is a very real danger that the Taoiseach will introduce this measure.  It is more than likely that he will bring it in as soon as the Dail adjourns for the Christmas Recess.  He can try to muster public opinion in his favour by saying we have had bank robberies and killings.  They have had bank robberies in England but they have a police force to tackle them.  We did not see Britain bringing in Special Powers Acts.  We did not see internments up North when they had tremendous trouble last year.  They had justification, if anyone had, with all the trouble that prevailed up North, but they did not bring this in.  Still we, <Col N="1399" /> who condemn them, are permitting the Taoiseach to bring this in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This kind of folly one would not find anywhere.  Abysmal ignorance is what I would call that. Have we not a Garda force that is capable of protecting the public against bank robbers and others?  If they are not, we want to know why the Garda force should not be strengthened to deal with problems like this.</P>
      <P>We should not allow, and the public should have a massive demonstration against, any attempt by this Government to bring in Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act, because no Government in a democratic country have the right to take away a person's freedom and liberty without trial, without reason, without justification.  I do not care who the people are: the Government have no right to bring in laws like this to deal with them.  If people are guilty of something, they should be brought before the courts, and let justice prevail.  The Government are afraid of justice and this is their only excuse because their actions belie their intentions.  Cases brought before the courts show a mockery of the courts and justice.  There was a case that took place recently.  It was evident from the newspaper reports what happened.  It seems so ludicrous that when people are arraigned before the courts and when justice is applied the next thing is there is an appeal and the Minister for Justice decides that the person can go scot free.  I do not know the ins and outs of all this. Now they say the courts are inadequate.  How could they be adequate if the Minister for Justice intervenes and says the person can go free?  I am wondering if that person was the informer?  Is that why the person was allowed to go free?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The informer was supposed to live in a flat on the north side of Dublin.  The Opposition have a duty to inform the public and to arouse public interest in what is going <Col N="1400" /> on, what the measures are and what are the implications of Part 2 of this Act.  Many people are ignorant of the implications of this Part of the Act which was first enacted 30 years ago. The present generation know nothing about it.  The onus is on the newspapers and on public representatives to inform people that a person can be arrested on the order of any Minister, without consulting his colleagues, and interned without a trial.  This is not just a threat by the Government.  They acted very rapidly when despatching their representative to Strasbourg.  There is no doubt that this was not just a threat. We will see it coming into effect during the Recess because that is what is in the Taoiseach's mind.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that this State will not be used as a base for any plots against the North or anything like that. This Government are no example of leadership and proper Government because we saw their members involved in plots.  We always have to keep one thing in mind about any leader. Megalomania is a terrible thing.  You start by distrusting your colleagues and then you begin to distrust everyone around you.  Any leader will then make sure that his position is consolidated and fortified and he takes more and more action, more and more repressive measures.  This is the fear in my mind, that we might have a Taoiseach who might be thinking along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember three years ago seeing a patient who suffered a stroke.  Members of the Special Branch broke into her house at 5 o'clock in the morning, dragged her son from his bed and took him away for questioning and the woman suffered a stroke as a consequence. I wrote to the Minister for Justice suggesting that he might make an apology to the lady for what happened. I think it was then I first became aware of the implications of this.  The people in the Special Branch can concoct all sorts of charges against a person to suit their own ends.  They can break into your house at any time of the day or night, as happened in this case, and take people from it.  I have to confess that I am not one of those super-republicans; I am a realist perhaps and I have no particular sympathy with the republicans who want to take <Col N="1401" /> over the north by force or anything like that, or with Sinn Féin.  But I do not care who they are, even if they are Jehovah's Witnesses they are entitled to their freedom and liberty and the right of free speech.  I do not think any force such as the Special Branch have the right to carry on as they do.  We are given no information about this Special Branch but what we are doing is giving them this extra power and before we know where we are there will be hundreds interned.</P>
    <P>What should be known is that if a trade unionist says anything that any Minister considers is not right he can have the trade unionists interned.  This affects the ordinary working people and anyone can be locked up.  When I spoke to people about it they said: &ldquo;Oh yes, but can't you get your solicitor? Can't you go to court?&rdquo;.  They did not realise that you could be put away and no one knows for how long.  When I wanted to put down a question during the week to ask the minimum time a person would have to serve it was disallowed because the Minister for Justice, to whom the question would have been addressed, had no responsibility. When I spoke to the Ceann Comhairle's secretary about this he said it was a matter for the courts.  There are no courts involved in this.  He said it was a matter for the courts to decide how long.  We found after further discussion that no courts were involved, that you are just interned and that is that and no one knows for how long you may be put away.  I am saying this, that I will personally march through the streets if there is any attempt to do this and I will enlist support everywhere for action against this repressive measure and this dictatorial power.</P>

    <P>I wonder how many people will spend this Christmas in an internment camp?  At the rate the Government are acting this is liable to be brought in as soon as the Dáil adjourns.

This Government have not got an exemplary record in their treatment of people.  I do not think only Ministers are involved; I think the backbenchers are involved as well.  As public representatives Fianna Fáil Deputies should protect the freedom of individuals. Fianna Fáil Deputies should protest about this repressive legislation.  They have a moral right to do this.  We must have a proper Garda force to deal with this or any lawlessness, but we cannot take dictatorial powers to deal with <Col N="1403" /> alleged threats.

      <P>How do we appear in the eyes of the people in the North when they see the threat of the reintroduction of Part 2 of the Offences Against the State Act?  Despite intense provocation in the North there was no suggestion of bringing in a measure such as this in the North and, God knows, they had their troubles up there but there was no suggestion of internment without trial.  We talk here of human rights, liberty and freedom.  We talk about the minority.  All we are doing is paying lipservice to these things.  How can we talk about reunification? We should be setting an example.  We should be showing that freedom is the right of every individual here.  Fianna Fáil talk about republicanism. There is no such thing as republicanism in Fianna Fáil.  The word is being thrown around like snuff at a wake.  I was looking at the Taoiseach's speech on the Motion of Confidence.  It is very interesting.  At column 1395 of volume 246 of the Official Report the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party was founded in 1926.  They had the specific task of restoring national confidence following the tragedy of the Treaty and set out clearly their fundamental aims and objectives which have continued to be the basis of Fianna Fail policies up to the present day.  In order to achieve those aims it was not sufficient just to provide an Opposition at that time, as it did, but as quickly as possible to provide an alternative Government to Cumann na nGaedheal. This was the only effective way in which the republican ideal could be restored, our aspirations to reunify the country could be fulfilled.... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in 1932.  They had aspirations. That was some 38 years ago. The first thing that should have been done was to bring our social services up to the level of those in Northern Ireland.  Fianna Fáil took office in 1932 in order to fulfil their aspirations.  In 1970 expenditure on social services in the Republic per head of the population is less than half that in Northern <Col N="1407" /> Ireland.  Fianna Fáil made no effort to fulfil that aspiration.  That was the first barrier they should have tried to overcome.</P>

      <P>I do not.  I do not know what kind of republican or gunman Deputy Aiken was.  I judge him on his performance as a Minister.  I should like to have seen the Taoiseach and Minister for External Affairs take the initiative and talk to the British Premier and the Northern Premier and decide that there should be regular consultations on how we might bring about the reunification of the country. <Col N="1413" /> I should like them to get some assurance from Britain that the subsidy to Northern Ireland would continue for a certain time while we try to reach a solution.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to say, when questions are asked, that there are no meetings in view and that nothing is being done.  The Taoiseach must constantly take the initiative and see what can be done.  He must constantly raise the matter with the Prime Ministers of Britain and Northern Ireland.  He has not seen the Northern Prime Minister since he took office: the Taoiseach has admitted that in the House.  This is a country that should be united.  There is no reason why it should not.  We should be telling the people in the North that we are very anxious to have them with us and we should improve our social services so that they do not form an obstacle.  The articles in our Constitution that are an obstacle should be removed as early as possible. That is the kind of legislation that should come before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen what happened here in the bank strike because of inaction by the Government. I found out yesterday that we will not know the true position resulting from this strike for at least another month and perhaps longer.  I believe we will have repercussions worse than those following the closure of the Hibernian Transport Company when men were thrown out of employment and found themselves abandoned.  There was no prior warning here, as there was in the bank strike, and there was no way for the workers to know the situation.</P>
      <P>The Government have encouraged foreign industry to come here.  They should, instead, have encouraged foreign expertise to come here.  The only thing those new industries have guaranteed is employment.  Profits went out of the country tax free.  The employment given is not secure.  We have had mergers and take-overs by foreign interests.  An article by &ldquo;Maynard&rdquo; in the Sunday Press of the 6th December stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> Transferring control of an Irish firm into foreign hands differs I suppose from the setting up of a new firm.  Profits for example will tend to be sent abroad so the country loses to that extent. </P>
    <P>We see more and more of those mergers and rationalisations.  As a result more and more of our workers are thrown out of employment.  We have an obligation to our workers.  If foreign interests are allowed to come in here the Government should have a representative on the boards of those companies to see that the interests of the workers are protected.  This is very important for the country.  We should safeguard the interests of our workers.</P>
    <P>This is another example of workers not counting.  Those people are allowed in here without any control.  The interests of the workers are not the concern of the Government in the Prices and Incomes Bill.  The present Government have not shown that they are interested in bringing constructive legislation into this Dáil.  We have recommended reform of the Dáil. that there should be some attempt to bring the Dail into line with present day conditions so that we have a proper Dail functioning.  This initiative should have come from the Taoiseach.  No attempt has been made to reunify our country and to protect our workers. Unemployment is on the increase here. due to the fact that the Government have no policy.  They are changing from day to day.</P>
    <P>The Third Programme is a philosophical dissertation.  It does not give any real plan for the coming year.  The Government did this because their Second Programme was a disaster.  We would have supported the Government if they had come in with constructive legislation but we will not tolerate this threat by them.  We will oppose this legislation all the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell tried very hard to give us the Labour Party thoughts on the Government.  If we feel confused about socialism I am afraid we do not get much help from Deputy O'Connell on the matter.  At the start of his speech he compared the Fianna Fail Government with Adolf Hitler, <Col N="1419" /> the late German Chancellor, and because we pointed out that Adolf Hitler was a socialist Deputy O'Connell poured scorn on our ignorance and told us to read history.  Somebody at one time said: &ldquo;He who at 20 is not a Socialist has no heart and he who at 40 is a Socialist has no head.&rdquo;  If we take the socialism which Deputy O'Connell speaks about in the classical context of Lenin or Marx we can then see that you can today equate a socialist with Adolf Hitler or with Chairman Mao.  We would never accuse the Labour Party of being followers of either Hitler or Chairman Mao, but this House has a right to expect a serious contribution in this most serious debate.  To go down the by-ways of Labour Party socialism and to come out then as the Deputy did in defence of English capitalists is just too much for the Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>We do not claim that we are super rulers, super socialists or anything else. We believe in social justice and we feel each Irish man, woman and child should in his own country have a fair share of the national wealth.  We do not go around spouting about our just society or our new socialism.  We simply preach a doctrine which has been preached here since the beginning of Irish nationalism.  We believe in this.  Perhaps we are being very simple people when we try to look after the aged and underprivileged.  We try to create employment for our people and not only to raise the standard of life but also to raise the quality of life of our people.</P>
      <P>We do not claim to have a monopoly of the interest in and care for Irish people.  By their action the people have given us this task over many years.  At each succeeding election since 1932 our party has been returned as the biggest party in this House.  On two occasions, by a combination of Fine Gael and Labour, an inter-Party or coalition Government was formed. Today if coalition is a dirty word, the people over there can be blamed, not us.</P>

How did they solve the housing problem in this city?  Not by building more houses but by having too few people here.  I was a member of Dublin Corporation with some of Deputy O'Connell's colleagues, ex-Deputy Denis Larkin and others.  I remember Deputy Dowling and others of us being sent around to the banks looking for money.  At that time the banks were merely polite to us.  They told us to go, that there was no money there.

Both parties and particularly <Col N="1421" /> the Labour Party are not &ldquo;with it&rdquo;. The Irish people, who are highly intelligent, return Fianna Fáil to office at each election.  Why should they not? We are not a very sophisticated people but we are an intelligent people.  The people will go on returning Fianna Fáil to Government until such time as an alternative is offered to them.</P>
      <P>In 1969 at the time of the last election the Labour Party made a great showing.  Indeed, I admired their agility if not their ability.  They fought a hard battle but you cannot sell a bad product despite advertising, and the Labour Party came back with a loss of four seats.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy O'Connell mentioned gerrymandering. At the time of the Referendum on the PR system, both Fine Gael and Labour speakers in this House, at the crossroads and on the Dublin streets said that they wanted to hold on to PR because under PR you could not gerrymander and under the straight vote you could.  In their wisdom the people kept the PR system.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  If they said you could not gerrymander under PR they cannot now accuse us of having gerrymandered the constituencies.  They know in their hearts and soul that we did not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Each area must be taken on its own.  In Britain under the straight voting system the same thing happens.  You cannot equate every seat with every vote.  I do not want to further denigrate the Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  The Irish people are wise to them now.  In our life today there are much more serious matters to be dealt with than chasing socialist shadows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment in this city of ours we have roughly 8,000 applications for houses to Dublin Corporation.  That is quite a large number and one which should not be there.  I do not think we should accept that we will always have 8,000 people on our waiting list and neither does the Minister.  He believes that we can have a comprehensive housing drive.  The figures show that at present 2,500 dwellings are being built and we have plans for another 6,000 <Col N="1423" /> dwellings.  When those 2,500 are completed plus the ones which are planned, it may be said that there will be no housing problem but this is not true.</P>
    <P>I have said before that no living city ever solves its housing problem.  The population of this city and this country is growing and therefore we must build more houses.  The Government, under the Taoiseach, by judicious budgeting has been able to provide sufficient money to keep up the housing drive.  We will not go back to the period of 1956-57 when the building trade ground to a halt.  That is all in the past now.  In the building trade at the moment we can thankfully say that not only have we full employment but we have overemployment.</P>
    <P>In a speech a few weeks ago, addressing the builders' federation, the Taoiseach pointed out that there was a great degree of inflation in the building trade and that we must tackle this if we are to provide enough dwellings and also dwellings at rents which people can afford, or dwellings at loan rates which those Who purchase houses can afford.</P>
    <P>This was not just another speech because already the Minister had announced his plan for low cost housing.  He invited contractors and developers to come along with their proposals for lower cost housing.  I am glad to say that the contractors and developers are co-operating with the Department.  We may well see in the next few months some worthwhile ideas not alone in regard to the provision of more dwellings but in regard to the provision of dwellings at cheaper rates than we have had up to the present.</P>
    <P>It is said that one cannot build bridges with straw and one cannot build houses without bricks.  One cannot employ labour on a building scheme and one cannot buy the materials or the land unless one has got the necessary money in the National Exchequer to pay the carpenter, the plumber and the bricklayer for his work or the landowner for his land. Therefore, it takes wise husbandry on the part of the Government to build the economy to stand the strain of this <Col N="1424" /> great housing drive.  We in this Party are very determined never again to allow our building industry to crumble as it did in 1956-57 when we saw thousands of our craftsmen having to leave and go to build houses in Birmingham, London or Liverpool.  We want the men back here working in their own country.  Thank God many of them have come back.</P>
    <P>The last census showed for the first time since the famine an increase in population.  We believe that at the moment emigration is at a very low level.  We will never be happy until we see all involuntary emigration stopped. There will always be people who will emigrate for different reasons.  They are right to do so if they want to, but we do not think of them: we think of the man who wants to live and rear his family in his own country.  He is entitled to do this.</P>
    <P>This all takes bold leadership by a Government and that Government must also have the trust of all sections of the people.  A fortnight ago we had two tests of public opinion on this-one in Donegal and one in South County Dublin.  The Government won the Donegal seat.  They did not win the Government seat in County Dublin but there were over 8,000 people there who endorsed the Fianna Fáil candidate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The people have put the Fianna Fáil Government here and the Fianna Fáil Government have justified their trust.  When I hear people shouting about concentration camps and Chancellor Hitler and others I know it is only to make up for any reasoned argument against the Fianna Fáil Government or for the Opposition.  It is said that the people get the Government they deserve, but I do not think it can be said that the Irish people deserve the Opposition they have.  Until the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party either coalesce or decide not to coalesce the people will be a little confused about their intentions.  However, they will always have a united Fianna Fáil Party to go before them and offer themselves as a viable Government interested in social justice and the building of this nation.</P>
      <P>We do not believe in gimmicks like the <i>Just Society or the New Republic.</i> The <i>New Republic</i> has the Plough and the Stars on its cover but in recent times we have seen evidence that the Plough and the Stars will be hauled down very shortly.  I wonder if it will appear on the election propaganda next time or will Fine Gael say: &ldquo;It is far too socialist for us.  Take it off your cover &rdquo;? It does not matter whether they do or not, but if they consider coalition in all honesty they should coalesce before the election.  Why did they not put forward a coalition candidate in Dublin South County or in Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> In the housing drive for Dublin we see evidence all round us in the city and in the county of the drive to eradicate all bad housing and overcrowding of families and to give a proper dwelling to each family, to clear the slums which 50 years ago were the worst in Europe.  One very often hears the Deputies on my left shouting: &ldquo;Declare a housing emergency.&rdquo;  Not only them but I have heard other people in the city who should know better say the same.  They never fully explain what they mean by this, whether they intend to dragoon labour into the building industry or what kind of emergency powers they want or how they would do it.  One just gets vague proposals or non-proposals.</P>
    <P>In this document&mdash;I am speaking of Dublin at the moment&mdash;there are details of the housing drive.  From these figures one will see that perhaps in two years time the housing waiting list will be reduced greatly not because people have fled the country, but even with an increase in population we will have a better housed society.  If I make a special plea for Dublin it is because, according to the Myles Wright Report, by 1980 or 1984 we will have a million people in this city.  I would not want the city to get that big.  At the same time it is a world wide feature that cities grow larger and larger.  Since the industrial revolution people have been heading towards the cities and the bright lights.  We must accept this fact. We have people coming here from all parts, even from outside the country. We must create conditions whereby it will be possible for all people qualifying for houses to have them.  We must not only increase the numbers but we must raise the value of each dwelling. We have had experience since 1932 in house building and we are improving each new scheme, and this is only right.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we are on the right line in regard to housing.  Simply by declaring a housing emergency or using some other cliché will not add one room to the existing stock of houses.  It takes wise planning with the co-operation of the unions and all sections of the community; none are excluded.  Please God, in a very short <Col N="1427" /> time we will have seen the last vestiges of really bad housing.  We will still have a problem of overcrowding and this is the second stage of the housing drive.  When we reach that stage we can examine the progress of the programme. If the Government are satisfied that there are people who are not properly and adequately housed then we will continue the drive.  A throw-up of houses here and there is not going to raise the standard of living in the city.  We must have proper planning and ensure that any co-operative scheme will be as well landscaped, and the roads in it as good, as any scheme of private development.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that because a man living on a suburban road has something a man living elsewhere must have the same thing.  I do think we have basic needs to fill and the man living in any part of the city is entitled to expect that the Government will create conditions so that he can live in a proper house, that he will have a job and proper educational facilities for his children.  In regard to education we can point to the tremendous breakthrough which has been effected by the Government in secondary education.</P>

      <P>They have been doing that all their lives.  The people are not fooled so easily; they vote for the party with the policy and not the party who claim they have a policy.  In regard to planning, it is a tremendous problem not only in this city but in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Wexford and the larger towns.  At the moment we are in need of a tremendous urban renewal drive.  We see this in every city and larger town and there is evidence that we have got to tackle it at a greater rate than we have been able to do up to this.</P>
      <P>Many of these places would be better places to live in if we had a greater drive for re-development in them. Again, this takes wise government and a sound economy, because this has to be paid for and planned.  From our past experience we should be able to keep on improving the appearance of and the conditions in each city and town.  We should design our cities and towns so that our people can live in them as human beings and not have to face miles and miles of concrete jungle.  We should have all the playing fields, roads and other amenities needed in any urban society.</P>

      <P>He is back in 1931. Chairman Mao will be in power before the Deputy wakes up.  I was referring to planning, which is a very essential part of our whole national existence.  We must plan properly for the amenities that each area needs but at the same time we must not be hypocritical about this.  If we are to do it the Government must find money and there will have to be taxation.  Let us not come in here crying for amenities and then crying against taxation.  No country in the world, whether it is this side or the other side of the Iron Curtain, has found a way to make progress without taxation in some form.  The Fianna Fáil <Col N="1430" /> Government in their wisdom have brought about the most suitable system of taxation possible.</P>
      <P>We are making progress in housing and in planning, but there is one facet of our living in which we are not making progress and that is in regard to the frightful problem of road safety.  I know that this is causing the Minister for Local Government great concern and I compliment him on his approach to the matter.  For the 11 months ended 30th November, 475 people were killed, an increase of 44 over the same period last year.  I know that this is a world problem but this is no consolation to us or to the person who is killed or a person whose relative is killed.  If someone here ran amok with a gun and killed two, three or four people there would be no cries about concentration camps then.  Each one of us in his own way is responsible to some extent for the road toll.</P>

      <P>As has already been stated here, the priority lists for major and minor catchment areas were drawn up in 1946. Although some minor adjustments were made these did not affect the net result and there has been no revision of those lists which have been accepted by successive Governments.  I do not think that any revision is called for now. The lists remain as published in the Official Report in February, 1963, in Vol. 199, No. 9, columns 1251-1252.</P>

      <P>Postal voting is confined by law to members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  The Joint Committee on the Electoral Law recommended in its Final Report, dated 12th July, 1961, against any further extension of postal voting facilities, on the grounds that the greatly increased risk of abuse would not be justified.</P>
      <P>As has already been indicated in replies to previous questions on this subject, the introduction of legislation to extend postal voting facilities is not proposed.</P>
