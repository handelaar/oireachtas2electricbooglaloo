      <P>There are no plans or proposals for the development of the Shannon estuary before my Department other than one by Limerick Harbour Commissioners to construct a jetty adjacent to Shannon Airport to cater for vessels of up to 6,000 tons deadweight.  The harbour commissioners' application for my consent to borrow money towards the cost of the proposed jetty is at present under examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Representatives of the principal harbour authorities within the Shannon estuary have agreed to recommend the establishment of a joint ports committee for the purpose of formulating a scheme for a single harbour authority for the estuary.  My consent to the establishment of the committee is required under section 161 of the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date requests for my consent have not been received from all the <Col N="1582" /> harbour authorities concerned.  When all the requests have been received I will have the matter dealt with favourably as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether any investigations have been carried out into the problem of the future viability of western ports; and if he will make a statement outlining Government policy in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the viability of harbours rests, under the law, on the individual harbour authorities.  I am not aware of what investigations, if any, the authorities for western ports have undertaken individually, or propose to undertake, into the question of viability other than a study undertaken by the Economist Intelligence Unit into Limerick port at the request of Limerick Harbour Commissioners in 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is Government policy in regard to harbours that they be operated as commercial undertakings and should be self-supporting.  The Government expect that any investment at harbours should be related to the specific and identifiable requirements of new trade or industrial development and should not be undertaken merely by way of providing general facilities in the hope <Col N="1583" /> of attracting new and unspecified business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he proposes to introduce any new legislation regarding harbours and harbour authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>General harbours legislation is embodied in the Harbours Act, 1946 as amended and extended by the Harbours Act, 1947.  Certain matters have come to notice from time to time which may call for amendment, in due course, of the present legislation but none of these is of sufficient urgency to warrant the introduction of special amending legislation at the present time.  As intimated in my reply to the Deputy on 10th June, 1970, special legislation would be necessary to create the proposed single harbour authority for the Shannon estuary when this course is agreed upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if it is possible to have a better service provided than that proposed to be provided by the ESB as stated in a reply to an application for electric current extension to the house of a person (name supplied) that 1975 was the earliest date by which a supply could be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the householder in question lives in the board's Ballyvaughan rural area and that he did not accept the terms for supply quoted to him during the recanvass of the area under the rural electrification planned post-development scheme.  It will not be possible to give unconnected householders in Ballyvaughan a further opportunity to take supply until work under the programme has been carried out in the outstanding areas in the board's Tuam group into which Ballyvaughan falls.  The programme is proceeding on a planned basis, area by area, so as to ensure that the available resources are utilised to the fullest possible extent and it is not <Col N="1584" /> expected that Ballyvaughan will be reached before 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware that a person (name supplied) has been refused connection of electricity supply to his farm except at a prohibitive charge although the farm is adjacent to Ardnacrusha power station; and if he will take steps to have the charge reduced to an equitable amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the farm in question is two miles from Ardnacrusha power station and that it would not be technically feasible to extend supply from the station to the farm.  Because the costs of connecting the farm were high, the terms for supply quoted to the householder in 1967 included a high special service charge.  These terms were not accepted.  As a result of the reduction in high special service charges arranged by the Government in June, 1968, the terms on which supply could now be made available to the householder are substantially below those quoted in 1967.  The householder should contact the ESB district manager at O'Connell Street, Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the applicant was not one of those people who declined to accept the ESB terms at that time and having regard to the close proximity of the power station would he not try to ensure that more reasonable terms are provided in this instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the original terms, quoting a very high special service charge in 1967 of £8 3s 4d per two monthly period, were not acceptable.  Now, as a result of the arrangements made in June 1968 the offer is cut by practically half, to £4 12s every two months.  He should contact the ESB in Limerick and settle on that basis which appears to be reasonable as the service charge quoted has been cut by half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware of grave concern among the local people at the reported proposals of the ESB to erect large pylons in the vicinity of the Nire valley, Clonmel, County Tipperary; and that it is of the utmost importance to preserve the scenic beauty of this area; if he will investigate the matter; and if he will detail the proposals that have been made and take steps to ensure against the despoliation of this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that already the ESB have been active in this very beautiful area in erecting various types of aerials <i>et cetera</i>?  Would he kindly give the House an assurance that before any further work of this nature is embarked on some kind of public notice would be given so that interested persons could take steps to ensure that the natural beauty of this area will not be spoiled?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that many deserted wives are being refused the allowance granted under recent legislation because of the rigidity of the means test imposed; and that deserted wives who are obliged to work are particularly affected; and if he will take remedial action, if necessary by introducing amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy. The means test applicable under the deserted wife's allowances scheme is <Col N="1586" /> precisely the same as that operated under the scheme for non-contributory widows' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that because of the means test which is stipulated many of these applicants will have their claims disallowed, especially those who are obliged to work to maintain their children in the absence of a husband?  In these circumstances would he liberalise the means test so that these genuine cases could be properly considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to have more generous terms for the means test in this case than in the case of widows and non-contributory pensioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that applicants for these allowances are being refused because there is a son or a daughter in the household who is working and they are obliged to live on the charity of their son or daughter in these cases?  Would he not examine this, especially since he said there would be real flexibility in it, because, while he meant this, in practice it is being too rigidly applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I mentioned the word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; I was referring to the proof of desertion.  We cannot be more flexible than the law permits within the terms of a means test.  I am not aware of the particular case the Deputy mentions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that, in such a circumstance, where there is a child working and the child is being kept at home, it is only the excess of the receipts from that child over the cost of keeping the child that is taken into account?  Is that not right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What usually applies in the case of widows is that <Col N="1587" /> the entire outgoings which are unavoidable are taken into account and balanced against the income.  I should say on the overall question of these applications, I have been looking into the number that have been coming in and the number that have been sanctioned. I think they are being dealt with very fairly and there is no reason to think there is any&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the questionnaire which is sent out certainly gives the impression to deserted wives that they are expected, if they have information of where the husband lives, to furnish this information, to contact the husband even if it is 20 years since he deserted them; that this is causing great distress and concern to deserted wives who in some cases have very good reason for not contacting their husbands?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in connection with the deserted wife allowance, that many of the questions posed, to say the least, are very indelicate and of a very personal, searching and embarrassing kind; that many widows have given up all possibility of completing such forms?  Would he look at this whole situation with a view to ensuring that the wishes of this House in granting these allowances will not be frustrated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cott</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would be prepared to waive the stipulation that a deserted wife at the age of 55 or under must have a dependent child living with her, in view of the fact that many of the deserted wives married at a very young age and, hence, at the age of 50 or 55, would not have a child living with them because of broken homes and the like?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an age limit fixed in the measure and it is possible to have it examined as time goes on.  I did point out at the time this legislation was introduced that the original investigations would, perhaps, reveal a good many anomalies, which undoubtedly can be rectified in time. Deputy Treacy is complaining about the questionnaire.  I especially looked up his area and I find that 17 forms have gone out, 11 have been returned, ten applications have been granted and one has been withdrawn.  That does not seem to justify the overriding statement he made that there is widespread consternation.  I do not think that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister re-examine the form in view of the complaints?  Another issue which the Minister might re-examine is that the deserted wife is asked to give evidence from a home assistance officer about her condition.  I understand from the Department that, in fact, other people can give evidence to this effect, but the person receiving the form thinks it must be the home assistance officer. The form is badly designed and not designed to carry out the intention. Could the Minister examine the forms in the light of these complaints?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will admit this is an area where we have to move very carefully.  The evidence available in some cases can be very flimsy and very delicate.  There is such a thing as a deserted husband.  However, in the light of the evidence we are getting, we are satisfied we shall arrive at a fairly reasonable means of assessing cases correctly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the inquiries conducted by officials of the Department of Finance prior to 14th May last into the possible use of public funds for the illegal purchase of arms included an inquiry to the principal private secretary to the Minister who had control over the issue of sums from the Northern Relief Fund; if so, what these inquiries elicited; and, if not, how these officials were able to assure the Taoiseach that no public funds had been used for arms purchases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The assurance given to the Taoiseach that no public funds had <Col N="1592" /> been used for arms purchases followed discussions with the official described in the question and an examination of the relevant departmental papers. These papers give no indication that the Northern Ireland Relief Expenditure (Grant-in-Aid) had been used to purchase arms.  The payees listed in the papers were reputable persons and bodies.</P>
      <P>I should add that the official described in the question had no control over the issue of sums from the grant-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from what was stated in evidence during the course of the trial that this money was given to the Red Cross with written instructions to transfer it into a bank account in the names of a number of people whose names were, in fact, false.  How could the Taoiseach give an assurance of a negative character that no money came or could have come from such a source for arms purchase?  What the Minister has said is that there was no evidence that the money was used for arms purchase but the question to which the Taoiseach replied was one to which he replied in terms of saying that it could not have come from such a source.  How could the Taoiseach have given such an assurance in the light of what the Minister has just said?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 to 23 together.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to provide a guidance service in all post-primary schools.  To this end, a number of training courses in guidance for post-primary teachers have already been held by my Department. At present there are approximately 150 guidance teachers in post-primary schools and training will continue to be provided until such time as all post-primary schools enjoy the services of a guidance teacher.  These guidance teachers are employed by the schools not by my Department.</P>
      <P>Teachers for training in guidance are selected from recognised teachers who have shown a special aptitude for such work and are given special courses of training.</P>
      <P>A number of guidance teachers are also appointed by schools from amongst those who have done a special university course.</P>
      <P>As regards the school referred to by the Deputy arrangements have already been made for the manager of that school to discuss the matter with a senior psychologist in my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>The conditions governing the recognition of secondary teachers are laid down by a statutorily established registration council.  That council has refused to register as secondary teachers persons with practical experience of woodwork who were trained at the Department's two years training course.</P>
      <P>In December, 1969 it did, however, agree to register holders of the leaving certificate who had successfully completed the Department's three years training course.</P>
      <P>The latter group are accordingly eligible for appointment in a fully recognised capacity in secondary schools.</P>
      <P>Steps are being taken to recruit as many as possible suitable trainees in woodwork for both secondary and vocational schools.</P>

A scheme of temporary works was carried out at the school in 1958.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions in this House and also in An Seanad I have referred to the necessity to secure in every area of the country post-primary educational provision which would be such as to cater for the aptitude and ability of all the pupils in the area.  I referred in this respect also to the necessity to establish larger school units as no small school could by itself provide the range of subjects and facilities which would be required.</P>
      <P>The memorandum to which the Deputies refer was in the nature of a working document, not a circular.  It brought together in a form suitable for discussion my ideas as to how what I had in mind could be achieved by the establishment of community schools. As a preliminary to the discussion with interested parties which would be necessary copies of the memorandum were sent to the Catholic hierarchy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to the question, the memorandum was issued to the hierarchy as a preliminary to the discussion I intend having with interested parties.  I should like to make a few points about this document.  I wish clearly to underline <Col N="1615" /> the fact that it is working document. I was somewhat surprised at the emotional manner in which the document was dealt with, as if it were something new and had not been heard of before.  In fact, there is nothing in this document on which I did not speak in this House, in the Seanad and in many speeches outside the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I have expressed concern on many occasions that there should be equality of educational opportunity as well as free education.  I think in this age when people are very concerned about education, and when young people are flocking into post-primary schools, it is essential that the schools should be able to provide a wide curriculum.</P>
      <P>The broad range of subjects required could be provided in individual schools in the cities and larger towns because of their big enrolment.  In many of the small towns throughout the country, for historical reasons, there are two or three post-primary schools and it was obvious to me that due to the relatively low enrolment it would not be possible to provide in such schools the wide curriculum that is necessary to cater for the aptitudes and abilities of all the pupils.</P>
      <P>We therefore tried to get co-operation between these schools so that between them they would have sufficient numbers on the rolls to be able to provide the wide curriculum about which I spoke.  I would like to mention the fact that the decision in relation to the schools coming together in co-operation will be a local decision.  I want particularly to emphasise that the State will not be represented on the board of management.  The community school will be just as independent of the State as any existing post-primary school.  The schools will be conducted by the same people who are running them now, except perhaps in a different manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was endeavouring in reply to a request from the Government benches to indicate methods, other than the methods advocated in the Bill under discussion, for controlling inflation.  One of the central points of all methods is the matter of increasing production and productivity.  As Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and others have pointed out in this debate, we have formed the habit in this country of making comparisons between our standard of living and that of other countries, and the rate of increase in the living standards.  From the point of view of the Government in avoiding repeated crises of the sort that now face us, it may be fortunate that we found ourselves in the shadow of the most sluggish and slow-growing economy in Europe.  Had we been able, by reasons of proximity and shared language, to make comparisons with some of the more dynamic economies our problem would have been greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> People all over the world have the expectations of rising standards of living. If there is rising production and productivity these expectations can be met without inflationary pressures arising.  If on the one side there are increased expectations, proper and valid in the context of the modern world, and on the other hand a stagnant economy or a slow-growing one, then there is basic disequilibrium between the expectations and the possibility of satisfying them.  This gives rise to inflationary pressures.  Therefore, the question of increasing production and productivity is a central one in the management of a potentially inflationary, or an actually inflationary, situation. It is in that context that one comes back to the question as to how, in the circumstances of Ireland, one should set about increasing production.</P>
    <P>The policy adopted by the Government which I discussed last night has been the policy of opening up the economy to foreign investment.  Of course, this is an effective mechanism for a certain time and in certain areas of the economy.  These foreign companies are only interested in very specific areas. In those areas we have seen productivity gains and production gains though at a cost in sovereignty and in the ownership of our resources and in the acceptance of very great dangers in times of recession which I consider too high and which I believe events will prove to be too high over the next year.</P>
    <P>This is not the whole economy.  There is a very significant service section, an indigenous section of industry and the whole of agriculture.  In all of these areas efforts to ensure steadily rising production and productivity have been very seriously inadequate.  The problem of alternatives which might improve that situation is not too difficult of solution.  We have the over-shadowing circumstances, to which I referred last night, of relative capital starvation in Ireland and of quite a drastic and continuing outflow of capital.  In the end productivity depends on a number of things and to a great extent on how much one can invest per man.  Where we have circumstances of unchecked capital outflow, as we have at present, <Col N="1619" /> and where we have circumstances of competition for available investment capital by foreign firms who are given conditions under which they do not have to bring their own investment capital with them but can raise it here, then agriculture, the service industries and indigenous industries are faced with capital starvation.</P>
    <P>They are faced with growing difficulties of re-investment, of moderisation and consequently with a continuous falling behind their competitors on the international scene, a continued diminution in profits and a vicious circle where the profits are low, capital scarce and the cost of borrowing high, and they cannot re-invest in a way which would increase their production and productivity.  It is a vicious circle which has existed in the Irish economy due to the fact that it was opened up to foreign investment in this uncontrolled way for a long time.</P>
    <P>One major check to inflation&mdash;be it a long-term one&mdash;must be the abandonment of the free opening of the economy to any other forces, or to any other economies or companies which choose to try to mop us up as a rather weak and semi-independent economy. We have to reverse the existing Government policy.  We have to build in a whole lot of protections if we are to get the capital accumulation and the investment here which is essential to raise the level of production all across the board.  I shall be referring later to this problem as it exists in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the current world inflationary situation which is a new one and which makes it particularly alarming.  In the past, there has been rapid inflation in certain economies and a relative price stability in others.  In the current situation, the islands of price stability in the economy of the western world have disappeared under the rising flood of price inflation.</P>
    <P>If one takes the period 1963-69 as a whole, our position in the league table of rate of inflation&mdash;a table which includes the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom as well as the major countries of the EEC&mdash;was third.  We were inflating over those seven years at <Col N="1620" /> the rate of 5 per cent per annum.  The rate, that time, in the United States was only 3 per cent per annum.  In some of the countries of the EEC the rate was &mdash;Belgium 3½ per cent; Germany, the greatest economy in the EEC, over the lengthy period of seven years, was inflating at a rate of only 2½ per cent per year.  That was the situation in the world at a time when we had a minor crisis in the 1966-67 period of the sort that is now on us in a much more general way to a much greater degree. We had a warning then at a time when the world scene was much more advantageous and propitions for us.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the situation in 1969&mdash; this is not an average for the seven years up to 1969; it is the figure for 1969 alone&mdash;we find that the most rapidly inflating country in that period of 1969 according to the table I have listed&mdash;including north American countries, the EEC countries, Japan, the United Kingdom and ourselves&mdash;was one inside the EEC, the Netherlands, at 7½ per cent.  We were second in the table last year at 7.3 per cent.  The relatively stable United States&mdash;stable over the seven years when they are averaged&mdash;inflated at 5½ per cent in 1969 and that inflation has grown more rapid in the United States.  In 1969, Germany was still holding quite extraordinarily steady at 2.7 per cent but that situation in Germany has come to a spectacular and sudden end.</P>
    <P>If we go on to the first half of 1970, we are again second in the league table&mdash;and this is a half-yearly period but it is an annual rate of inflation&mdash; 8.5 per cent for us which is, again, second in the league table of all of this group with the United States at 6.1 per cent.  Japan, which was rather stable, has gone up to 8 per cent&mdash; almost as high as ourselves.  Sweden has gone up to over 9 per cent.  Germany, which was previously so steady, has gone up to almost 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The point here is that the islands of stability are disappearing and we are faced with an intense inflationary situation all over the capitalist world. We are faced with the situation where major economic spokesmen of responsibility and senior position have talked about the possibilities in Britain either <Col N="1621" /> of devaluation or of such a serious deflation as would lead to massive unemployment there.  When we are faced with the Budget that we got last April and the subsidiary Budget that we have just now and when we are faced with the general recognition, not by economic experts who have access to the latest confidential information but by public and politicians at large, that there is an inflationary crunch all over the world, we must try to look at the strategy behind the Government's introduction of this Bill after the two Budgets which we have had this year.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a possible explanation that they have abandoned responsibility entirely and are leaving it to other people.  It is a continuing possible explanation that they are very foolish and very incompetent.  These are things that occur to one immediately.  But there is another possible explanation in that it is a deliberate strategy; that, just as in the Budget of April last, the Government had vested interest in inflation and indeed in pushing along that inflation by an increase in turnover tax, apparently on the grounds that there was inflation everywhere else also. Have they now a vested interest in creating a situation of anarchy in our industrial trade union relationships and in the whole business of bargaining about wages, all of collective bargaining and, indeed, all of the moderated tug-of-war that exists between capital and labour?  Are they concerned now to disrupt completely all the mechanisms so patiently and so lengthily evolved for moderating that tug-of-war between capital and labour?  Are they aiming to do this in order to validate their own legal imposition of a freeze on the basis of the anarchy that exists inside the labour movement?</P>
    <P>The introduction of a freeze of this sort has been shown all over the world to be incapable of ending what I called last night wage creep in particular industries where particular skills of a very special sort can be bid for in a quite informal and circuituous way so that it does not show up formally in the pay packet and so that it does not formally break the rules of a pay freeze.  You can pass on benefits in all <Col N="1622" /> sorts of ways, even by fiddling productivity agreements, on both the capital and labour sides agreeing that the productivity agreement would be fiddled so that the workers got more in their pay packets but once there was agreement from both sides about the fiddling of the productivity agreement then more money would show up without its being illegal under the terms of the Bill.  That mechanism of wage creep is, apparently, by any existing legislation that has been devised in any country invincible.</P>
    <P>You are therefore generating a situation where tiny numbers of workers in certain very key areas in a highly-integrated industry can exercise extraordinary leverage.  You thereby smash up the standing of trade union leadership and all the chains of delegation of authority that exist in the trade union movement, whereby leaders can negotiate and have the results of their negotiations accepted by the rank and file even if it is not all that the rank and file want.  In fact, the effects of this Bill on an already delicate situation are to break up the mechanisms of trust, of confidence, of established leadership which have been so slowly and so painfully evolved.  I will have to talk about this later when I come to look at the report of the NIEC.</P>
    <P>It may be that we are facing a strategy here involving the hope of seeing irresponsible actions on the part of sections of the trade unions.  These actions have been castigated in the Minister's speech although they have not occurred&mdash;there was the reference to a demand for a 50 per cent increase, a figment of the Minister's imagination. It may be the Minister has a vested interest in this happening.  He has said in effect: &ldquo;The only way you can do it is by law&rdquo;.  The unions have enough sense to regulate their internal arrangements, but it may be that after 13 months, when the intentions in this Bill are seen to have failed, immediately there will be an effort to extend the period of its operation.  Then the Minister will need to elaborate his case for so doing and, of course, he will want to be able to attribute the unworkability of the legislation to intransigence on the part of the labour element in the negotiating machinery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> Therefore, the Minister has a vested interest in the disruption of confidence and of trust.  This may be an unduly pessimistic and cynical interpretation. The Minister's action may be due to plain stupidity or plain incompetence or plain indifference, but it may be also that somebody is using his head inside the Fianna Fáil Cabinet in a scandalous and a disgraceful way which will compound gravely the nation's problems.</P>
    <P>I propose to talk at some length on the NIEC report about an incomes policy and about the necessary base lines in regard to this.  I propose to deal with the report's reference that this must be based on trust and confidence and on the possibility of negotiating in belief and trust in the other side's honour.  As I have said, we may be seeing a deliberate drive towards a situation of anarchy on the basis that the worse it gets for the country the better it gets for the people who want authoritarian solutions such as wage freezes imposed by law.</P>
    <P>If one reverts to the matter of gaining higher productivity, higher production, which would enable higher wages to be paid without inflationary trends, then one has to look at agriculture.  According to the NIEC, if we are discussing the matter of an incomes freeze we must not think in terms of a freeze in wages alone&mdash;what we are getting here is a wages freeze, not an incomes freeze &mdash;and we have to look at the agricultural sector as well.  Total incomes going to farmers are 15 per cent of the national total, not much less than the total from profits, rents, <i>et cetera</i>, going to self-employed people.  We have circumstances in which during a long period very large amounts of public money have been spent by way of agricultural supports, but at no stage has this expenditure been used to produce rationalisation of purchase.  I will come to the matter of real competition later and of rationalisation at the input stage, and the effect of these as an anti-inflationary measure.</P>
    <P>At no time has this enormous expenditure of public money by way of agricultural supports been used to produce rationalisation of purchase and, therefore, a more intensely competitive <Col N="1624" /> situation.  These enormous sums have not been used at the point of production. If you could get rationalisation at the point of production you could get higher output per man and therefore you could get a much better standard of living because more would be put out without a change in price. The only real base for a higher standard of living in the countryside is higher production.</P>
    <P>From another point of view, this immense expenditure could have been used in the area of marketing farmers' produce.  In relation to the producing of an efficient, financially competitive export situation, the way in which the Government have opted out of the food industry is scandalous.  We could have had production, exports, and consequently revenue, if our food industry had been rationalised as a result of leverage by a forward-looking Government. If we had such a situation, if we had a food industry which was efficient, highly productive, aggressive in the matter of market developments, we would be now in a vastly more advantageous general economic situation&mdash;we would be able to give more goods to purchasers of foodstuffs at the same price and we would have a higher standard of living among the farming community because we would have enabled them to lift themselves above the inevitable increase in the price of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>This is impossible at the moment because we cannot control the price of the farmers' inputs because so many of them come from outside the area of our economic jurisdiction.  This, during a protracted period, has resulted in a continuous draw on the people's resources in respect of a section of the community.  Therefore, this enormous expenditure by the State at a time when State expenditure in general is inflationary, gives further encouragement to the inflationary spiral.  This policy of the Government during the past 50 years&mdash;I am not confining my remarks to Fianna Fáil Governments&mdash;is a great source of our relative defencelessness now.  A vastly more rationalised agriculture would have been a great source of economic strength to us.</P>
    <P>Because of our failure to rationalise <Col N="1625" /> agriculture during half a century, what could have been done economically then may now have to be done in a ruthless way at a time when we might otherwise have an opportunity to cushion that section of the community against serious, sudden shocks.  Our attitude seems to be to look for short-term, instant measures to combat a chronic situation.  The present crisis arises from reasons outside our control but, of course, the response we got from the Government has been so ill-judged and so foolish and so inadequate as to make the problem much worse than it need have been.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the matter of what one does about a prices and incomes policy.  We had a document in April of this year from the NIEC.  If we are accused on our side of the House, in our party, of being intransigent on the matter of an incomes policy, we simply refer people to the NIEC report of April of this year, Report on Incomes and Prices Policy, which bears the signature of such people as Denis Larkin, an erstwhile Labour Deputy in this House and leader of the Workers Union of Ireland, an honoured and respected name in the annals of the Labour Party, and the trade union movement in Ireland&mdash;he could sign this without any feeling that there were improper things in it&mdash;Fintan Kennedy of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, Donal Nevin and other such people from the trade union side.</P>
    <P>There was no setting of the faces of the trade union side of the NIEC totally against such a policy.  Far from it.  They have been loud in their advocacy of the need for such a policy as long ago as what I believe was the 11th report.  In Document No. 11 on the economic situation in 1965, half a decade ago now, the trade union side recognised the need for an incomes policy and advocated that one should be established.  In the light of the NIEC report of April of this year, the action of the Government in introducing this Bill is to me all the more appalling as, indeed, was the action of the Government in introducing the Budget they introduced in the same month as this report appeared.</P>
    <P>On page 11 of that report&mdash;and it was an agreed report between the management <Col N="1626" /> side, the labour side and others who were on nobody's side&mdash; speaking from all points of view, quite unequivocally, in rather strong language, one would have thought for a semi-official body, they say:</P>
    <P>If the current rate of domestic inflation...is not curbed, it is our unanimous view that event the existing level of employment cannot be maintained and that it is utterly unrealistic for the Irish community to aspire towards full employment for its potential labour force.</P>
    <P>The reason for talking about the composition of the NIEC and for reading out that sentence is to hammer home the word &ldquo;unanimous&rdquo;.  That was a unanimous warning, a long time ago relatively speaking.  It was totally unheeded. They said:</P>
    <P>In addition, we will be faced with serious tension and unrest.</P>
    <P>That was a unanimous warning from both sides of our society of serious social tension and unrest.  What the Government now do, having ignored those warnings for half a year&mdash;a precious half-year which we will never be able to recover&mdash;is to take precisely the step in a statutory action which forces a freeze on a section of the community in an unbalanced way.  This brings nearer the day when the serious social tension and unrest about which they were warned will come to a head. That is why I ask whether there is, in fact, a vested interest in anarchy.  Is this a deliberate though scandalous manoeuvre to disrupt the whole of the social relationships which have evolved lengthily and with great difficulty?</P>
    <P>They also say:</P>
    <P>Inflation frequently brings unmerited gains to some individuals while bearing particularly heavily on those on fixed or low incomes.</P>
    <P>That is an obvious truism but it is nice to have it said unanimously at this time and the response is increased indirect taxation and increased turnover tax which bear most heavily on those who are already recognised as the ones who are losers in inflation anyway.</P>
    <P>These warnings were explicitly <Col N="1627" /> spelled out and it is very hard to understand why the Government ignored them.  A suggestion is made, which I think is unanswerably true, later on in the report on page 25 that if a successful incomes policy is to work there are certain requirements.  They say:</P>
    <P>The first requirement is the promotion of a general understanding of the national need for a closer and more orderly relationship between incomes and output.</P>
    <P>This is the first requirement&mdash;understanding. Socialists have always accepted the need for a more orderly relationship between incomes and output. It seems to me that <i>laissez faire</i> capitalism, the law of the market place, is the opposite to orderly.  Orderly relationship is order in social relationship, economic relationship and the substitution of a humane order in which human need is dominant to the law of the market place which is essentially anarchic.  I will not insult the jungle by calling it jungle law but it is a totally disorderly and anarchic way of running an economy.</P>
    <P>We have always accepted the need for a more orderly relationship between incomes and output.  Of course, we have to have the promotion of general understanding of that national need but what sort of sense does the speech on the April Budget make against that stated requirement for a general understanding of the national need?  What sort of sense does the Minister's speech, which I analysed yesterday when he was introducing this Bill, make in that context?  I am trying now, in face of what I believe to be a desperately serious situation, not to speak from the particular political and class point of view which I hold and from which I habitually think and act.</P>
    <P>The value of these NIEC recommendations is that they came from all across the board, from all sections of the community.  They said the first requirement was understanding of the national need.  In the face of that we have had lighthearted trampling by an incompetent Government on all informed economic opinion.  We have heard people from the responsible seat of a Minister in the National Parliament <Col N="1628" /> mocking economic experts, mocking experts of all kinds and mocking the possibility even of analysing an economy in a rational way, a sort of know nothing attitude.</P>
    <P>The NIEC report said:</P>
    <P>The second requirement is an explicit commitment by the Government, the Irish Employers' Confederation (IEC) and the ICTU to exercise their particular responsibilities fully towards creating the general understanding referred to above and the environment in which an incomes and prices policy, based on this understanding, would have reasonable prospects of success.</P>
    <P>First you have to have understanding and, secondly, you have to have a commitment to it by the participating parties.  Traditionally, of course, we have always seen crises of this sort solved at the expense of the weakest, the poorest and the most oppressed section of the community.  Those who provided the wealth to carry the rest of society on their backs, at the moment when their masters made messes of things, historically were required always to carry the can.  This is the tradition and the history that the trade union movement, the socialist movement, inherits.  This is what we have always known so it is particularly difficult for us to say to our members: &ldquo;This is a crisis; row in with everybody else&rdquo; because they have always seen that those who could escape the crunch did so and those who could not were left to carry the can&mdash;and they were always the working class.</P>
    <P>We have been trying to accept our responsibility.  We have been trying to declare our commitment to an orderly incomes policy.  We have been trying to urge on our members&mdash;they are, understandably, sceptical, cynical, distrustful, believing this is just a stunt to offload the crisis on to our backs&mdash;the need for participation, the need to run risks, the need to think as widely as possible of the total national responsibility. Then we get a piece of legislation introduced in a hurry, after what seems to me the cynical disruption of negotiating machinery, something which completely breaks up existing <Col N="1629" /> structures of negotiation, which undermines the position of leadership on the trade union side and which, whether through stupidity or incompetence or villainy, has a vested interest in creating anarchy in the organisation of the working class, in the activities of wage negotiations and in the whole matter of collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>This is the commitment.  When the Government say &ldquo;We do not propose to control profits because we do not think it is possible.  Maybe we will control dividends, but you can retain the profits and pay them next year or get your money by an appreciation in the value of your shares&rdquo; it is easy for employers to say: &ldquo;This is fine; we approve of the idea.&rdquo;  It is much more difficult for us.  We are taking the risk. The Government, who of all three participants have the greatest responsibility in this, set about disrupting the possibility of a freely negotiated incomes policy.  Therefore, while we will urge on the labour movement, on the trade union movement, restraint, commitment to the solution of problems in a national way, care at all times for the weakest sections of the community, for the pensioners, for the unorganised workers, for the unskilled, we would be leading people against their own interests if we said to them &ldquo;You must carry the can.  This is a mess you did not make, but you must solve it.&rdquo;  We would be betraying any trust they might have in us if we acted in this way.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to expect from the other two participants in what must be a three-sided discussion&mdash;from the employers' side and from the Government side&mdash;at least as much responsibility, at least as much commitment to the national weal as distinct from sectional welfare.  We have not got that. We have not got it from the Government. We have got the opposite.  We have got the pushing away of the possibility of a negotiated and accepted incomes policy.  We will not have any other sort.  We will not have an imposed incomes policy.  If the Government want a confrontation and want to try out who is the stronger in that sort of confrontation, then we will not shirk it.  We will not seek it; we do not <Col N="1630" /> seek it; we think it is a mistake, but we could not lead our membership, those who support us, those who look to us, to refuse such a confrontation if the Government insisted on it.  We prefer negotiation.  We believe in negotiation. We do not believe in the big stick of a statutory wage freeze.  We do not seek a head-on collision but neither can we tell our side, if that head-on collision is generated by others, that they must submit, that they must acquiesce, that they must run away.  That we will not ever do. It is well that the Government should be clear about that.</P>
    <P>The NIEC goes on to discuss an independent prices and incomes board, to discuss its functions, to discuss the requirements that would have to exist if it were to do its job effectively.  I argued last night, and I do not propose to repeat myself, that the setting-up of an independent prices and incomes board which really worked was very difficult.  I do not say impossible.  I do not know whether it is impossible or just very difficult.  I am prepared at this stage to keep an open mind.  It may be one; it may be the other.  What we can be sure about is that it is not easy. Efforts have been made all over the world to do this and it has always proved to be very difficult.  It will have to have sources of information and sources of power, real teeth, vastly more than anything proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are asked to accept a freeze on wages on the condition that all other incomes&mdash;prices, profits, professional fees&mdash;would be frozen too.  We have made the point that it is very easy to freeze certain sorts of wages, much more difficult to freeze other sorts, more difficult still to freeze prices, nigh on impossible to freeze professional fees and, as our society is currently structured, totally impossible to freeze profits.  There is an ascending order of difficulty from the freeze which bears on the section of the community which we represent to the freeze which bears on the section of the community which the Minister for Finance represents.  I am here making a distinction between those who vote for him, in my view misguidedly, and those whom he <Col N="1631" /> actually represents, whose interests he represents, because he is in this Bill&mdash; as indeed in all the other activities of his that I have seen during my period in this House&mdash;acting in the interests of the biggest money, of the biggest economic power, the foreign economic power which dominates this country.  That is the section in whose interest he is objectively acting, regardless of the republican, patriotic noises with which he chooses to cloak his actions.  I am quoting again not a partisan opinion, not a Labour opinion, but the unanimous NIEC opinion about an independent prices and incomes board. It says:</P>
    <P>there would have to be sufficient information available about all significant price or income developments;</P>
    <P>This means a level of divulging of information greater than anything that currently exists and difficult to structure quickly&mdash;not impossible&mdash;but we are talking about structuring it in reference to a Bill which the Government hopes will come into operation immediately and will last only 13 months anyway.  We are asked to believe that this mechanism can be structured as quickly as that to work equitably so that people from different sides, different interests, could have confidence in it.  The report says:</P>
    <P>the staff of the board would have to be sufficient in number and expertise to enable it to report on most cases in not more than three months;</P>
    <P>This is a high-minded aspiration.  They are talking in terms of three months. The reality would be at least half a year.  There is no possibility of this mechanism being got off the ground and being effective, even with the best will in the world, even believing in its possibilities of which I am sceptical, there is no possibility of its being got off the ground at the sort of speed that would be needed for it to be effective. However, the freeze in wages would be effective the moment the Bill became law.  To a considerable extent it is effective already.  How then can we believe the suggestions that efforts at controlling prices are real and will compensate us if we accept the control of wages when there is no mechanism here envisaged by which it can be <Col N="1632" /> made to work on a time scale that would be of any value?  This is why it is depressing trying to enter into any sort of negotiations with the Government. This is why it is discouraging to urge voluntary mechanisms on the section of the community for which we speak because we simply cannot trust the Government in this or in other matters.</P>
    <P>We have all grown so wearily accustomed to lengthy, concentrated, deliberate and specific lies about almost everything that when they make promises and utter thoughts of this sort, we do not believe them.  It is one of the very serious elements in the situation that has not always obtained.  In the past they were trustworthy enough for it to be at least possible to enter negotiations in the hope that one would not be betrayed when one tried to persuade his supporters to accept the result of such negotiations.  However, we now have an utterly depressing situation.  We do not know but that we will be betrayed at any moment because all the signs are there.  There is a vast conflict between party interest and national interest and the determination is to solve that conflict on the basis of party interest.  Such a conflict does not always have to exist but it exists now in the ranks of the Government.</P>
    <P>Therefore, anybody coming to the negotiating table on an issue of this kind is put in a very difficult position. He is left with the question of whether there might be a trick or a stunt or whether there will be some betrayal. As the question of confidence is extraordinarily important in the control of inflation, it is equally as important in any sort of set-up of a voluntary incomes policy but at the moment confidence at the simple level of believing what is said is non-existent.  This is a very depressing situation.  It is depressing to have to express oneself in these crude terms in the national Parliament but such is the situation.  We do not know whom to believe.  It is not a matter of believing one or the other. There is the suspicion that we cannot believe any of them about anything. There is no limit to what they will say in defence of their own interests; there <Col N="1633" /> is no limit to the extent to which they would depart from the truth at this time in the defence of their own interests.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to my observations on the NIEC report I turn to the conclusions of those who compiled that report.  Those people were from the business side, from official circles and from the trade union side.  In relation to the institutional arrangements for the solving of the problem of inflation, they say and I quote from page 46 of the report:</P>
    <P>The inescapable requirement for their success is the application of the fiscal and monetary measures which can more effectively contain inflation in the short and medium run.</P>
    <P>There is no use talking about measures of income control.  These people say unanimously that there must also be fiscal and monetary measures to control inflation in the short and medium run. Yet, what has been done is the direct opposite&mdash;a Budget has been introduced and this Budget increases inflation. Further on in the report it is said:</P>
    <P>...success of the new arrangements requires an explicit recognition of the need for an incomes and prices policy by Government, the IEC and the ICTU....</P>
    <P>This commitment, they say, is crucial. We are now pilloried as the people who are being difficult and intransigent but we have seen the Government indicate that they want us to commit ourselves to such a policy while they are not prepared to commit themselves to it.  In this instance there are three sides to a bargain.  Of course, the IEC would accept it and with great difficulties and reservations we may accept it but the condition of our acceptance would be some sort of responsible action from the Government side.  In a Bill which, by law, beats us over the head because we do not accept the situation of a kick in the face and a fair fight afterwards, there must be Government commitment and the Government, as usual, are facing in two directions and speaking with two voices.</P>
    <P>In relation to the control of prices I shall be interested to hear from the Minister whether any promises have <Col N="1634" /> been made to some of the large foreign companies who have set up factories here&mdash;companies who come from societies in which profit is their god and who are traditionally hostile both to the trade union movement and to the ideas of price control.  It seems to me to be likely that some large American companies that have now set up here would have sought promises to the effect that no efforts would be made by the Government to fix their prices.  It is not impossible that the Government would have given such promises, so anxious are they to sell Irish assets.  It might have been a condition that a large American company said &ldquo;We will not come in until you promise us that we will not be subjected to price control&rdquo;.  Have any such promises been given?  What we are seeing in regard to price fixing is the sort of advantage being given to the foreign companies in the way I am about to explain.</P>
    <P>If a price is fixed for a product made by a number of manufacturers, some of whom are large and highly capitalised and some of whom are small, indigenous and under-capitalised, and if both sell the product at the same price the rate of profit will be very different for the two undertakings.  It will be much less for the small, indigenous company.  When a price is fixed, a big international company with great financial resources can soak up the diminution in its profit margins since their profits were already high. Further, they have the financial strength to withstand the period when no profit whatsoever is made whereas the indigenous company will pass much more quickly into a position of loss at a fixed price because their profit was much smaller originally and also because they have not the deep financial resources on which to draw during a period of low-rate profit.  The net outcome of such price fixing where competition exists between foreign and indigenous firms is to strengthen the domination of the foreign firms and to enable them to bankrupt their Irish competitors or to buy them up.  I trust we shall hear from the Minister whether any promises have been made in regard to price control at times <Col N="1635" /> when we were endeavouring to tempt foreign firms to come here.  Such firms may have made such promises a condition of their investment.  It is fair that we should know about this.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a situation where we are urged to pass on to the labour and trade union movement the Government's exhortation in regard to the ready acceptance of a wage freeze.  We have indicated that we can visualise conditions in which we would be quite happy to pass on this exhortation, to endorse it with whatever authority and respect we may possess.  However, it is worth spending a little time, if we are seeking voluntary solutions, considering the state of mind of people who come from a long line of wage earners.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that people in the Government benches, although they have their tamed trade unionists, and the people who frame Bills on the Government side often forget what it feels like to be a wage earner.  I say this as somebody who, to an extent, is on the outside looking in but who is continually trying to make the effort of understanding and appreciating a point of view.  There are people who remember the terrible exploitation, degradation and lack of security of the distant and recent past.  It is easy to feel secure as the result of a long period of security but it is very hard to persuade people who have the opposite history that they should accept promises from people who will not have to face the hardships themselves if things go wrong.</P>
    <P>We are told we must concern ourselves with the interest of the whole community.  We accept this.  But it is necessary to understand the psychology of people who, historically speaking in the trade union movement, only got what they struggled for.  They were not given higher wages because they needed them.  They were not even given the right to organise trade unions because they needed that as a necessary adjunct to human dignity.  They had to fight for the right to organise.  They had to fight for the right to decent wages and decent conditions, in so far <Col N="1636" /> as those things now exist.  In fact, they got nothing without a struggle.</P>
    <P>This is the history of the labour movement all over the world.  Once they have obtained those rights the sociologists are prepared to write books saying they were entitled to them all along; and the employers are entitled, as they do, to claim credit for what they present as concessions but which were wrung from them with great difficulty. Once the workers have won those rights everybody admits they are correct.  Nobody admits they are correct beforehand and nobody gives them those rights without a struggle. Therefore, if there is ever to be in this country&mdash;I am willing to take the risk of saying I hope there will be&mdash;a rational incomes policy, it has to be based on understanding of the point of view of people who have been betrayed over and over again through the whole history of the trade union and labour movement, who have been expected over and over again to clear up the mess other people made, who have been expected, poor though they were, to endure cuts in their standard of living, while those who were already very well off did not have to suffer any cut.</P>
    <P>This is the background which must be understood if anybody is talking about a voluntary incomes policy&mdash; even if we concede the possibility that such a policy may work.  Therefore, anything which heightens the sense of distrust on the part of the Labour movement is counter productive if you are trying to get the Labour movement to participate in a voluntary agreement about incomes.</P>
    <P>We have seen every Government action&mdash;it has been certainly so in my period in the Dáil, when I have been in a position to look closely at things, but also for a very much longer time&mdash; sowing distrust, fostering the conviction that, from the point of view of the trade union movement, you only got what you fought for and nobody gave you anything.  It will take a great deal of promise keeping to remove that distrust, if it can ever be removed.</P>
    <P>This is why it is so depressing to have listened to a debate on this subject. We are all agreed it is serious, <Col N="1637" /> but because it is so we have to stop making trivial debating points and obscuring serious issues.  The more serious it is the more it is incumbent on this House to debate it.  This is where the fundamental hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party emerges, as it emerges over and over again in everything. I do not think it is a fundamental hypocrisy which arises just from human wickedness.  I do not think that the members of that party are essentially more wicked than anybody else.  They certainly do not believe themselves to be so.  They certainly retain their own good impression of themselves and their own good opinion of themselves.  However, with the evolution of the years, with the evolution of the party and with the extraordinary highly developed uncritical attachment to the party they find themselves manoeuvred unintentionally into positions which are hypocritical.  That is the way it ends up.</P>
    <P>The basis of that hypocrisy which makes the Fianna Fáil Party try to reduce political debate to political abuse is that the party have changed fundamentally, but they have got to deny this in order to retain electoral support. This is the basis, much more than the north of Ireland or things like that, of the fundamental hypocrisy which strives to make what ought to be a debate on principles between right and left as to how national problems can be solved into the sort of deliberately muddied political abuse which strives to obscure the real issues.</P>
    <P>This is the reason why it is so difficult in Ireland to have a serious debate about anything.  The Fianna Fáil Party have changed from one which at its inception expressed the interests of the workers and the small farmers to one which now expresses the interests of the biggest of big business&mdash;most of which is foreign based&mdash;but in order to keep electoral support it is necessary to go on speaking with many voices at the same time.  There is the voice of the Fianna Fáil trade unionist.  This is the voice of those branches of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union which are predominantly Fianna Fáil. We all know the ringing tones of the Fianna Fáil trade unionist in his concern <Col N="1638" /> with the trade union movement and with working class issues.  There is the voice of the Fianna Fáil small farmer at the same time that we can have uncritical endorsement of Mansholt without even explaining what Mansholt means.  There is the voice of the Fianna Fáil small shopkeeper at the same time as big international supermarkets who are rapidly cutting his throat are being welcomed.  There is the voice, the real voice of the Fianna Fáil banker, the Fianna Fáil globe trotters who peddle the assets of Ireland to Japanese and Americans or anybody else as a place where there is cheap labour and a tax holiday.</P>
    <P>All of those are different voices, and they are incompatible voices.  When all these voices are used simultaneously they must obscure real divisions, and each in the end must be hypocritical. That is why in dealing with legislation of this sort it is very difficult to get a frank exposition from a Minister or from the Government of the real political issues and the proper method of solving the problems at hand.</P>
    <P>It may be in the future that there will be a coalition government in Ireland, but it will explicitly be, publicly, overtly a coalition of different parties with different outlooks retaining their differences and agreeing about certain limited, overlapping areas.  That is something you can honourably do. When you have a coalition of a whole series of interests which denies that any coalition exist and which pretends to be completely unified then you get hypocrisy.  What we have is a coalition not just of two sorts of republicans, both of which from my point of view are pseudo republicans but of people who speak at the same time for Irish workers and foreign bankers. Inevitably you end in the sort of moral filth which produces not only the trooping up those steps of some gentlemen who had some critical things to say about the Government a few days before but also the pretence that legislation like this should be accepted by the trade union movement as being in their interest because really Fianna Fáil speaks for everybody.</P>
    <P>You get that sort of lying and then you get the necessity to debase the <Col N="1639" /> argument from what it ought to be about.  What the argument ought to be about is: how do you solve an inflationary crisis?  Or to put it another way: for whom do you solve it? Because you cannot solve an inflationary crisis for everybody.  You can do it at the expense of the working class movement.  You can do it at the expense of some section of the community, but somebody has to carry the can or else the burden has to be spread.  The pretence here is that it is being spread when, in fact, it is being offloaded on to the working class and on to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>That is why we get this level of debate that is represented by the interjections of Deputy Joseph Lenehan, this negation of debate, this negation of argument, when we would wish seriously to be debating from different social, political and economic outlooks, the ways in which the nation's economy might be protected and the ways in which people might be advanced to a higher standard of living, culture and education.</P>
    <P>Right through all the Fianna Fáil contributions to this Bill, starting with the Minister's speech&mdash;which I analysed yesterday and to which I do not propose to revert now&mdash;this basic hypocrisy has existed, this facing two directions by this party that is all things to all men, which has now reduced us nationally to this terrifying sense of insecurity.  As I said yesterday, one of the constituents in inflation is a sense of insecurity, a lack of confidence in any reasonable stability.  Then you say, if you are an individual consumer: &ldquo;Let us spend now, because goodness knows what the situation will be in a year&rdquo;, or, if you are an industrialist: &ldquo;Let us invest now because goodness knows what the prices will be in a year&rdquo;.  This sense of national shame we now have is a profound contribution to inflation and makes it specially difficult to solve.</P>
    <P>In working any system of prices and incomes restraint it is necessary to have a modernisation of the trade union movement.  I think everybody on our side of the House recognises that something which grew up in a scattered way <Col N="1640" /> at a number of points in the course of a very sharp struggle needs modernisation, needs rationalisation, very often needs amalgamation.  The places in the world where the trade union movement best defends the interests of its members are precisely the places where old conflicts have been eliminated, where old differences between craft unions and general unions have become less and less important.  It is obviously in the interests of everybody in our society to minimise the disruptive tendencies which perpetuate old divisions. It is obvious we need in the trade union movement, not just for the sake of the trade union movement but for the sake of the whole nation, to have this modernisation, to speak with one voice.</P>
    <P>If such legislation as this is enacted &mdash;and by means of the rubber stamp it will be enacted&mdash;it is giving a mandate to any militant on any shop floor on any day to disregard the discipline of the whole working-class movement and to overturn the existing structure.  That is the opposite to the achievement of the harmonious trade union interrelationships and the progressive trade union reform which everybody agrees are necessary.</P>
    <P>NIEC made reference to the need to have a prices and incomes board with personnel of high calibre.  It is a very difficult and a delicate task.  Over and over again we have seen the sordid spectacle at times of difficulty&mdash;and this is certainly a time of difficulty&mdash; when Fianna Fáil Governments have preferred the reliable hack to the independent person of high ability.  I had bitter personal experience of this when I worked with the television authority and I have seen it over and over again.</P>
    <P>This is a time of crisis.  There are people in the State with a sense of independence and justice, and the basic intelligence, as well as professional training, which might make them capable of serving effectively if they were given a chance to do so.  All our experience induces us to think that at moments like this the persons chosen will be the reliable hacks who, when there is a conflict between party and national interests, will side with the party.  This is another aspect of the <Col N="1641" /> crisis of confidence, the crisis of trust, and at a more fundamental level the crisis of honesty in Irish public life which has coincided with an economic crisis.</P>
    <P>We are told that the virtue of loyalty to a party is a very important one.  As a member of the Labour Party, a working class movement, I accept the importance of loyalty.  Surely the loyalty must be to principles before it is to organisations?  Surely we admit that a time can come when organisations, and I am not specifically referring to the Fianna Fáil Party, may betray their principles or change?  Surely we do not deny the possibility that a conflict can exist between organisations and principles? Surely we have the duty either in public life or private life to give our own verdict by our actions against the organisation, however precious and however much it is involved with our lives, for those principles?</P>
    <P>The situation exists now where, not in the eyes of the Government but in the eyes of almost everybody else in the country, a conflict does exist between national interests and party interests. What is curious and depressing is that at all times loyalty to an organisation has been able to override loyalty to principles.  This is very depressing for the whole future of this country as a separate, valid, independent entity having any belief in its own future.</P>
    <P>Every specialist on inflation agrees that free competition is vastly important in regulating prices downwards in the interests of the consumer.  We need to examine this if we are to try to answer the questions put to us by the Government about what we would do. One answer would be to look at the matter of competition and monopoly inside our society.  Ours is a small economy and a vast amount of the things purchased by consumers are supplied by small local subsidiaries of large supra-national companies.  I was criticised for using the word &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; during my speech last night but one would have to think of a paraphrase in reference to the fact that we are after all a very small and open economy, on the edge of huge industrial powers.  That is what I mean by &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the significance of competition in combating inflation if the Government were seriously concerned with spreading the burden of combating inflation through the whole community.  There are many areas representing a very significant section of total expenditure on goods and services where competition is very weak indeed.  Many of these markets <Col N="1643" /> are dominated by a small number of supra-national companies which have a long experience of price fixing among themselves and consequently no real price competition exists.</P>
      <P>In Scandinavia an attempt was made to break the fixing of the price of petrol, oil, fuel oil and all other oil products by a small number of international clients who have a long tradition all over the world of doing this and who have been fought without any great success by the anti-trust laws in the United States.  The experience in Scandinavia was that the price fixing arrangements between oil suppliers could be broken and the price of these products dramatically reduced by the existence of a co-operative which imported and distributed oil and petrol direct from the ships to the retail petrol pump outlets.  Such is the subservience of our &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; Government to the largest international companies that they have made no effort of a serious nature to prevent price fixing and market rigging, no effort to prevent the extraction of the higher than normal profit from a small manageable market.  Again, the question of monopoly is something that the NIEC referred to, the question of the sharing out of the market.  I think there are circumstances where subsidies are used to keep prices down while the primary suppliers have agreements that the total price should be kept above the level at which natural competition would put it.  Not alone is the Irish people's money going into the pockets of the price fixers but the State's money is also going there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A real uncovering of price fixing would involve the Government taking power to investigate the real balance sheets of very powerful companies which in the past they have shown no disposition to antagonise.  There would be a great gain to be made in the battle to hold down the cost of living and against inflation and for the protection of Irish consumers were there a serious Government policy against price rigging, against monopolies, against sharing of what is, by the standard of many of these companies, a tiny and easily managed market.  We wait for <Col N="1644" /> the Government to show signs of using the legislative power they possess and have long possessed against these people before we will believe they have any intention of taking new powers or every moving seriously against such people.  Frankly, I do not believe they will move against them.  I do not believe they are able to do so because they are beholden to these large, international companies and are in their pockets to a great extent.  Because they are in pawn and have sold so much of our economy, they are unable to fight against the inflationary activities of price rings and monopolies.</P>
    <P>These are an obvious source all over the world of increased prices.  Even a country like the US has elaborate mechanisms to combat them.  Such mechanisms were called for by all sections of the NIEC.  There is no disposition on the part of our Government to take any action because there is no wish to do so.  I was amazed to hear the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in Ballyragget the other night in response to an argument from the floor arguing against the domination of our industrial employment by foreign companies, say that he did not really care who provided the jobs as long as they were provided: it did not matter who provided them.  This is a republican in the Republican Party. It matters, not as an abstract matter of principle that Irish people should own the assets of Ireland as far as possible: it matters in a practical way if you have to struggle against price fixing and inflation because if you do not control your own assets and control the companies that run the commanding heights of your economy, you have no power to move against them.  You have lost your sovereignty, lost the power of decision and the power to govern.  You have lost the power to protect your population against inflation and all that remains is the myth and the sham of independence and the hypocrisy of invoking the name of republican for actions which are the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>If you have an open economy you may get jobs at a time of boom.  We have got jobs in the past 12 years at a time of boom but with an open <Col N="1645" /> economy you lose the power to control, the power to protect employment at a time of slump.  You lose the power to control the big companies and financial institutions and the price of capital. You lose the power to govern.  Essentially, the inability of our Government to control an inflation which, year in year out, since the early sixties has been faster than that of any of our competitors, is due to our loss of sovereignty because of industrialising by the sale of Ireland's assets.  That is why there is no power to move against financial institutions or big companies, price fixing or the flight of capital.</P>
    <P>I made a comparison before about heating the house by burning the furniture and I said you could get a blaze of industrial development by flogging your assets but once flogged you then have no heat and no furniture.  If you flog your assets to anybody who will develop them you lose the power to regulate your own affairs and financial business.  We have totally refused at the behest of bankers, in the life of this State, to set up a real independent currency and exchange control, to establish a grip by the people and the State on our own financial institutions. I have no objection to the writing on an Irish pound note being in Irish.  I rather favour it, but when that Irish pound note is, in fact, £1 sterling it is hypocrisy.  If it were an Irish pound it would be great in my view but as it is, it is a green lie because it is part of sterling with no exchange control.</P>
    <P>How do you protect yourself against the export of inflation by the British, the Americans or anybody else in a tiny economy if you will not set up a financial republic as well as a parliamentary one, if you will not establish financial independence?  What was the objection? If you listened to the people, they wanted it but the bankers did not and the bankers won.  The banks are owned outside the country, anyway, if you analyse the shareholding.  There is the dilemma: an open economy will give you jobs up to a certain level of industry. It will not give you research and development so that it will not employ Irish scientists on that.  The research and development is done elsewhere.  If an Irish trained scientist wants to <Col N="1646" /> emigrate he can work on research and development in the big companies elsewhere. There is a limit, of course, to how high you can go in the management pyramid in these foreign companies; because the top of the pyramid is retained for nationals of the country of that company.  Of course, we can have jobs of the traditional Irish sort, unskilled and semi-skilled, and instead of having to emigrate we can sell our unskilled and semi-skilled labour in Ireland, and that is progress.  Of course, it is progress at a desperate price, a price that leaves us defenceless in the face of the sort of crisis we have been analysing.  It is a defencelessness which makes the puny, trivial and disruptive measures suggested in this Bill utterly irrelevant and ridiculous in the face of the situation that republicans have engendered consciously and with open eyes.</P>
    <P>On the one hand I think everybody agrees that we need a levelling of incomes in our society.  A Danish reformer in the last century said that the ideal was a society in which nobody was too rich and nobody too poor. This, I think, is widely accepted now. Fifty years ago one had to be a socialist to accept this, but now everybody accepts the desirability of the levelling out of incomes.  That is now respectable.  In the past it was regarded as impossible.  It is desirable that there should be equality of opportunity and of incomes.  Despite that, we have this legislation giving the green light to tiny handfuls inside industry to exert the special leverage their special position gives them.  We admit the danger of this happening.  We are prepared to instance certain cases in which special influence has been used to the great advantage of a tiny section and to the detriment of poorer, weaker, unorganised groups.  Undesirable, retrogressive, generally condemned, but a risk because of the integration of modern industry and something that sensible legislation surely avoids.</P>
    <P>We have this piece of legislation which says to trade union leadership: &ldquo;No progress.  Not even worth your members' while coming to ask to negotiate&rdquo;, but the green light is given to tiny groups to act in a retrogressive <Col N="1647" /> way.  Yet, we are asked to regard this as serious, progressive legislation.  At a time when national production is not rising one can validly point out that the national cake is only so big and until it starts growing, because it is not a static thing, nobody can have any more.  That may be true from one point of view, but it is not true from our point of view because, even if the national cake is static, we believe in redistribution; we believe in a bigger share for those who generate the wealth and a smaller share for those who are non-productive.  Even if production is static it will start to rise again, perhaps slowly, but it will rise and one can have long-term objectives for an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>One can have an incomes policy for the partitioning of the total wealth according to the percentages presently obtained.  There will be a bigger cake so there will be a bigger bit, but proportionately the same amount for each section of the community.  Clearly that is the sort of incomes policy the Government want.  It is the sort of incomes policy industry wants.  It is not the sort of incomes policy we want.  We do not accept that the workers' share of the national cake must remain the size it is now.  We do not accept the freezing of the present <i>status quo</i>.  We do not look on the policy of incomes regulation in an orderly way as simply avoiding tumult, conflict and harsh confrontation.  We look on it as a mechanism for the orderly re-distribution of wealth, the orderly equalisation of opportunity.  It may as well be spelt out if we accept the principle of trying by discussion to work out such a policy.  We may as well express our long term objective clearly.  We believe in social mechanisms being orderly as far as possible.  We believe in the avoidance of bitter confrontation with all the hatred and disruption engendered by such confrontation, but we do not believe in the freezing of the <i>status quo</i>.  We do not believe in any pseudo-divine ordinance which says the share of profits is 20 per cent and the share of wages is 60 per cent and so it must remain forever.  We do not accept that.  If we did accept it we <Col N="1648" /> would betray the trust reposed in us. The basic idea of an incomes policy is concerned with social order.  It is not concerned with the freezing of the situation in which industry clearly wants to freeze and, apparently, the Government also want a freeze policy.  That is not the sort of bargaining we are prepared to entertain.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with a general assessment of the Government's role in protecting our economy and controlling inflation, with some thoughts about what may be done in the coming months.  I recall the doggerel of my childhood:</P>
    <P>If all the good people were clever, And all clever people were good,</P>
    <P>The world would be nicer than ever We thought that it possibly could.</P>
    <P>We have been led to believe in recent years that, in politics, one does not have to be good provided one is clever. We were offered cleverness from the ranks of the Government.  We were told there might be shrewd operators and crooks and people who manipulated elections, but they were at least able. The situation now is that goodness was never there and the cleverness has departed.  The Government are neither clever nor good.  Someone said the other day that if anyone had bet him 12 months ago that Messrs.  X, Y and Z would be Cabinet Ministers in 12 months time he would not have taken the bet.  He could not believe that in any modern democracy such men would come within an ass's roar of being Cabinet Ministers, so utterly unfitted obviously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill may hold things up for 13 months but fundamentally it will change nothing.  It may hold up a whole series of activities with regard to fiscal policy, monopolies and price control.  The crucial issue now is the question of credibility and confidence because you cannot manage something as delicate as an economy unless there is trust and confidence, but particularly trust in the ability of the Government.  This is why the current situation is so desperately serious. This is why whoever inherits government in the near future will inherit an appalling mess.  It will be no prize for anybody.</P>
      <P>The Government are responsible for this mess and they have rejected advice from all quarters.  They display the feebleness in their on-again, off-again attitude to price control and have denied the existence of a crisis, with the result that confidence has diminished. Having done all that we have the prospect that, in failing to see the danger signals and thereby getting further into chaos, the Government will run away.</P>
      <P>I said yesterday, in disagreement with many critics of the Government, that they did not create this mess; inflation exists throughout the western world.  However, when faced with such a situation one can either take serious protective measures to diminish the impact of inflation or behave as the Government have done and exacerbate the situation.  If the Government run away it will be difficult for someone else to solve the problem, but life and the Government goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an irrelevant and worthless <Col N="1650" /> Bill because it cannot operate fairly. It will be in operation for a short period and it will generate disruption and anarchy in the organisations and structures needed to participate in the formulation of an incomes policy later on. It is a trivial and ridiculous Bill having regard to the problems with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>The problem will remain and will be difficult to solve because of actions that were taken over a long period of time.  The foreign crises are compounding the difficulties we have been generating ourselves in the last 12 years through the Lemass policy of industrialisation. I might add that we have not helped our situation by concluding the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>One point is certain: the problem can only be solved voluntarily.  Nowadays it is not possible to solve such a problem by legislation; this can only be done with the goodwill and participation of the three sections who must come together and agree&mdash;industry, Government and trade union workers. It will be a lengthy and difficult process but it will be necessary.  Although I know this legislation will be passed and I have indicated why I think it is counter-productive, I shall finish this debate with a single plea to the Government. Henceforth, they should try to create a climate so that if the trade unions start negotiations on an incomes policy they can have some confidence in the truth, credibility and the honourable intentions of the Government.  The great difficulty in solving the problem in a rational and humane way is the fact that such faith does not exist.  We cannot make progress by legislation or by using the big stick; it can only be achieved by the voluntary participation of all interested sections.  It will not be quick or easy but we must have an atmosphere in which we can trust each other sufficiently to enter into meaningful negotiations.  We are far from that and, regrettably, this Bill does nothing to help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House for long but I consider I should make some comments on the legislation before us.  We <Col N="1651" /> are all aware that a trend was started following what was called the inflationary settlement in the maintenance dispute some time ago.  A danger was created to the system everyone in this party wished to see preserved&mdash;the system of free collective bargaining. From that time onwards, the Government issued warnings, they set up machinery to try to bring about some rationalisation and responsibility in certain sectors of the trade union movement. This was done for the protection of jobs and in order to control spiralling prices.  As a result of wage trends since then my information is that this year our gross national product will be half the average amount in the last decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase will only be half?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the increase will be half of what has been the average amount in the last few years.  The first settlement to which I referred and the pattern of settlements that followed means that there are less people at work today than would otherwise have been the case.  Our balance of payments has been upset, prices have spiralled and existing jobs are at risk. Some jobs already have gone but there may have been other reasons for this. When it became apparent&mdash;I read a report in the newspapers even if Deputy Keating did not&mdash;that claims were being formulated, and when it was obvious that the pattern set two years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was apparent to everybody outside this House what was taking place.  I believe the time had come for the Government to shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Stop before you destroy not only yourselves, but those of your brothers who are around you.&rdquo; Irresponsible action on behalf of a few&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;few&rdquo; carefully&mdash;would result not only in soaring prices and lesser money values, but in emigration, the dole and the destruction of what we now call the planned economy.  This is something that I think we cannot allow to be destroyed because since the introduction of the planned economy this country has made great progress.  One of our great problems is that the trade union movement in recent years lost one of its greatest leaders, the late Deputy Jim Larkin.  Others have tried to step into his shoes but it would appear that those shoes were just too big.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil first talked about a planned economy and outlined proposals for it when in opposition, they had a policy document which contributed in no small way to the success in the election of 1957.  The late Deputy Larkin said that he thought that the Labour Party should be engaged on similar planning and the preparation of documents of that nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has worn that one out.  I am talking about the planned economy.  It has been put into practice and used.  I am talking about how responsible trade union leadership reacted to it when it was first put into action.  These proposals, made prior to the 1957 election, led to the first programme of economic development. When the Government adopted that first programme Ireland lifted herself off her knees.  Up to then, the average growth of the GNP was in the region of 1 per cent.  We used to be pleased to report an increase of 1 per cent.  As a result of that first programme we achieved a rate of progress comparable with any other country in the world with the exception of countries like Germany and Japan.  Each time we fell short of the national target&mdash;and I do not think the fault could be found in the fiscal or monetary policies which were being adopted by the country at the time&mdash;the question was asked &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;  We have heard various versions of what has gone wrong.  I must admit, as the last speaker pointed out, that there has been external inflationary pressure. That is making a contribution.  Price control legislation may have needed to be tightened up.  We have asked the public in general to make a bigger share of the national cake available to the old, the infirm and the underprivileged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main contribution was the selfishness of the few I mentioned before.  They are few in relation to our population, but they are strong in taking action, the results of which they had not thought out to their conclusion. Had their leaders acted in a responsible way, and not been weak, and explained economic consequences to their followers if they had persisted in their demands, it would have been better.  The congress of trade unions seems to have no power to enforce its authority on the individual unions. There are branch secretaries and executive members who lack the moral ability of honesty of purpose to explain the facts of life to the individual union members.  Perhaps their only concern is to attract new members to their ranks from other unions which, by right, they should be assisting. <Col N="1654" /> Instead of assisting and having the trade union men standing in solidarity we have various unions in competition with each other.</P>
    <P>Like many members of the political labour party I was not presented with my trade union badge because I read a little blue book and saw a chance of becoming a member of this House.  I started to earn my badge at 10s per week behind the counter of my grandfather's shop in Capel Street.  If I were a member of the ITGWU I would feel my status as a trade unionist was degraded if my union opened a section for T.D. intellectuals, so called!</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We can see now what has happened.  We can look at the building industry.  If we have a housing shortage despite the fact that there are 6,000 units of housing being provided yearly in Dublin, it is not because of lack of money or lack of services.  It is because the construction industry is working to full capacity.  By that I mean that all the skilled workers who wish to offer their services to the construction industry are employed.  This extends to unskilled and semi-skilled workers who have the ability to produce at a fairly high rate.  We have come to a situation where a builder, whom we shall call A, has trained a young apprentice and has him employed at something above the basic rate for his job.  Builder B hears how good this man is and offers him £3 or £4 extra a week.  The worker agrees to move for the extra money.  Builder C offers him more, and builder A may have to buy him back at considerably more than he was paying.  The worker can come to the trade union and say that the time is ripe for asking the builders of the country for an increase in basic rates.  The worker may feel that it is the right time because the builders are offering this extra money over and <Col N="1655" /> above the trade union rate.  The worker may feel it is the time to increase the minimum basic rate.  The union will make a claim on behalf of the worker. One may ask &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;  The reason should be apparent to any one who is a full-time trade union official, whose concern should be for all the members of his union and not just for one section.</P>
      <P>In the building industry today we have a seller's market.  We have a situation where the construction industry, because it can sell what it produces at practically any price, must pay for the people in the industry even if the basic goes up by £4 or £6.  One should ask what about the worker in a very competitive trade.  What about the worker employed in a factory who, because of its keenly-priced structure, is managing to export its products?</P>
      <P>What about the worker who is dependent entirely on his firm to maintain the export market or the home market?  That worker, who probably has equal training or maybe even more difficult training, who has equal skills or even better skills, will he not say he is entitled to this £4 or £6 a week? Of course, he will.  If his trade union does not make that claim, the worker is inclined to say that the other unions can get it for their workers and that he should move across to them.  Therefore, the trade union is, so to speak, blackmailed into making a demand which the leadership of that trade union know will lead to a cut back in production in the factory where that man works or, indeed, its closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no leadership today in the trade union movement as I used to know it.  It used be a lot better or else the leadership has got old: do not ask me.  There is nobody in the trade union movement now who will go down to Congress and spell out the facts of life as the late Jim Larkin used do.  Nobody in this Government, nobody in this party, nobody in this House, is happy that it has become necessary to introduce this legislation. I realise that the principle of free collective bargaining is sacrosanct in the concept of the trade union movement as it has been built up from 1913.  However, <Col N="1656" /> we have in the trade union movement, 1970, leaders who are talking in the phrases of the trade union movement, 1913.  We have a different set-up here now.  We do not see children walking around our city now without shoes. We do not see starving people who are begging for pennies.</P>
    <P>We have a potentially full employment situation here.  It could be brought about much easier than by legislation of this nature&mdash;by intelligent co-operation and understanding of the situation; by the leadership of the trade union movement and then, subsequently, by their ability to pass on that information and that message to the rank and file of their members and to go down to Congress and get almost unanimous support for it.  I can think of one or two unions which, naturally, would be out.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan made an election speech in the course of which he urged the people to ignore the provisions of this Bill.  Having encouraged anarchy of that kind, Deputy Flanagan then suggested that the people in this country who save money should get their money out of the country quickly because there was a hidden threat of devaluation which he said the Minister could, by himself and without coming to this House, bring about.</P>

      <P>This is the type of speech I would expect from Deputy O.J. Flanagan when he is helping the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave, to get nearer the loot.  I can tell Deputy Cosgrave that &ldquo;the loot&rdquo; is the Financial Resolution we passed in this House: the necessity to introduce legislation of this kind, to try to explain it, and to have it accepted.  This is &ldquo;the loot&rdquo; that has been available to Fianna Fáil over the years&mdash;and this is the only &ldquo;loot&rdquo;&mdash;the loot of responsible government and the &ldquo;loot&rdquo; of this Bill which, if it is to be effective, must have a complete set of teeth or else it is just a waste of time discussing it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the party meeting I made some points for the attention of the Minister. I shall pass on some of them for the <Col N="1657" /> information of the House.  Unlike the Deputies on the Opposition benches, I consider that section 4 needs tightening up.  We have Trade Union Acts and Friendly Society Acts.  Trade unions are supposed to comply with certain regulations and to make certain submissions and returns to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Many of them do not do so.  I went over there during the time of the Referendum to see exactly what unions had political objectives in their rules: I was surprised how few there were.</P>
    <P>I think the expression &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; should be better described in section 4.  It should cover a branch of a trade union, a group of trade unions, sections of trade unions.  I am going on the record now to say that, as a trade unionist, I must support this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 22 has come under great criticism.  Nobody referred to section 23 which makes it quite clear that any order the Minister makes under section 22 will be placed before the House and that any Deputy has a right to raise the matter here and to seek to have the decision reversed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke for 6½ or seven hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed like ten hours.  He spoke about a tug-of-war and said that if wages go up profits go down, and <i>vice versa:</i> he said this is a law of life.  I do not know where he gets his information or who gave him that law of life.</P>
      <P>It is recognised, even among the most amateur trade union and employer organisations that, with proper incentives for greater production, wages can go up, production will go up and profits will go up, too.  That is the type of situation we hope to see here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My trade union association and my background in it should be known.  I have been a delegate for some three years in my own right to the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.  I have been a substitute delegate twice and a full <Col N="1658" /> delegate once to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I got there not because my name is Lemass.  The fact that I was a Teachta Dála in the Government party made it more difficult to get there.  There is some type of propaganda percolating from the Labour benches to the effect that if you are a trade unionist you should vote for political Labour.  These people do not seem to realise that the type of exercise in which we are engaged is necessary because of the weaknesses in leadership in the trade union movement as a whole and it is due to the fact that political Labour is using the trade union movement as a political toy for their own selfish ends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before making my contribution on this Bill I would mention that Deputy Keating spoke for 5½ hours.  I have been a Member of this House for the past 16 years.  Whether a contribution is bad or is good&mdash;I do not know whether or not mine will be helpful&mdash;it should be judged not in relation to its volume but in relation to what one has to say.  If one can make it in two sentences then one should do so.  If one can make it in five sentences, that is reasonable.  It does not appear reasonable that this should occur in this House.  The only other examples I remember of such an occurrence in this House was that of Deputies Brown and McQuillan and, on a certain occasion, Deputy Patrick Smith of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not the best sort of parliamentarianism. While Deputy Keating's speech was very good, in many ways it was, of necessity, repetitious.  There is no need for that.  We should be able to make our case here logically and clearly, be it wrong or be it right, stand up, say what we have to say, shut up and sit down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation derives from a Government who were too lax, and it has arrived too late.  I was surprised at Deputy Colley, who as Minister for Industry and Commerce was my opposite number when I was Industry and Commerce spokesman for Fine Gael, coming out almost in a bullying fashion in his speech on the First Stage of the Bill, quoted at column 55 of the Official <Col N="1659" /> Report for Wednesday, 28th October last.  He said:</P>
    <P>If such people fail to produce a reasonable alternative and still oppose the principle of this Bill they stand before our people branded as people who do not care if the prices of all those commodities which the housewife must buy will shoot up and who do not care if thousands of our people are thrown out of work.</P>
    <P>At that stage there were interruptions. I interrupted and I think any Member of the House who was thinking clearly, unless he belonged to the Fianna Fáil Party, would have interrupted.  Is it not extraordinary that a member of a party who have done nothing but stand idly by and who consequently caused inflation, should come along on the First Stage, before anybody in the House had an opportunity of criticising the Bill, and say that no one had produced a reasonable alternative which would not result in putting up prices still further and putting people out of work?  He said this in face of the fact that during the past 18 months, if not 2½ years, we have been telling them of the dangerous situation that threatened.</P>
    <P>We had a situation in March when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, came out and said there was a crisis.  Then, a few weeks afterwards, when the party decided there should be a general election, he said there was no crisis.  There has been talk about planned economies, modern politics in relation to this sort of problem, but before we start to talk of the success of the First, Second or Third Programmes, or of reports from bodies like the NIEC, we must admit that any modern economy needs constant attention.  A person in the position of the Minister for Finance must think of the country and the people first and then of the party.  Any such Minister, even in a minor way, must in these days, deflate the economy if it becomes too proud of itself.  Later he will have the pleasant task of re-inflating the economy in a variety of ways.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are discussing a situation which is upon us because a Government have completely neglected such a necessary operation during a period of <Col N="1660" /> years.  We have had the experience of a Minister for Finance in such a Government, on the First Stage of a Bill, before the Opposition had an opportunity of studying the Bill, or of criticising the legislation, going bald-headed for the Opposition.  This seems to have stemmed from a sense of guilt in the Government, from a sense of the knowledge that they have created this situation which has brought the country into great difficulty and privation&mdash;and I mean great difficulty and privation extending far beyond the scope of the Bill if it is passed and is operated as law.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister's appointment there was a situation through which the ESB employees refused to accept certain offers and had threatened to go on strike.  I remember the Dáil being kept back on a Friday evening so that the Seanad could pass a Bill, so that that Bill could come down here and become law at two a.m. on a Saturday morning.  Under that Bill employees of the ESB who did not obey its terms could be imprisoned for six months. Then, on the following Monday morning when we bought the newspapers we read that the strike had been called off and that the employees had accepted an increase of 30s a week, a reasonable sum at the time.</P>
    <P>Because this legislation is being opposed by the trade unions it is unlikely to hold.  As further proof of the likelihood that it will not hold, that it will not be law&mdash;I deliberately used that phrase &ldquo;not be law&rdquo;&mdash;for the term up to 31st December, 1971, I offer a statement issued on 16th October last at 4 p.m. by the Government Information Bureau.  I quote the first paragraph of that statement:</P>
    <P>The current economic difficulties and the threat of major damage to our economy, as a result of the failure of the employer-labour conference, have made it imperative that the Government should take decisive and urgent action.  Accordingly, the Government have decided that, as from today statutory control will be exercised over all forms of incomes and that the machinery in respect of price control will be strengthened and extended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> The following paragraphs, which are available to Members, point out that the terms of the 12th round as they extend into next year were being wiped out&mdash;that there was no question of any increase in wages or salaries between 16th October, 1970, and 31st December, 1971.  It was also stated that the 7 per cent ceiling on wages and salaries applied also to commodity price.  The first part of that statement cracked within three days.  Within three days the Minister had to go to the press and say that the terms of the balance of the 12th round would be allowed to operate.  It became quite evident that a panicky Government had issued the original statement without consideration or without adequate application to the problem.</P>
    <P>I instance a case which I negotiated. On 4th April a person got £2 10s, with provision for 15s on 1st January, 15s on 1st April and 15s thereafter.  If somebody else had negotiated and received £3 on 4th April that person would have been better off than the person whose increase was phased over a period going into 1971, although both men had accepted the agreements in good faith.  Therefore, I hold that the original statement by the Government was stupid, that it showed a lack of detailed examination.  It was buried alive within days and it showed evidence of a panicky Government and an inadequate Cabinet, who were on the run and who could not sit down to produce legislation of the type necessary, if any legislation was necessary.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who served in that capacity under Deputy Haughey said that while his party might be sorry that this legislation had to come, every member of the party was in favour of it.  I should like to point to this important fact.  The ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, stated quite clearly in the public press that, in his opinion, this legislation is not necessary.  He has not come into the debate yet to say why.  This is no criticism of Deputy Haughey or the Government or anybody else, but I would be extremely interested to hear his different point of view because, if he has said this in the public press, there must certainly be a <Col N="1662" /> different point of view and, from an ex-Minister for Finance, we would expect that such a view would be formed in depth and in knowledge and it is a different view altogether from what has been expressed so far by the Government side in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Government party at the last election portrayed themselves as a party of reality.  Some of the gilt has worn off the ginger bread.  Apart from that political matter which really is not of such serious portent as what we are discussing today, namely, the future of the whole Irish economy, there is this other aspect.  The party of reality are not now in any way politically or economically the party of normality. Any party that allows this sort of thing to run for two years and then sends in the principal Minister of the Government, apart from the Taoiseach, to produce a normal approach to people who are being asked to make sacrifice and who ends up by abusing the Opposition in the first paragraphs of his speech, before they even get a chance to criticise him either constructively or destructively&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I now propose to address my remarks to the Bill as a businessman.  It is not possible to discuss this Bill fully without at the same time considering some of the measures in the Finance (No. 2) Bill of this year. I intend to stay within the rules of order and I will not discuss those measures except in passing.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Keating when he says that we should have a managed economy, apparently able to redistribute the cake and at the same time expand and employ more of our people.  The reason is not that I have any ideological reaction to that line of thought because I do not believe in financial or political ideologies.  It is that any radical change in the structure of our economic and industrial life and of our economy will only bring real benefit when Deputy Keating's sons and my sons may be here in Dáil Éireann.  I do not think that as a country Ireland is interested in something that is decades away.  When we arrived at a fundamental change in the nature of our economy we might find that the world had moved another way and that the goal on which we had set our sights was the end of a rainbow where obviously there is no pot of gold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, we must adhere to reality in our approach to this problem.  The Government have not adhered to reality in their approach.  We are surrounded by private enterprise economies. The first private enterprise economy I would mention is Britain where two Labour Governments in the past decade or so have failed spectacularly&mdash;although they succeeded in many ways&mdash;in the destruction of certain aspects of the private enterprise economy and the substitution therefor of a different sort of enterprise, notably a State enterprise.  This proves that Britain's economy is likely to <Col N="1664" /> remain a private enterprise economy mainly.  If one considers the other nations of Europe and particularly the ones with which we hope to be associated, one finds, from the small gownshop in the village to the small restaurant that provides the best food and the farmer living on his farm and not farming communally, right across France and Italy, <i>et cetera</i>, with the possible exception of some big corporation in West Germany, that not only are they private enterprise economies but private enterprise economies of the smallholder, the small proprietor.</P>
    <P>I hold that you must operate on the basis of fair play.  You must operate on the basis that you must get the best purchasing power for your worker and the best possible wage for him.  At the same time, you must produce a level of unattached profits which will mean that you can have from within your country a steady re-investment of profits and an incentive to your own people to invest within your own country and to attract investment from abroad.  There is no use in talking about a different situation when you know that the expertise from abroad, the money from abroad will come from private enterprise economies, from firms outside this country who have the expertise, the knowledge and the money.  The only thing that will attract them here is a level of profits that will allow them unattached profits to reinvest while at the same time leaving them a profit on the investment made.</P>
    <P>That being the situation you must consider, against the limitation of dividends, the fact that in the sister Bill, the Finance (No. 2) Bill, there is a provision which raises the average takeout by taxation of profits from a company in this country to the staggering figure, for a small country, of 58 per cent.  The relevant figure in Britain for the average sized company is 42½ per cent.  We are giving huge industrial grants to people to come here.  We have moved in the matter of corporation profits tax with the result that, before a person has the opportunity by capital investment to leave money behind in the country for re-investment, for safeguarding the jobs there are and the creation of new jobs, we have skimmed <Col N="1665" /> off more of the cream and there is less left.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to the question of profits.  I should like to differentiate very clearly between profits within a company for re-investment and profits to be distributed by dividends to individuals.  The way to achieve the <i>desideratum</i> mentioned by Deputy Keating namely, a society in which there are no very rich and no very poor, which is everybody's <i>desideratum</i> is not through the application of corporation profits tax which attach profits before they come out, but by the operation of ordinary taxation, of estate duty and death duty, surtax and what could be termed personal taxation as well as indirect taxation on luxuries enjoyed largely by rich people. That can be done and that is the avenue to which Deputy Keating should direct his attention.  It was not done by the Government and, in fact, the Government's ham-fisted handling of this whole problem, from their late start on the 16th October, reminds one of Alannah Machree's dog, a bit of the road with everybody, and if workers had to be told they could not get more wages and increased salaries then other things had to happen as well.</P>
    <P>Naturally, there would be divided limitation.  I think Deputy Dr. O'Donovan&mdash;certainly Deputy Corish &mdash;pointed out that this is merely a delaying measure and that one can withold dividends until 31st December if one wishes and then distribute them and the people getting the dividends, with the exception of some poor pensioners who are always forgotten when we are talking about this sort of thing, do not mind if one waits until after 31st December.  But there had to be another tax.  A corporation profits tax had to be introduced at the same time.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;remark from an experienced Minister who does not <Col N="1666" /> seem to have had very much rub-off politically or any other way from his experiences.  It is very important that he should be taught a lesson.  I am sure Deputy O'Donovan will correct me if I am wrong.  In relation to the Budget, the last time we voted was for a measure of £435 million.  Every year, at Budget time, since I arrived here, Deputy Paddy Burke, that decent man from north County Dublin, stood up and said: &ldquo;There you are voting against the old age pensioners.&rdquo;  Here we were, voting on a measure of £435 million, and there were the boys on the other side saying: &ldquo;You are voting against the old age pensioners&rdquo; which was probably of the order, Gold help them, of no more than one over four hundred and thirty-five.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the dog has his bone he will keep it.  All that is wrong is that the Minister's nose is being rubbed in the mud.  The Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party were in the position that this measure was not voted upon at the same time as other measures and that was the parliamentary trick at which Fianna Fáil are such experts.  I have pointed to the Minister's non-knowledge of these affairs.</P>
      <P>The approach here should not have been, as it clearly was, of Alannah Machree's dog, a bit of the road with everybody, a sort of punishment measure handed out on the basis that it must appear to be equal punishment for everybody and that the measures produced must react unfavourably against all sides of the economic field. These measures, taken jointly with the Finance (No. 2) Bill measure, slow up industrial expansion.  No industrialist would consider coming in here now unless he got an enormous grant, one that would mean&mdash;probably in a designated area&mdash;that his own expenditure was relatively a minor matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasant duty the other evening of ringing a stockbroker to ask him for advice for two constituents of mine who have saved money and who wish to invest in industrials.  The reason they wanted to do that was they felt that if they invested in the national loan or any such loan the value of their money would fall to such an extent that they would be robbed no matter what dividend they got.  These are two country people.  I did my duty and rang the stockbroker and told him the problem.  He said: &ldquo;Paddy, I am afraid my advice will be that they should place their money outside this country.  The measures that have been introduced will create such a drop in industrial activity and investment here that without the slightest doubt there will be no move in Irish shares here <Col N="1668" /> nor will there be any expansion of Irish industry for the next few years.&rdquo; That is what has been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite dishonest in his first approach in abusing the Opposition before they even started to talk.  He demanded suggestions from the Opposition as to what they would do.  He should not get them because it is not our job.  He has all the knowledge.</P>

    <P>I think this Bill is going to fail.  The Minister was at pains some months ago&mdash;it is a coincidence that we should all be here&mdash;to decry me when I made a public statement to the effect that there was on the stocks of this House a Bill which would allow devaluation without devaluation of the English pound.  Before I got down to replying to the Minister when he attacked me for this in a statement from his Department&mdash;I take it as an accolade when a poor independent fellow who makes a speech at a political gathering away out in the country finds that the whole Department of Finance has to come down around his ears&mdash;it devolved on Deputy Dr. O'Donovan to set the matter right by saying that, in fact, in the Central Bank Bill, which the Minister can get in the general office of this House on his way home&mdash;and he can read it in bed while he is having his cup of milk&mdash;it will be found that the <Col N="1669" /> Minister has included a section which does allow the devaluation of the Irish pound without British devaluation.</P>

      <P>The statement was made because I had made a political speech down at the Cooley Peninsula which I submitted to the press.  I might say in relation to the Cooley Peninsula that, as far as the people of Ireland are concerned, the Minister would be better off to be down there snagging turnips.  However, leaving that out of it, I say without fear of contradiction that these measures will fail. I have no wish to be a prophet of doom but on the stocks of this House there is a further measure that would reduce the purchasing power of every £ in the pocket of every Irish man and woman.  This reduction can be made by any amount the Government wish once the legislation has been enacted.  Maybe the speech I made at the Cooley Peninsula is one of the reasons why this is not moving any faster.</P>

      <P>It does not behove an Opposition to point to measures that might have been taken by the Government.  That is not to say that my party would take such measures but the invitation has been extended by the Minister.  I make it clear that I am speaking for myself.  I cannot see any reason why there should be a limitation <Col N="1670" /> of dividends for unfortunate people who are living on dividends and who are paying tax on such dividends. I cannot see, either, why there must be an absolute stop on any increase in wages or salaries except those negotiated in the 12th round, while, at the same time, I can go to the Members' bar of Dáil Éireann and buy a brandy and ginger ale at the same price at which I could have bought it six months ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to what should come from the Fine Gael front bench but it should be put on record in relation to Fianna Fáil that at a time when Mr. Seán Lemass was the great operator, he interrupted Mr. John A. Costello no less than 47 times during one speech.  Speaking of Mr. Lemass prompts me to refer to something which was said by his son only a few minutes ago.  Deputy Lemass referred to the first planning there was in Ireland but the speech the Deputy has probably forgotten but which I have carefully filed was one made in 1956. Perhaps the Deputy has forgotten where that speech was made.</P>

I have been put off my line of thought for a moment by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the howls from Fianna Fáil when levies were put on in 1957 at a time when the Korean war and the Suez crisis were making it extremely difficult for any Government to produce anything for this country.  I remember the present Tánaiste coming in here when the prices of cattle were falling and asking ten questions every day on cattle prices.  Every time he asked a question, the prices fell by another 10s <Col N="1671" /> a cwt and our balance of payments suffered another rattling.  I remember all those horrible things that were done and I remember, too, that the levies which were imposed were converted into duties and kept by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>One of the problems which will face us on entering the Common Market is where we are going to get that £9 million.  So far as I know, I am the first Deputy to suggest that if it was necessary to put a curb on the economy, if it was necessary to get down to the hard facts and say that we were spending more than we were earning, there are luxuries which are imported and which could have borne a heavy impost temporarily.  In the first place, such imposition would have brought in money to the Government which they could have devoted, if they wished, to capital work and, at the same time, they would have discouraged our people from buying those luxuries from abroad.  I ask the Minister how can it be fair that a man who may have three or four children cannot improve his lot; that a widow receiving a dividend on which she pays unearned income tax cannot improve her lot; that a company, about which I was approached at an economic seminar in Cork a few weeks ago, who have not paid a dividend to shareholders for the past three years, cannot now pay a dividend to those shareholders until the 31st December, 1971, while at the same time I can buy a brandy and ginger ale in the Members' bar at the same price at which it was six months ago?  I am not suggesting taxation.  I am suggesting merely that the situation which the Government have brought about is utterly incongruous. They stand charged with that and with the fact that there may be in the offing, whether or not the Minister likes it, the question of the devaluation of the Irish £ as apart from British devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look, then, at how bad things are and how inept and unenergetic are the Government.  In the papers today we saw the balance of payments figures.  We find that the balance of trade figures for the first ten months of this year are worse than the corresponding <Col N="1672" /> figures for last year to the extent of £3.5 million.  What would have been the difference if there had not been a bank strike, if there had not been a cement strike?  This was not mentioned by the Minister in any of his speeches.  I asked a builders' provider how much less he imported because of the fact that there was no cement available to make blocks with which to build houses, knowing that the range of things he would import would be extensive.  His reply was that I should start thinking at £1 million. I must say that he is not the biggest builders' provider in the country.  We can go right over all that has happened.  I know that at this moment one of the authorities in Dublin are, in so far as building is concerned, running at £800,000 less than the allotted amount of capital moneys for the financial year and the result is that they will finish up by spending £800,000 less.  We can go from there to all the local authorities in the country. We can take my county as an example. We can take the houses being built by private builders in Drogheda and Dundalk; we can take the houses being built by Dundalk Corporation and Urban District Council; we can take houses being built privately all over the rural area and by Louth County Council&mdash;take the stoppage of all that and the fact that there was no need to carry stocks&mdash;stocks of these commodities that were not required because of the cement strike and so were allowed to deplete&mdash;and we are now faced with a situation whereby as building regains its previous volume, these stocks will have to be built up. There is no doubt that the £3.5 million disimprovement in the balance of payments figures for the first ten months of this year is just a joke.  We will get the backlash of the goods which were not imported over, perhaps, the next six months.</P>
    <P>Let us take the bank strike.  I explained to the Minister before that people who are importing goods from Britain or elsewhere for manufacture here or processing here could in a month be sending any amount of money out of the country for raw materials.  Let us take the case of a <Col N="1673" /> man sending £10,000 per month to a firm in Britain and let us imagine the firm in Britain with liquid capital available to it of £100,000.  The first month of the bank strike the firm received £10,000, put the cheque in the safe and their liquid availability was then £90,000.  Four months later the firm only had £50,000 liquid cash left.  The firm's only hope at that stage was to tell the Irish customer to produce the money or they could not send them the goods.  Naturally enough they had to pay their own suppliers.  I know quite a lot of money was got outside the country by people who desired to continue with their imports but a lot was not.  I also know that there was great running down of stocks, apart from the building industry, because of the bank strike.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the situation is far worse than any figures he can read or assimilate or that I can either.  The measures he has produced will not be any good.  Let it be known for the record that the trade union movement will fight those measures.  I do not know what will be the outcome of that. It seems an extraordinary situation to me that you might find a group of trade unionists parading up and down outside a place of work with placards on their backs stating &ldquo;Industrial dispute on here&rdquo; when, in fact, the dispute was not with the employer but with the Government.  There was, in fact, provision for heavy fines if the employer paid them an agreed amount or perhaps what they desired.</P>
    <P>Let us consider manufacturing industry in Ireland from 1963 to 1970. There was an increase in production of 46 per cent, an increase in employment of 15 per cent, hours worked minus 4 per cent, the output per worker per hour, 33 per cent, the employee earnings per hour were up 18 per cent, the labour costs per unit of output were up 36 per cent and consumer prices at the same time went up 39 per cent.  That indicates an improvement in the workers' lot, which is a correct and proper situation, but it also indicates that our competitiveness was very severely impaired.  We are a small country and we suffer from the fact that our units are smaller.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> Let us take unit labour costs, the cost of a ton of the finished product or the cost per article or per dozen articles.  The unit labour costs from 1963 to 1970 in the United Kingdom went up 24 per cent and in France 7 per cent.  Anybody who goes to France now sees the difference between the inflationary situation which existed there about 1963 and what exists there now. The improvement is very obvious to anybody walking out of a railway station, buying his first meal and staying his first day.  The unit labour costs went up 11 per cent in West Germany, in Italy, 13 per cent, Belgium, 24 per cent, the Netherlands, 11 per cent, the United States of America, 12 per cent, Canada, 20 per cent, Japan 7 per cent and Ireland 33 per cent.  I give those figures not from any desire to prove that anybody did better or did worse but to prove that the Government were looking at this as far back as 1965 or 1966 and that their 1965 and 1967 credit squeezes were the measures of people clinging to office.</P>
    <P>Thanks be to God, whatever the Minister for Finance admits, that will not be our attitude because whenever we gain government, and gain it we will, we will be the fastest back to the ballot boxes when we feel we have failed. Perhaps one of the good things about being a long time in opposition is that you get quite a while to look at yourself and to look at the other fellow. Those who are drunk with power and drunk with the determination that they must maintain their position in government must be taught the lesson that they are expendable, that there are other people willing and able to do the job as well as they.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the question of exhortation by the Government, the timing of the maintenance strike, the speeches by the ex-Minister for Finance and the shabby performance we have witnessed.  I also want the House to cast their minds back a few years to the by-elections in Kildare and Cork when there was a wage demand being negotiated. A few days before the by-elections the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, that brilliant architect, in Clerys Restaurant in 1957 came out with a 12 per cent increase in wages <Col N="1675" /> for certain people in the public service and an increase for the Army.</P>
    <P>He won the two by-elections.  Debased politicians of the Fianna Fáil Party realised that many of our people did not think in depth, did not think of anything but the following week, did not think about anything except the present situation as far as the wage packet was concerned.  From that day to this those people were prepared deliberately to prostitute the high office they attained to keep themselves in office rather than work as the servants of the people who put them there.</P>
    <P>I have contributed two items to this debate which were not mentioned before&mdash;the possibility, which I hope is no more than that, of separate devaluation of the Irish £ quite apart from the British.  I have also suggested as an individual that in this situation it appears entirely incongruous that, while in the parallel legislation there is some increase in selective wholesale tax on certain luxury items, the import of goods from abroad, when our balance of payments situation is so bad and far worse than the figures indicate, should continue without any further impost on them while the men and women who run this country by their work to create the wealth of this country, as Deputy Keating pointed out, are asked to make sacrifices.  This seems illogical and it highlights the fact that Fianna Fáil consider Fianna Fáil first, God second for their own skins and the people a bad third in a very badly galloped race.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that this Prices and Incomes Bill is a short-term emergency measure which should expire on 31st December, 1971. We have memories of emergency measures passed into law in this House during the war years, 1939 to 1945, which were never revoked.  They are still on the Statute Book and can be implemented by order of the Minister at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no guarantee that this is but a temporary, short-term measure. Is it not fair to suggest that, having secured such power, the Minister and the Government would be loath to <Col N="1676" /> part with it, that they would want to hold on to it and apply it as circumstances justified in their estimation?  It is dangerous therefore from that point of view.  There are very serious implications involved in this Bill, having regard to the repercussions which could result.  It is a deliberate attempt to cut back on the standard of living of working-class people.  Let there be no doubt or ambiguity about that.  It cannot hurt the employers.  It was never intended to hurt them.  This is essentially a piece of anti-working-class legislation.  This is a wage freeze to be dictated as to size or percentage increase by the Government of the day. It is an unwarranted and uncalled for interference with the fundamental right of free negotiation and free bargaining as we know it in this democracy between unions and employers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is clearly designed to destroy the voluntary pattern of industrial relations.  It calls for a fundamental and retrogressive change in industrial relations.  It is unfortunately couched in terms which give the impression that there is equal treatment in this Bill for the worker, the employer and the people at large.  However, even a cursory examination of the measure will show that all the weight, all the penalties involved, come down on the unions and the workers.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Noel Lemass, talked about trade union leaders harking back to 1913.  This measure seeks to turn the clock back 100 years so far as industrial relations are concerned.  The Fianna Fáil Party have out-toried the Torys themselves in this reprehensible piece of anti-working-class legislation.  Fianna Fáil have once again bowed to the dictates of the Tacateers and the profiteers of this country.  They are now deliberately seeking to depress the living standards of our people.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from a wage freeze of not more than 6 per cent as indicated by the Minister, such essential features of conditions of employment as hours of work, allowances and rates for overtime, and incentive bonus schemes, are debarred under this Bill. This short-sightedness is greatly to be deplored.  It will obviously have an adverse effect upon incentives to work <Col N="1677" /> and on increased production, and cuts right across the normal agreements between employers and unions in respect of incentive schemes.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that production has been falling in recent years, and I think perhaps it will have reached a new low this year by dropping to something approximating 2½ per cent.  From any standpoint this measure is a sickly, puny, compromising and cowardly piece of legislation. When the Minister first announced these proposals he said they were not negotiable and that he would not compromise on them in any way. When the roar of indignation went up from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions representing some 500,000 members the Minister quickly backed down and allowed the 12th round wage increase to proceed and be concluded.</P>
    <P>There are serious penalties for not conforming with the Minister's regulations. One can be fined various amounts&mdash;£200 or £5,000 in respect of individual unions or firms and £5 for each day of the offence committed. The Minister stipulates in the Bill that these fines shall be collected by seizure. This is a unique piece of legislation in the history of any country in that the architects of it did not have the moral courage to back it up by the appropriate penalties of imprisonment for nonpayment or non-conformity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister prefers to covet the assets and property of the trade unions which are, primarily, the assets of the trade union members. There is no danger that employers will be seized upon and have their assets threatened under this Bill.  It is unlikely that employers will incur the Minister's displeasure by graciously increasing the wages of their workers.  In my association with trade unions and employers over many years I have yet to meet an employer who out of the goodness of his heart increased his workers' wages.</P>
      <P>The rigours of the law are being brought to bear on the workingclass movement and the attack is directly on the unions, their assets and their property.  This is very definitely a frontal attack on the Irish trade union movement.  The money and the assets of the members are clearly in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>There is no possibility of this measure succeeding.  Where Governments have tried to legislate in matters appertaining to industrial relations they have invariably failed, and failed abjectly.  Repressive legislation of this kind has been in vogue in the United States for a number of years.  In the United States it is illegal for people in public employment to strike.  Yet in this field alone there were 254 strikes in 1968 with a consequent 2½ million working days lost, even though the possible penalties were a $1,000 fine plus a year's imprisonment.  In very many instances the courts found it inexpedient to enforce the law.</P>
      <P>The leader of the teachers' union in Boston, Massachusetts, was sent to prison only last May for a month.  He had to be released shortly afterwards to carry out negotiations for and on behalf of his union and its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March of this year, rather than risk the law, 2,000 air traffic controllers went sick at the same time and no aircraft were able to fly, and also in March more than 200,000 postmen in the United States went on strike and again no action was taken.  These were State servants who were debarred from striking.  The United States has a great deal of law on industrial relations, but, <Col N="1679" /> even after making all the adjustments for the size of the working population, they lose four times as many strike days as are lost in Britain.</P>
    <P>It is clearly misleading for any Government to think they can legislate for human problems of this kind.  In the United States there have been recurring spates of illegal strikes, walk-outs, sit-downs and go-slows as well as official strikes and wildcat strikes.  Official stoppages in the United States are massive. In October last one company employing 150,000 workers was shut down for 12 weeks because of a strike.  That one company lost more days in that one strike than Britain lost in all strikes in her industries in one year.  Clearly, law is not the answer in the much-vaunted United States and it will be demonstrated that it is not the answer here.</P>
    <P>In Australia, where again there is repressive legislation of the kind we are now asked to implement here, union officials were sent to jail for refusing to pay fines such as those contained in this legislation.  There were protest strikes all over Australia and as a result of this imprisonment millions of man days were lost until an anonymous donor paid the fine in question.  That rings a bell: legislation was passed here in respect of the ESB which was also obviously unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Sweden is also held up as a country of very good industrial relations but Sweden has not avoided considerable inflation of a much worse kind than ours.  Germany has been pointed out as an example of good industrial relations but even there there have been one-day and two-day stoppages and some longer strikes.  I understand the figures compiled there in respect of lost man days are not calculated on the same basis as in these islands.  From any standpoint it must be seen that this legislation has little hope of success.  It is opposed implacably by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, all its constituent bodies and all its 500,000 members.</P>
    <P>This Bill purports to control wages and salaries, prices, profits, rents and dividends.  I believe the primary purpose of the measure is to control wages <Col N="1680" /> and salaries.  On the Minister's own admission it will be extremely difficult to control prices.  The Minister says that the existing powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Prices Acts of 1958 and 1965 will be rigorously applied to ensure that only unavoidable increases in costs are passed on to the consumers after every effort has been made to absorb them either by raising productivity or by accepting a lower level of profit.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, having regard to the very large amount of materials which must be imported for the manufacture of so many things, we cannot control the price of these foreign commodities and that prices will rise.  In any case, one challenges the sincerity of any Fianna Fáil Government in doing anything effective about curbing prices. They have never believed in price restraint.  They have never utilised effectively the price control measures provided by this House.  They have been firm believers in allowing prices to find their own level by competition. Price will rise.  Wages will be rigorously fixed but prices will rise and the Minister has indicated that he has very little control over them in many facets of our economy.</P>
    <P>There is talk of controlling profits and dividends.  This is a huge joke. Obviously, there are so many ways and means for employers to confer on each other the golden handshake that this suggestion is simply not on.  Even if these extra profits and dividends have to be deferred for 12 months&mdash; the duration of this Bill&mdash;at the end of that time the plums will be all the riper.  This is essentially an anti-working class piece of legislation.  Prices cannot be effectively controlled and to talk of controlling profits and dividends is simply to insult the intelligence of the people and especially that of the working class people.  It will not wash.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should restrain himself.  The reference to controlling rents in this Bill is not merely misleading.  It is untrue. There is nothing in this Bill which assists any aggrieved tenant to find redress.  The Minister says that the Bill proposes to extend rent control to all lettings and dwellings, apartments and business premises not covered by the Rent Restrictions Act and also the lettings of non-agricultural land. The Minister stressed that whereas control of prices was a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, control of rents was a matter for the tenants themselves and the courts.  Any person, therefore, aggrieved in respect of a rent increase has clearly no redress under this Bill.  He must take his case to the court and face the costs of litigation, as he did heretofore.  The reference to rent is particularly misleading when we have regard to the mass <Col N="1682" /> of tenants who are scourged by the differential rent system.  The differential rent system is deliberately excluded from the scope of this measure.</P>

      <P>I seem to be touching on a sore point now, especially with Dublin Deputies.  Is it seriously suggested that local authorities can profit, or take their cut, under this measure from future wage increases granted to tenants who live in accommodation subject to the differential rent system? Nothing, in my opinion, contributes more to human misery and to a lowering of the standard of living of the working-class people than does the daylight robbery involved in the application of the differential rent system. Add to that income tax and turnover tax and you have the kind of millstone which hangs around the necks of our working-class people.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister, when he comes to reply, to deal with this matter of differential rents as distinct from the rent mentioned in the Bill.  I appreciate that under the differential rent system there must be flexibility to allow for a fall or an increase in income but, bearing in mind the widespread indignation which is rife as a result of the unjust and unfair method of assessment in respect of differential rents, I want to ascertain whether the balance of the 12th round, which is now to be allowed to run, will be assessed by local authorities for the purpose of increasing differential rents or whether the percentage increase allowed under this Bill, be it 6, 7 or 10 per cent, will be of set purpose and deliberately eaten up and dissipated under the differential rent system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot avoid this fundamental issue.  The tenants are, rightly, on the march.  If we are going to stabilise anything we ought to try to stabilise the differential rent system and bring into the odious system some degree of humanity, fairness and equity.  No single item I know of has caused such widespread unrest and indignation as has the differential rent system.  The Minister, therefore, cannot avoid his responsibility in this matter and he must clearly indicate to us what <Col N="1683" /> he intends to do in order to ensure that rents under this vicious system will not be allowed to increase over the next 12 or 18 months, for the duration of this particular measure, if passed by this House.  I believe an instruction should be issued to all county managers and local authorities to the effect that, in present circumstances and with a genuine desire to stabilise prices, to conserve living standards and curb inflation, they should review their differential rent schemes and be more humane, more liberal and more generous with their tenants and there should be no increase in rents arising from wage increases during the completion of the 12th round or the 13th round wage increase.</P>
    <P>This is a burning question and, if this measure is to have any modicum of success, we shall have to give those tenants governed by differential rents a positive assurance that their rents too will be stabilised.  They need not go to the courts.  They are under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Local Government and his county managers. To a large extent the success or failure of even a genuine incomes policy here will depend very largely on how justly tenants under differential rent schemes are treated.</P>
    <P>For the implementation of a prices and incomes policy one needs the utmost goodwill and co-operation from all sections of the community.  One must be respected and relied upon by the masses of the people to do the right thing and one must be shown to have a genuine regard for the welfare of all the people.  This cannot be said of the present Government because it is simply not true of the present Government. This Government have lost all respect, all credibility.  They are looked upon with suspicion and distrust, and even contempt, by a very large section of our people.  In the vital areas of individual integrity and collective responsibility they can be said to have lost the confidence of the people.  It has been evident to us, so close to the hub of things in this House, that the Fianna Fáil Government, as such, have ceased to exist and that for a goodly number of months past, the Government have <Col N="1684" /> ceased to operate as a Government. They have let the affairs of the people go to hell.  Our economy is in a shocking mess.  Our institutions of State have been seriously undermined by recent appalling events.  These events have shocked all right-thinking people in this country.  Our ability to govern ourselves has been called into serious question once again.  All the evidence is that we are drifting fast towards economic ruin and political anarchy.  It will take a very long time to restore confidence in the Government, in the institutions of State, in the impartiality of justice and in the maintenance of a semblance of law and order and equality.</P>
    <P>This Government are ill-equipped to secure the support of the working-class people for such a regressive measure as the Bill before us.  By their disgraceful conduct in recent times the Government have made this country a laughing-stock throughout the world.</P>

      <P>I hope to relate all my remarks to this Bill and to show that in order to implement any worthwhile prices and incomes policy the Government must command the respect and support of the people.  I wish to show that this Government have lost every shred of respect and support.  Not merely have they discredited themselves but our country has become a by-word for degeneracy among the progressive countries of the world.</P>
      <P>We have lost respect and credibility abroad.  It is the wrong moment to ask the workers and the trade union leaders to bow the knee to what is a dictatorial piece of legislation.  It seeks to put the clock back and it destroys the fundamental principle of free negotiation. It is now law by order of the Government of the day but the rights of trade unionism were too dearly fought for to be conceded lightly to any Government.  This Bill has the implacable opposition of all democrats in the country and it has no chance of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil are in trouble they find something spectacular in an effort to divert the attention of the <Col N="1685" /> people.  I am of the opinion that this anti-working-class piece of legislation was conjured up during the height of the recent crisis to try to divert the attention of the people from the intrigue and corruption evident in the Cabinet ranks.  Fianna Fáil have always had a tendency to blame the workers whenever the economy went wrong and, in particular, they have always blamed the unions.  The smallest strike was always enlarged out of all proportion and the blame was always laid on the workers and the trade unions.  For a number of years past the Labour Party and the trade union movement have sensed that Fianna Fáil were deliberately trying to create a climate of opinion in order to have a go at the trade unions.  They have had their go.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always imitated what was done across the water and, significantly, a Conservative Government are now in power in Britain.  One of the first things which Mr. Heath and his Tories sought to do was to harass and try to crush the power and influence of trade unionism in Britain. Deputy George Colley, the Minister for Finance, quickly followed suit.  There has been this deliberate attempt to blame the workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>She is a magnificent lady of whom I am very proud.  The Parliamentary Secretary's party are the hoary Tories now.  The Government have used the communications media from time to time to aggravate out of proportion the most minor strikes. There has been a deliberate attempt by the Government to denigrate the Irish trade union movement and its leaders. The maintenance strike could have been resolved much more speedily had there been a genuine desire on the part of the Government to do so.  Had there been an iota of goodwill on the part of the Government the cement strike could have been settled much sooner but it was deliberately dragged out. <Col N="1686" /> Some people say this was to slow down the housing drive and save capital resources. The bank strike was a disgrace to any civilised society.</P>
      <P>Behind all this we can see the attitude of a Government that made no effort whatever to try to resolve the various strikes.  This was done deliberately in an effort to whip up support for the present legislation. I said earlier that it was a cowardly, compromising piece of legislation because when they were preparing it they had not the guts to give this measure teeth in any sense of the word.  It was a sloppy, puny piece of legislation, the kind of legislation that one could expect of a Taoiseach who was opposed and even despised by so many of his own colleagues, the kind of legislation one could expect from a party torn asunder with disunity and vicious in-fighting such as was never known in the history of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the great cover-up, but it will not work.  One of the most nauseating aspects of this legislation is the pompous attitude of the Minister for Finance who has the duty and responsibility of pushing this measure through this House.  As I said, one would imagine that the Fianna Fáil Government were in no way responsible for the present sorry mess in which our economy finds itself.  One would imagine that they had nothing whatever to do in the realm of price control. Deputy Colley is the man who was Minister in charge of price control for a number of years past.  This is the man who has the audacity to appear before our people on television telling them that he is bringing in this measure for the welfare of all the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us of the great increase in prices and wages and of the inflationary spiral which must be stemmed.  One would never imagine that Deputy Colley was the very man who was responsible for these price increases and that he had at his disposal effective price control which he disdainfully threw aside.  Deputy <Col N="1687" /> George Colley pandered deliberately to the Tacateers and profiteers of this country and allowed prices to soar. Some say that, apart from the vested interests involved in this Government which have also been pandered to, the more prices increased the more the Minister for Finance garnered in turnover tax so that there was no incentive for the Government to restrain or control prices in an effective way.</P>
    <P>Deputy George Colley by his clear dereliction of duty as Minister for Finance has made life absolutely miserable for the housewives of this country. No man has done more to drag down the standard of living of our people than the Minister has done by his lack of attention to price control.  When one considers the various actions of this Government in recent times one is really taken aback by the audacity and the brassneck of some of these Ministers. A Taoiseach and a Cabinet which allowed turnover tax to be increased by 100 per cent in the major Budget of this year were clearly an irresponsible Government.  Any schoolboy would know that this was not merely dangerous but inflammatory from the point of view of increasing costs and creating an inflationary spiral.  We had the simplest, most indolent and most irresponsible Budget of all time.  The Budget statement was read by the Taoiseach, Deputy J. Lynch, in the absence of the then Minister, Deputy Haughey. It was truly a disgraceful Budget and the men who had hand, act or part in it were deliberately responsible for the kind of situation we find ourselves in today, where we are trying to grapple effectively with the difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was demonstrating as best I could the utter irresponsibility of the first Budget of this year.  One could not expect the workers to stand idly by and see prices increase so rapidly as a result of measures of this <Col N="1688" /> kind.  It was a bad day when turnover tax was first introduced because we felt then&mdash;and our fears are now justified&mdash; that this simple device would be increased by a certain percentage each year, thereby garnering in all the millions of pounds required for budgetary purposes.  This is exactly what has happened. The Government seemed to fail to realise that the turnover tax affects virtually all commodities and especially the necessaries of life.  It affects bread and butter, clothes, fuel, light and footwear.</P>
      <P>It was evident that not only were these things increased by 2½ per cent but that, in the absence of effective price control, every exploiter, extortioner and profiteer would have a bumper time and increase prices as much as they could get away with. Every housewife will tell you that when shopping in recent months, in particular, she found that extra shillings were required to purchase the same amount of groceries that previously she used purchase for less.</P>
      <P>This country of ours is becoming a very difficult place to live in by reason of high prices.  The trade union movement here did nothing more, in seeking wage increases, than try desperately to maintain standards.  The unions have responsibility not merely to maintain standards but to improve them progressively from year to year.</P>
      <P>This Government are incapable of governing effectively because of vested interests and because of difficulties amongst themselves.  Government of the country has been ignored and the welfare of the people is of no concern. In recent months, our country has been run, in the main, by dedicated civil servants.  Responsible and real government has ceased to operate here.</P>
      <P>Production is falling.  Unemployment is rising.  There is a widening gap in our balance of payments.  Prices, of course, are soaring.  Production in 1970 is expected to be as low as 2½ per cent. In 1969, industrial production was 4 per cent.  This year it is expected that industrial production will fall to 3 per cent.</P>

In other words, it is untrue for Deputy Treacy to say that there will be a reduction of 3 per cent, which is not the same as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Increase.  This year it will be as low as 3 per cent increase. This is a most unhealthy sign.  We were hoping to increase employment principally through industrial expansion. In recent times, agricultural production has, in the main, been static and there has been a considerable fall-off in employment in that sector.  Our balance of payments in 1968 showed a deficit of some £22 million.  In 1969, that deficit rose steeply to £69 million.  It is estimated the deficit for 1970 will be approximately £57 million.  The 1969 and 1970 figures are expected to show a deficit of some £125 million.  The continuation of such a trend is a most serious threat to our external reserves which at present stand at £314 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister says this measure is designed to maintain living standards; to ensure value for money and, above all else, to safeguard jobs.  This Government have a darned cheek to talk about the provision of jobs or about employment in view of their extremely bad record in this respect.  Unemployment is rising pretty sharply in this country.  Despite all the modern devices and techniques for increased productivity there is a serious decline.  The October unemployment figure stands at 59,000 persons compared with 51,400 on the unemployment register last year.  In the past 12 months there has been a reduction of 7,600 persons in employment which represents a 15 per cent increase in unemployment in the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, there has been a rapid and continuous rise in prices. The August, 1970, figure shows an increase <Col N="1690" /> of 8.4 per cent on the August, 1969, figure and, in turn, the August, 1969, figure was 8.4 per cent above the level of the figure for the previous year, 1968.  Therefore, in the past two years, there has been an increase of 17½ per cent in prices.  This is equivalent to 3s 6d in the £.  This unhappy record of Government inefficiency prompts me to say that the Minister was audacious in coming before our people and asserting that he would be the saviour of our economy and protector of the welfare of our people through the introduction of this anti-working class measure.  Deputy Colley and his colleagues are responsible for the inflation problem we have because they are the people who allowed prices to increase.</P>
    <P>During the past two years prices have increased in Ireland at the rate of 17.5 per cent, as I have said.  It is the second highest increase in prices among all of the OECD countries and it is considerably higher than in most other countries, as is evident from the following figures.  The percentage increase in consumer prices from August, 1968, until August, 1970 was: Yugoslavia 24.4, Ireland 17.5, Portugal 16.7, Norway 14.4, Japan 13.3, Netherlands 12.7, France 12.5, UK 12, USA 11.5, Denmark 10.7, Sweden 10.6, Spain 9.8, Italy 9.2, Canada 8.4, Belgium 8.3, Australia 7.8, Luxembourg 7.8, Greece 5.6.</P>
    <P>Here is clear evidence of an abandonment of responsible native Irish Government by allowing prices to spiral to such an extent that they are the second highest in the table for high prices throughout Europe.  Those increased prices have been responsible for the terrible economic climate we have had to contend with in recent months and they have done irreparable harm to our economy.</P>
    <P>Among other things, they have set back the tourist industry to a very large extent and we have reached a situation in which ordinary people, especially British people who like to come here to enjoy themselves, have been saying in recent summers, particularly last summer, &ldquo;We will not come here any more.  Prices for meals, drinks, cigarettes, petrol, foodstuffs, <Col N="1691" /> anything you like, are grossly excessive, exorbitant in every sense of the word&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why prices were allowed to increase to this extent.  By this abandonment of Government responsibility we have ruined our tourist potential, and it ill becomes any Minister or Government in these circumstances to seek to reprimand by repressive legislation of this kind the Labour and trade union movements for taking the steps they feel are suited and necessary to raise the standards of living of our people.</P>
    <P>I believe the trade union movement here will not stand for this measure. We have had a long and chequered history.  The rights we have secured in this country, the rights of man to association, to free negotiation, to order one's business to suit one's own means within the law&mdash;and the Irish trade union movement have always been respecters of the law&mdash;will be defended. The trade union movement will not have imposed on them a law of this kind which stultifies them in respect of free bargaining, a law which destroys the very purpose for which trade unions were founded&mdash;to secure decent conditions of employment and good wages, sufficient to provide a decent standard of life, to safeguard that standard of life, and to try to ensure progressive improvement. The trade union movement will never accept from any Government such undue interference in this fundamental area.</P>
    <P>The Minister was wise when he allowed the balance of the 12th round to run its course.  He was right to realise that it is wrong to interfere with agreements honourably entered into and solemnly signed by the parties concerned. The Minister must realise that he has done irreparable harm to many important institutions by bringing in this measure.  He must realise that he has destroyed the intrinsic worth of the Labour Court, that he has destroyed any possible agreement on long-term arrangements for phased pay in the future.</P>
    <P>Trade unions and the workers have been forewarned by this kind of <Col N="1692" /> measure.  They will be very slow to allow their leaders in future to commit them to long-term agreements over periods of 18 months or two years because they will never forget the lesson they learned when the Minister for Finance announced that this wage freeze was applicable as and from a certain date and that it even included agreements already entered into and which were to continue during the course of the next 12 or 18 months.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger that, having secured legislation of this kind, the Government will be very slow to part with it&mdash;that we will have this legislation perhaps set aside on 31st December, 1970, but kept on the stocks, ready to be reimplemented by Fianna Fáil whenever they feel the occasion merits it.  We know that emergency legislation enacted even during the war was not lightly revoked by Fianna Fáil.  It is still there on the Statute Book, ready to be reimplemented by order of the Minister.  It is too dangerous a weapon to be put into the hands of any Government because it is a weapon that can be used for ulterior motives.</P>
    <P>This legislation is something we would naturally wish to see wiped from the Statute Book at the earliest possible opportunity.  I should like to see an incomes and prices policy of a fair, just and equitable kind.  I should like to see it demonstrated by the Government that not only would there be restraint in respect of unjust wage and salary increases but that it would be clearly demonstrated that prices, profits, rents and all these things would be controlled rigidly.  This Government can give no such assurance to the people in respect of prices, rents, profits or dividends.</P>
    <P>If there is any possibility at all of an incomes and prices policy being adopted it can only be implemented by a Government having the utmost support and confidence of the mass of the people, a Government which can be trusted and relied upon, a Government which can be trusted by the workers in particular to do the right thing by them and not allow them to be compromised by employers or vested interests.  The only Government <Col N="1693" /> with any hope of success in bringing responsibility and fairness and justice into this area of industrial relations are, clearly, a Labour Government. There is no possibility of such a measure being accepted in present circumstances because of the general disarray within the Government.</P>
    <P>I have said sufficient to demonstrate our opposition to this measure.  We understand the reasons behind it.  We understand only too well the implications inherent in a measure of this kind.  As representatives of the ordinary people, and having particular regard to the work of the trade union movement, it behoves us to expose this measure for what it is: a deliberate attack upon the trade union movement and its institutions and, despite what the Minister might say, a deliberate attack on the standard of living of the workers.</P>
    <P>No other section has been singled out in this measure except the salaried and wage earning people.  It is nothing less than a shabby pretence to pretend that as a corollary to wage control we will have anything like price control, or rent control, or any other kind of control.  These things cannot be implemented.  They were introduced into this measure as a palliative, a sop, to inveigle misguided workers, perhaps, into thinking they will be all right, that the value of their next increase will be genuine, that the value of their money will remain intact and that their standard of living will be improved proportionately. This simply will not happen.</P>
    <P>It is ironical and nauseating in the extreme to hear Ministers lecturing us here about opposition to this Bill and about the sorry mess our economy is in, as if they had no responsibility for that sorry situation.  One would imagine that this Government came into power only the other day, or that all our social ills were imported from outside and the Government had no control over them.  I need hardly say that there is also the wild, enthusiastic ambition of the Government to join with the countries of Europe, on any terms seemingly, so that by such an association with the rich man's club of Europe the gold may rub off and thereby give some kind of boost to this wilting and <Col N="1694" /> decaying economy of ours.

It is penal and repressive and selective, and it makes a mockery of the sufferings endured by such great men as Jim Larkin whose name was brought up here tonight by Deputy Lemass.  They are guilty of flagrant disloyalty to all that Larkin fought and died for in supporting an iniquitous measure of this kind, and there is no use in pretending otherwise.</P>
      <P>With these sentiments I express the ardent hope that this measure will not pass through this House.  If it does by any stroke of bad luck, it will not be long until it is wiped off the Statute Book as one of the worst pieces of legislation to come before us for a very, very long number of years.</P>

Deputy Corish implied that it was necessary to take some steps regarding inflation although he did accuse the Government of being the cause of inflation. Deputy Keating said that it was an economic gimmick.  There is confusion within the Labour Party.  I do not know whether Deputy Keating is the new challenger for leadership in the Labour Party or not but when he speaks for seven hours he must be trying to prove something.  It may be that he is trying to prove that he has a large vocabulary&mdash;it does not suit his stature&mdash;or he may be trying to put on the record of this House as many words as possible in the short time which he will be here.  If this is so, I should like to say to Deputy Keating and others like him that it is an abuse of the rules of order of this House to carry on with such lamentations without referring specifically to the matters concerned or without offering a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people tend to be illogical and irrational when it comes to Government expenditure.  They press for a reduction in the scale of this expenditure and often find it extremely difficult <Col N="1696" /> to understand why these reductions cannot be made instantaneously.  In the next breadth these very same people will vigorously advocate an increase in State support for something.  It is high time we got rid of this type of politics from this House.  The day of the middle of the road person in this House is gone.  This type of politics is not acceptable to the Irish people.  If the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party want to play this type of politics all I can say is that they are in their rightful place and there they will remain&mdash; in Opposition.</P>
    <P>It should be realised that the State can only use the resources available to it.  These resources are got each year at Budget time.  They are got in a very vigorous manner, in a very dictatorial way, but it must be realised that as long as a party are in Government this attitude must be adopted.  One cannot soft pedal when one is asking for money.  We get our money from the taxpayers.  It must be appreciated that the people have responded on every occasion on which the Fianna Fáil Government have asked them to do so. I would expect that on this occasion in regard to this legislation, the people involved will respond in the same way.</P>
    <P>The Government, like any individual, must make ends meet.  This is the purpose of this temporary provisions Bill.  This brings us to the point of the real necessity of this action.  There seems to be a general agreement that something had to be done.  No real solution has been put forward by either of the Opposition parties but the general view is that there was an air of unreality in existence and that that had to be got rid of and that the people themselves were so concerned that they hoped the Government would bring in legislation which would curb the present inflationary trend.</P>
    <P>This all began with the maintenance strike.  I must admit that I think the employers dealt very unfairly and unreasonably with this particular strike. This measure is one of the significant features of our economic advance in the 1970s.  This depends on how exactly we approach this type of settlement and our ability to prevent these stoppages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> There is one aspect which has not been adverted to by anybody, even by the Minister, and it is something about which I am greatly concerned.  This is the fantastic demand settlements which have been made in some sectors of our community widening the gap between the rural community and the urban, white collar or industrial worker.  I am speaking about the farm labourers and other labourers who are on the basic wage of £14 and £15 a week.  We are by this legislation curbing all incomes but we are curbing the income of the lower paid worker and this will allow the urban dweller when the next increase is granted to stride further away from the rural worker.  This is an aspect of our economy which will have to be dealt with.  Slowly but surely we have more people leaving the land by virtue of a poor standard of living and the fact that their wages are not sufficient to give them a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>The only questions then are whether this action is right and whether it will work, whether it can be implemented. These are questions which I put to the House and to the Minister because I want answers and I believe it is in the interest of the country that these questions should be answered.  I am worried about free collective bargaining.  This system has been part of our society since this State was founded.  It has also been part of the basis of our freedom. It would be a terrible blow if free collective bargaining were abolished by some legislation which would force the hand of the employer, of the trade unions, of the Government or of the workers to take steps to counteract it.  We can only accept the assurance of the Government that there is no other way of dealing with this problem.  It will be extremely hard to drive this home to the people.</P>
    <P>Every effort will have to be made on the part of everybody to do this in a successful manner so that the people will realise that this is for the betterment of the economy and that it will not give all of the cake to the upper echelons of the community.  In this legislation we are endeavouring to control inflationary trends.  Of course, it is not in Ireland alone that there is <Col N="1698" /> this problem.  Inflation is worldwide. Deputy O'Donovan said that we were responsible for world inflation.  Since he is not in the House at the moment I would not wish to say anything derogatory about him but I will say that if we can spread our wings as far afield as he seems to infer, then we are indeed a great little nation.  While I do not accept what Deputy O'Donovan has said, I realise that we have our part to play and it is reasonable to accept that Fianna Fáil are prepared to play their part in controlling inflation and by so doing, that we may at least indicate to other nations that we were not prepared to sit back and watch our economy decay through inflation. We will let other nations, perhaps much stronger than ours, see that we were prepared to take whatever steps were necessary in this regard, irrespective of whether these steps were unpopular, irrespective of how unpopular they might be in the future.</P>
    <P>The next question which must be posed is whether this type of legislation will work.  Personally, I believe it will cause a large number of people to be upset.  Already one hears a lot of talk about ways and means by which the legislation can be evaded, particularly in regard to price control. Opposition members have mentioned this matter here several times as have members of my own party.  It is obvious that some producers and shopkeepers as well as others concerned will make an effort to avoid this control of prices.  For instance, an item might be offered for sale in a packet different from the one in which it was offered before the legislation was enacted. Such items might be given a different name and also, of course, a different price.  Some people have gone so far as to say that producers might reduce the amount of liquid in a container but I would not imagine that there are any producers who would do so.  However, if there were such an item on the market as, say &ldquo;wash-and-shine&rdquo;, it might be offered as &ldquo;wash-and-shine and non-slip&rdquo; thereby leading the consumer to believe that he was getting a completely new product.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister will find it possible, under this legislation, to operate a system which would control this <Col N="1699" /> sort of practice.  If the Minister can give us an assurance that it will be possible for him to control prices at the level at which they were before the control was introduced, we would welcome this provision in the Bill.  I agree with the curtailing of new house prices. However, there has been no mention about the prices of old houses.  In regard to curtailing the prices of new houses it is my belief that the builders concerned will find a way of evading the legislation.  This they can do by purposely slowing down their building programme so that they will produce only a certain number of houses this year at the price specified by the Minister. This would result in a falling-off in the building trade.  Such a falling-off would have serious consequences because, of course, the building trade is the greatest source of employment for our manpower.  If it were not for the building trade we would have the mass emigration about which we hear so much from Opposition speakers.  Therefore, it is my wish that the trade should survive and that we would be able to produce even a greater number of houses than are being produced at present.</P>
    <P>It seems obvious to me that the prices of old houses will spiral if there is a shortage of new houses.  We all know what happens when there are more buyers than there are commodities available.  Prices soar.  The Minister should ensure that this will not happen in relation to housing because should it happen we would be encouraging the selling of old houses at astronomical and unjustifiable prices.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture I want to ask the Minister why no efforts were made during the last 12 months to curb price increases for artificial compounds used by farmers.  Many Deputies will know exactly what I am speaking about.  In March last the price of artificial manures increased by £3 per ton.  This increase was allowed by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce. Again, this month, artificial manures have increased by £4 per ton, making a total increase of £7 this year. There are many other items, the prices of which have also been greatly increased but I shall not take up the <Col N="1700" /> time of the House in referring individually to these.  Surely something should have been done to prevent such an extraordinary increase.  It is obvious that the powers of price control were not utilised.  Legislation exists which would have controlled these price increases.</P>
    <P>I might add that in regard to this item the farmers received no increase as far as subsidies or otherwise are concerned.  It is not justice on the part of the Government and it is not justice as far as the producer is concerned. I am concerned on behalf of the community which I represent and I felt I should make representations to the producers of this item.  I did so and the answer I got was that as long as the Minister for Industry and Commerce allowed them to increase the price of this commodity they would do so. The producers are not being unfair but it is unfair of the Minister to allow such a thing to happen.</P>
    <P>This poses a problem for the Labour Party in that factory men earn £50 to £70 a week.  Who is bearing the burden of these people's success?  I do not begrudge those workers their wages if they earn them but their colleagues in rural Ireland have to bear the brunt of the astronomical wage increases which the trade unions have negotiated to the detriment of other employees. The Labour Party should realise exactly what they are preaching as regards equal pay for equal work. Some consideration should be given to the facts I have mentioned, which I can stand over because I have inquired into them.  I also participated in talks to try to make the producers realise that those increases were unjustified. I should like the Minister to concern himself with this problem and by doing so he would not only do a favour for the agricultural community but also for the Labour Party who seem to be incapable of carrying out their duties. He would relieve them of the pressure under which they have been for some time of not being able to control their own trade unions.</P>
    <P>This company were prepared to say that they can quite readily bury their £4 million profit at the end of the <Col N="1701" /> year and accumulate a loss when necessary. This is an extraordinary situation. I hope this legislation will not alone curb this but will bring it out into the open so that we can realise that those anomalies exist within our society and that legislation is necessary to reveal them.  If it does nothing else we will be playing our part so far as the workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>Is it practical to impose such provisions on the people?  Is it practical to implement such provisions?  The Government, in abandoning the general 6 per cent limit and by virtue of the fact that they intend to deal with the situation by a working order, are posing a problem for themselves.  I would like to know if this means that every application will be dealt with and examined by the Government and that every application will be decided on by the Government alone.  This is an impossible thing to do.  This type of arrangement could not work.  It is impossible to see how every application could be dealt with specifically and a definite answer given by the Government within a period.  We know that it often takes between six to eight months to decide such applications. We also know that the provisions of this Bill are limited to 12 months.  This tends to make one wonder whether this provision in the Bill is operable or not.  I should like to hear from the Minister how he intends to deal with those applications.</P>
    <P>The Government, in making this case, have the financial advisers and they have the important details regarding the structure of our economy. Those details possibly outweigh the arguments which I, as a Deputy who represents a constituency which has rather mixed feelings on this particular legislation, could adduce.  I support this legislation on the basis that the Government have greater knowledge and also because it is for the good of the economy.  I hope everybody else will think about this legislation in that light.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is no question of anybody going to jail.  Deputy Treacy implied that this was a bad thing.  I want to put it on the record of this House that I never want to see an Irish worker jailed for looking for his rights. <Col N="1702" /> It has not and I do not think it would ever be the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government to think in that manner. Reference was made to the ESB legislation. I should like the House to remember that on that occasion we had to consider the lives of those unfortunate people in hospital who were in no way responsible for the situation.  Their lives were our concern and no matter how callous a man might be surely he would consider that aspect of the matter.  I would not be a party to any kind of legislation the object of which was to jail Irish workers for seeking their rights.</P>
    <P>I am sure that a great number of Deputies like myself hope the provisions of this Bill will never have to be implemented and hope that the trade unions and the employers, even at this late stage, will save us the job of implementing such provisions.  We hope they will come together and hammer out some formula which can be acceptable to both sides.  This is the sensible solution which I hope will come about in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the efforts now being made by the Fianna Fáil Party is to curb inflation by means of a sane incomes and prices policy, and to ensure that what has been achieved will not be engulfed in the reckless inflationary turmoil which surrounds us. The future of the country and the prosperity of our young people are at stake. I would ask the Government, the employers, the trade unionists and all other workers to consider this before they take any retrograde action with regard to the implementation of future demands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at length on this Bill, as it has been debated pretty thoroughly by now.  However, there are a few points I should like to make.  First, this Bill is merely another indication of the total failure of Fianna Fáil economic policy not merely in the past year but over the past decade.  This measure has been introduced purely as a stop-gap measure, but I am not at all convinced and I doubt if anyone in the country will accept this measure as the final solution or the full remedy for the serious economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> All the ills which beset our economy can be traced back over the past six or seven years and can be traced back particularly to the complete failure of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  Had there been a proper economic policy which would have ensured the full development of all our resources and had there been a proper prices and incomes policy as outlined by Fine Gael away back in 1965, then not merely would this Bill not be necessary but the economy would be in much better shape than it is today.</P>
    <P>This Bill is typical of the many stop-gap measures and hotch-potch legislation we have had from Fianna Fáil over the past decade.  This measure has been dictated by political expediency. The Government allowed the economy to drift in a totally irresponsible manner, particularly over the past 12 months.  Every one of us recalls that earlier this year, perhaps for the first time in the history of this State, there was a most remarkable unanimity of opinion among economic experts and various commentators on economic matters.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Central Bank, the NIEC, the Economic and Social Research Institute, eminent economists like Professor Fogarty, all publicly warned the Government of the dangers of inflation which were then apparent. It was reasonable to assume that any responsible Government and any competent Minister for Finance would have taken the necessary corrective action to halt this inflationary spiral.  Had the corrective action been taken at the time of the last Budget, which would have been a relatively simple matter, no drastic action would have been necessary.  No such action was taken at the time of the last Budget with the result that the inflationary situation has worsened.  Therefore as a result, first of all, of the failure of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and, secondly the failure to take action last April, the cost of living has risen out of all proportion, so that many families are unable to buy what might well be regarded as the necessities of life rather than luxuries.  There are numerous examples. <Col N="1704" /> One which comes readily to mind is that of butter.  Where there are large families of young children the mother is unable to afford to buy butter and has to resort to artificial substitutes.</P>
    <P>One of the inevitable and tragic consequences of the failure of the Government to tackle courageously the problem of inflation 12 months ago is that rising prices have had serious repercussions on our tourist industry this season.  I can say without fear of contradiction that prices have been a very important factor in the difficult situation which has arisen in the tourist industry.  I was in Britain a fortnight ago and I took the trouble to travel from one end of the country to the other to have discussions with travel agents and others.  The general verdict in the British tourist market is that we are fast pricing ourselves out of existence.  If the Minister is not inclined to believe me he can easily do what I did; he can walk into any travel agency in Birmingham or Manchester and compare the cost of holidays in Ireland with the cost of holidays in Spain or anywhere else you like to mention.  Certainly so far as the British tourist market is concerned we are in serious trouble.  Action should have been taken long ago particularly on the question of prices.</P>
    <P>The repercussions of the inflationary spiral are making themselves felt in many sectors of manufacturing industry. Our unit costs of production in industry are increasing all the time and must have adverse effects on our exports. The fact that the economy has got out of control has led to a series of what I would describe as socioeconomic problems in that the income between the agricultural sector and the non-agricultural sector is widening all the time.  This has definitely led to an acceleration of rural depopulation and it may have very serious consequences for the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot deny that he and his Government have been warned time and again by various agricultural spokesmen about the ever widening gap between the incomes of the agricultural community and the nonagricultural community.  It is a serious problem and it can have widespread <Col N="1705" /> social repercussions.  The Minister is aware that incomes in agriculture have remained static while prices and costs of production have been increasing all the time.  I fail to understand why the Government did not face up to this situation in a responsible manner.  I do not believe for one moment that this Bill will rectify the economic problems which confront us at present.  I do not see how this Bill will be able to rectify the problem of prices in relation to the tourist industry, which I have already mentioned, or in relation to the continuing rise in unit costs of production in the manufacturing industry.  This Bill is not going to do anything to ensure that the agricultural section of our community will receive the basic social justice to which they are entitled.  I can see that the agricultural community will continue to be faced with rising prices and static incomes.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that this Bill is to me, at any rate, an inevitable consequence of the complete failure of Fianna Fáil economic policy over the last decade.  I recall in particular the total failure of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion which was supposed to be the greatest thing ever to hit this country.  It was supposed to be designed to ensure progress in all sectors of our economy but we found towards the end of the allotted five-year period that the targets had not been reached in any sector.  There was a full review of the performance of the economy under the Second Programme and the Third Programme was produced. This, of course, was an even greater fiasco than the Second Programme. As far as I am aware the Third Programme never got off the ground and no attempt was made to implement it.  There is no evidence in this Bill that the Government have even learned any lessons from the failure of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  No one knows where the Third Programme is&mdash;other than in the Library&mdash;and certainly there is no evidence of it having been implemented.</P>
    <P>While other factors have contributed to the present economic crisis I believe that basically and fundamentally all the problems of our economy can be <Col N="1706" /> traced to the failure of Fianna Fáil to formulate and implement a practical, comprehensive, realistic economic policy.  This is basic and fundamental not merely to economic progress but to social progress and to the creation of a society in which social justice will be seen to prevail.</P>
    <P>All the indicators were there last January, February and March and warnings were publicly issued.  There was a remarkable unanimity of opinion about the need for proper corrective action in the 1970 Budget.  The Minister for Finance chose to ignore all the advice he had been given by the economic experts and the many different organisations.  In March 1969 the then Minister for Finance went on radio and television and, without recalling his exact words, the gist of his message to the nation was that we were in trouble; belts would have to be tightened and there would have to be corrective action.  Lo and behold, in April of that year, just one month later, that same Minister for Finance came into this House and introduced a Budget which made no reference to his radio and television appearance a month before and we learned that the position was rosy again&mdash;the situation had, apparently, drastically changed in one month.  The truth was that the Dáil was dissolved a few weeks later and we had a general election.</P>
    <P>Since I came to this House in 1961 I can recall many other examples where political expediency seems to have been the main factor in determining Fianna Fáil thinking in regard to economic, financial and social problems. It is written in this Bill and it was in the Budget of 1969.  The outstanding example of political expediency was in 1963 when the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, introduced that famous White Paper &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo;.  It was a substantial booklet in which there was a complete review of the economy, the problems were spelled out and remedies were suggested. The message was the same message as Deputy Haughy gave us in 1969, that belts would have to be tightened.  A few months later there were two by-elections, one in Kildare and the other in Cork.  Lo and behold, &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo; was consigned to <Col N="1707" /> the waste paper basket, so to speak, and on the eve of polling in both those constituencies the Government did a complete turn-about.  I do not have to go into the details because they are well known.  The steps taken by Fianna Fáil in 1963 in order to win those two by-elections have had a direct bearing on the economic situation we find ourselves in now, just as had the 1969 Budget, the 1970 Budget and the failure of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>All these factors have been building up to the present disastrous economic situation.  In every budget speech I have made in the past nine years in this House I have said this: I believe it is an absolute fact that cannot be denied even by the Minister that until such time as we have a proper economic policy we shall be faced with a continuation of stop-gap measures, in most cases dictated by political expediency, and the economy will deteriorate all the time.  We shall have increased unemployment, accelerated emigration and a decline in farm incomes with all the repercussions these will have on the cost of living, the tourist and manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it, the Government are not capable of introducing a realistic economic policy combined with a proper incomes and prices policy such as was advocated in 1965 by Fine Gael.  Neither is the present Minister capable of introducing such a policy.  The best we can hope for is that the people will be given an opportunity in the very near future&mdash;I have no doubt that they will get it after the two by-elections&mdash;of having a Government that will be capable of designing and implementing a realistic economic and social policy which will put the nation on the road to progress.</P>
    <P>I shall not go in detail into the provisions of the Bill but how can the people have confidence in the Bill or the Minister introducing it when for all practical purposes, it is a wages and incomes freeze measure and when a few days before its introduction bus and rail fares were permitted to be increased by 45 per cent?  How can we accept the credibility of the Minister <Col N="1708" /> or the Bill in this situation?  This was the second increase in transport charges in 1970.  We had a substantial increase in bus and rail fares last June and we now have this 45 per cent increase.  The worst feature of it, particularly in regard to bus fares, is that it hits the poorest sections, those travelling from housing estates in Dublin or new satellite towns on the outskirts of Cork and Limerick and who must use buses to get to work. This involves severe hardship for them. It is totally irresponsible of the Government to permit this outrageous increase particularly when we had a similar substantial increase last June.</P>
    <P>We also had the announcement of a substantial increase in postal and telephone charges&mdash;I should more properly say an outrageous increase in the case of the postal charges, particularly, where it was 50 per cent, from 6d to 9d.  That is without precedent here or elsewhere in the world.  I cannot see how Fine Gael or any other party in the House could accept this Bill as a measure designed to effect what the Minister says it will effect.  I have no confidence in the measure; I reject it completely.  Neither I nor any of my colleagues have any confidence in the present Minister or the Government. All we can hope for is that the people of Donegal and South County Dublin will give this Government their answer and that the Government and the Taoiseach will get the message, get out and allow another Government to take over, a Government which will face their responsibilities courageously and produce the necessary economic and social legislation to put the country on the road to progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure reminds me of the proverbial bull in the china shop, the bull in this case being the Fianna Fáil Government and the china shop the field of industrial relations. The Government have certainly damaged the whole field of industrial relations and relationships in their approach to this matter.  There have been many years of long conferences and meetings in an effort to get better methods and improved living standards and productivity and efficiency and in this one measure the Government have <Col N="1709" /> undone in no uncertain way the good achieved over the years.  Some might dispute whether the amount of good done in industrial relations has been great, but I think anyone involved either on the employers' or the employees' side realises that a good deal of progress had been made.</P>
      <P>Obviously the Government were waiting for even the flimsiest excuse to act in this manner.  The manner in which the trade union movement handled claims in the past years, the way their members assented to package agreements providing for give and take showed the responsible attitude of the movement and the members generally.  We can pick extreme cases, but if we are to legislate for the very small minority of extreme cases we should not have to go to the length of upsetting all the relations that have been built up over the past number of years.  As I said, the Government jumped at the lamest of excuses in order to avail of this opportunity and they have now created a situation which it will take many years to rectify.</P>
      <P>One wonders what is the real purpose behind this Bill.  It certainly will not solve the problem that it is allegedly designed by the Minister for Finance to solve.  Every move in the introduction of this measure was motivated by a political decision.  We had the timing.  We had the announcement of the wage freeze coinciding with announcements that were being made in another part of this city in the hope obviously that one would play down the other.  This was a manoeuvre by the Government to help them in their difficulties at that time.  This is not the first time we have had experience of this kind of thing.  Neither will it be the last time on which we will see the economic situation manipulated for petty political advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious aspect of this measure is that it prevents trade unions from carrying on their work.  The trade union movement has not alone the right but the moral obligation to try to get the best possible living standards for its members.  It cannot allow any legislation, particularly legislation such as this, to cut across that very serious obligation.  When we think of the sacrifices that were made to <Col N="1710" /> achieve that right and when we think of the men who fought to achieve the freedom we have, men like James Connolly, we wonder what their reaction would be.  We wonder what would James Connolly think of a measure such as this, introduced by a native parliament in the setting up of which he played a major part.  One would, I think, have to forgive him if he felt sorry for providing this opportunity for a native Government to bring in a measure such as this.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement has a moral obligation to ensure that its members have a decent living wage. If we saw that the workers had a decent living wage then we might see some sense or some reason in these proposals, but the fact of the matter is that the majority of the workers have not got a decent living wage and this Bill will not help them in any way; in fact, it will make their position worse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley talked about workers in a certain industry with weekly wages of £50 to £70.  This is the type of deliberate distortion carried on in an effort to try to justify this Bill. When we see the weakness of the arguments put forward to try to justify the Bill we realise that there is really no sustainable case for the Bill.  One of Deputy Foley's arguments was that certain workers were getting £50 to £70 per week.  This may be the case in certain skilled grades and, if these workers are getting that money, then they are certainly earning every penny of it because it is obviously made up by their working long hours into the night when the rest of the community are enjoying themselves and when their employers are possibly wining and dining in some posh hotel.  These skilled men and, possibly, unskilled men too are working around the clock to keep the economy going.</P>
    <P>I know from experience that, generally speaking, workers do not want to work overtime at night or at weekends, no matter what payment they get for it.  Only last Monday evening in my capacity as a trade union official I had a meeting with a section of union members; the employer had asked me to talk to the <Col N="1711" /> members to try to get them to do overtime.  When we have the cynical approach of Deputy Foley held out as a justification for this measure we see the complete lack of any case for this Bill.  No matter what Fianna Fáil think, no matter what any individual thinks, any man, be he skilled or unskilled, who earns this money earns every penny of it.  If workers work on shift work, if they work long overtime, if they work on Saturdays and Sundays and bank holidays, they have to be paid for that work and the work must be necessary because no employer uses overtime if he can possibly avoid it.  I hope we will hear no more of this kind of argument levelled against unfortunate workers who are compelled in most cases to do long hours, sacrificing their home life and their social life, while well-heeled directors and so forth are possibly wining and dining their time away.</P>
    <P>I should like to pose one question to the Minister: what would happen if every worker decided not to work overtime?  The economy would collapse. Economic activity would grind to a halt.  It is very important that workers in certain industries should do overtime and when they do overtime they are obliging the whole economy and not just their own particular industry. Because they are doing that their earnings should not then be held up as an excuse for limiting earnings generally.  Out of the £50 mentioned by Deputy Foley quite a slice goes back to the Exchequer in direct and in indirect taxation.  I recall Deputy Andrews some time ago saying that the more money the workers have the better because more would be spent on consumer goods and more money would be secured by way of indirect taxation.  I was interested to hear the Deputy's remarks on that occasion and I hope that he still holds that view. Some members of his party do not share it.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill constitute, in effect, a wage freeze It is provided that as from the 16th October, 1970, increases in excess of a certain limit must not be granted.  There is nothing in the Bill to help the underpaid and the lower paid worker.  Members <Col N="1712" /> of the Government party may try to justify the Bill on the grounds that it helps the lower paid and the social welfare recipients.  There is no section in the Bill to help them and, indeed, it will make life more difficult for them.</P>
    <P>There was mention at one time of 6 per cent but there is no guarantee that this will be paid to the worker.  It is not stated in the Bill that if an employer does not give a minimum of 6 per cent he will be fined.  Therefore, it is obviously a wage freeze.  It does not tackle the problem of low incomes and bad working conditions.  It does not help those people.  In fact, it makes their position much worse and renders impossible the prospect of improving their lot.</P>
    <P>The system of free collective bargaining is not perfect but that is not the fault of those involved in it.  It is the fault of the system of government that has operated here for the past 15 or 16 years.  Many social welfare recipients will be affected adversely by the provisions of this Bill.  Many old age pensioners and sick people are helped by members of their families who are in gainful employment.  However, the latter will not have any extra money to help the less fortunate members of their families who may be in bad health or who may be old.  The underpaid worker will continue to be underpaid but now his employer will have the full legal protection of the courts and the protection of an Act of this Parliament in his attempts to keep the employee underpaid.</P>
    <P>We have not yet reached the stage where all of our workers have a just wage.  Quite the opposite is the case. When workers in a strong bargaining position decide to refrain from taking more of the national cake than their bargaining position could secure for them, they know there is no guarantee that what they leave will be distributed to the more needy sections of the community. They have no guarantee that that will be done.  In fact, it is never done.</P>
    <P>Because of our system it is true to say that the more money the worker who is in a strong bargaining position receives, correspondingly, the man in the weaker bargaining position will <Col N="1713" /> get more.  When the man in a strong position gets an increase of, say, £3 per week the man in the weaker position can expect £2 or 30s.  However, when the man in the strong bargaining position receives only 30s the person in the weak position will be lucky to get 10s or 15s.</P>
    <P>There is no point in supporters of this Bill saying that it will help the underpaid and the lower paid.  Experience has shown that while we have this kind of Government policy the position will be that those who refrain from taking more of the national cake will not be leaving it for those for whom they had intended to leave it, but rather for those least in need of it. In present circumstances, the arguments based on that type of case do not stand up to the experience of the recent or distant past.  Because of the lack of any Government policy for the lower-paid worker, the only hope for him is that organised workers in a strong bargaining position will get the most they can.  The more they get the more the people in the weak position can hope to get; they might get one-half of what the strong, organised people get.  That is their only hope because of the lack of Government policy.</P>
    <P>If we can bring in legislation like this to ensure that increases should not or must not be given, surely the practicality of bringing in legislation to ensure that even the minimum standards of social justice are complied with should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the Government or the Minister for Finance.  The Minister may point to last year's agreement in the public service and to the current agreement, which was almost not current, as examples of what Government policy is in relation to the lowly-paid manual workers.  Here again, their increases were many years overdue.  No one could dispute the fact that the manual workers in the Government service, such as roadworkers, forestry workers, Office of Public Works roadworkers under local authorities, who had wages which were subject to sanction by the Department of Local Government, manual unskilled workers in the health services, such as <Col N="1714" /> hospital porters, gardeners and groundsmen were all the worst paid workers in the country.  The roadworker was the worst paid worker.  He is not much better now, but all these groups of workers whom I have mentioned were very badly paid.  Their conditions of employment were bad.  It goes without saying that their wages are still bad. It is impossible to negotiate with Government Departments on certain aspects of conditions of employment.  The Public Services Agreement in 1968-69 was the first attempt after many years of agitation and pressure, to come to grips with this problem.  This more recent agreement is also an improvement on the situation.  There was so much leeway to be made up on these rates of pay and conditions of employment of manual workers in the public service that even these recent improvements, which are large by comparison with what were granted in other years, do not provide the workers with a living wage.</P>
    <P>When one considers that the original attempt of the Minister was to take from these roadworkers and forestry workers, who are out in all kinds of weather, a sum of 10s we can understand the mentality behind this type of legislation.  The present inflationary situation has been brought about by the Fianna Fáil Government.  They have used the Budgets&mdash;I cannot call them annual Budgets because they are no longer annual Budgets, but almost monthly Budgets over the last six months&mdash;and have juggled them for political advantage.  We saw the juggling in the 1969 Budget for the subsequent general election.  We saw the juggling done this year.  In fact, in all three Budgets&mdash;and we will have to call the postal increases a Budget because they were a measure to extract more revenue from the people&mdash;every available item that the Government could increase in price has been increased. They have used every opportunity in the last six months to increase the prices and to extract the maximum amount of taxation from the people. It is hard to think of anything which they have overlooked.  They have hit at everything.  Having done that, they say nobody else can get anything.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government can <Col N="1715" /> only create other problems in putting forward solutions for the problems which exist.  The wage increases which have taken place over the past number of years have been very necessary.  The spectacular increases in the cost of living have justified these wage increases. The cost of every essential item has been raised.  The Government lost no opportunity to get an increase from the consumers and the wage-earners. In fact, ten years ago less than one person in four paid income tax. Today more than three people out of four pay income tax.  This does not necessarily mean that the people are better off.  Rising costs have kept the standard of living still low by the standards of countries in Europe or elsewhere If there is a crisis, it is due to the lack of Government here.</P>
    <P>We were accused by a previous Fianna Fáil speaker of trying to discredit the Government.  I do not think there is any need to try to discredit the Government because they have well and truly discredited themselves.  Any measure put forward by them must be suspect.  Any discreditable person who tries to sell anything&mdash;in this case, the customer is the general public and the sellers are the Government&mdash;finds it very hard to do so and it is the same with the Government.  They are discredited salesmen who are trying to sell this Bill to the workers and to the people in general.  They will find it a very difficult job to fool the people this time.  This would be a difficult enough Bill for any Government with good standing in the country to try to put across.  I do not think a Government in good standing would attempt to put across proposals such as those contained in this Bill but, even if they did, it would be difficult enough for them to sell it to the people.  However, how can a discredited Government, a Government torn internally, a Government who have shown they cannot be relied on in what they say, a Government who have been shown to say completely opposite things on the same subject, how can a Government like that hope to get the confidence of the people and acceptance of a very retrograde measure such as this?  It is just not possible, particularly when it embodies <Col N="1716" /> powers which put the Minister in the position that he can and will be subject to political pressure.  It gives far-reaching powers to the Minister that he can wield without reference to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that section 22 gives the Minister power to override the authority of the Dáil and that power like this given to a normal Government in normal circumstances might be all right but that to give it to a Government such as Fianna Fáil in present circumstances would certainly not be all right.  This is something we shall fight very hard on Committee Stage if the Minister gets even that far with this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, provisions in this Bill in relation to price control and other controls.  However, there are many way in which they can be circumvented. Deputy Foley pin-pointed many of the ways in which they can be circumvented.  I agree with him that there is really no protection for the consumer in the provisions put forward here.  In practice, they will prove well and truly capable of being circumvented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the prohibition on increases of rent.  A landlord can say to a tenant: &ldquo;I am sorry.  I have to <Col N="1717" /> give you a week's notice or a month's notice.  I want this house.&rdquo; The tenant must get out and the landlord can make an arrangement with a new tenant and get more rent for the same house.  That is an example.  There are many ways in which one can get around the provision.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that at least the Fianna Fáil Government have learned their lesson about proposals to jail workers.  This was a feature of previous legislation of this kind by the Government.  It is not a feature now, not because they have got softer on the issue but simply because they know it is just not workable.  The penalties here will most certainly be tried but there is no law the Government can pass&mdash;thank God&mdash;that can compel a worker to get up in the morning and go out to work.</P>
    <P>The Government know the practicality of the situation.  The Government most certainly will come up against it if this Bill is ever enacted.  There is no provision in it, either, for reward for additional skill or technique, for arrangements for greater efficiency.  In fact, one could go through the Bill and pick out the anomalies and the injustices, the latter being more serious than the anomalies.  The Bill is riddled with injustices of one kind or another, particularly in relation to the underpaid worker, the man in the weak bargaining position, who now will have taken from him the only yardstick he had.</P>
    <P>It is a sorry day when a Government, having made such a mess of things, can now offer only this type of solution to the difficulties which they have created.  Again, it is a question of asking one section of the community, the people who have to depend on a weekly wage, to get the Government out of the difficulty they have got themselves and the country into.</P>
    <P>We can see coming to nothing the great achievements reached in industrial relations, not because of any failings as between employers and employees but simply because of bad government. The excuse that the Bill is necessary because of certain pending wage demands has been shown to be ridiculous because the one demand that <Col N="1718" /> was mentioned has been dealt with. Demands are one thing, settlements another.  The trade union movement has shown itself to be most responsible, in its negotiations, in its settlements. It has always agreed to give in return measures to increase efficiency and productivity.</P>
    <P>Is there not a temptation in this legislation for employers, in order to get a few extra pounds, to cut down on the employment content in industry?  Here they might see a saving and we could find redundancy leading directly from that, and consequent stagnation in the economy.  This will mean that we will have a fall in employment as a further consequence of further damage to the economy.  I hope, therefore, it will not be too long until we have a Government who will take this measure from the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>I take my cue from the last speaker who said he wanted a change of Government and that the new Government who would come in would work miracles.  I was in this House when the inter-Party Government were here.  Instead of facing up to their responsibilities they went to the country.  I remember when there were 100,000 people unemployed, when there were 1,800 houses unoccupied in Dublin and when builders from all over the city and county had to go to every country in the world to make a living. There was not the price of a bag of cement left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now they tell us they were facing up to their responsibilities.  We did not wish to introduce this legislation but I want to compliment the Minister for Finance for his efforts to meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in an effort to bring about settlement through goodwill.  I hope we shall continue in that way, but we have to face up to our responsibilities to the country.  We are concerned about the workers.  We are trying to keep them in employment and we will not throw in the sponge in the same way as the inter-Party Government did.  We are trying to bring reason, common understanding <Col N="1719" /> and goodwill into industrial relations to try to save this country.  If it is a mortal sin to try to save the country, to protect the employment of the people, then we are guilty of a mortal sin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it very clear at the outset that anything I may say is not to be taken as a criticism of or a reflection on the Garda force. On the contrary, I want to compliment them on doing a good job under very difficult conditions.  Indeed, I have discussed this matter with senior officers of the force and with ordinary members, and they told me they feel frustrated by regulations.  One man said to me that their work is being increased day after day, practically, and their numbers are getting fewer.  They find it very difficult to give a good service under those circumstances.  Indeed, that is not like the force because they go out of their way, and have always done so, to do their best to give a very efficient service.</P>
      <P>At the moment the people of Charleville are up in arms against the regulations which have created this problem.  They are disturbed and they have every reason to be.  Their garda barracks is closed for 17 hours out of the 24.  The Minister is well aware that Charleville is an expanding town with a population of something like 2,500.  We must face up to the fact, unfortunately, that crimes of violence and robbery and vandalism and breaches of the peace are on the increase everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> A while ago I read in the <i>Evening Herald</i> what was said by the Garda Commissioner, Mr. J. Weymes, at a passing out parade at the Garda Training centre.  The report reads:</P>
    <P>We are living in a time of great change where members of our society are becoming increasingly aware of their rights.  Emphasising the importance of courtesy at all times to the public, he stressed that the prevention of crime is far more important than the apprehension of a criminal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are very wise words coming from the Commissioner. I want to ask the Minister how can crime be prevented in the absence of the Garda Síochána?  At the moment throughout the country their numbers are being reduced.  I do not know whether this was a matter of economics or whether it was the brain child of someone in his Department who suggested carrying out a survey &mdash;this was in the time of the Minister's predecessor, of course&mdash;and they worked with maps and suggested we could do without this or that barracks.  Despite that, the Minister told us that this will lead to a more efficient service which is ridiculous. If the Garda Síochána are not stationed in rural areas they cannot prevent crime.  In reply to a question the Minister said that 42 per cent of crimes of all descriptions within the city and county go undetected.  That is practically half of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back again to the plight of Charleville.  Last week the Minister told me and the House that the reduction in the number of hours the barracks are open gave a more efficient service.  I would agree with him up to a point.  There are probably more men on the beat but there is a <Col N="1721" /> complete lack of communication between the barracks and the members of the force even when they are needed in an emergency.  There is a notice in the station window, I think, telling them to ring the district headquarters in Mallow.  The Minister knows that Mallow is a very big district and that there is only one squad car there.  If you were lucky with the phone system and got through to Mallow you might be told that the car was not available. It is not on a radio link and it could be anywhere in a vast area.  Consequently, the unfortunate person at the other end of the phone in Charleville has no hope of getting any help.</P>
    <P>In order to highlight that I want to tell the House that there was a meeting in Charleville recently to which all public representatives were invited.  At that protest meeting there were protests from all types of people.  I took special note of one complaint.  One evening some time previously there was a row in a village near Charleville.  The people tried to get through to Mallow but were unable to do so.  Finally they enlisted the aid of the local county councillor and he succeeded, after a time, in getting through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He must be powerful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>He pointed out that there was likely to be a serious row in the locality where there was a threat of firearms being used.  It is hard to credit that nobody came out to inquire into the problem or to find out if anybody was shot until four o'clock the following evening.  That is the service the Minister is giving the people and defending in this House.  I can tell him another story.  In Charleville a housewife was awakened recently and saw from her bedroom window a window being broken and a burglary about to take place across the street. She tried to telephone the gardaí at Mallow and failed the first time; she got through at a second attempt and when somebody arrived the burglary had taken place and the birds had flown.  That is the service Charleville has now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will tell me that it is because the gardaí must <Col N="1722" /> have the same as all other sections of the community&mdash;leisure and time off, in other words a five-day week.  Nobody objects to that, they are entitled to it, but the machinery of the civic administration and the protection of the public must be kept in operation just as well as the machinery of industry where they have a five-day week. I am well aware that the Minister and his expert advisers are completely out of touch with the situation that exists not alone in Charleville but in many rural areas.  The people there are just as entitled to a service as the people in this city.  I am appealing to the Minister, despite what his advisers tell him, to have another look at this situation and if it is necessary to strengthen the force and to increase its numbers substantially that must be faced up to immediately.  If it is a question of money it should and must be found.  Otherwise, law and order will break down completely in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Charleville was the subject of my question.  Charleville is entitled to more gardaí.  It has a large population. It has industries working 24 hours a day.  It is on the main road between Cork and Limerick where there are all sorts of emergencies at all times.  The least that should be done there is that arrangements should be made for a barrack orderly to be on duty at all hours in the station.  When that is done the Minister should have a further look at the question of strengthening the force generally, not just there but in all rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleague, Deputy Burton, in appealing to the Minister to reconsider his and his Department's attitude towards Charleville Garda station.  I remember the ex-Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, speaking in Charleville and saying that he was glad to say that Charleville was one of the up and coming towns in County Cork.  That was the day he opened the extension to the Golden Vale cheese factory.  That was not many years ago.  Everyone, including Deputy Burton and myself, Deputy Meaney, Deputy Forde and others knows that, thanks be to God, Charleville is an up and coming town, <Col N="1723" /> yet, here we are in November, 1970, and the Minister and his advisers decide that now Charleville will have a lesser Garda service than it ever had before.</P>
      <P>Here is a glaring case of injustice and mismanagement on the part of the Minister's Department.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not accusing the Minister; I am accusing his Department in regard to their advice in this case.  Can anyone imagine a town with a growing population of 2,500 to 3,000 people being left with a Garda station which is closed for a certain number of hours each day and a notice put up in the window to ring a certain number?  This is not only going too far in Charleville, it is going too far in Fermoy also and all over the country.  That is why, as a Corkman, I want to join with Deputy Burton in asking here, in the name of common sense, will the Minister get on with the job and give service and protection to the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to say, in reply to both Deputies who have spoken, is that there is no question of some change having been made in recent times&mdash;when I speak of recent times I mean recent months or even in the last year&mdash;in relation to the policing of Charleville.  As I pointed out last week in reply to a question asked by Deputy Burton, the present hours during which Charleville garda station is open were fixed on the 27th January, 1967.  That is more than three years and nine months ago.  There has been no change since nor has there been any change in the strength of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the same position has existed and has continued to exist in Charleville for a period of almost four years.  So far as I am aware, there was no complaint about this station until the beginning of last month and I find it difficult to understand why suddenly, after its successful operation for three years and nine months, the service provided by the gardaí at Charleville should now be alleged to be inadequate or unsatisfactory in some way.  I cannot accept that this is so.  In the short time that was available to me this <Col N="1724" /> evening I recapped as far as I could on the strength of Charleville station. At present the strength of the station is one Sergeant and five Gardaí.  The figures that I could obtain readily tonight unfortunately go back only six years to 1964.  I find that the strength was the same then.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no question whatever of any reduction either in opening hours or in strength at Charleville as seems to have been alleged tonight.  In the course of his remarks Deputy Burton said that the people of Charleville are up in arms against the regulations that created this problem. Although the Deputy spoke for more than 15 minutes, at no time did he specify what these alleged regulations are supposed to be.  I know of no regulations that are creating this problem. There is the general overall situation of manpower and financial resources in this country, whether it be in relation to the gardaí or to any other organisation, but there is no evidence whatever of any lessening of the service given in Charleville in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be alleged by some people and, I think, implied in what Deputy Burton said, that because a station is not open 24 hours a day&mdash;it may be open as in this case for only seven hours a day during the normal office hours of 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. &mdash;there is no proper police service for the town.  In fact, the position is that the whole point of closing the station outside these adequate office hours was to enable a greater and more effective police service to be provided.  The old system of policing as we had it, and as we inherited it, was that a barrack orderly would be on duty all the time. The station orderly can contribute very little to the policing of the town or district in which he is on duty.</P>

      <P>He conveys information to district headquarters but in the present situation any member of the public can convey information direct to district headquarters himself and the public are given every encouragement to do so.  It is possible for them to reach the district headquarters at least as quickly as going to a station and asking the man on duty there to act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be an additional man on the beat.  The town of Charleville, in so far as I know it, is not so large that the one or two men, as the case may be, who are on the beat and who would otherwise not be on the beat if they had to serve as barrack orderlies, are readily available for emergencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, the six gardaí who are stationed at Charleville are living in or close to the town so that, if an emergency or a serious situation should arise, it is open to any member of the public to go to their homes.  I am sure that in the case of an emergency, the vast majority of members of the Garda Síochána would respond immediately to the situation. There is no doubt about that.  The important thing to remember is that, instead of a man sitting in a station for many hours at night, he is out on the beat preventing crime and keeping the peace in the town so that he is far more effective and far more efficient than if he were doing what the Deputies opposite seem to imply that he should be doing.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Conroy Commission have been in effect since the 1st April, 1970.  These recommendations created immense problems for me, for my Department and for the administration of the force in general because the Garda hours were reduced by one-sixth which, in effect, means a one-sixth reduction in the strength of the force.  We have approached this situation in many ways in endeavouring to overcome the problems that were created.  We do not grudge the gardaí the concessions given to them under the Conroy Report, which we readily implemented, but nobody denies that immense problems were created for me, for my Department and for my predecessor and these problems were created almost overnight by the revolutionary nature of the recommendations. These recommendations have now been in force for over six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major changes in the administration of a force of the nature of the Garda Síochána which have been administered previously under somewhat outdated regulations inevitably mean that various teething troubles would arise.  Unquestionably we have had problems, problems that were <Col N="1727" /> difficult and serious, but I have been trying to solve them during the past six months.  We are doing this in a reasonable way.  We must be reasonable to the gardaí.  We must give them reasonable time off and reasonable facilities such as are enjoyed by other members of the community at present.  We must provide a reasonable service but we must provide that service at a reasonable cost to the taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been doing the best we can in difficult circumstances. <Col N="1728" /> It would be very easy for me as Minister for Justice to come in here and say that I will increase the force tomorrow morning by x men but the cost of a garda in pay and pensionability alone, not to mention the other extras that are inevitable, is £31 a week.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, the Government have under urgent consideration the question of a possible increase in the force in the not too distant future. As well as that, we have taken a large number of men off non-police duties and put them on police duties during the past six months.  In that way, we have increased the effective strength of the force very considerably.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, the 19th November, 1970.</P>
