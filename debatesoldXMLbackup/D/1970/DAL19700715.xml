      <P>I do not propose to appoint a Minister for Tourism to replace Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that there is grave dissatisfaction among people working in the tourist industry with the operations of Bord Fáilte and that many people in the industry consider Bord Fáilte to be at this stage of its existence very much a hidebound bureaucracy accountable to nobody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there are very many people in the tourist industry dissatisfied with Bord Fáilte's functioning but I do know that Bord Fáilte is regarded as one of the foremost tourist organisations in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there appears to be a breakdown in communication between Bord Fáilte and the people engaged in the tourist industry?  There has been considerable criticism of the poor communication between Bord Fáilte and hoteliers, guesthouse owners and so on.  Will the Taoiseach look into this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first complaint <Col N="1106" /> I have received but the Minister for Transport and Power is in the process of putting the Tourist Traffic Bill through the House and perhaps he will expand on the position between the tourist industry and the board and on what the long-term prospects will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that some hospitals appear to be exercising discrimination against Irish nurses trained in England by giving preference to nurses trained in Ireland; and whether he will investigate this matter with a view to ensuring equality of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information which would support the suggestion contained in the question.  If the Deputy will furnish me with evidence of discrimination of the kind referred to, I shall take the matter up with the health authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that very many girls have no option but to go to England for training as nurses because of the acute shortage of places in Irish hospitals and will he not take steps to remedy the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a much more complicated matter than is indicated by the Deputy.  A number of Irish student nurses go to England to complete their training and some of them come back.  Some of these go back to England but, so far as the health authorities are concerned, there are regulations which ensure that vacancies are published in regional newspapers and there is a selection board procedure. I have not had any complaints of this kind.  I should need to have specific complaints to find out whether Irish based nurses are not having as good a chance of entering the service of health authority hospitals as those who make application from abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the House on 12th February that agreement in principle had been reached regarding the creation of a Chair of Psychiatry at University College, Galway.  It is intended that the person appointed professor of psychiatry will also act as clinical director in charge of a new professorial psychiatric unit which is being provided by the health authority at the Regional Hospital, Galway. Draft qualifications, duties and particulars of office for the post of clinical director under the health authority are at present being examined by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, since school medical inspections were first carried out, he has investigated why a mere 30 per cent of children are examined each year; what effective steps are to be taken to see that the 70 per cent of children denied these health safeguards are given them; and why the number of school medical inspections carried out has fallen during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 30 per cent of the national school population receive school medical examinations in accordance with the existing regulations which require a child to have three such examinations during his national school career.  Three routine medical examinations for each child was accepted both here and in Britain as a reasonable target for a preventive health service designed to detect unknown or untreated ailments.</P>
      <P>I have already announced my plans for progressively improving the school health service from October next.  I envisage that more frequent visits by the doctors to the schools and greater involvement of parents, teachers and district nurses in the service, should ensure that children needing attention come to notice at the earliest possible stage.</P>
      <P>The number of children examined under the school health service in 1969 showed an increase of 6,000 over the previous year, while the proportion of national schools visited rose marginally.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Health Authority offers treatment facilities to drug addicts through its general psychiatric services.  In-patient treatment, as required, is provided in the health authority's psychiatric hospitals and treatment and advice is also given at out-patient psychiatric clinics.</P>
      <P>The health authority, in collaboration with Jervis Street hospital authority, operates a special drugs advisory and treatment service at Jervis Street Hospital.  I have approved a proposal from Dublin Health Authority to operate an adolescent centre, including treatment for drug abusers, in the authority's new buildings at Ushers Island and the provision of a high security unit for the treatment of drug abusers is at present being actively considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputies are referring to the working party on drug abuse.  As I indicated in a reply to a question on 5th May, 1970, I expect to receive the final recommendations of the working party later this year.</P>
      <P>A statement was issued on 3rd November, 1969, on my behalf, by the Government Information Bureau regarding interim recommendations made to me by the working party and the action taken thereon.</P>
      <P>The following is the position:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The working party recommended that proposed legislation, which I had announced, for dealing with the unauthorised possession of certain drugs should be enacted as soon as possible.  They also endorsed the action taken by me with a view to restricting the use of amphetamines in medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unauthorised possession of certain classes of drugs not covered by the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, (e.g. amphetamines, LSD and barbiturates) <Col N="1110" /> is now an offence under the Health (Possession of Controlled Substances) Regulations, 1970, which came into operation on 18th May, 1970.  The regulations were made under section 78 of the Health Act, 1970.  These statutory controls are intended as an interim measure pending the enactment of legislation containing more comprehensive measures for the control of drug abuse.  This legislation is at present in course of preparation.  The Medical Preparations (Control of Amphetamine) Regulations, 1969, made early in December, 1969, prohibit generally the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of amphetamines, and preparations containing such substances.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the arrangements made under the regulations, stocks of amphetamines held by retail chemists, health authorities, hospitals etc. throughout the country have been gathered in one centre for safe-keeping and further disposal.</P>
    <P>(b)  The working party supported the measures taken by my Department, some of which were the subject of special recommendations by them, to ensure security against theft and pilferage of drugs liable to abuse from various sources, e.g., hospitals, health authorities, manufacturers, pharmacies, etc.  The general position in this respect is being kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>(c)  Joint discussions have been held between the appropriate Government Departments regarding the measures to be taken in relation to the smuggling of drugs into this country.  Further discussions are being arranged.</P>
    <P>(d)  The strength of the Garda Drug Squad has been substantially increased with the assignment of additional personnel and I understand that arrangements have been made for their special training.</P>
    <P>(e)  The position regarding the use of forged prescriptions by persons endeavouring to obtain drugs has been kept under review; and retail pharmacists in the Dublin area were specially alerted in the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> (f)  I have dealt with the question of treatment facilities for persons dependent on drugs in my reply today to Question No. 6 by Deputy Doctor Noël Browne.</P>
    <P>(g)  My Department have taken steps with a view to the establishment of a system of registration of persons dependent on drugs, as recommended by the working party.</P>

      <P>Grants given by my Department for constructional projects relate to harbours and the improvement of bog roads to the small turf-burning electricity generating stations. No savings in relation to these grants are expected in the current year as a result of the cement strike.</P>
      <P>The only grant schemes administered by the State bodies under the aegis of my Department in which constructional work is involved are the holiday accommodation and resort development schemes administered by Bord Fáilte Éireann.  The board have informed me that they do not anticipate any savings as a result of the strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware that, in spite of the fact that 1970 may not be a good year for tourism, Bord Fáilte is cutting back on its marketing activities because of budgetary difficulties; if he will state the amount being spent by Bord Fáilte on marketing in the current year bearing in mind that a total of £2.6 million is being voted for the development of accommodation and resorts in Ireland; and whether he proposes to increase the grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte so that the board may step up the marketing <Col N="1112" /> activities this year in view of the adverse factors currently affecting Irish tourism.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The marketing activities of Bord Fáilte are financed from the grant-in-aid for administration, operational and general expenses of the board.  This year the level of funds to be provided for this grant-in-aid is £2.95 million, an increase of £200,000 on 1969-70. The allocation of these funds is a function of Bord Fáilte.  I am informed by the board that in the current financial year they propose to spend £1,786,000 on marketing and that, in the case of Germany, there will be a reduction of 6 per cent on the 1969-70 allocation.</P>
      <P>I met the board of Bord Fáilte on last Wednesday, 8th July, and asked them to carry out an urgent and full appraisal of their activities in the light of the problems facing the tourist industry with a view to making any changes which appeared necessary to ensure the continued expansion of our tourist income.  On last Friday, 10th July, I met a deputation from the Irish Hotels Federation to discuss the planning and proper organisation of tourist development for the coming years.  At both meetings we had a constructive exchange of views as a result of which the board and the federation undertook to submit to me as soon as possible reports in relation to the development of tourism not alone for next year but for the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of these discussions both organisations were agreed that it would be unrealistic at this period of <Col N="1113" /> the year to embark on a special marketing campaign for the 1970 season.  Bord Fáilte, however, are now making a special effort to encourage Irish people to holiday in their own country this year.</P>
    <P>I shall be reviewing the outlook for tourism in the coming years in the light of these reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether any additional funds are being allocated now to Bord Fáilte to enable them to carry out the special effort to which he has referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to know the direction in which we shall allocate any additional funds in the future and it is to this I have directed the attention of Bord Fáilte, to the preparation of an up-to-date realistic appraisal of where we are going in the coming years with a view to allocating funds in the best possible way.  I shall be expanding on this matter, as the Taoiseach has said, in the course of the debate on the Tourist Traffic Bill which is currently before the House and the Second Stage of which I hope to take next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the total amount of money allocated to Bord Fáilte for the coming year for promotional purposes shows a reduction of £100,000 on the amount which was available last year&mdash;£1.8 million last year, £1.7 million this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  As far as the Government are concerned, there is an increase of £200,000 on the previous year in the allocation to Bord Fáilte.  The allocation of these funds is a matter for Bord Fáilte.  This is one of the matters we discussed at our meeting last week &mdash; the allocation of funds in the best possible way from the point of view of developing tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the net result is that Bord Fáilte have £100,000 less this year for promotional purposes than they had last year?  Due to factors which were there this year was there not a castiron case for giving them an extra subvention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is <Col N="1114" /> missing my point.  The Government allocation to Bord Fáilte was increased by £200,000.  The allocation of increased overall funds made available to Bord Fáilte by the Government is a matter for Bord Fáilte.  This is one of the very pertinent questions I discussed with them last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the extra £200,000 has been largely absorbed by rising costs and that it was necessary to meet the increased costs falling to be met by Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a debatable matter.  At any rate the House can be assured that we had a very full and frank appraisal of the whole situation at our meeting last week and at my meeting with the Irish Hotels Federation. I am confident we can evolve a programme for next year and the coming years that will be more realistic than heretofore.</P>

Is the Minister not aware that we do not know how Bord Fáilte disburses its funds?

This still applies and is equally true of the effects of the closure on the general level of business activity.

      <P>Two head guides and four guides have recently been appointed at the Rock of Cashel for the current tourist season. The posts were open to candidates from the locality who are conversant with local history, especially the history of the Rock of Cashel, are reasonably fluent in Irish, have a good speaking voice and a pleasant friendly manner. A conversational knowledge of one continental language was desirable but not essential.</P>
      <P>The posts were advertised locally. There were 27 applicants for the posts of guide, and two for the posts of head guide.  All applicants were called for interview.  Two did not attend.  The interviews were conducted by representatives of the Commissioners of Public Works and of the South Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation on whose recommendation the appointments were made.  I am not aware of any concern in Cashel arising from these appointments and I do not consider it necessary to hold a public inquiry into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on 11th June last regarding the average time between takeover of an estate and its division.  As I indicated then, there are many considerations which must be taken into account in deciding how soon lands can be divided; the date of possession of an estate is not always the determining factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where acquired land is intended for locals, it is divided as soon as possible after possession is obtained.  In the case of lands destined for migrants, buildings must be erected and other necessary improvements works carried out before division.  In this connection I would mention that such operations <Col N="1128" /> this year were seriously affected by the cement strike.</P>
    <P>The speedy allocation of lands on hands &mdash; in County Meath as elsewhere &mdash; is high on the Land Commission's list of priorities but the Deputy will appreciate that circumstances do not always permit of the disposal of lands as quickly as would be wished.  I might add that an aggregate of some 6,500 acres has been allotted in County Meath over the past three years.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider that it is rather unreasonable that farms which were taken over in County Meath over three years ago are still in the possession of the Land Commission, who are setting the land, although this was the reason why the land was originally taken over, because the holders were not making a proper use of it?  Would he not agree that it is a poor answer to say that the cement strike is holding up the division of land in view of the fact that the strike occurred this year while the land had been in possession of the Land Commission for over two years before the strike occurred?</P>

      <P>For the economic and proper working of an allotment it is desirable that it should be within a reasonable distance of the allottee's residence.  Such distance has been accepted as about one mile in the case of an enlargement and about half a mile in the case of an accommodation plot.  Experience has shown that this practice is reasonable and satisfactory and, in general, I feel it is true to say that the nearer an owner resides to his farm property the better it is worked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this limit of half a mile for accommodation plots and one mile for enlargement of holdings was fixed in the era of the donkey and cart and in view of mechanisation that the areas could be extended reasonably to five miles?  I am sure the Minister has at the back of his mind the fact that this would increase the number of applicants entitled to get holdings but I think he should look into the matter. I am not asking him to give a decision off the cuff but perhaps he would investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Pending clearance of title by the owner, the Land Commission took possession of this 64 acre property, on a provisional letting, in August, 1966. Plans for division have now been approved and I understand that discussions on the matter are in progress between the Land Commission and the selected allottees.  In fact, I am informed that the land is being offered at a price which does not cover its cost to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The determination of the price at which land shall be allotted is a matter reserved to the commissioners.</P>
      <P>Resale price is normally based on the amount paid for the land and the cost of any necessary improvements. The rents received for lettings have no bearing on the matter.  In any case, I understand that the rents received by the Land Commission in this case did not represent the normal letting value of the lands.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary, in the general interest, to keep capital losses on resale of land down to a minimum and to recover improvement costs as far as is reasonably practicable.</P>

If the Department can provide any assistance at all in the solution of this very serious problem in the Tipperary town area we will be very glad to do so.  The Deputy must remember that the co-operatives involved are the properties of the shareholder farmers.  The Department are not in a position and do not wish to issue instructions to them.  The co-operatives and the farmer shareholders are the masters of their own businesses and while the Department are anxious to see a rationalisation taking place in this particular area we do not want to thrust our services upon them.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Any arrangement whereby a number of individual farmers combine as a group either to achieve economies in the cost of their farming inputs, to increase the value of their output by improved production or marketing arrangements or to advance the level of technical skill and management of the group members can be regarded as group farming.  Such arrangements can range from the simplest one between neighbouring farmers for the sharing of machinery or other resources or the combined purchase of requisites to a fully integrated system where the farmers of a group pool all their resources of land, labour, stock, buildings and equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was talking about the rates which are to be paid to the various groups under this new Bill and suggesting that, because of their small size, this seemed to me to be a very good antidote to the extraordinary euphoria on the Government benches about our capacity to take on the role of a co-partner in the Common Market.  The general approach so far as the Minister for Social Welfare and his Department have been concerned &mdash; and also the Departments of Education and Health &mdash; has been that we are a very poor country with very limited resources, a country that has to struggle with high unemployment and emigration and, that for various historical and other reasons, this is the best we can do, whether it concerns health, education or care of the aged or the disabled. Yet, at the same time, we have speaker after speaker saying in this House that because of the buoyancy of the economy, because of the success and prosperity of our industrial arm, and because of expanding agricultural output and exports, because the whole of our society is so flourishing and expanding, we are in a position to play the part of a well-developed and well-organised society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, there is a clear conflict here.  There is a certain amount of wishful thinking on the part of the Government.  The reality is the first approach mentioned above.  The Ministers are correct when they say that the money is not there.  They are not correct when they imply that the money is not there simply because of some act of God.  It is not there because of their failure over such <Col N="1142" /> a long time to create the wealth needed in our society.  It is because of this that we have these unsatisfactory conditions of life for the ordinary working-class person who comes to retirement age, or becomes disabled or unemployed, or in some way dependent on this community which we have created here to care for them in their hour of need.</P>
    <P>This Bill purports to be a codification of our social welfare legislation. In my view, it is a very poor thing indeed.  I would remind the House that the proposals put forward by the first inter-Party Government, which was not a very left-wing or socialist Government, were very little different from the figure mentioned in this Bill for a death grant.  That was 20 years ago.  The figure is much the same now as it was then.  If we look at the amounts to be paid it seems to me that little has happened except that, from time to time, we adjust the pension figure to the cost of living.  We make very little serious attempt to provide a code of living here to show that, if we did go into Europe, our understanding of our responsibility to these people would be on the same level as that of a number of these other countries in Europe. There is the basic problem of caring for the underprivileged in our society.</P>
    <P>It seems that the various designations have been changed.  Retirement pensions are mentioned instead of old age pensions and invalidity pensions instead of disability pensions.  These are a few touches which have not really changed the whole social welfare code in the fundamental way in which I would like to see it changed.  I do not think it is enough to adjust from time to time the miserable amounts paid. We give these amounts to these people and we adjust them to bring them into some relationship to the increasing cost of living over the years.  A very much more comprehensive code of social welfare is needed.  In particular what is needed for the old people is not only allowances, although obviously allowances are necessary, but also services. The Minister does not mention legislating for the provision of a comprehensive social welfare code, especially for the old people.  We have talked about this on many occasions, particularly <Col N="1143" /> in relation to the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health.  We are making no serious progress. Any questions put down to either the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for Health elicit much the same information, that the quality of the services is virtually static, if not going backwards.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister making provision for a very wide extension of domiciliary care services for the disabled and for the old people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would seem to be a matter for another Minister. It does not arise on the Social Welfare Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult because the Ministers appear to have joint responsibility on these issues.  It is difficult to know where responsibility moves from one Minister to the other. If one asks the Minister for Social Welfare one is sometimes told that the subject under discussion is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  I believe that the basic philosophy of the Minister's approach to this problem is that, so long as he adjusts the allowances and increases them by 15s or 17s 6d from time to time, then he has discharged his function.  I do not think the Minister has discharged his function.  That is the point I am trying to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister attempting to establish parity out of a new concern to reduce the discrepancies between the services here and in Britain and the Six Counties or are his party trying to prepare themselves for entry into the Common Market?  They accuse us of being ashamed of putting the poor mouth on the fact that things are so bad here in relation to these social services.  Is it their wish to go into the Common Market with heads held high?  How can one enter this type of organisation or talk about the reunification of Ireland while assistance benefits of £3 10s or £4 are being paid to one individual for a whole week?  Even the contributory allowances are only around the £4 10s or £5 mark.  It is obvious that these allowances are <Col N="1144" /> grossly inadequate and it is absurd to say that we can move towards these other wealthy countries which are providing services that are sometimes double or even treble the extent of the services here.  How can we claim parity with them in regard to a successful handling of the economy?  How can we claim parity with them in regard to responsibility to the underprivileged in our society?</P>
    <P>Obviously, the figures are the shortest answer to these questions.  We cannot afford these services and the reason why we cannot is because our economy has been mishandled down through the years.  I do not know how the various Ministers hope to change everything simply by going into the Common Market because if we enter that Community it will be required of us that our social services are at least closely related to those of other nations.  Where do the Government think the money is suddenly to come from?</P>
    <P>Not only should the Minister be increasing the allowances very much more than is being done here but the various services that one associates with domiciliary care &mdash; meals, domestic help, social visiting, transport, community centres and nursing and medical centres &mdash; should have been part of the Minister's proposals for a new social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing mainly with the pensions to be paid to the contributory groups and I think that I can now make the case with validity that the amount paid to contributory pensioners is grossly inadequate.  It is only about £4 10s or £5 a week.  This can be said to be only a subsistence allowance at best.  What does one say about those people who are not contributory beneficiaries and who are on the £4 5s or unemployment assistance of £3 12s level?  How can those people be expected to live for a week on these few shillings in our very high cost economy?</P>
    <P>There is not one of us who could face a week on £3 12s or £4 5s but these people must do that week after week knowing quite well that it is not a question of a subsistence allowance but rather one of a starvation allowance <Col N="1145" /> because these allowances can truly be described as being starvation allowances.  In the rural areas the level is even lower, at £3 6s per week.</P>
    <P>How can a widow with four children be expected to live on £6 15s a week? This is a scandalous situation and we should be thoroughly ashamed of ourselves as a society because of it.  This amounts to less than 30s for each of five persons.  The Minister knows very well that one could not feed children on that amount.  Therefore, bad as the contributory pension groups are, the assistance groups are completely derelict and the Minister and the Government should be ashamed of themselves for offering such rates to these people.</P>
    <P>A retrograde development has been that these people are the very ones who are hit hardest by the change away from the tendency of the past for Fianna Fáil to tax the wealthy in order to help the poor.  These people, also, are the ones who are most heavily hit by the increases in indirect taxes which have escalated in the most frightening way during the past five or six years. What has happened to these people since the Budget?  These new allowances will not come into operation until October but very high increases have taken place in the prices of essential commodities.</P>
    <P>As another Opposition speaker said, these increases in the Budget should have been made available before now or, at least, they should be retrospective so that these unfortunate people could be cushioned against the very high level costs brought about by the imposition by the Government of indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>On the question of deserted wives, everybody will be glad that the Minister has taken some steps to deal with the problem.  I do not envy him this particular problem.  It is very complicated indeed.  On the one hand, if he is flexible it will lead to his being vague while, on the other hand, if he makes too rigid a ruling as to what constitutes desertion, he will find himself in much the same sort of difficulties. What constitutes desertion and who makes that decision?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> On what evidence is a decision taken?  Is the person subjected to some sort of inquisition by departmental inspectors?  The Minister, of course, faces possible collusion between people from time to time in order to mislead his Department.  Has desertion to be permanent?  What constitutes desertion? Is it a month, six months, or a year?  If a person comes back within a year, are we glad to see that person back or do we feel in some way he is exploiting the law?  How does the lady establish desertion has taken place?  Does she have to go to court? If she goes to court will there be free legal aid?  Quite possibly this person would not be able to employ solicitors or lawyers.  The only people wives can use to find out what has happened to their husbands in England are the Salvation Army.  The police usually do not take very much interest in this matter because they have other problems which they consider more important. Is there any possibility that the Department could set up some sort of information bureau in order to help those unfortunate women who frequently are left with large families and find themselves suddenly changed from a position of relative affluence to one in which they are left with nothing at all and are dependent on assistance given by the Department?</P>
    <P>Will those people benefit if they get a legal separation?  Do they come under this clause, if they get a legal separation? Will it make some completely irresponsible people a little bit happier if they desert and then feel their wives will be looked after?  Will it have that undesirable social effect?  I have given this matter a certain amount of thought to see if there were any suggestions I could make to the Minister. It will be a very difficult problem for him because the local authorities simply will not be able to come to any decision.  If there is any loophole, they tend to evade making decisions.  Some of them are more enlightened than others, but many of them feel it is safer not to do anything about the matter.  I suppose eventually the Minister will have to make up his own mind and make some strict regulations. I presume such regulations would be laid before the House and we would <Col N="1147" /> have an opportunity of discussing them.</P>
    <P>What happens if a man deserts in Ireland and goes on living here?  Will an allowance be paid in that case?  It is very desirable that the Minister should have taken this step because desertion is something which one comes up against more and more.  Those people suddenly realised that they must desert in order to get what I understand has now become known as the &ldquo;Irish divorce&rdquo;, where you take a single ticket to Liverpool.  This has become the cheapest and most effective divorce device in the world.  I hate to sound flippant about this because it is a very serious and calamitous situation for the wife and children who are left behind.  I suppose this is one of the repercussions of our own refusal to face up to the social problems of broken marriages, our refusal to decide on this whole question of the desirability of divorce in our community and to make legal separation more readily available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about it.  I am merely saying this in passing. I appreciate it is a particularly thorny problem.  This is a measure on which the Minister should be congratulated. He should be congratulated particularly for having the courage to try to do something about it.  I am afraid I cannot be very helpful with regard to how he will achieve his objective. Another Deputy raised the question of the relation who lives with an old person and looks after that person for a long time.  What happens to that person when the old person dies if that person has given up her job?  One wonders if the upper means limit of £300 a year is not a disincentive to the conscientious relative.  I have in mind the case of a daughter working and looking after her mother, but help with the electricity bill, transport facilities for the old person or free fuel are refused because the relative is earning a little.  The means test tends to exclude the old person from those services. <Col N="1148" /> Such services should be readily available to all people over the age of 65. One finds that the person who makes an effort to keep the old person at home is not helped by the State as much as she should be.  Every encouragement should be given by the community to the relation to be conscientious in regard to looking after the old person.</P>
      <P>One of the disturbing features of our community is the high percentage of old people who find their way into Irish psychiatric hospitals, not because they are mentally disturbed but because nobody wants to look after them.  If a person is sufficiently concerned for her parents, instead of discouraging that person by imposing conditions on the granting of obvious things like fuel, light and transport, we should do everything to encourage them.  The £300 limit is very low.</P>
      <P>It says here that the deserted wife who is under 50 years of age and has no qualified children will not get an allowance.  I presume the point is that, if she has children, she will get the allowance and that you simply do not wish to pay a desertion allowance to the lady who has been deserted and who has no children.  I suppose that is reasonable enough.</P>
      <P>We naturally will support these proposals because half a loaf is better than nothing at all, but we regard the proposals as pathetic in the light of the fact that this Government have been in office for the best part of 30 years. After all those years the Government can come forward with these pathetic proposals, purporting to represent a serious or significant social code introduced by people professing to believe in the Christian virtues.  This is, indeed, a very poor effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this Bill is to give effect to the provisions outlined in the Budget for the social welfare classes.  In my opinion it must be considered in the light of the Budget as a whole.  Provision is made in this Bill for a death grant, an increase in old age pensions, contributory and non-contributory, and in retirement pensions, for pensions for deserted wives, increased invalidity pensions <Col N="1149" /> and general increases in social welfare payments.  I do not wish to be ungracious about these provisions.  In so far as they go I welcome them, but I do not think that they are something about which we can boast or that they enable us to say to the social welfare classes: &ldquo;What good boys are we.&rdquo;  Having regard to the increase in the cost of living brought about by the Budget and having regard to the advance in the standard of living brought about by collective bargaining and threats of strikes of one kind or another, the Minister could not have avoided bringing in some increases for the social welfare classes.  He would have been guilty of a grave derelection of duty for having failed to cushion to some extent the social welfare classes against the increases in the cost of living brought about by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, through the recent Budget.  Cushioning to some extent is about all the Minister has done. The increases will restore those who receive them to the position approximately in which they were about 12 months ago because the Budget imposed a tax on the necessaries of life, which all these people have to purchase, and in that way drove up the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with particular items in this Bill, we have a duty to consider these increases against the general picture we find in the country today.  Only one Government speaker, apart from the Minister, has so far contributed to this debate &mdash; Deputy Paddy Burke &mdash; and Deputy Burke adopted the attitude of &ldquo;What good boys are we.&rdquo;  We must compare the position of the social welfare classes with that of other sections of the community.  It is all very well for Deputy Burke and other Members of the Government Party by way of interruption, to compare these increases with the increases given ten, 15 and 20 years ago.  That is not a valid comparison. One has to look at these increases in the context of the demands for increases of up to £5 per week in wages, increases which, if not conceded entirely, are being conceded substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Social Welfare Bill and the Budget it implements is not something <Col N="1150" /> of which we, as a community, as Deputy Dr. Browne said, can be proud. I believe the social welfare classes will be no better off than they were years ago.  The rest of the community is enjoying a higher standard of living.  The gap between the social welfare classes and the rest of the community is widening. We are giving an increase of 15s per week to old age pensioners.  Superficially, compared with five or ten years ago, that looks a substantial increase. Is it?  Think of the respect there was for a 2s piece two years ago and the lack of respect that there is for the same coin today.  I suggest that the 2s piece today is assuming the importance if that is the right word, of sixpence a few years ago.  It is in that atmosphere we must judge the Budget and the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Half a loaf is better than no bread. I concede &mdash; I am not very good at mathematical problems&mdash;that the Minister has done something better than restore the social welfare classes to the position in which they were six, eight or 12 months ago.  But that is not enough.  An indication of the thinking of the Government in relation to social welfare benefits can best be obtained in the light of the death grant.  We often hear from the benches opposite disparaging remarks about what was done by inter-Party Governments for the social welfare classes.  There is no valid comparison because one cannot compare the half-crown or the 5s and say that the 10s given today is four times or twice what was given then. That is not a valid argument.  We know that the Minister in an inter-Party Government in 1949 was thinking about a death grant and that he wrote it into a Bill, a Bill which was not accepted by a Fianna Fáil Minister when he came into power.  The death grant in mind at the time was £20.  After 20 years the present Minister has introduced, belatedly, a death grant of £25 &mdash; £5 more.  I do not suppose I would be accused of extravagant finance if I said that £20 in 1949 &mdash; I will be conservative &mdash; would equal £75 today.</P>
    <P>We are not being generous.  Having regard to the demands of other sections of the community, having regard to the incomes of Deputies and Ministers <Col N="1151" /> today as compared with a few years ago, having regard to the salaries of civil servants and local government employees today as compared with a few years ago, having regard to the incomes of the commercial community in this country today as compared with a few years ago and having regard to the wages of people who have the power of collective bargaining today as compared with a few years ago, not alone are we not being generous but we are not being just.  I know the Minister will tell me or he is probably thinking that, if we go along as I say we should go along, we should have to impose further taxation.  The money would have to be raised by taxation or otherwise.  Many benefits we are conferring today do not come out of taxation but rather out of an increase in the social welfare contribution from the employer and the employee.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also probably say that, in common with the Labour Party, this party walked into the division lobby and voted against the Budget.  Deputy Burke has already said that, although he did not put it in that way.  He said we opposed these provisions in the Budget.  We did no such thing.  We opposed the increase in turnover tax on the necessaries of life and on food, which put up the cost of living and reduced the value of the so-called concessions.  That is an entirely different thing.</P>
    <P>This Bill should not be allowed to go through the House in a superficial way which would give the impression that the contributory old age pensioner will receive an increase of 17s 6d per week; that the non-contributory old age pensioner will receive 10s a week, and so on.  I seriously think we are not doing our duty by these classes in the light of the regard for money which is held by other sections of the community.  The gap is widening and the pensioners will suffer more as a result.</P>
    <P>Let me deal now with a few particular matters.  The death grant is £25.  It is a contributory grant payable to people who are in benefit.  As the Minister very fairly said, it will not become payable until March of next year when people will have paid 26 contributions. <Col N="1152" /> I concede that that is a start.  It is a very belated and small start when we consider what an inter-Party Government Minister for Social Welfare had in mind.</P>
    <P>Retirement pensions will come into operation at 65 years of age for people with sufficient contributions.  That is in line with Fine Gael social welfare policy.  We have urged the introduction of these pensions.  Again, it is a beginning.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to see a provision for deserted wives in this Bill. I think that all Members, certainly Members of the Opposition here, were campaigning for this for several years. I am quite sure the Minister &mdash; and his predecessor, whom we seem to have forgotten completely &mdash; were also under pressure from their own party to provide for these unfortunate people.  I urge the Minister, when bringing in his regulations, to ensure that they are flexible because this is a difficult problem. He should err rather on the side of having the regulations flexible because there will not be a great number of persons involved in these pensions. I was rather alarmed to hear the Minister say:</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that, before title to the allowance could arise, the wife should have availed, in so far as is possible for her, of whatever processes, legal or otherwise, are open to her to effect a reconciliation or to oblige her husband to meet his responsibility to support her and her family.</P>
    <P>If the Minister writes anything like that into his regulations he will be going very far.  If he seeks to impose an obligation on a deserted wife to exhaust her legal rights against her husband before she can become entitled to this pension he will, in effect, render this otherwise worthy provision useless.  I realise he said: &ldquo;in so far as is possible for her&rdquo; but, when that comes to be interpreted in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, it will quite properly be interpreted in accordance with the regulations if the Minister writes it into them.  Where are most of these widows going to pursue their legal rights? They will have to pursue them across the water.  They will have to invoke the <Col N="1153" /> services of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children or, as mentioned by Deputy Dr. Browne, the Salvation Army or some other charitable organisation to try to locate the husbands.  Even if they locate them, how will they pursue them by the process of law?  We have not in this country free legal aid in civil cases. This would be a civil case.  We have not even free legal aid in criminal cases at the moment because it has completely broken down.  It would be impossible for a widow to do what the Minister says she should do, that is, to avail of whatever processes, legal or otherwise are open to her.  I would urge the Minister to make these regulations flexible for the first year at any rate.  If he sees then that they are being abused they can be amended.</P>
    <P>There is no use in holding out hope for these unfortunate people, hundreds of them, I suppose, and maybe more, and then having them find out that they cannot avail of the provision.  That would be a repetition of the first scheme introduced by the Minister's predecessor to provide an additional pension for a daughter who came home or gave up work to attend to her mother.  The regulations then were so onerous, involving a provision that the daughter should have been employed, or should have been an insured person, or should have left insurable work, that the net result was that the scheme did not work.  It was no use.  It did not do the job it set out to do.  The Minister had to scrap it and bring in more flexible regulations.  I thank the Minister for providing for deserted wives.  If he takes my advice, for the first year, or so, he will err on the side of flexible regulations rather than rigid ones.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about invalidity pensions.  I do not want to run this down altogether but really it is switching a long-term sickness benefit recipient over to an invalidity pension. It is not an innovation.  It is not a new departure.  It will mean that the person will not have to attend at the employment exchange or social welfare office every week.  He will not have to sign on or submit medical certificates as often as he has to now.  He will collect his invalidity pension at the post office <Col N="1154" /> on a book something like the old age pension book.  That is an improvement, but it is not something new.</P>
    <P>I, and other people also, made reference to the provision of an additional pension for a female relative who is caring for an old age pensioner.  That is a good provision.  The regulations have now been loosened and they are a great deal more workable than they were.  Another speaker suggested that, in certain cases, this additional pension should apply to a male relative.  I am not so innocent as to think that this might not open the way to difficulties and abuses, but a considerable case can be made for it.</P>
    <P>Within the past month or so I had a visit from a man who is completely crippled.  He is an old age pensioner and his wife is an old age pensioner. Their invalid son is living with them&mdash; or for some reason or another he is not capable of looking after them. There is no unmarried daughter. Another son came back from England and he is living with them on this little farm, wasting his time, as he would regard it, caring for them.  The poor law valuation of the farm is too high, even if they transferred it to him, to qualify him for the small farmer's dole. He gets nothing although he is looking after his father and mother.  The Minister should include male relatives in suitable cases.  I would allow him to make the regulations fairly tight in this sphere because it would be necessary to have them fairly tight and wide enough to cover cases of hardship only. Such there are, as the Minister will be aware.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that were it not for the female relative the old people would be living alone.  That is a necessary qualification.  I know of cases in my constituency where, instead of a relative going to live with an old age pensioner, the old age pensioner was brought to the relative's house.  I am not certain about this but I think in such cases the pensioners do not qualify for the 45s increase, and I think they should.  I am nearly certain from cases I had within the past few months that they do not qualify.  If the Minister knows, I should like him to tell me now whether they do or do not and, if he does not <Col N="1155" /> know, perhaps he would tell me when he is replying?  My understanding is that where a relative brings an old person to the house to live as one of the family that old age pensioner does not qualify for the increased pension. Such old age pensioners should qualify because they are better off living in a house with other people than living alone.  The old people I have in mind would be sent to the county home if they were not brought to the home of a relative or a kindly neighbour.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has made any provision in this Bill to ensure that employees whose cards have not been stamped through no fault of their own will not suffer a loss.  I know the Minister says these people can follow their employers and recover any such lost benefits from the employers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am sure the Deputy has had experience of that, but the argument I want to put forward is that it is unreasonable. It may not be effective, in the first place, because the employer may be a man of straw.  The Minister's Department know of many people who lost benefit because a company went into liquidation in this city and did not pay any contribution in respect of their employees for a number of years.  The liquidation process is slow.  They may have a priority.  I do not know if they have.  At any rate, the employer might be a man of straw and, if so, nothing could be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, apart altogether from the effectiveness of the claim, people, especially people in rural Ireland, do not like being put to the trouble of suing their neighbours for something involving the State.  They regard themselves <Col N="1156" /> as informers or something like that.  They do not like doing it.  The Minister should take over this responsibility of making good the losses incurred by these people straightaway and if he thinks it wise to recover from the employer, that is his own business. The motor insurers' bureau and other matters like that provide precedents for this.</P>
    <P>That is really all I want to say about the Bill either in general or in particular. As I say, the Bill is nothing that we can write home about, or boast about, or be proud about.  It was principally because I feared it might go on record as such a Bill that I thought it necessary to make the record clear.  I trust the Minister will regard the particular points I made as being made in an effort to improve the machinery at his disposal for the administration of the social welfare services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as I would welcome any legislation which would make things better for the aged, the blind, the widows or deserted wives. It is a good augury for the future that in the first year of this decade the Minister has introduced a Bill which to some extent will help those who most need help.  I suppose every Member agrees we should give all we possibly can to the pensioners and other categories covered in this Bill but, at the same time, we must face the fact that any increase in benefits will mean extra taxation.  We have reached the stage when we should not have competition in social welfare.  The Opposition and back benchers should examine the problem not for any particular kudos to be got out of it but in a real effort to perfect the legislation so that it will be effective and help those we are trying to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made a vow not to go back to make comparisons with what other Governments did in regard to social welfare beyond this remark: while the Opposition parties are very much to the forefront in advocating better social benefits they are not prepared to face up to the task of providing extra taxation.  To prove the point, I quote Deputy Fitzpatrick, the previous <Col N="1157" /> speaker, who said he did not vote against the increased benefits of the Budget but against the increased taxation. To my mind this is not facing facts.  It would be wonderful if the Minister could announce the benefits that are in this Bill without having to increase contributions from insured people or if the Minister for Finance need not impose new taxation in order to make these benefits available.  This is not possible.</P>
    <P>Seriously, the Minister deserves our compliments on bringing in a Bill which, while it is not the be-all and end-all of social welfare payments or increases, makes considerable progress. We all agree that the benefits given here or indeed in any other country would not be adequate to compensate somebody for, say, loss of eyesight. One cannot measure these things in terms of money.  While I say that, it behoves us to examine the Bill all the more closely to see what we can suggest to make it a better Bill.  As it stands, it is a good Bill because it continues progress towards giving the old, the blind, the orphans and the widows better benefits We cannot say that we are now giving adequate benefits.  In the case of a blind person, for instance, I believe no benefit is sufficient to compensate for loss of sight but in this comprehensive Bill the Minister has made great strides forward.  He has also continued progress towards the day when we shall have social services which will give all recipients at least a frugal living.</P>
    <P>So far, every speaker has commented on the death grants.  This is an innovation in the social welfare code.  A grant is already given in respect of Old IRA men who have been in receipt of a special allowance.  Will the Minister say if this benefit will be paid on the death of an Old IRA man if the other death benefit is payable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume they will. That was the point.  To digress for a moment, because there must be so few Old IRA men left who could benefit from this provision, I am sure we could ensure that those who are left, or their relatives, will get this £25 also.</P>
      <P>A point I raised last year on the Estimate in regard to the free travel allowance was that it only operates in the Twenty Six County area.  If an old person wants to travel over the Border he must pay the Ulster Transport Authority the extra fare.  Might I suggest that the Minister contact his counterpart in the north and ask him to give facilities to our pensioners that they enjoy here on the basis that we would reciprocate by giving people from the Six Counties the same benefits when they come here?  This is the time for building bridges to the north and there is no better way of doing it than by showing that an old person whether he lives north or south of the border is given all possible benefits.  I am not indulging in one-up-manship I think the fact that we have this scheme operating here shows progress which could be copied elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Section 21 deals with schemes of social assistance for old people.  Could the Minister tie this in with the provision by which local health authorities pay an allowance to a person to go into a house and look after an old person?  Those concerned do not have to be relatives of the old person.  Certainly in the city here and, I am sure, in every health authority they pay such an allowance for somebody to go in, tidy up the room and perhaps do messages and so on.  If the two things could be tied together it would be a great improvement because I feel that the scheme operated by the health authorities is not altogether satisfactory in all cases.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this section again with a view to doing what I suggest and so providing a more comprehensive service. I appreciate what the Minister is doing in this section for those who, because of their age, must have somebody to look after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the allowance <Col N="1159" /> for a deserted wife.  It states that a weekly payment will be made to women under the age of 70 who have been deserted by their husbands.  I presume this is not because of the fact that no wife over 70 is ever deserted but because of the fact that she would qualify for a pension at the age of 70.</P>
    <P>Many Members on both sides of the House have been pressing for this allowance for the deserted wife, and, again with gratification, I note the Minister's action in this matter.  One by one we are getting rid of the pockets of social insecurity for some of our people.  I do not know how many wives will benefit under this scheme.  I hope the number who will qualify will be very small indeed but the fact must be recognised that there are people who desert their wives and throw them almost on the charity of the local authority.  The State is not condoning the desertion of a wife by her husband, but it certainly does not want the innocent person to suffer.</P>
    <P>Throughout this Bill, as in all Bills, there are qualifying dates and periods. Instead of stipulating that a person must have 26 or 52 contributions in the case of a claim, could the Minister spread this over a longer period so that the person would not be deprived of benefit for the want of a few stamps? There will always be the hard cases and I realise that hard cases make bad law.  However, could there not be a sliding scale of benefit so that a person could get credit for the number of stamps for which he has paid? While some of the benefits they got would be very small, at least it would be a recognition of the fact that we are trying to give them something out of present resources.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to raise is probably more a matter for the Department of Health than the Department of Social Welfare, but I would ask the Minister to consider making a small allowance to a person who is maintained in a hospital by public funds or by public funds and private help.  Could a nominal sum be made available each week to these people just to give them the assurance that the <Col N="1160" /> State has not ignored them?  Contributions are made under the various Health Acts to these hospitals, but they go into the general coffers.  There are people in hospitals for over 30 years and it would be desirable to make some payment to them which would indicate: &ldquo;We recognise you are there and this is just a small sum to show our concern&rdquo;, always planning that in the future this would be stepped up.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government, through their history, have always made social welfare one of their top priorities. Without boasting I think I can say this is what our party is all about.  One has got to be realistic and I am sure the Minister would be the happiest man here if the House would agree to increase taxation substantially so that he could dispense much more generously the benefits being provided in this Bill. Our social welfare code can do with amendment and the Government recognise this by providing extra benefits each year in the Budget.</P>
    <P>I would hope some day to see a unification of health services and social welfare services, because very often the two things are synonomous in that old persons, who have not sufficient means to care for themselves well, suffer in health.  I should like to see the Department tackle this question as well as the preventive question.  It may well be said that all social welfare assistance is preventive in that if people benefit under it they will need less care in other ways. I do not know whether this would work or not, but I would suggest the Minister's Department be organised so that at least one section would deal purely with aged people.  Old age brings on its own complaints and, while we cannot stop old age coming about, at least we can make it much more pleasant for people.  This Bill will make things much more pleasant for many of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister realises that there are other problems which must be tackled arising out of the fact that we shall have a greater preponderance of aged people in our society than ever before. This will not be a burden to us but a challenge as to what we shall do to cater for the growing aged population.</P>
    <P>Going into any of our city hospitals I can see that people are being cared <Col N="1161" /> for very well indeed.  However, there is a point on which I meant to check but I did not have time.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he would say whether in the case of persons in receipt of an old age pension any part of that pension goes towards their keep?  While many old people in hospitals may be physically handicapped they still have their faculties of mind, speech and so on.  They still want to follow things outside, to buy newspapers and a few comforts for themselves. We should ensure that the Health Act will provide for the total cost of the hospital maintenance of persons who qualify and that the pension will be their personal property not to be touched by anyone else.</P>
    <P>It may be a cliché to say I congratulate the Minister, but I do compliment him on this Bill.  It contains some increased benefits and, above all, it shows the Government are keeping their promises and honouring their commitment to create a better social welfare code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start by taking up the last point made by Deputy Seán Moore: that the Government should set their sights on formulating a better social welfare code.  I could not agree more, and I wish to quote from the April-May, 1970, issue of <i>Trade Union Information.</i>  On page 4 details are given of social welfare expenditure per head of population, base 100, in 1966, and things have not improved a great deal since then.  For each £100 per head of population in Ireland, in Belgium it was £427; in France, £464; in Germany, £468; in Italy, £264, in the Netherlands, £423; and in Great Britain, £350.  Taken as a total percentage of GNP the figures were: Ireland, 6 per cent; Belgium, 14.8 per cent; France, 14 per cent; Germany, 15.1 per cent; Italy, 15.1 per cent; Netherlands, 16.3 per cent; Britain, 12.8 per cent.  I am sure Deputy Moore will agree with me that it is about time Fianna Fáil set about improving social services in this country.</P>

      <P>Nothing is fair if it tells <Col N="1162" /> against what the present Government are doing.  I would say it is fair to say that of the last 40 years Fianna Fáil have been in office for 34 and they cannot blame anybody else for the present situation.  We have been talking over the last couple of weeks about going into the Common Market.  The first thing we must do if we get into the Common Market is almost to double the amount of money made available for social welfare benefits. Therefore I agree with Deputy Moore that the Government should set their sights on social welfare targets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would need to try it there.  He cannot do it here because I am giving facts.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Department of Social Welfare are usually criticised by uninformed people all over the country, indeed particularly by one evening newspaper in this city which has recently mounted a kind of crusade against the officials of the Department, let me say that my experience of the officials of the Department is that they bend over backwards to see that everybody gets what he is entitled to get.  It is only fair that this should be said from this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because, in fact, this is how we found them.  I have found the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister who deal with social welfare most courteous, as are the officials.  It <Col N="1163" /> may be said that it is different for a Deputy making an inquiry, that he must get attention but, whether they know me or not, without even asking who is speaking, they give me the particulars I ask for and do what they can to provide the benefit.  It is not the officials who are at fault.  If there is fault it lies with the system.  The system must be changed here because there are a number of little things which give a great deal of trouble.  I suggest that the Minister could and should have included in this Bill remedies for the problems which have grown up over the years in his Department. I refer particularly to one which I discussed with the Parliamentary Secretary on many occasions.  Following the cement strike which we have all been talking about over the last few months, all those on a site, except one small group, were paid unemployment benefit because they were not directly producing cement.  This small group, because somebody decided that the regulations said they were not entitled to benefit, were starved out. They were not able to get any benefit from anybody.  They were the type of people who had been working and, therefore, did not want to look for assistance from the local authority. They were literally starved out.  They were men with young families.  This was a disgraceful act.  I agree that it was the regulation, not the people who administer it, which was responsible for this and I would ask the Minister to bring in either a regulation or a section of a Bill which would prevent recurrence of this stupid sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recovery of benefit in the case of persons who have not their cards stamped is something which is left to the persons themselves.  I cannot understand why this Bill does not contain a section which would ensure the application to them of what is being done at present in regard to occupational injuries claims.  If in the case of occupational injuries the benefits can be paid and recovered from the employers, why can this not be done in regard to the ordinary social welfare benefit?  There is only one reason: nobody would bother to do anything about it.  I am surprised that the Minister <Col N="1164" /> and his Parliamentary Secretary have not taken the initiative in this matter.  They could have dealt with it in one line in this Bill and cleared this up for good.  Then they could go after the employer who fails to stamp cards.</P>
    <P>Last night we had a long discussion on the Finance Bill on what are popularly known as &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Lumpers&rdquo; are persons who are affected by this sort of thing because they do not stamp cards.  One of the reasons why they engage in &ldquo;lump&rdquo; work is that they do not have to pay for insurance stamps and the employer likes it that way because he does not have to pay his share either.  The Minister for Labour is the person who should ensure that the cards are stamped and if they are not stamped then as I have suggested, he should pay the benefit and sue the employer who has not stamped the card.  In that case we would soon see an end to this sort of racket.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister has not raised the level of wages or salaries over which people can be insured. The ceiling of £1,200 is too low in this day and age.  I cannot see why it has not been raised to at least £1,800. If the Minister has not thought of it up to now, will he take a look at it before this Bill goes through the Seanad and see if he can introduce an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I grant it was another Minister who is no longer with us. Perhaps the Minister will have a look at it?  I do not care how he does it, but I suggest that it should be done quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to payments to persons in hospital.  While it may be slightly outside the scope of this Bill I want to say that something which I <Col N="1165" /> think is wrong and which is being persisted in by Social Welfare is the payment to the MOH of a mental hospital for mental patients who go in even for short periods.  This matter must be investigated.  The MOH does not see the money.  It goes to an individual, an ordinary staff member, who has for the time being the onus on him or her of regulating how this money is to be dealt with.  This system should be abolished, even if it means a return to the old system.  Anything is better than the present system.  I know somebody who was in a mental hospital for six weeks and who when he came out found that the MOH had got the benefit which should have been given to him, the patient, and he had nothing to live on.  This should be changed and can be changed very simply.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that we still allow the situation where people who go into hospital for treatment, not for shelter, even if they are to be there for the rest of their lives, are not paid the benefit which is due to them.  The benefit is collected by the local authority to pay for their keep.  That should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill itself is concerned, while we must welcome a number of improvements in the social welfare code which are included in it, the death grant of £25 in 1970 shows, in view of the fact that the late Deputy Bill Norton had a proposal to introduce £20 in 1949, how far back the Minister and his officials are.  The fact that the provision will not be operative until the end of March, 1971, is a mistake.  This provision should have been implemented almost immediately.  I do not know what £25 is supposed to do.  It certainly will not pay for a funeral.  It will not buy a coffin.  I saw a poor man recently whose wife had died and the bill he got for a coffin, with nothing elaborate about it, and a hearse to take his wife's remains ten or 15 miles to the local church and from the church to the cemetery was £65.  The Department of Social Welfare are giving £25 in this case and smaller amounts under other circumstances.  This will have to be reviewed.  I also think that the qualifications required for this grant are wrong.  Again let me go back to our friends the &ldquo;lump&rdquo; job men, those <Col N="1166" /> who are not in constant employment, or are not stamping cards for a long time, those who have gone to England and have been out of the country for a while, or perhaps people who do a small amount of work for themselves and do not stamp cards, or sign for unemployment benefit for a short period.  It is a very small thing which will reduce the number of stamps below an average of 48 per year.  An average of 48 is far too high &mdash; 48 in the last contribution year or 48 over his insurance lifetime.  I assume that by &ldquo;insurance life time&rdquo; the Minister means from 1953 because, as he is aware, the insurance before that is dealt with in a different way.  Perhaps he might have a look at that section because if he does mean from 1953 it might require a small alteration in order to ensure that it is correct.</P>
    <P>When I read about the invalidity pension I thought for a moment that the Minister had taken some advice which I gave his predecessor last year, and which I gave a number of his predecessors, on a number of occasions, that what is needed more than anything else in regard to social welfare benefit is some way of dealing with the unfortunate person who has less than 156 stamps on his insurance card.  The person with less than 156 stamps and who qualifies for benefit gets a maximum payment of 12 months benefit. At the end of the 12 months he is simply out.  As far as social welfare is concerned such people no longer exist. If they are unemployed and have drawn their full benefit they are then able to go to unemployment assistance.  Will the Minister tell me why it was not possible to introduce some type of, let us call it, disability assistance, so that those who had less than 156 stamps would be able to continue in their illness receiving a lesser amount than they were receiving for the 12 months when they were getting full benefit because of their insurance record?  The Minister or his predecessor must not have understood the case that was made.  I can see no argument against it.  If it is right that those who are unemployed can, having drawn their full unemployment complement of six months if they have less than seven years or 12 months over seven years, then go to unemployment <Col N="1167" /> assistance, why is it not possible to have the same arrangement for those who in fact might need it more?  A person who is ill and cannot work should be entitled to some type of payment without having to go to the local authority and every week having somebody call around to see whether or not he had a little extra fruit in the garden or a few extra hens laying, as has happened to my knowledge within the last few years.</P>
    <P>This is something which the Minister should try to remedy and he can remedy it quite simply even in this Bill. While the invalidity pension is an improvement, I wonder how it will work out because again he has the magic 48 stamps per year, 48 stamps or credits in the previous year, or an average of 48.  This simply means that somebody who has not got 48 stamps will be out for good and there are so many reasons why people may not have the 48.  They may have been doing a &ldquo;lump&rdquo; job, or they may have done a contract, let it be a small contract job for somebody for which no stamp is put on, or they may have been in England for a short time or they may have been on an extended holiday.  One year in which they have less than 48, if they have not got it in the qualifying year, does not reduce the amount of benefit &mdash; and Deputy Moore was quite right &mdash; it abolishes it completely.  They are completely out if they have not got the 48 stamps or over.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of rigidity which we could do without in social welfare arrangements and it is something which should be looked at and changed. What is to happen those who qualify for this pension?  Who declares that they will be invalids for the rest of their lives?  The Minister says that he has not made the regulations and that he would welcome advice on this matter.  I had a call on Saturday last from a man who has been crippled with arthritis for eight years and before that he was employed full time by a county council. Eight years ago he got arthritis and was declared unfit for work.  After attempting for six months to continue working, the doctor told him he would have to stop.  Since then he has been able to <Col N="1168" /> crawl around with the help of a stick. Some time last year a neighbour told him that he had some small potatoes which he could put in a bag and take away for nothing.  The man went to the field on two, three or four days, sat down for a while, filled the small potatoes into a bag and had them taken home.  The following month another neighbour told him that there was a small portion of hedge which, if he cut it with a saw &mdash; the Minister knows that there is a difference between cutting a hedge with a saw or with a hook &mdash; he could have the timber.  With the assistance of his wife he cut some of the hedge and they got the timber home.  Somebody with a long tongue or with a long pen and very little to do wrote to the Department of Social Welfare and complained that this man was working and was drawing benefit. The Department in their usual kindhearted way sent notification to the local agent that the man was no longer entitled to benefit until the matter had been fully investigated.</P>
    <P>This man worked for as long as he could and if he could work now he would be getting about £15 a week but he is living on £6 7s 6d which is not a very good living.  If he was one of those who were entitled to an invalidity pension, as he would be because of the long number of years he has drawn benefit, what would the situation be? Will the same situation arise?  Will there be reviews?  Will there be doctors who will visit these people periodically and say, &ldquo;You were sick yesterday but you are not sick today&rdquo;?  The Minister will have to be very careful about this sort of thing.  On previous occasions in this House I have said I consider that the investigating officers are not only far too severe but that they have a tendency to try to get information from neighbours rather than from the individuals concerned. The investigating officer in this case did not go to this man but to his neighbours and asked them what they knew about him.  This is the sort of thing that will ruin this scheme before it even gets off the ground.  A pretty strong line will have to be taken. If somebody is sick for a period either a doctor's certificate is accepted or it is not.  It cannot be both ways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> Next we come to the retirement pension. Frankly, while there may be some merit in the fact that people do not have to sign at the exchange and therefore can draw benefits just as if they were old age pensioners by going to the post office with their books once a week, I really think that the main reason why this retirement pension is being introduced is that it will take a considerable number of people between the ages of 65 and 70 off the unemployment register and next year some Minister will come into this House and say &ldquo;Look at the huge reduction in the number of people on the unemployment register compared with last year&rdquo; and he will be able to say that all those people must be employed when in fact they will have been taken off because they will be in receipt of the retirement pension.  The Minister smiles.  I am quite sure the thought never struck him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not do a thing like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that this idea must have been at the back of his mind and at the back of the minds of those who invented this.  It will come into effect as from 1st October.  The same idea is introduced here: that they have not less than 156 employment contributions paid and have an average of 48 contributions paid or credited per contribution year up to the age of 65 years.  I am sure the Minister realises that this will disqualify many ordinary working-class people who depend for their livelihood on what they earn by the sweat of their brow.  There will be complications and the Minister refers to this when he says that the man or woman can opt for or out of the scheme.  It would have been much better if the old age pension idea at 65 years were accepted.  In the 1949 document which the late Deputy Bill Norton produced in this House there was a suggestion of a 65 years retirement age for men and 60 years retirement age for women.  Twenty-one years later we are making a song and dance about a modified retirement pension at 65 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that both those schemes will mean that a considerable number of officials will be relieved of <Col N="1170" /> the job of dealing with weekly certificates or claims.  I paid tribute to the officials a short time ago; however, one of the matters causing considerable worry at the moment is that there is a marked shortage of junior officials in the Department of Social Welfare.  Some years ago young girls who came up from the country thought they were doing quite well by getting a salary of £6 per week out of which they paid perhaps £2 10s for accommodation.  However, the situation is now changed and a young girl receiving, perhaps, £9 weekly wages, out of which she pays £5 or £6 for &ldquo;digs&rdquo;, does not think that she is doing so well and the result is that such staff are not available to the same degree as in former years.  Junior staff are necessary for the efficient running of the Department and it is unfair to ask senior staff to do this work in addition to their own duties.</P>
    <P>In connection with the allowance given to a person for caring for an incapacitated old age pensioner or widowed pensioner, I am not very clear about what is proposed in this matter. When the Budget was being discussed I made the comment, and I now repeat it that I cannot see, in the case of somebody who qualified for the old age pension and who could have applied for it but did not, why it is expected that he would apply for the assistance which would be given to the prescribed female relative for looking after him.  I notice the Minister has slightly extended this; he says that it applies also to people aged 70 years and over who require full-time care and attention who might not qualify for the pension.  I find this difficult to understand but I am sure when the regulations come out we will see how it works out.  I do not understand the reasoning behind this proposal: if it is decided a person is not entitled to an old age pension, how can it be decided that the same person is entitled to assistance?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Last year the prescribed female relative category was altered to include not only daughters and step-daughters but also sisters, half-sisters, granddaughters, daughters-in-law and nieces. Can the Minister state why wives are not included?  It is ridiculous that a <Col N="1171" /> wife who is caring for an old age pensioner is not included in the category of prescribed female relatives when daughters, step-daughters and nieces qualify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very glad if the Minister can tell me how the wife can live, and a considerable number of people in my constituency would be glad to hear the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but the Minister could do something here to help many people.  The category of prescribed female relatives does not include a married daughter or the daughter-in-law if her husband is alive.  There are many cases where the young couple are in poor circumstances and have little money to spend on their own family; yet even though they care for the aged parent, they do not qualify for an allowance &mdash; an allowance they would get if they were single.  The Minister might stretch Christianity a little in this regard because any help given would be much appreciated.  The young couple could send the parent to an old folks' home but they do not adopt this course and they care for the old person at home.</P>
      <P>It is time something was done for deserted wives because there was a definite need.  I am sorry that the old system is being reintroduced &mdash; namely, if the people concerned are under the age of 50 years it is an entirely different matter.  Somebody here expressed the hope that not many people would qualify for benefit in this case but, unfortunately, we all know that in this country far too many people will qualify.  Even in this city there are a tremendous number of people who have been deserted, many of them are under 50 years of age and they are unable to find work or to get any income unless some assistance is given by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> I would appeal to the Minister to have another look at this age limit: he is confining it to people between the ages of 50 and 70 years and to cases where there are children.  I appeal to him to ensure that the regulations he will make will not be too strict.  I remember the former Deputy James Dillon at one stage tried to have some person declared a widow whose husband had disappeared 32 years previously. He was told by the then Minister that nothing could be done to enable this woman to be declared a widow as her husband might eventually turn up.  As a matter of fact, her husband did turn up about six weeks afterwards: he was an embarrassment to everybody, including Mr. Dillon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was right. However, if we adhere rigidly to this regulation and want definite information that the man has gone, many cases will be held up.  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the matter of all the legal processes possible being utilised.  However, if this is done many of these ladies will be far more bitter than they are now.  Up to the present they have not been promised anything.  Now that they have been promised something if they find that, because they do not fulfil certain conditions the Minister lays down, they will be deprived of benefit, I do not think the Minister will have their prayers.</P>
      <P>The upper limit for qualified children under the social assistance schemes has been raised to 18 years. The Minister perhaps would make a statement that those who have been disqualified on reaching the age of 16 years will once again qualify for benefit. Will the Minister let us know if this be done automatically, or is it necessary to make an application? Deputies are frequently asked questions about such matters and a statement clarifying the position would help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount mentioned in the Budget speech for the increase in social welfare benefit was 17s, subsequently it was 17s 6d and in the Bill it is 17s 6d.  This may be a typist's <Col N="1173" /> error, but there have been a number of slight alterations up and down in some of the rates given.  I notice it is stated that some of these are due to the fact that decimal currency will be introduced next spring.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the increases in insurance stamps.  The situation is getting completely out of hand.  From the 5th October next a man's insurance stamp will go up from 25s 1d to 30s 6d.  The employee is being asked to pay 2s 8d and the employer the remainder.  Some years ago the State departed from the system whereby it paid a proportion of the increase in the stamps which left roughly one-third for the employer and one-third for the employee.  They maintained the amount which had been paid up to that date but they said they were not going to pay any more and they have maintained that since.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The State still pays one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The State only pays one-third of the basic, it does not pay one-third of this increase now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They make up the deficiency in the social insurance fund each year which is always more than one-third.  That is all we ever did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in my arguing with the Minister.  I shall put down a question to him and he will then have ample time to answer it because we are obviously talking at cross purposes.  I know quite well that the State are not paying the proportion of the insurance which they should be paying; they are making the employer and the employee meet the responsibility. The increase of 2s 8d for the man is bad enough but the woman's contribution to her stamp has also been increased by 2s 8d and the agricultural worker's stamp has been increased by 2s 8d.  This is the first time agricultural workers' stamps have been increased by the same amount as industrial workers' stamps.  The stamp for women in agriculture has been increased by 2s 4d and the stamp for the domestic has been increased by the same amount. Will the Minister explain why he considers <Col N="1174" /> he is entitled to charge those rates to women in agriculture and domestic service although they are deprived of the right to unemployment benefit unless they have ten years stamps?  Is it because the Minister considers that these women should be available for domestic work?  I suppose it is regarded as a good idea to ensure that they cannot draw unemployment benefit because they will then be more likely to accept badly paid jobs in domestic service.  Will the Minister say if he is considering giving women the same unemployment benefit rights as their brothers or husbands?</P>
      <P>At the end of his brief the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Bill includes a provision to make a minor modification of the means test for non-contributory old age and widows' pensions.  At present a person who is paying rent for a labourer's cottage is not assessed with any means from the cottage for pension purposes but a person who is paying an annuity in respect of the purchase of a labourer's cottage has the value of the cottage assessed against him although the annuity payment may be the same amount as the rent would be.</P>
      <P>The Minister now proposes to do away with this where the annuity is concerned. Would the Minister consider applying this not only to the council cottage to which he referred but to any type of old house?  A system has operated for a number of years by which people who have any type of residence of their own are debarred from getting the benefit of an extra 5s per week.  It is a very small amount to the State but it is a very large amount to these unfortunate people who are trying to eke out an existence on what they get from the State.  I would ask the Minister to look at the whole question and remove this completely, because not only do those who live in a house of their own lose this 5s a week but also do those who sleep in a relative's house.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  People like that are not very popular in any walk of life.  Will the Minister say if he has considered the question of graded benefits?  Last year his predecessor announced that he was considering the introduction of graded payments and graded benefits such as are in operation in most European countries.  Is there any reason why it has not been done here?  If there is a reason the people should be told what it is because many expected these graded payments and graded benefits to be introduced in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare system has a long way to go.  I do not blame those who operate the system but I do blame the Government who for 30 or 40 years have allowed us to drop back in the league, to the point where our expenditure on social welfare is only 6 per cent of our GNP as against 14.8, 14, 15.1, 15.1, 16.3 and 12.8 which are the <Col N="1176" /> percentages payable in countries which, according to the Minister for External Affairs, we hope to be our partners in the EEC.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows well that I sympathise with what Deputy Tully has been saying.  I have been saying the same thing for years and years.  When the Minister hinted about the inclusion of health and education he omitted to mention defence which enters into the GNP in other countries where a much greater share of national prosperity and national income is spent on defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the percentage of GNP being paid in social welfare. I do not care how it is made up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point Deputy Tully is making.  The point I am making is that not only are we spending less of our GNP on social welfare but because we do not have the defence commitments which other countries have we should be able to donate without any real difficulty another 10 per cent of our income for the assistance of people who have fallen on hard times.  In some cases defence amounts to as much as 25 per cent of the annual budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality of the situation, when we leave aside the statistics, is that the gap between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; is growing.  The gap between the people who have steady employment and a reasonable income and the people <Col N="1177" /> who are ill, injured, invalided, widowed, orphaned, blind, incapacitated or suffering from old age is widening to a greater and greater extent.  Poverty is always difficult to bear but it becomes more difficult to bear in a community where a large number of people enjoy a substantial share of comfort and wealth.  The person to day who is below the breadline suffers immeasurably more than somebody at a similar level ten, 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  It is wrong that we should be contemplating at all increases which have been computed on a totally inadequate basis.  It is no fair test to indicate that the amount paid many years ago has been multiplied. Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick of Cavan said this was no fair test as to whether our social services today are adequate to meet the needs of the modern age.</P>
    <P>Demands today are greater than they were formerly.  Many items are regarded as necessary today to provide people with a reasonable life which, in other days, were regarded as luxuries.  It is right that that should be so.  It is correct that the State should accept the burden of providing what are regarded as necessities today.  It is not right that the Government should feel smug because they have increased the benefits by a certain percentage each year in order to provide what was regarded as an adequate subsistence level four or five decades ago.  It is because of this yawning gap between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; that we, in Fine Gael, express our considerable disappointment at the inadequate levels of social welfare benefits which were proposed in this year's Budget and which it is now proposed to implement.</P>
    <P>We also express our disappointment that the Minister has yet again allowed another opportunity to pass without reducing the number of means tests which are applied to necessitous people.  The widow with children may, in her urgent need to provide a decent standard of living for those children, to provide them with adequate clothes and shoes, fuel, food, schooling and health benefits, has to submit herself and her children to as many as 18 <Col N="1178" /> different means tests operated by a multitude of conflicting agencies.  This is wrong.  It is time that we decided what was necessary in order to provide a reasonable livelihood.  Having set that standard we should ensure that a minimum of administrative regulations and a minimum of means tests should operate, and that standard should be applied all round.</P>
    <P>Poverty and hardship are difficult enough to bear without having to surrender one's self respect time and time again in order to get some extra benefit or some marginal relief being administered by a multitude of conflicting agencies.  We have now added another patch to the patchwork quilt of our social services.  That quilt is wearing very thin.  It is unable to provide protection from the winds of hardship which blow in this modern age.  Instead of designing a new quilt, instead of weaving a social welfare structure which would meet present-day needs, we have put another patch on to the quilt of the poor law relief legislation enacted by Queen Victoria's Ministers.</P>
    <P>Our widows and orphans are the most neglected people in our community. This is a crying shame in a society which boasts, even in its Constitution, of its recognition of the particular place which mothers have in the family.  It is a shame in a society which accepts the fundamental position of the family.  It is intolerable that we should be leaving widows and orphans to bear a burden far beyond their capacity.  In many cases this means that the equality of opportunity which should be available to the children of such families is denied to them.  It is denied to the elder children of such families who are often required to leave school earlier than they should in order to supplement the incomes of their mothers so that the younger children may get a chance in life.</P>
    <P>No widow with an average family could survive on the amount of non-contributory benefit paid.  A sum of £7 per week would not pay for food, clothing and housing accommodation for a widow with four children.  This sum is clearly inadequate.  The Minister and his Department know &mdash; it is common <Col N="1179" /> knowledge &mdash; that many widows with non-contributory pensions go out to work.  By so doing, these widows render themselves liable to penalties.  But if they did not go out to work in such circumstances the opportunities for the children to advance in life would be non-existent.  The mothers would not be able to maintain them at school beyond the minimum age of 14 or 15 years.  We would urge that widows and orphans receive far more generous treatment than that which has been meted out to them in the past.  These are the children of the future.  There is a clear obligation on our society to pay particular attention to their requirements.</P>
    <P>We welcome the introduction of the death grant.  The Minister will appreciate how disappointing it is to us that this grant is so small.  It should have been made something worthwhile.  I often handle administrations of estates and I know that the minimum cost of a funeral in this city at present is £75. Where does £25 go to meet the expenses? This is the figure mentioned by the Government in this Bill towards meeting the necessary expenses.  The local authorities get more than £25 for providing a pauper's funeral.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Paupers' funerals no longer exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Paupers' funerals no longer exist in name but the provision whereby local authorities provide for burial does exist.  Let us not drop the semantics of another age when they accurately describe what occurs.  We like to run away from such descriptions. The workhouse is now referred to as the county home, but the county homes are institutions of another day and age.  This sum of £25 is quite inadequate. We are told that it is of assistance.  It is of assistance, but the purpose of introducing the death grant is to provide a form of national insurance to meet the expenses which arise on death.  The assistance should be on a level which is adequate to meet the necessary expenditure.  It is proposed to provide only £5 in respect of the death of a child under five years of age.  The cost of burial and other costs <Col N="1180" /> incidental to death do not reduce by that amount if the child is less than five years of age and they certainly do not reduce to £11 or £15 if the child is less than 18 years.</P>
      <P>I can understand why these figures were chosen for actuarial purposes and, perhaps, to assist in reducing the level of contributions that must be made, but if we are proposing a scheme that is tailored to the requirements of the modern age we ought to introduce one that will provide adequate benefits and not introduce a scheme that is only an excuse and which will involve, in many cases, an expenditure of at least one-fifth to one-third on administration alone.</P>
      <P>The difficulties of uniting our country have been uppermost in our minds for some time past, in particular the political and religious difficulties, but one of the substantial difficulties which certainly will affect the decision of many families will be in relation to the level of social welfare benefits.  Of course, social benefits in the North of Ireland are subsidised from London but it is not sufficient an excuse for us to point to that and say we cannot come up to their level.  The reality of the situation is that, if we are to see a united Ireland, the levels of social benefits in both parts of our country will have to come to an equal point on the scale because if they do not, there will be many Irish men and women north of the border who will not vote for a united Ireland until such time as the levels of social welfare benefits are equal in both parts of our island.</P>
      <P>Difficulties have arisen from time to time in relation to the payment of pensions and other welfare benefits where the would-be recipients are living abroad.  I am glad to say that, as a result of considerable pressure some years ago, the Minister made regulations whereby pensions in certain limited circumstances could be paid to Irish citizens living abroad. However, I urge the Minister to avail of this year's legislation to allow payment of pensions to Irish people living abroad without the limitations that have hitherto applied to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensions and social welfare benefits are payable only because people contributed <Col N="1181" /> to the scheme when they were in a position to do so.  If a person does not contribute while he has an income, he is not entitled to benefit.  Therefore, it is a contractual debt, and a debt which the State owes to the contributor should be paid without regard to the place of residence of the person at the time of receiving the benefit.  That is the legal position and it is on that legal principle that I would justify the removal of all limitations in regard to the payment of benefit to Irish citizens living abroad.</P>
    <P>There is also a very good humanitarian reason for removing all limitations. Many young people are obliged to emigrate for economic reasons, and in the closing years of their parents' lives they like to be reunited.  However, elderly people like to maintain their self-respect and independence and should be encouraged to do so.  When they are invited, as they often are, by a son or daughter to go to live abroad, they usually will not do so unless they can be assured of some income which will make them financially independent of their children.  They do not wish to avail of the hospitality offered to them if they are to be a burden on the financial resources of their children.  On that account, there are a large number of elderly people still living with us&mdash; we are only too glad to have them and to maintain them here&mdash;who, in many cases, would prefer to be with their children who have settled down abroad but who, because of the regulations imposed on the payment to them of old age pensions, do not go.  Very often the result is that they continue to live in inadequate and sometimes unsafe circumstances here and with an inadequate old age pension.  We do not facilitate them as we ought to enable them be united with their children.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, the State's share of overall expenditure for welfare has fallen during the past ten years.  That is the reality of the situation. It is the share we give of the total national cake that matters and not any multiplication of an utterly inadequate base.  I would hope for a reassessment of the manner of calculating our social welfare contributions.  A proper basis for determining what would be the average would be to determine what is <Col N="1182" /> the average annual wage.  Having determined that, we should ensure that no social welfare recipient receives any less than a certain percentage of that.  If that were the basis, any Minister for Social Welfare could go to the annual pre-Budget meeting of the Cabinet and say, &ldquo;This year's statistics show that the figures for social welfare must be so much.&rdquo;  It would assist a Minister for Social Welfare if that principle were accepted.  I am sure that, if Members of the House were to give serious and sympathetic consideration to that idea, they would agree that it would be just.</P>
    <P>We should prepare a social welfare policy to meet present-day requirements. That is the only way in which we can ensure that the invalided, the aged and the sick in our midst would receive a fair share of increasing national prosperity.  If we do not do that, they will continue to lag behind as they have lagged behind during the past decade and longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Firstly, I wish to congratulate the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on introducing this Bill.  I think we all agree that increased social welfare is always welcome because when we increase social welfare benefits we improve the lot of the weakest section of our community.  Those in the business and industrial sector can look after themselves but it is the duty of the Government and of this House to ensure that the weakest section of our community is adequately provided for.</P>
      <P>When we talk about increases in social welfare we should be fair to ourselves and when moneys are being voted we should ensure that there is no criticism of the manner in which the money is being raised.  There is no use in advocating large-scale increases while, at the same time, decrying any increases in taxation because it is obvious that any increases in social welfare benefits must automatically be gathered from the taxpayer.  By and large, we all agree with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan has said, the increase in the death grant may not be adequate, but I am sure it will be a welcome contribution towards funeral <Col N="1183" /> costs which are very high and run in the region of £75 or £80.  In the past, the pattern has been to take out insurance policies.  Probably an insurance policy was taken out 20 or 30 years ago to cover the cost of funeral expenses at that time.  The people who took out those policies were convinced they had sufficient money to cover the cost of a funeral but now they find themselves short when it comes to paying funeral expenses.  When the money which the Minister is now giving is added to the insurance policy which is held by those people it will help to defray some of the expenses.  As this scheme is in its infancy I am quite sure something extra will be given when money becomes available.  I hope maybe next year the Minister will take a new look at this particular section and relate it to present-day costs.  A grant of £25 in the country could be adequate and possibly would cover half the expenses of a country funeral but there is no comparison between the expenses in this city and those prevailing in rural Ireland.  I have attended funerals in rural Ireland and I have seen the bills from undertakers which are only one-third those which apply in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the grant got by local authorities for providing a pauper's funeral.  Quite often this has to pay the entire cost of a funeral.  If the person has no means at all, it is the duty of the Dublin Health Authority to pay the funeral expenses.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the section regarding retirement pensions.  I hope eventually we can get old age pensions at 65 years. The granting of a retirement pension at 65 years will certainly help those people who have to sign at the labour exchange and submit medical certificates at frequent intervals.  This was a burden on many people who had a long illness.  They will now be given this pension book which will ensure that money is available every week.  I know of several cases in the past where the cheques did not arrive from the Department of Social Welfare.  This was probably due to no fault of the officials of the Department but may have been due <Col N="1184" /> to the medical certificate not arriving in time.  However, we must realise we are dealing with a section of the community who are dependent on the cheque from the Department of Social Welfare to buy the very necessaries of life over the week-end and it is imperative that this money should arrive in time.  When it does not it means that those people face complete starvation for the week end.</P>
    <P>Provision is made by Dublin Health Authority whereby destitute people can get assistance.  I have tried to secure this from the Dublin Health Authority but because the Department of Social Welfare is closed on Saturday and Sunday the Dublin Health Authority will give out nothing without consultation with the Department to ensure that those destitute people receive money from them.  The Minister is doing something to rectify this matter by ensuring that they have a retirement pension at 65 years of age.  Those people will also be credited with stamps up to 70 years and will not be debarred in any way from the old age pension or the widow's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The old age allowance scheme in the Bill is very welcome.  This is £2 15s a week.  Many of us realise the misery and misfortune which many people in this city have to endure, particularly when there is an old person to be looked after.  I have known of cases where a daughter gave up her job to look after her mother and had very little to live on.  We should take a very serious look at this particular section of the community.  Where an old woman is living with her daughter who has to go out to work she is left alone from eight or nine in the morning until the daughter comes home at six or later in the evening.  In a house where there are several sons and daughters working one can decide to give up one's job to look after the mother.  The allowance of £2 15s is a step in the right direction.  This is really a saving of money to the Exchequer. If a member of the family does not stay at home to look after an aged parent, that person has to be put into an institution.  It is much better when the person can remain at home in the comfort of the family.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> Things are not as difficult in rural Ireland because members of the family are working on the family farm so they are able to look after their aged parents during the daytime.  There are many people in Dublin who deserve special consideration for looking after their aged parents.</P>
    <P>We have also introduced in the Bill an allowance for deserted wives.  I am delighted the Minister has introduced this.  It is a sad state of affairs to see a woman who is deserted by her husband at 50 years of age or even younger left, as we saw up to this, dependent on the home assistance officer as to how much she would get.  It is only right that the Minister should give her the equivalent of a non-contributory widow's pension.  It is difficult to define what constitutes a deserted wife.  We know there are many husbands in England whose wives have taken legal action and by and large have been granted £4 a week by our Irish courts but we all know that some of the husbands are not living up to their obligations. Sometimes their wives may receive £1 or £2 a week but very often there is a gap of three weeks or more before they receive anything.  We should ensure that these deserted wives are not prohibited from receiving this allowance by virtue of their having been granted a certain amount by the court when the husband fails to fulfil his obligations.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will take all the steps necessary to bring in the best scheme.  Many wives would be hesitant about coming forward when they find themselves in this situation and the possibility is that the local doctor or the local priest might be worth consulting. This is a section which could be abused.  The age limit should be reduced from 50 to 40 years.  A deserted wife in her 40s will find it very difficult to get employment and that is why I should like the age limit to be reduced. Most employers are hesitant about taking on women in their 40s.</P>
    <P>We welcome these increases.  We live in a society in which there is massive inflation in both wages and prices and it is the duty of the Government to keep a close watch on the weaker sections of our community and ensure <Col N="1186" /> that the benefits they receive are not eroded by rising prices.</P>
    <P>A pension scheme should be introduced for all workers.  Trade unions and employers should get together on this.  It is very sad to see a man who has been earning £18 or £20 a week suddenly reduced, at 70 years of age, to living on an old age pension.  There are firms which have introduced pension schemes.  I cannot see any reason why all employers could not introduce pension schemes for their employees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the stamping of cards, I have had several cases in my constituency in which employers have failed to stamp cards.  These employers should be dealt with severely.  The money is deducted from the employees' wages every week.  At the end of two years an unfortunate employee, who falls ill, suddenly discovers his card has not been stamped at all.  It is very difficult for an employee to take legal action to recover this money.  He may not be able to afford to employ a solicitor; he may not know exactly how to go about it.  As well as that, it is a very slow process.  I suggest that people who are wronged in this fashion should get full redress when they need it and let the Department recover from the employers subsequently.  The unfortunate part is that some of these employers go bankrupt and this makes it impossible for employees to recover their money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill. Down through the years we have always tried to improve the standard of living of the weaker sections of our community.  Everyone in this House would like to see more being done for these people.  I am sure the Minister would like to do more but his hands are tied to a certain extent because he has to take cognisance of the overall economic situation and the amount of taxation that can be levied.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the help I have received in the past.  I also thank his Parliamentary Secretary, whom I have always found very helpful, especially in cases in which benefits have been withheld.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anticipating, as were many others, that this year would see a change in the qualifying age for <Col N="1187" /> the old age pension.  It is a long time since the Government of the late Edward VII introduced old age pensions to Great Britain and Ireland and set the qualifying age at 70 years.  That age has not changed since 1908 &mdash; 62 years ago.  We have had violent changes in many fields.  Our way of life has changed very much &mdash; fortunately, for the better, in many circumstances &mdash; but this qualifying age of 70 still remains in Ireland.  I do not think that is the position in any other country in Western Europe: they all have changed.  A previous speaker mentioned the position of Northern Ireland.  The change took place there long ago.  People resident within a short distance of the Minister's home are enjoying retirement allowances at 65 and 60 years of age and why should we lag behind?  I have been pressing this for many years.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why those in what could be termed the better type of employment get their pensions and their gratuities at 65 years of age whereas the fellow who is out in the field or who is behind the counter trying to make a livelihood from a small shop, and so on, and all classifications of self-employed persons, must drag on until 70 years of age, if they are spared that length.  I am pleased that, so far as wage earners are concerned, retirement allowances will be payable from the age of 65.  Why not make that general in the year 1970 which is 62 years since that standard was established?  Why not make a general law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the cost. While I appreciate that to provide allowances at 65 for everybody would necessitate additional taxation it would not necessitate nearly as much additional taxation as we were led to believe by Government sources whenever that question was posed.  My view is that, on average, at least 50 per cent of the allowance paid to the old age pensioner finds its way back to the Exchequer through taxation of one kind or another; that is a minimum; it is below average.  It is not unusual for old people, if they can manage it, to have a few &ldquo;half ones&rdquo; to keep up the old spirits.  The Minister is well able to calculate how much the Exchequer <Col N="1188" /> gets from each &ldquo;half one&rdquo;.  It is the unfortunate position that many pensioners who would like a &ldquo;half one&rdquo; cannot afford it.  At the moment, I am not dealing with that point but with the age limit.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there would be any opposition within this State to the provision of funds to bring about this justifiable reduction in the qualifying age.  I am satisfied that the benefits accruing would far outweigh the disadvantages of getting additional taxation for this purpose.  I addressed myself to this question in this House on previous occasions.  I left it over.  Possibly I thought the time was not ripe; the Government were making excuses about shortage of money, and so on. However, this question can no longer be allowed to lie in abeyance.  One advantage is that farmers would assign their holdings five years earlier with the result that marriages in rural Ireland would take place earlier.  That would be a marked advantage.  The same situation would apply so far as shopkeepers and others in rural Ireland are concerned.  It is an established fact that the time to assign property is on reaching pensionable age.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that pensions payable at 65 years to insurable employees will bring many benefits.  These people will be retiring earlier and making room for younger members of our population who, in the past, had to leave Ireland to seek a livelihood.  By reducing the pensionable age by five years there will be a great improvement so far as keeping young people in employment at home is concerned.  I am aware that there was a general expectation amongst Irish people that the qualifying age limit would be reduced.</P>
    <P>Another item, a very important one, was referred to by Deputy O'Hara during Question Time last week or the week before, that is, the number of our people who are afflicted with arthritis.  It is unfortunate that in this country, with its relatively small population and its relatively high hospital bed occupancy per head of the population, many of our people over 60 years of age are afflicted with ailments of one type or another.  If you travel through the countryside today you will find that at the age level of <Col N="1189" /> 70 every other person is suffering from some defect.  That is unfortunate but, to my mind, it is a factual appraisal of the situation.</P>
    <P>Why should a person be asked to wait until he is 70 years of age before he is given these allowances?  Why should certain classifications of our people only be asked to wait?  Is not the man in the field as good an Irishman as any of us here in this House? We will not be asked to wait until we are 70 years to qualify for a pension. None of our friends in the Civil Service and none of the employees of local authorities will be asked to wait until they are 70 years of age before they get a pension.  Pensions and gratuities are available to them.  The question of their paying contributions towards them does not arise.  The classifications I am speaking about contribute to taxation just as much as anyone else. In some cases they contribute directly and in all cases, naturally, they contribute indirectly.</P>
    <P>We must get down to this and get someone to do our mathematics on it to see what it would cost because the people demand it.  I want to impress on the Minister the advantage of getting people off the land or out of business, and the advantage of giving our young people an opportunity of running the farm or the business five years earlier than is the usual practice at present. I want the Minister to bear that in mind.  There are no political kudos to be gained from this type of legislation, either from approving it or criticising it.  Any moneys we give at 65 years of age must come from the pockets of the people.  I know that and I have stressed it.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has no magic wand in Store Street that he can wave over that big building and say: &ldquo;Fall down here £8 million or £9 million.  I need it to give old age pensions at 65 years.&rdquo;  I am not putting my view forward in that spirit.  I know it will have to be calculated closely and carefully. When the calculation is assessed the Minister or his successor will have to come back to the House and say: &ldquo;We are formulating a new system for the payment of social welfare to people between the ages of 65 and 70 years <Col N="1190" /> and we want extra cash.&rdquo;  This is July, 1970, and I hope that whoever is here in July, 1971, instead of asking for this benefit for our people will be discussing the actual details of proposals to implement a reduction in the qualifying age.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will continue in office.  The Ministers seemed to be in good form today at Question Time. Things may be improving.  However, that does not arise on this Social Welfare Bill.  I want to impress on the House that I hope whoever is here, whether it is the present Minister or some other Minister, will be bringing in proposals for a reduction in the qualifying age.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Fitzpatrick from Dublin city was speaking about the advantages of increased allowances, it struck me that we had an answer to a Dáil question here last week telling us that this year it would take £187 to buy goods which cost £100 in 1963.  I presume the commodities referred to in the index were the commodities dealt with by the Minister in his reply.  What you got for £1 in 1963 would now cost £1 17s 9d.  That clearly indicates a depreciation in the value of money and a sharp reduction in its purchasing power from year to year.  When you have that sharp decrease in the purchasing power of money, social welfare benefits must be increased not to give an improved standard to the recipients but to maintain their standard. I do not see any great increase in benefits so far as the purchasing power of that money is concerned. That is borne out by the departmental calculation of £1 in 1963 equalling £1 17s 9d in 1970 in purchasing value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> We have a reasonably wide field to cover in this discussion: the plight of the old age pensioners, widows and the orphans and people afflicted with illnessses of one type or another and, of course, unemployment benefit.  I am leaving that until last because I do not think it should be in existence at all. It is peculiar that in 1970 we have not got work for all our people.  Surely a system could be devised whereby it would be possible to bring about that arrangement.  To start at the top rung of the ladder and come down, the circumstances of old age pensioners vary very much.</P>

      <P>I undertook on Second Reading, in response to a request from Deputy Cosgrave, to give some details of the proposed savings scheme.  As <Col N="1192" /> Deputies will see, the effect of this section is to exempt from income tax and sur-tax interest and bonus payments made under instalment savings schemes set up under section 51 of the Bill.  Under an instalment savings scheme a person will undertake to save a stated instalment each month for 12 consecutive months and leave the total so saved on deposit for a further two years.  The stated instalment must be in complete pounds subject to a maximum of £20.  For each £12 so saved and left on deposit for two years a bonus of £3 &mdash; 25 per cent &mdash; will be payable. This is equivalent to 9 per cent per annum compound interest or in the case of a person liable to income tax at the standard rate of 7s in the £ it is equivalent to almost 14 per cent per annum gross.  If a saver completes the 12 monthly instalments but withdraws his savings before the subsequent two-year period has expired, interest at 4 per cent per annum tax free will be payable for each complete calendar month following that in which the final instalment was paid.  With exemption from income tax at the standard rate this is equivalent to about 6 per cent per annum gross.  For sur-tax payers the gross yield in respect of bonus and interest will, of course, be higher still. Bonus or interest payable under the schemes will not be returnable as income to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the problem I dealt with on Second Stage. As the Chair has mentioned, the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Higgins and a slightly different amendment in my own name have been ruled out of order because of the charge which would be involved.  A particular problem has arisen and has been drawn to my attention.  I presume similar cases have been brought to the notice of Deputy O'Higgins and possibly other Deputies.  It arises from the relatively new development, at least in this country, of industrial estates.  It arises in a particular case but I have no doubt similar cases exist in other industrial estates.  The one I raised happens to be in my own constituency at Kill-o'-the-Grange.  It is known as the Dún Laoghaire industrial estate.</P>
      <P>The difficulty arises for this reason: the allowances which should apply cannot be granted because the firm concerned holds a factory on a 200 year lease subject to a nominal ground rent plus a certain sum for estate maintenance. As I understand the position, because the firm hold the factory on a long lease subject to a nominal ground rent, apparently they are deprived of the benefit of the retrospective amendment of the law.  This, as the Minister will appreciate, involves a considerable sum.  Apparently, the industrial buildings allowance amounts to 20 per cent of expenditure on construction.  This is an allowance in respect of the factory in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.  When this particular benefit was introduced industrial estates were certainly very few if they existed at all. On the scale on which they have now come to be established they are a recent development.  Purchasers of these ready-made factories in industrial estates have been denied the allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have insisted that, as the law stands, such <Col N="1194" /> purchases did not constitute actual expenditure on construction.  That may be, and undoubtedly is, a technically correct interpretation of the law but I think it is not in accordance with the spirit of the legislation.  For all I know this applies to most of the firms in this estate but certainly in the case that has been brought to my attention the particular firm holds it on a long lease and because it is a lease as distinct from an outright purchase it is denied the benefit.</P>
    <P>It was obviously difficult to phrase the amendment.  Both the amendment that Deputy O'Higgins phrased and the one I phrased would have involved a charge on public funds, but this problem has been brought to my attention because of the interpretation that has been applied &mdash; and I understand that accountants or for that matter solicitors dealing with cases of this sort have found that the same interpretation applied.  The situation which has developed in the particular case I have in mind and, as I understand it, in other cases as well, is that if the industry concerned purchased the building outright, they would be entitled to the allowance, but because they did not purchase it this is denied to them, and their neighbours or competitors or firms in similar circumstances who avail of ready-made factories. Undoubtedly these developments are useful and have been beneficial in the provision of employment.  Their usefulness or their advantages to industrial expansion and as an incentive to promote and encourage industry is adversely affected by this.  If it is possible to draft an amendment or to deal with the situation, then I believe it should be done.</P>
    <P>As I say, relief is granted where the person acquires the interest in a factory. If the builder held the freehold, then the purchaser must acquire the freehold.  If, on the other hand, the builder held the leasehold interest, then the purchaser must acquire that by way of assignment or in any event by purchase.  Apparently what the section does not cover is where the purchaser acquires the factory under a long lease, or through a fine or a nominal ground rent.  In the ordinary understanding of that, the fine is equated <Col N="1195" /> in the mind of the purchaser with the purchase price but the vendor is still in possession of his interest in the land, either the freehold or the leasehold, and the purchaser consequently is merely a tenant.  The purchaser has not acquired the relevant interest and, therefore, cannot claim the industrial buildings allowance.</P>
    <P>These are the circumstances in which the allowance is refused, and, perhaps, the Minister would indicate whether cases have come to his notice other than these.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to what Deputy Cosgrave has said.  He has covered the problem very fully, but the purpose of this relief, as appears from the marginal note, is to give an &ldquo;industrial building allowance in relation to buildings and structures bought unused&rdquo; and in the section the operative phrase is &ldquo;where the relevant interest in the building or structure is sold&rdquo;.  Of course, that involves what is meant by &ldquo;sold&rdquo; or &ldquo;sale&rdquo;.  On a strict interpretation of the word, I suppose &ldquo;sale&rdquo; means the out-and-out transfer of the property for value but, as Deputy Cosgrave has said, there are many translations nowadays &mdash; and they are becoming more frequent &mdash; in which long leases are granted at a pepper-corn, nominal rent, but the substantial consideration for the lease is the payment of a fine which is a substantial sum of money and, in fact, it represents what would normally be called the purchase price of the premises.</P>
      <P>In so far as the granting of this allowance is a policy decision to encourage this kind of development, I have no doubt that to perfect the implementation of that policy it would be necessary either now or at a later stage to cover transactions which do not strictly come within the term &ldquo;sale&rdquo;.  However, the reality of it is the out-and-out transfer of all immediate control of the buildings concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle involved in the section and in the industrial building allowance was to compensate an industrialist whose capital, having been used to construct new buildings or to extend existing ones, was indefinitely <Col N="1196" /> tied up.  In 1967 this principle was also applied to a person who, having erected a building, did not use it himself but let it for industrial use, but the principle is to give an allowance to someone who had expended money in the construction of industrial buildings and thereby tied up his capital.</P>
      <P>This operates on the basis that the person who expends the money gets the initial allowance and the annual allowance.  If that person disposes of his interest, whatever that interest is, to somebody else, then in disposing of it he also automatically transfers the right to claim this allowance.  The problem to which the Deputies have referred arises because the lessee in the case cited by Deputy Cosgrave has paid a substantial fine on his lease and presumably is paying a relatively small rent, and thereby feels he is expending that money on the building.  However, the position is that the estate owners who granted him the lease are entitled to claim the allowance and to continue to claim the allowance because it is they who have expended their money and tied up their capital.</P>
      <P>It may be argued that when they got a substantial fine, to that extent their right to the allowance should be abated. There are two objections to this: one is that you can dispose of property in various ways and you can grant leases in various ways.  In the case cited by Deputy Cosgrave I think it is not unreasonable to take the view that the fine or premium being paid is, in fact, an immediate commutation of rent and to say that the bigger the fine the lower the annual rent or, correspondingly, the smaller the fine the higher the annual rent.  This bears out the point I am making that the fine is really a commutation of portion of the rent.</P>
      <P>Therefore the principle underlying this allowance should not be applied, because what the lessee is doing is not expending capital on the construction of industrial buildings, but simply entering into an arrangement whereby he pays a certain rent which suits his purpose and he commutes part of the rent, the economic rent, which otherwise he would pay, by making a down payment now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> This is one objection to it.  Another objection is, I am advised, that to accept the principle involved, as put forward by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy O'Higgins, would necessarily involve a great deal of apportionment of the allowances into, perhaps, almost impossible fractions.  If one considers the various possible ways in which property can be disposed of, the various ways in which the interests of the owners can be divided up, one can get some idea of the complexity of the problems which can arise in this kind of apportionment.  I am advised that having regard to this complexity this kind of arrangement, whereby the allowances would be apportioned between different owners, and maybe between very many owners and subowners, would in practice be impossible to administer.  However, it is not merely the difficulty of administration that is the objection to it, but also, as I said, the objection in principle that the case described by Deputy Cosgrave does not seem to me at any rate to come within not only the letter but the spirit of the original allowance and the idea behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically what the Minister says may be correct as I mentioned initially, but in practice and certainly in the case that has been brought to my attention the difference between the firm which rent the factory and a neighbouring firm which have a similar building is that in one case the firm had the factory built and paid the money for the actual construction and in the other case the builder let the factory at a nominal rent but charged a substantial fine.  I can see the difficulty in trying to apportion it but, as I understand it, the fine is a once and for all payment.  Certainly, the firm in question consider that while technically they are excluded from the industrial buildings allowance this is contrary to the spirit of the legislation.  Although this firm did not actually construct the factory the developer constructed it and then let it, subject to the payment of this fine, at a nominal rent.  The amendment suggested was that it would be deemed a disposal by way of a lease covering the period that I suggested <Col N="1198" /> was 50 years but as I explained under Standing Orders that would be a charge on public funds.  The firm naturally do not claim and would not seek to get the double benefit or that the industrial buildings allowance should be paid to the builder and also to the person who has acquired the leasehold. As at present operating the developer is receiving the benefit which, in effect, was meant for the person providing the industry and putting the plant and machinery into the building that was constructed by the developer or owner of the property and who has leased it to the firm concerned and then charged a substantial fine as the equivalent of purchase price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Deputy Cosgrave would agree with what I said, that in the case he cited where apparently a substantial fine was paid and a relatively nominal rent agreed on, that if, in fact, the fine had been much less the rent would be more. This seems to me to bear out the point I was making, that the fine is, in effect, a commutation of rent.  I do not think that Deputy Cosgrave would argue that if rent alone were being paid and no fine that this should be allowed as ranking for the allowance. His point is that the fine paid is, in effect, a purchase price.  I admit that the argument I am making may be somewhat theoretical but it is borne out in practice by the fact that if the fine goes down the rent goes up.  I sympathise with the point the Deputy is making but I have a feeling that it is not right in principle and, as I said, there are considerable difficulties of administration involved in it.  However, I will undertake to have another look at it.  I do not want to suggest that we will be able to do anything about it because as at present advised we cannot, but I will undertake to have a look at it and see if anything can be done.</P>

    <P>In page 12, subsection (3) (c), lines 28 to 30, to delete from &ldquo;by the <Col N="1199" /> transfer&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph and to substitute &ldquo;, in a case in which the profits or gains of a profession were computed on an earnings basis at the discontinuance thereof, sums realised by the transfer of the work of the profession in progress at the discontinuance, or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of subsection (3), section 20, removes from the scope of the section sums realised by the transfer of trading stock of a trade at the discontinuance thereof or by the transfer of the work of a profession in progress at the discontinuance of the profession. That part of the paragraph relating to the transfer of trading stock is in order but the reference to the transfer of the work of a profession in progress has turned out to be too wide.  It was intended that the exclusion from the section of the work of a profession in progress should apply only to a case which was dealt with on an earnings basis.  This is because a full valuation of such work in progress is provided for in section 23.  It is plain from section 21 (4) that it was intended to charge sums received for the transfer of the work of a profession in progress in certain circumstances, that is where the profession was assessed on a basis other than the earnings basis.  The amendment, therefore, proposes to remove from the scope of the section sums received for the transfer of the work of the profession in progress only in a case where the profits or gains of the profession were computed on an earnings basis at the date of the discontinuance.</P>

      <P>Good.  At least we can reach that measure of agreement. So far as I have been able to ascertain, these sections appear to be based to a great extent on sections 32 to 36 of the English Finance Act of 1960.  If that is so, an explanation is required here because these sections dealing with post-cessation earnings &mdash; after a business or a profession had been discontinued &mdash; were introduced in England to deal with what was regarded as tax evasion.  They were introduced to deal with artists who discontinued their profession, sold their rights to a company and received in return employment in the company or, more important, received royalties or other payments in respect of works they had created or written during the practice of their profession.  That was regarded by the English tax authorities as a serious evasion of income tax liability, particularly following the cases associated with the late Peter Cheyney and Leslie Howard.  Therefore, in England for the first time these sections were introduced to deal with a particular movement or trend in relation to tax evasion.</P>
      <P>I wonder why these sections are now introduced in our Finance Bill?  It cannot be to deal with artists because last year we excluded artists and artistic earnings from the scope of income tax. In fact, we have encouraged people who have a message to give in the artistic sense to become resident in Ireland and it is ironic that a measure designed to catch their earnings in England should, the year after their earnings have been freed from tax, be introduced in our Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the problem here as far as tax evasion is concerned?  The wording of section 20 and the following sections is incongruous in the sense that there is a reference to professional works.  It is incongruous because the provisions were designed initially to deal with artistic works and the transfer of rights in relation to particular works of artists.  In our Bill it is clear that the measures were not designed to deal with artists but to deal with trades or professions.  What profession operates solely on an earning basis in relation to income tax?  I believe there are <Col N="1202" /> only two, if I can include a trade &mdash; barristers and barrow boys, the latter in the sense of people who have to sell for instant cash and pay any tax liability on cash received.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, no other profession in this country will be affected by the sections.  Is it to be suggested that a widespread tax evasion is being carried on by barristers who proceed to retire from their profession? Old soldiers never die, and I can assure the Minister that old barristers never retire.  I am aware of only one case of a barrister retiring from his profession but in the practice of the law here a man continues to practise to the best of his ability until eventually he is called to another Court.  Of course, from time to time barristers are appointed to the Bench. In a period of ten years perhaps five might be so appointed.  Is it to catch these people that these sections are being introduced?  If I am right, and I believe I am, the sections can only have a sense of reality if they operate on the basis of affecting trades or professions where there is payment of tax on earnings.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any situation in this country justifies such an enormous change as is proposed here.  In so far as it affects barristers and members of my profession, I doubt the justice of the measure.  I had the experience at one stage of not practising my profession while I was in Government &mdash; I might add that I was not in Government for the statutory period that would entitle me to draw anything as a result &mdash; and the only solace I had was that for the initial period in Government the fees that came in were not liable to taxation.  If the situation is to be altered, let it be done because there is a huge problem of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>We could deal with that, but I do not believe it is being dealt with here. As I said last night, we are simply taking a section from a British Finance Act and putting it into our own finance legislation without any regard to our own particular circumstances.  This was designed to deal with the artists of England who built up a worldly paradise for themselves by contrivance to enable them to exist on royalties. <Col N="1203" /> These sections were intended to deal with people like the Beatles and the Beatle Empire.  But we have a Beatle paradise here anyway because our legislation is to that effect and these sections cannot deal with that kind of problem.  They deal with ordinary professional people here.  As far as I can see their application must necessarily be limited to professions operating on an earning basis.  These appear, in my view, to be exclusively barristers.</P>
    <P>I am speaking not only to amendment No. 16, because, quite frankly, I am not sure whether amendment No. 16 is properly tabled to section 20 or to a later section.  If the Minister will bear with me, I would like to explain what I had in mind when tabling the amendment.  What I have said up to now has been in relation to the proposal contained in the sections themselves but on the basis that we are going to have this kind of legislation here and so far as it deals with the individual professional man &mdash; I think it is unfair that it should &mdash; if he dies that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>When one finds professional men in partnership new problems clearly arise by reason of our partnership law here <i>vis-á-vis</i> income tax and partnership law in the United Kingdom <i>vis-á-vis</i> income tax.  This, as I have said, is territory in respect of which I have no competence and very little knowledge except as I can gradually seek out for myself.  As I understand the position in relation to the liability of partners with regard to income tax it appears to be this: under the provisions of section 69 of the Income Tax Act, which came into the income tax code in the Finance Act of 1965, a fundamental change was made in the partnership position in both countries.</P>
    <P>Up to the passage of section 49 of the 1965 Finance Act the position was that in a partnership, if there was a change by death or retirement of a partner, the surviving partners had the option either to elect for a discontinuance or to carry on the partnership as it had been before.  If they elected for a discontinuance the accounts were closed and a new account was opened for the <Col N="1204" /> new partnership, but post-cessation earnings which came in were not liable to taxation.  In the Finance Act of 1965, now incorporated in the Income Tax Act, as I read it, discontinuance now can only take place when the number of partners drops from three to two, from two to one or increases from two to three.  Discontinuance takes place on death in relation to all partnerships that do not exceed three in number without any option being given so that the smaller firms &mdash; solicitors, trading firms or whatever it may be &mdash; if there are three partners or two partners and one of them dies, no option is given.</P>
    <P>I take it the Revenue Commissioners will agree that death is not a very creditable tax evasion dodge: if a person dies, he dies, and that is that.  As I understand the position in relation to all partnerships not exceeding three in number, on death at the present moment no option exists and there has got to be a discontinuance.  When this discontinuance takes place the carrying on of the partnership subsequently is treated as the earnings of a new partnership and liability for tax is assessed. There is the slight advantage, not a very real one, in solicitors' offices, but in most cases, if tax is being paid on an earnings basis, then the post-discontinuance earnings in that case would be free of tax.</P>
    <P>Under these sections, which will only affect the smaller firms in this respect, that is going to end.  Once a change takes place in the number of partners by reason of death or otherwise, then all the post-cessation earnings will be liable for tax.  There will be no option, whereas in the larger partnerships and the larger firms, where there are five or six partners, the death of a partner will not affect the partnership at all.  The partners have the option to elect to carry on or they can elect to discontinue and start a new account.  It is for that reason I feel there should be a change.</P>
    <P>I must confess this is such a technical Bill I am not quite certain where the amendment should go.  I have two amendments rather similar, amendment No. 16 and amendment No. 17 to <Col N="1205" /> another section, but the object of these amendments is to ensure in relation to the partnership that is governed by section 69, that the change of partnership brought about by death should not have the effect of bringing into operation tax evasion sections.  I put it purely on this basis without knowing the technicality that death itself can never be a designed measure of tax evasion.</P>

      <P>As I read the sections now, death occurring in a partnership of less than three persons will bring into operation these particular tax evasion sections.  I know I have not made it clear because, frankly, I do not know precisely how to deal with this, but the object of the amendment is to prevent a situation arising on the death of a partner, where the partnership is three or two persons, which would bring into operation these particular sections.</P>

      <P>I think I should follow Deputy O'Higgins by referring in general to these sections which deal with post-cessation receipts.  Perhaps, I might start by saying that I do not think the Deputy is correct in suggesting that these sections are following sections in a British Bill designed to deal with the situation of the Beatles. I think that that section in British legislation was introduced last year.  It is true that in British legislation they have dealt with a number of the items we have here in these sections, but their first approach to it was in the 1960 Finance Act and the second stage of their approach to it was in their 1968 Act.  We did not follow this British legislation.  We waited until we had positive evidence of loss of revenue caused by lack of comparable legislation here.  This evidence has become apparent during the past year. We have reason to anticipate that the loss of revenue would increase unless we take steps to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We cannot have <Col N="1206" /> one for the same reason which I gave last night.  Basically, Deputy O'Higgins's approach to these sections is based on a misconception which he seemed to correct at the end of what he said.  The whole tenor of his remarks seemed to be based on the assumption that in practice these sections would apply only to professions operating on a cash basis and, therefore, to barristers.  If it were only barristers who were affected by this I think we would not have these sections here at all.  Deputy O'Higgins is right in saying that the application of these sections to the barristers' profession would be minimal.  In fact, these sections are not confined to professions whose earnings are computed on a cash basis.  They apply to other professions.</P>
      <P>The area in which the problem has arisen has not been in relation to barristers and, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, has not been in relation to artists whom we have exempted from tax, but in relation to other professions. I do not wish to single out particular professions when I refer to this.  Deputies will be aware that in recent years there has been a tendency &mdash; and in my opinion it is a laudable tendency &mdash; in certain professions for the one man firm or the smaller firms to amalgamate in the interests of greater efficiency.  Deputies will be aware of this trend which is growing. Arising out of this trend, we have had situations in which firm A amalgamates with firm B and then becomes firm AB and continues as firm AB. The partners in firm A and the partners in firm B all continue to operate the firm AB with the same clients.  The income derived after the amalgamation, the income derived and earned by the firm AB, is income of the firm AB and taxed as such.  Nevertheless, in such cases there have been very substantial fees outstanding and due to firm A and similarly substantial fees outstanding to firm B.  They have been collected in due course, paid to the partners who are continuing to practise with the same clients, and these substantial sums have been free of tax.</P>

      <P>Surely not.  As I understand it that could only apply if <Col N="1207" /> they were paying tax on an earnings basis.  If they are paying it on a conventional basis these fees would already have been accounted for.</P>

      <P>No.  The situation I have described has occurred on a number of occasions and is likely to occur on an increasing number of occasions. This is not the only problem which is being covered by these sections.  I am mentioning it to illustrate the point that there is a problem of tax evasion in that area.  These sections are not designed for the purpose for which Deputy O'Higgins seemed to think they were designed.  On the amendment No. 16, I understand the argument which Deputy O'Higgins was making.  It, perhaps, relates more to amendment No. 17 than to amendment No. 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I say in dealing with amendment No. 16 that it does not refer to a partnership of two or three persons?  It refers to a new partner entering a firm or to an existing partner retiring without reference to the number of partners.  Dealing solely with that situation, I am advised that under the system for assessing partnerships contained in Chapter III of Part IV of the Incomes Tax Act, 1967, a partnership is deemed to continue so long as there is a continuity of <Col N="1208" /> the persons in the composition of the partnership.  When a new partner enters a partnership or an existing partner retires, the computation of the profits of the partnership trade is made without reference to the change in the persons forming it so long as even one of the members of the partnership before the change continues in the partnership after the change.  Consequently, a change of that nature would not invoke the provisions of section 20 which we are discussing.  On those grounds, I wish to suggest to the House that Deputy O'Higgins's amendment No. 16 is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 15, line 15, after &ldquo;death&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or where a profession carried on by a partnership consisting of not more than two individuals is discontinued by the death of either of them&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to enable this matter to be discussed.  I do not know whether this is the appropriate section at which it should be inserted but I am concerned with the principle involved in these sections where they are aimed and expressed to be aimed at tax evasion.  Indeed, that is reinforced by what the Minister said a <Col N="1210" /> few minutes ago.  It is clear under section 69 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 that if a change in a partnership takes place and if the number of partners is reduced from three to two or from two to one&mdash;we can forget about an increase &mdash; there is a change in the partnership even if that reduction in the number is brought about by death.</P>
    <P>These sections come into operation, then, if there is any change in partnership but I wish to exclude a situation in which one partner dies in a small firm of two partners.  I do not think that that kind of change should bring about the operation of these sections. Whatever options are open to such a surviving partner should remain open to him.  At any rate, I do not think this would be of any great significance but it might be of some significance if tax was paid on an earned basis. In any event, death should not be a reason for bringing this into operation. That is recognised in subsection (3) of section 23 in so far as it applies to a single individual.  There seems to be an exclusion in the case of a profession carried on by a single individual being discontinued at the time of his death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In his amendment, Deputy O'Higgins refers to a profession or a partnership consisting of not more than two individuals.  I thought I read the position as being that where a partnership consists of two or three persons, on the death of one of the partners, there is a discontinuance.  I am advised that there is no discontinuance in a partnership of three or more when they are reduced to two. The problem arises only when a two-man partnership is reduced to one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I can confine my case to what is in the amendment I can deal with that, because the other is a different situation.  The problem here is tied in with another provision &mdash; section 62 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  As Deputies will see, section 23 of this Bill provides a statutory basis <Col N="1211" /> for valuing the work of a profession in progress at its discontinuance and it is parallel to the provisons in section 62 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which provides a similar statutory basis for valuing the trading stock of a firm at its discontinuance.  Both provisions are designed to counter the avoidance which could be effected by placing too low a valuation on the stock or work in progress at discontinuance.  Section 62 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, excluded a case where the discontinuance of the trade was occasioned by the death of a sole trader on the grounds that, as Deputy O'Higgins put forward earlier, death cannot be regarded as part of a planned tax avoidance scheme, not in normal circumstances at any rate.</P>
      <P>If Deputy O'Higgins's amendment were accepted it would have the effect of excluding from section 23 a further case where the death of a person is treated for tax purposes as causing a discontinuance, that is where one partner of a two-man partnership dies.  If that were to be accepted it would be anomalous not to make a corresponding amendment in section 62 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The problem there is there could be considerable loss of revenue in the event of the amendment of section 62.  I am faced with a difficulty here.  While I can see some merit in Deputy O'Higgins's amendment the consequential amendment which I think I would have to make in the other section could mean a much wider opening of the gap than would be opened by this amendment.</P>

      <P>One cannot foretell the number of people who will avail of those things.  One can estimate whether there are likely to be many and, if there are, are they likely to be in a substantial way of business.  The problem which arises in regard to the amendment which I think would have to be made in section 62 is because the basis of valuation of trading stock is cost or market value, whichever is the lower.  In a period of rising prices valuation at cost price could be used to relieve from tax very substantial sums from the realisation of stock in trade at market value.  The possibilities of evasion and loss of revenue are fairly substantial in that case.</P>
      <P>The most I can do in this is to say I am prepared to look at it and see if we can get a form of amendment which might go some of the way at least to meet Deputy O'Higgins's point.  I have explained what the difficulties are. There is a problem of drafting with the amendment as it stands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in the drafting.  I have in mind a particular case where a partnership existed and the sole remaining partner died.  As the Minister will appreciate, in similar cases it may require considerable rearrangement to continue the business for a variety of reasons.  There may be minors involved or if it is a professional business the necessarily qualified persons may not be available.  In any event the persons entitled to the partnership in the sense <Col N="1213" /> of being entitled to the assets may not wish to engage a person on that basis. As Deputy O'Higgins has said in this particular case it could not be planned as part of the evasion.</P>
      <P>The type of case I have in mind is where the sole remaining partner died.  In the particular case I have in mind if the person had lived another partner would have been brought into the business but for one reason or another the necessary arrangements were not completed.  In that particular case naturally it may take considerable time before it is possible, not to revive the partnership, but to make an arrangement which would succeed in continuing the business.  Some sort of saver ought to be considered by way of an amendment which would cover categories of that sort which were due to the intervention of the actual event which occurred, the death of a partner, which it is not possible either to foresee or to have the necessary arrangements made.</P>

      <P>There is only one thing I would like to add.  I appreciate what the Minister has said and I accept his concern.  Would the Minister in considering the matter between this and the Report Stage, consider it in the light of my view as to the effect of section 69 being correct?  I have no doubt the Minister will get advice on this but if it is correct that section 69 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 operates <i>vis-á-vis</i> partnership on the basis that if the number of partners drops from three to two or from two to one and the cause of the drop is death, there would in effect be a change in the partnership, would the Minister consider the amendment as also covering that possibility?</P>

The idea is that a professional man who has reached that age or is, perhaps older, could well have been counting on post-cessation receipts tax free as part of his nest egg for retirement and this is an effort at relief in such cases. As Deputies will see, it is graduated so that somebody who was 65 at the time of the passing of the Bill will, in fact, receive 75 per cent of his last year's earnings free of tax.</P>

Because of that there is great difficulty in doing anything about them so it is proposed now to enable the Revenue Commissioners, at their discretion, to prescribe the quantities in which wines and spirits may be bottled and packed.

      <P>No.  It is somewhat different.  The effect of this section is <Col N="1217" /> that from 1st October, 1970, an optional scheme for the deferment of payment of excise duty on spirits delivered from a bonded warehouse will operate.  The scheme does not apply to spirits delivered during the month of March in any year.  In substance, it means that, by postponing payment of duty in this way for a month, the distillers will have more funds available to finance expansion.  It is a form of aid to Irish distillers because of the substantial programme they have undertaken for the expansion of their industry, particularly on the export market.  There is provision for partial recoupment to the Exchequer of the cost of this by an increase in the excise duty of 8d per proof gallon, which is roughly equivalent to .09d per glass. Those who do not avail of this option pay the existing rate of duty.  I want to make it clear that there is no question of this operating to increase the retail price.  There is a benefit to the distillers in it.  This is an optional scheme.  If they use it it means they pay something extra in the duty as a partial recoupment to the Exchequer. The cost to the Exchequer is estimated at about £100,000 a year.</P>

      <P>We are dealing now with Part III and death duties.  I wonder if I may just make a reference to death duties themselves.  In Part III, the Minister is, in effect, re-enacting the code in relation to death duties and continuing their application in our tax law.  I think we should appreciate, in doing what we are doing and in discussing these sections, that we are continuing a code of taxation which, from a social <Col N="1218" /> point of view, has considerable disadvantages. It pays no regard to the differences in families or in circumstances or anything of that kind.  It operates purely on the national value, at times, of property which passes, on death, irrespective of the fact that the unfortunate person whose death has caused the application of the duty may have been a hardworking parent with children or dependants for whom he was endeavouring to provide.  The tax falls on him with the same application as in the case of another man who may have been a bachelor with plenty of money and no one to provide for or, instead of a wife and family, may have had two or three mistresses knocking around the place.  This is the kind of duty and taxation that we are continuing each year in our finance legislation and which was borrowed from the century before last.</P>
      <P>There are grave social objections to death duties and there have been&mdash;and it is to be expected&mdash;many efforts to evade the net of death duties.  Efforts to evade the net of death duties have been made by people&mdash;parents, fathers &mdash;who were concerned and worried as to those whom they would leave after them.  They have done many things to try to secure, after their death, the welfare of their wife and children.  Therefore, in so far as we propose to deal now with sections designed further to tighten the application of death duties and the way they fall, I suggest we should examine them very carefully indeed and, I would hope, very sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Second Reading of the Bill I gave the Minister several instances of what I thought was most unfair application of death duties to the estates of deceased persons.  The big trouble is that while, some years ago, an estate of £9,000 or £10,000 value was a very substantial estate and was generally owned by somebody who was reasonably well off, at the present time a fairly medium-sized suburban house, well furnished, may in fact be valued for £9,000 or £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned, occasionally&mdash;far too often&mdash;it happens that the breadwinner of the <Col N="1219" /> family dies and leaves very little except the house to his widow and family of small children.  They must find the death duties somewhere.  The only way they can do so is by selling and realising the property they possess.  I gave the instance of the man who left a job when his wife got from an aunt what she considered was a reasonably sized farm.  By the time the death duties were paid, the family were much worse off than if the father had stayed in his weekly paid job.  He had intended to change over to farming but he finished up an itinerant labourer looking for work.</P>
    <P>The death duty idea was established in different times and in a different century.  Because of the fact that no provision is now made for the situation which has arisen, death duties are not catching the really wealthy people because they will make provision in various ways to try to avoid them.  Only those who do not know enough about the law, and most certainly those who do not know enough about death duties to provide against what is likely to happen if the head of the house dies, are caught.  I suggest the Minister should attempt to relieve at least people of modest means from payment of death duties particularly when this legislation will tighten the situation rather than make it easier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Tully have said.  This is a subject that has been discussed on many Finance Bills.  There are probably no recent occasions that any of us can recall when it was not discussed on a Finance Bill.  What Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Tully have said is particularly apt in present circumstances. Death duties were originally devised in circumstances in which wealth was in relatively few hands.  It can be argued that if a person has not an estate of a certain value it will not be liable.  The depreciation in the value of money and the substantial rise in the nominal value of house property can mean and does mean that cases that, in the past, would not have been caught for death duties&mdash;whose estates would not bring them within the ambit <Col N="1220" /> of the death duty code or certainly only at the very lower rates&mdash;are now caught within it.  As Deputy O'Higgins rightly said, the duty applies whether the deceased was married or single. To that extent, the effect is undoubtedly unfair.  In addition&mdash;this is one of the things about which we had a very protracted argument in 1965 when the Finance Bill of that year was being discussed&mdash;that Bill, which has since become an Act, changed the law very materially to the disadvantage of persons who leave property.  We have to consider this on the basis of the ordinary average person who nowadays leaves a house or leaves a house and a small business or a house and a farm as the case may be.  In the past, it was possible to take out an insurance policy to provide that, in the event of the death of the breadwinner, for example, &mdash;the father or mother in most cases of property of that character&mdash;liability or at least portion of the liability in respect of death duties would be met. By reason of the amendment made in the 1965 Finance Act, an insurance policy of that character is aggregated with the rest of the estate.  In fact, it has the effect of inflating and increasing the value.  This is bad social policy as distinct from the effect on the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>In theory both our legislation and our social policy are designed to assist the family and to preserve family businesses. The effect of the aggregation of an insurance policy of that character with the rest of the estate is that the old arrangements which were made cannot be made any longer.  If an insurance policy is taken out, the ultimate effect is to raise the total value of the estate and consequently to bring it, in most cases, within a higher rate of death duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, it has very serious effects.  The house has to be sold or mortgaged or the business or farm has to be disposed of in whole or in part, or some other arrangements of an onerous character must be made so that the death duties can be met.  It is sometimes easier to do that in one type of business or undertaking than in another.  It is certainly a tremendous burden to place on a small business <Col N="1221" /> or on a widow with a young family who inherits a farm.  The position is even worse if the person was in some employment and the principal asset is a house that has been acquired or purchased as a result of very considerable exertions on the part of the deceased person.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that should be considered sympathetically from a social point of view.  It should be considered apart from the annual Finance Bill.  It is always discussed here in the context of other financial proposals or in association with them.  Undoubtedly, the decision to make the change in 1965, which was slightly modified subsequently but, nevertheless, operates very severely in many cases, was a bad decision.  We have all kinds of assistance to promote and develop industry, to encourage external investment and to attract to this country industrialists or people with wealth.  If we do attract that type of people to come in, in most cases, as Deputy Tully said, they can get the best possible advice and they probably have sufficient assets to avoid the hardship the average family has to bear to a very considerable extent.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal in what has been said here.  We should have a fresh look at the changes which were made in 1965.  As I said, they were slightly amended subsequently.  Nevertheless, considerable difficulties have been encountered and, indeed, I am sure that in a number of cases the Revenue Commissioners are aware of the hardships caused by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate and support what has been said by other Deputies.  I wonder could some way be found of taking the house according to its value.  Deputy Tully referred to a suburban house and contents valued at something in the neighbourhood of £7,000 to £10,000.  Could a figure be taken and could that get either a special rate of exemption or absolute exemption?  It is a great hardship to a widow&mdash;and it is worse if she has a young family&mdash;to find that, after a lifetime of saving on behalf of the family, the house, into which they put their savings, becomes almost but not quite a handicap.  Usually, all the savings are put into a house.  Sometimes <Col N="1222" /> the widow may have a small pension but it is not very much in this day and age.</P>
      <P>If there are any savings apart from the house, they have to go to pay the death duties.  If there are no savings the widow has to get out of the house and go somewhere else.  This is more expensive on her than if she had been able to stay in her own house.  Because of the capital value of the house she has to find a fairly large sum of money. She cannot raise the money so she has to sell the roof from over her head and live more expensively in order to pay a sum of money which is asked for by the Government, which has not arisen through her own carelessness or through the thriftlessness of her deceased husband.  There really are tragedies.</P>
      <P>There was a time when the exemption figure from death duties corresponded more or less to the price of a house.  When some of us undertook to buy a house you could get a very nice house for £1,000 and, indeed, for a great deal less.  I remember when the houses in Mount Merrion were built and sold for £700.  They are beautiful houses.  I do not know what they would cost now but you would find it very hard to buy one for £7,000. Years ago the exemption rate would more than cover the house.  Now it will not cover the house.  We have the strange anomaly of somebody having to sell the roof from over her head which, in a climate like ours, is a great tragedy.  We do not live in a south sea island and we cannot put up reed huts and live in them.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister and his Department to consider the social effects and to try to relate the death duty exemption figure to something that is equivalent to an unpretentious house or a very small farm.  That would be an act of great social justice and value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question of death duties some people argue that they are an anti-social form of tax, but I think other people can argue, and, perhaps, with greater validity, that not to have a system of death duties is anti-social.  It seems <Col N="1223" /> to me that on balance&mdash;I am speaking purely on social grounds&mdash;that a system of death duties is necessary. I think that with most people the area of disagreement would arise with the manner in which the system of death duties is applied.  I think there are some misconceptions in this respect and to try to put the situation into proper perspective I should like to mention certain figures I have.  The average number of deaths each year is about 35,000.  Last year the number of cases in which an application was made for a grant of probate or where administration was extracted was about 14,000.  Of those 14,000 duty was paid only in about 2,000 cases.  The revenue was about £8 million and 70 per cent of that revenue came from estates exceeding £30,000 in value.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell spoke about the exemption figure.  Up to 1951 the exemption figure was £100.  From 1951 to 1960 the figure was £2,000.  Since 1960 the exemption figure has been £5,000.  There is a separate and additional exemption figure of £5,000 for sums paid under superannuation schemes.  But there is another aspect of our estate duty legislation which, while it may be known, is not widely appreciated.  It is an aspect which I think clearly demonstrates that our death duty legislation is much more progressive than that operating in Britain or Northern Ireland.  It is that we provide abatements in respect of a widow and dependent children.  These are abatements of duty which mean a very substantial amount of duty in relation to the actual value of assets. The effect of this is that, where a man dies and leaves a widow and five children, he would have to leave an estate worth more than £25,000 for his dependants to have to pay any duty. There is no abatement of that kind in Britain or Northern Ireland.  This is one area where, even if we are not entirely satisfied with the operation of our death duty legislation, at least we can console ourselves with the thought that we have moved in the right direction and that our legislation is considerably more progressive than that operating outside our borders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand that the abatements to which the Minister refers apply, I wonder if this is adequate in view of the change in the value of money every year, I think, for many years and certainly for the past 20 years?  I remember once when we were in Government &mdash; and I think the revenue at that time was about £4 million a year&mdash;in one particular year in the case of one person in the country, admittedly an exceptional case, the amount of duty paid on an estate was £1,300,000.  The estate was about £3 million.  Many would naturally say that if somebody had that much money he should pay the duty but such cases do not occur very often.  He was responsible in that case for one-quarter of the total duty, or possibly more, because for a number of years, I think, the revenue from death duties, amounting to something between £4 million and £6 million, remained fairly static. Now, as the Minister says, it has gone up to £8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are specific cases that come to mind in which the State incurs considerable expenditure to attract industry or make it worthwhile, all of relatively recent growth or development. One is the tax concession in respect of <Col N="1225" /> exports as applied to industry.  That has been progressively developed over a number of years and has paid off, I think, in attracting industry here and in developing a worthwhile export trade and in providing employment. Only last year there was a desirable change in the Finance Bill, and again it was one designed to encourage people.  We made a change in respect of persons who owned stallions and who for one reason or other could not locate them at their own studs or had no stud and who hitherto paid tax because the stallions were not located at their own stud. An exemption was provided.  Again, it was, I believe, a desirable change and an agreed measure here.  These are two specific measures that come to mind, one applying to industry and the other to agriculture.  There are many others.</P>
    <P>Purely from a revenue point of view no doubt there is a good deal of money involved in this and no doubt the stock answer of the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance will be: what substitute can we get to provide the equivalent revenue? That is an understandable attitude if the Minister for Finance is pressed, or the Revenue Commissioners, or the Government are pressed to raise a certain amount of money.  Here is an aspect which has probably never been approached at the same time as we approach the incentives designed to assist industry or develop the economy in one way or another: there is, and I think there has been, some evidence here &mdash; unfortunately the number of cases that come to mind could probably be counted on one hand &mdash; that for some reason or another relatively few wealthy people have been attracted to this country and have provided employment, and left assets or treasures or the benefit of their accumulated expertise in one form or another or a proportion of it to the nation.  I think there is a great case for attracting as far as possible that type of person here.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that if they had not accumulated the wealth the death duties would not have to be paid.  At the same time in every section of the country responsible opinion is convinced <Col N="1226" /> that what we want here is to attract more wealth and more know-how of various types.  Notwithstanding the exemptions, reliefs or allowances which the Minister mentions, the policy in respect of death duties is diametrically opposed, or as near as it is possible for it to be, to the policy that the Government, or for that matter different Governments, have operated in respect of trying to attract or encourage development.  It seems to me, particularly since the changes which were made four or five years ago, that this is a matter which might be considered from a social point of view to see if it is not possible to devise some more equitable system.</P>
    <P>A comparatively small number pay a fairly large amount of money in death duties.  With the drop in the value of money and with the changes over a few years, it is very easy to see, as Deputies opposite pointed out, that a house which cost hundreds of pounds 15 or 20 years ago now costs thousands.  Consequently the beneficiary is liable to an increasing amount of death duties.  The Minister should have this matter examined and if necessary appoint some form of committee.  I know it has been considered from time to time and was the subject of some consideration by the Income Taxation Committee, but no acceptable solution has been found. The changes introduced in recent years have in almost every case added burdens to people who have enough burdens already and who have had to make considerable exertions in order to meet the charges.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> There is only one bracket I should like the Minister to consider, that is estates between £20,000 and £35,000.  A widow with one child would be exempt in the case of a £20,000 estate and a widow with five children would be exempt up to roughly £35,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I thought it was higher than £25,000.  This is not a very large estate. In the case of a widow with five children whose husband was running a business, if on his decease the estate is valued at £35,000, it will be appreciated that the widow must bring in someone to run the business at a cost of between £1,000 and £1,500.  With property of £25,000 or even up to £35,000 a widow would have difficulty in paying death duties, particularly if she is educating her children and, as I say, has to employ a manager to run the business. Very little profit can be made out of a business worth £25,000 and very little property in Dublin can be bought today for £25,000.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the estate between £25,000 and £40,000 in order to give relief to a widow with from three to five children.  If the husband was only starting out in business, he would be carrying a large overdraft which would make it impossible for the widow to negotiate an additional overdraft to pay the death duties.  If a businessman with an estate of £25,000 dies young, he has not been too long in business, and this is one section to whom I can see hardship being caused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's figures were very interesting.  While it might be considered that an estate of £15,000 is a substantial one, with money values dropping the way they are and with house property and business property, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, at their present value, no one can claim that anything substantial can be obtained for that money today.  One of the extraordinary things about it is that apparently no provision is made for the payment of this except outright, which means that, in addition to having to find someone to run the business, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, if beneficiaries are just over the sum which is allowed, they are not given exemption.  Would the Minister confirm if that is correct? If the exemption figure is £25,000 and they have property worth £26,000, will the full £26,000 be taxed or do they get any exemption?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they do.  In the case the Deputy describes, the abatement would be £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is better, but it does mean they would have to find death duties in respect of £25,000.  We have been arguing for a number of years here about income tax in general and claiming that, although money values have dropped, no effort has been made to increase allowances in respect of PAYE and other things like that to what they should be.  The same thing would apply here.  The Minister said that 70 per cent of the money paid in death duties came from the estates of £30,000 and over.  Therefore we assume that 30 per cent of it comes from under £30,000.  If the total revenue is £8 million it can be assumed that the amount we are considering here is about £2,250,000.  Would the Minister agree that is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the provision of large sums of money is not involved in respect of the people about whom we are talking.  Personally I have no objection to the representative of a person who dies leaving £1 million worth of property paying a fairly substantial amount of death duties, but I am talking about people of moderate means, the small business person, and particularly the person who has nothing except a house and its contents or a small farm which at the present time may put them over the top, particularly if it is just a widow or an immediate relative of the deceased.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to deal with this quickly he can do so by increasing still further the allowance which is exempt for death duty purposes, and he can do that without breaking the Budget.  As he knows in relation to last year's Budget, towards the end of the financial year we were passing Supplementary Estimates and I think the final figure was £35,800,000 which had not been budgeted for.  Therefore a sum of a little over £2 million is relatively small in national finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister might look at this matter and he might meet the wishes of the majority in the <Col N="1229" /> House, including members of his own party, if an exemption could be given with regard to people of what we can now call modest means.  Even in country districts, and I live in a country village, house property which a few years ago could be bought for £2,000 or £3,000 cannot now be bought for up to £10,000.  Even newly erected houses which cost about £5,000 to build now cost up to and over £10,000.  Something will have to be done about this, otherwise it will become a very important matter in the lives of people who not alone are bereaved by the loss of the breadwinner but, in addition, get a bill for death duties which they are unable to pay.  I do not expect miracles from the Minister but I suggest he should have a fresh look at it.  It should be relatively easy to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of them do not. There are two aspects of the debate on which I should like to comment. Although Deputy Cosgrave did not explicitly say so I think he was suggesting that we should have a look at the idea of abolishing death duties <Col N="1230" /> altogether on the same principle as we provide incentives for the development of industry, the development of exports and so on.  There is a difference. In so far as we provide incentives for the development of exports or industry we are encouraging growth in the economy.  The abolition of death duties, if it operated at all in that direction, would simply attract capital. I do not think we could depend on that operation to attract industry.  The people you would attract would not be people who would be coming in to set up industry and, therefore, we are talking about different kinds of incentives altogether and for different purposes.</P>
      <P>While I do not say that we do not want to attract further capital, nevertheless, the capital inflow in recent years has been substantial.  From the point of view of the development of industry we are much more interested in know-how and access to markets abroad rather than in the attraction of capital.  In fact, the availability of substantial sums of money, and this is something of which I had experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce, of people coming along with quite substantial sums of money which they wanted to invest in industry in this country but having no technical know-how and no access to markets, was really an embarrassment because all they would end up doing would be to invest in existing industry, perhaps, on terms that would not be terribly attractive from the point of view of the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect and that is that in 1960 the maximum rate of duty was reduced from 53 per cent to 40 per cent in an effort to test the proposition whether or not it would influence wealthy people to take up residence here.  The maximum rate in Britain, by the way, is 80 per cent.  To date we have had no evidence that this substantial reduction in the maximum rate has had this effect.  Therefore, the theoretical basis for abolishing estate duty is doubtful and the practical basis is even more doubtful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of increasing the level at which estates are exempt from duty, and the abatements and so on, <Col N="1231" /> I can only say that while I sympathise with some of the cases made in this regard, as I have indicated, the situation in this country is not by any means as bad as many people seem to think, especially in relation to our nearest neighbours.  I could not undertake in the course of the passage of this Bill to make any changes in that regard.  In fact, if any such changes were to be made they would not be made before next year's Finance Bill. I do not want to mislead the House, I am not undertaking that such will be one of the provisions of next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>Before section 34 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>In valuing securities which form part of the assets of a deceased person regard shall be had to the value of such in the three years prior to the death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and Deputies may have <Col N="1232" /> noticed that this amendment is very vaguely drafted.  That is for the purpose of enabling it to be in order so that it may be discussed.  If I put down in writing what I wanted to do the Ceann Comhairle would have written me a polite note saying that this was a charging amendment and was out of order.  The idea of the amendment is, as I indicated on Second Reading, that at particular times &mdash; and recent times have been one period &mdash; there is a wild oscillation in the value of securities and cases have occurred, and do occur frequently, where on the death of a person if his assets include securities they are valued at the date of death and at the date of death they may have a particular value which on realisation, on the distribution of the estate some time later, may result in nothing at all being distributed, although duty has been paid on what was the apparent market value at the date of death. What I had in mind is in order to avoid injustices that may arise in a rapidly changing stock market of that kind, there should be a situation in which the person who is accounting for estate duty should have the option of taking an average valuation over three years prior to death, as against being compelled to take the value at death. That would prevent injustices and I do not think it would cost the State an awful lot of money.  It would ensure that those among whom the value of the assets would be distributed would not suffer in a falling market.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that some people may be unfortunate in so far as at the date of death the property may be valued considerably higher than it is subsequently. On the other hand, the reverse happens and property that is valued quite low at the date of death may be worth much more when it is distributed subsequently.  This may not be any consolation to those who are caught with property valued highly at the time of death but at least as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned they are not trying to get the best of both worlds.  As far as estate duty on normal assets is concerned, it has operated since 1894 that the valuation is taken at the time of death of the deceased.  In practical terms this is the only thing that we <Col N="1235" /> can do and I do not see how we can operate on any other basis.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 19, to delete lines 37 to 44 and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  by the insertion at the end of subsection (4) (a) (ii) of the following:</P>
      <P>`in the case of a trading company and in the case of a non-trading company the amount of dividends or interest on stock, shares or debentures of the company which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners are excessive having regard to the value of such stocks, shares or debentures of the company'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 34 seeks to amend section 20 of the Finance Act, 1965.  Therefore, it is another section dealing with duty or tax evasion.  It is well to recall that section 20 of the Finance Act, 1965, dealt with the device of a person transferring his assets to a company and receiving a yearly benefit or payment in return.  That was done by a person in the autumn or winter of his life for the purpose of endeavouring to preserve the assets for the benefit of those who would succeed him.</P>
      <P>Section 20 proceeded to provide that the extent of his benefit would be valued and, as it was valued, a portion of the assets would be deemed to pass on death and this particular device was stopped by section 20 of the Finance Act, 1965.  However, that section excluded dividends on shares and since section 20 was introduced there has grown the practice of providing exaggerated and unreal dividends.  As I understand section 34 it is designed to include the dividends in respect of non-trading companies and is a follow-up to section 20 of the 1965 Act.  However, it seems to me in proposing to go as far as this to be unfair.</P>

    <P>The dividends in any event following the death will be valued and those who succeed to them will be held accountable on the value of these dividend <Col N="1236" /> shares for duty purposes.  If they have an unreal, enhanced or bloated value in any event they will fall for tax in the hands of those to whom they go.  There is a problem but I believe the way it should be dealt with is to make liable to duty in the sense of section 20 that portion of the dividend which is inflated or excessive.  In my amendment I suggest what should be inserted in place of what is proposed in section 20 of the Finance Bill as follows:</P>
    <P>In the case of a trading company and in the case of a non-trading company the amount of dividends or interest on stock, shares or debentures of the company which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners are excessive having regard to the value of such stocks, shares or debentures of the company.</P>
    <P>That would deal with the problem created by this device.  It would ensure that the redeemed or declared excess would come within the ambit of section 20, but it would not work the double injustice.  If the whole of the share or dividend is put in under section 20 it will create a situation where there would be a double impact of duty because you will have it on the section 20 operation and also in relation to the shares being subsequently valued and held accountable by the persons who receive them.  This would avoid a double impact and at the same time it would achieve what the section seeks to achieve.</P>

      <P>I might start here by saying that the amendment drafted refers to both trading and non-trading companies.  Deputy O'Higgins has described some of the purpose of section 20 of the Finance Act, 1965.  He has also pointed out that certain loopholes have appeared and that in this section we are endeavouring to close those loopholes by restricting more than was restricted under section 20 of the 1965 Act.  We are proposing now to make even greater restrictions in this regard but we are proposing to apply these restrictions only to non-trading companies not to trading companies.  We are dealing here with non-trading companies whose assets have been disposed of to the company by the deceased.  I <Col N="1237" /> cannot conceive of circumstances in which a non-trading company set up in this way can be in existence for any other purpose than the evasion of death duty.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so it seems to me there could be a different situation where you are dealing with a trading company and for that reason I would have thought Deputy O'Higgins would be dealing here only with non-trading companies because we do not propose to apply these new restrictions to trading companies, only to non-trading companies.</P>
      <P>With regard to non-trading companies and the application of this section to them I am not quite clear if I follow Deputy O'Higgin's reasoning but on the basis of what he has said and what is in his amendment the stocks, shares or debentures should be valued having regard to the value of the stocks, shares or debentures.</P>

      <P>There is a problem here for the Revenue Commissioners in deciding what is an excessive amount for a dividend having regard to the value of the stocks because if regard is had to the real value of securities then no dividend would be excessive.  For example, if a 500 per cent preference share of £1 is bought for £50 then the £5 dividend on that share is not excessive because having regard to the real value of the stocks no dividend is excessive.  If the Deputy has in mind, as I think he has, a situation in which the Revenue Commissioners would in some way distinguish between, let us say, a preference share yielding 1,000 per cent and they decided 20 per cent was a reasonable figure on it, in that case the assessment to duty would be based on 980 per cent.  I am not sure if I am making the point clear.  Is this what the Deputy has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is asking the Revenue Commissioners to make the distinction and make a ruling in circumstances where it is almost impossible to do so for the reason I have given that if <Col N="1238" /> regard is taken of the value of the stocks no dividend is excessive.  I would remind the Deputy and the House that what we are dealing with here is an admitted device for the avoidance of duty.</P>
      <P>The point which Deputy O'Higgins is making, even if it could be applied in practice, is fairly unrealistic in terms of the difference it would make to the estate.  Consequently having regard to that fact and the fact that it is in relation to a device which is admittedly designed to avoid duty, even if I found it were practical to apply that, and I do not find that is the case, I do not think I could accept it as I understand the case put forward by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly I am only concerned with discussing this on the basis that this is dealing with a tax evasion device.  We are merely concerned with the way in which to deal with it.  The way it is proposed to deal with it here is to add a section which already provides a means whereby a slice of the assets of somebody else, or of a company, shall be regarded as passing on the death of another legal person.  Added to that is the inclusion now of unreal dividends which, in fact, will pass on the death and will become part of the assets of the deceased after his death so that under this section the beneficiaries will be hit twice.  They will be hit for estate duty in respect of a proportion &mdash; probably a significant proportion &mdash; of the assets of the company which will be regarded as rating a duty liability for which they must account.  At the same time, they will be liable to account, as part of the assets of the estate, for the value of these dividends.  It is because it seemed to me that there is a double liability for estate duty that I thought some other device should be adopted which would ensure that there would be a correct accounting for the property which was put into the <i>ad hoc</i> company but which would also ensure that that would not be hit twice.  I was suggesting that the Revenue Commissioners cream off the dividend on the real excess and put that into what determines the slice of assets which shall be deemed to be passing on <Col N="1239" /> death.  The amendment may not achieve that in words but that was the object.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is making two points.  The Deputy was expressing the fear of a double liability for duty. On that point the proposed new section 37 should take care of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It should eliminate the danger of double liability.  The Deputy is making the other point which must be seen in perspective.  We are dealing with a sham, a device to avoid duty.  In whatever way the deceased has been deriving income from the company, whether by way of salary or dividend or interest or anything else, what we are dealing with is an income derived by the deceased from a company which he set up for the purpose of avoiding duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

It should all be treated in the same way.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 19, line 41, after &ldquo;company&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and first became so controlled after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and amendment No. <Col N="1240" /> 24 &mdash; I do not know whether they will be entertained sympathetically by the Minister or not &mdash; are put down because we are dealing here admittedly with a device to evade death duties.  We have preceded this debate by a discussion on the social imperfections of this type of taxation.  There is, and there has been over the years, a fair battle of wits between those who represent the unfortunate person who is doing his best to provide, after his death, for his dependent widow and family and the Revenue Commissioners.  The company that was legislated against in 1965 was only one of many devices. The dividend that succeeded it was another.  There will be many more. Each year the Revenue Commissioners, through the Finance Bill, bring in section after section to deal with device after device.  Thanks be to God human ingenuity knows no limits.  In fairness, and seriously, let me say that the people affected by this amendment are people who are at the end of their days.  That is why they entered into the device in the first instance.  That is why it came about.  The arrangements they have made were not made illegally, unlawfully or in any sort of way of this kind.  They were made in perfect knowledge of the state of the law.</P>
    <P>The section provides that this section shall have effect only in relation to a death occurring after the passing of the Act.  May I say on behalf of all such people &ldquo;Thank you for nothing&rdquo;? The section is only to apply to deaths occurring after this Bill has passed.  We are supposed to express a word of thanks that the section was not expressly made to act retrospectively.  Of course it can only apply to deaths occurring after the Act is passed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these two amendments, which are in the alternative, is to ensure that what was a perfectly lawful arrangement, attracting no duty liability when it was entered into or when it was made <i>bona fide</i> on the advice of people whose profession it is to advise on these matters, should continue to be exempt and that this new section should operate from the passing of the Bill onwards, but it should not seek to bring about a change in the law retrospectively.  That is what is <Col N="1241" /> proposed here and that is unjust.  There is great merit, and I think it is essential, that the law should be clear even if it is to be clear for only one period of 365 days.  In order to have confidence in this country and in its institutions, when a man seeks to make arrangements for his own family in relation to his own business, in relation to his own assets and resources, if he seeks advice and gets advice he should be entitled to act on the basis that that is the law of the land.  I suggest it is wrong and unjust for this Parliament subsequently to legislate backwards and to change in effect what was the law after a man has made an irretrievable step.  That is the point.  I would ask the Minister to appreciate that.</P>
    <P>Such a person &mdash; I do not know who he may be &mdash; but I am going to imagine a man who has made arrangements now being legislated against, doing it because he was advised and advised correctly that there was no provision against what he was doing.  In effect, he scrambles an egg which he cannot unscramble and now when he is 12 or 18 months nearer death, it is proposed in this section to declare the law to have been different with retroactive effect.</P>
    <P>That is unjust and no matter how it is cloaked by providing sections which say &ldquo;This shall only apply to deaths occurring after the passing of this Act&rdquo; the harm will not be undone. In the sense of section 20 of the Finance Act of 1965 this is intended to make unlawful and inoperative the <i>bona fide</i> and lawful arrangements of transactions.  As well as this being unjust, I am not sure whether it would stand the test of the courts but that is another question.  It was in order to avoid that kind of injustice that I tabled amendment No. 23 which deals with the operative words in the section and which seeks to add &ldquo;and first became so controlled after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the amendment were accepted, it would mean that any such non-trading company first became controlled, in the sense that is being legislated against, after the passing of this Bill. In other words, this dog will not run. That is a fair way to approach it.  If <Col N="1242" /> it were approached in this way, it would mean that this kind of device could not succeed again; the battle of wits would continue, something else would emerge and the Revenue Commissioners could take other steps under other sections in other Finance Bills to deal with it but it is only fair that when a transaction of this kind of arrangement is being legislated against, it should be from this on.  My first amendment is, accordingly, in that sense and the second amendment is only putting it in another way.  Either of the amendments, in fairness, should be adopted by the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that we are legislating for people who are in the autumn of their days, if I remember his phrase correctly.  I admit there may be some such people concerned but I certainly do not admit that they are the only kinds of people with whom we are concerned.  There is no doubt that we may well be dealing with the people in the prime of life who have made a good deal of money and who have begun to think about how they can assure in so far as possible within the law that liability to death duties will be avoided.</P>

      <P>I do not.  In fact, I know that there are some people concerned with this who would not answer to, Deputy O'Higgins's description of them.  The Deputy said also that the process we are dealing with here was irreversible.  I do not know why he should have said that because we are dealing with controlled companies.  The prospective deceased controls the company. I do not know of any legal bar that would prevent him reversing the procedure.  Furthermore, Deputy O'Higgins said that such people would be advised and advised correctly that <Col N="1243" /> to do what they did was not unlawful. He is correct in saying that.</P>
      <P>However, he omitted to say that if he, in his professional capacity, had been asked to advise in such a case, he would certainly have prefaced his advice by saying that his advice was based on the law as it stands and that he could not give any guarantee that the law would remain as it is forever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going to imagine people advising on the law as it does not stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point I am making.  He can advise on the law as it stands only when he gives his advice and any prudent lawyer would certainly add, especially in circumstances such as those with which we are dealing, that of course the law in these matters changes frequently; that his client could act only on the basis of the law as it was with no guarantee that it would not be changed. Therefore, there is no question of such people being misled in any way.</P>
      <P>We come now to the principle behind the two amendments with which we are dealing.  It appears to me that Deputy O'Higgins is trying to advocate a new principle in this, a principle which I could not accept.  What he is saying in effect &mdash; we are dealing now with companies that have been set up solely as devices to avoid estate or death duties and the people concerned have worked out a device which, on the law as it stood, would enable them to avoid duty &mdash; is that having discovered that, we should say to them &ldquo;That is all right; we will let you away with it but nobody else will be allowed to get away with this after the passing of the Act&rdquo;.  I submit that this is a new principle.  Virtually all death duty legislation affects dispositions which were made before the legislation in so far as they operate in relation to deaths occurring after the legislation being brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> Deputy O'Higgins himself described the perpetual battle that is going on between the Revenue Commissioners and people with substantial assets in the main, and their advisers, to work out methods by which such people can avoid full liability for duty.  It is true that this battle goes on year after year and, as Deputy O'Higgins said, each year's Finance Bill indicates a further effort on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to close some loopholes that have been discovered.  In those circumstances how can anyone advocate that the battle should stop in relation to some people if one is prepared to view it in that light?  I am not trying to use any derogatory terms to describe the operation or the people we are dealing with but I am trying to deal with it in neutral terms, because I am accepting this description of a battle. Since that battle goes on every year and, every year, the Finance Bill provides proposals for closing loopholes, I am not aware that it has ever been accepted or suggested, certainly in the past, that in such circumstances arrangements, devices which have been come to should be allowed to stand and not interfered with in any way.  As far as I am aware, the position has always been that when such loopholes have been closed they have been closed on the date of the passing of the Act and thereafter the people concerned are in the position where they can reverse the process they have embarked on and they have been advised on alternative steps.  That advice will always be covered by the condition that there can be no guarantee given to them by their advisers that the law will remain as it is.  This is understood by everybody concerned in this matter.  If the principle Deputy O'Higgins is advocating were accepted it would surprise most of the people concerned in this kind of operation. I am not aware of any precedent for what he is suggesting but, if there is, it certainly is an exception.  The principle he is advocating is, as I say, new and is one I could not accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it is precisely what we are doing.  I suggest that is very much what is involved here.  We are providing by this section that, in a transaction which at the time it was entered into did not attract a liability for death duties, it will attract such liability, that it has and always had.  That is passing legislation which is having a retrospective effect.  It is unjust.  It is not for me to say whether it is unconstitutional or not, but it certainly is unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says it is a new principle. I believe we are entitled to say in our legislation here: &ldquo;We are going to stop this from now on&rdquo;.  I do not believe we are entitled to say anything more than that.  The Minister says this is something new and novel.  If to be just in our legislation is to be new and novel, let us start being that. There have been in the past many examples of punitive, penal Draconian legislation brought in here by successive Ministers for Finance at the behest of the angry Revenue Commissioners &mdash; livid and furious, that the late Frank Fitzgibbon or somebody else discovered a new loophole in their legislation. Ministers for Finance have said: &ldquo;It was never there.  We are going to pass an Act to say it never existed and can never be operated.&rdquo;  There have been too many examples of this kind of thing and they have never done much good to anybody.  This is what I suggest is wrong.  It is utterly unjust to legislate here in this sense in respect of transactions which were lawful, carried out in accordance with the law, carried out <i>bona fide.</i>  It is utterly wrong and unjust to change the law in <Col N="1246" /> respect of those transactions with the effect that they now attract legal liabilities which they did not and could never have at the time they were entered into. If there are examples to the contrary I suggest it is merely a case of many wrongs not leading to the proof of anything more than that they are a repetition of error.  For that reason I insist on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say another word or two on that, if I may.  Deputy O'Higgins can only argue that this is retrospective legislation by indulging in a great deal of sophistry.  He cannot get over the fact that the effect of these as he says, legal sanctions, but I would say consequences, on those transactions were not legal consequences at the time the transactions were entered into.  He cannot deny that this section proposes to apply those consequences only in respect of a death occurring after the passing of the Act.  Only sophistry can make that out to be retrospective legislation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, since he painted a picture of the Revenue Commissioners being livid because somebody discovered a loophole in their legislation &mdash; I think I am quoting his words exactly &mdash; let me say in all fairness that the Revenue Commissioners, in so far as they have responsibility for such provisions, are doing their duty to the people of this country.  That is what they are there for.  They are not there to enable wealthy people to avoid their liabilities to death duties.  If this House decides that such people are to be exempt from death duties that is all right; but until the House decides to do so it is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to make sure that such people do not evade their liabilities to death duties.  I must go on record, in view of what Deputy O'Higgins said, by reiterating that in their actions in those matters the Revenue Commissioners are doing their duty to the Irish people and to this House.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to think the function of the Revenue Commissioners is to a administer a moral code here and not a legal code.  Surely the position is if somebody gets advice, whether it be from his accountant or his legal adviser, and carries out certain measures which are perfectly legal, and afterwards because the Revenue Commissioners or their legal advisers or the Minister's legal advisers find they were not as good as they thought they were &mdash; apparently they are always finding this out year after year &mdash; they come back then and try to mend their ways.  They introduce a new section which they try to make retrospective.  It is quite reasonable that they should introduce a new section to close any loopholes they have discovered but it is very unsportsmanlike to change the rules in the middle of the game.  That is precisely what they are trying to do.  If they acknowledge they have failed to close any loopholes which they think may exist or may be deemed to exist, surely it should be sufficient for them merely to do that and they should not try to improve the position by introducing a punitive aspect of it, making it retrospective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I cannot let the bone run with the dog. The Minister, having started by referring to my indulging in sophistry, ended up a few minutes ago with an extraordinary outburst of demagoguery.  I want to make it perfectly clear in so far as justice is concerned that I do not care whether we are dealing with a succession of people as rich as Croesus.  It has nothing to do with the case.  From the point of justice we are doing something that is either right or wrong.  When we are discussing death duties we are obviously talking about people who have property to leave behind them when they die.  If they are <i>sans culottes,</i> people without a penny in their pockets, they may be happy to have no cares or worries in that respect. They will not be involved in this kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he will not stand &mdash; he suggests none of us should stand &mdash; for a situation which would enable wealthy people to avoid death duties. That is utterly wrong.  I do not think <Col N="1248" /> such an approach on the part of the Minister a proper ministerial approach at all.  I do not know who these people are; the Minister is, perhaps, closer to them than I am.  But I am concerned here with nameless people, people who have worked hard and done their best to provide for their dependants, anxious to make some disposition of their property. I am concerned here with people who seek advice and are told they can do certain things.  They do them.  They bear the expense of doing them.  They are advised that, by doing these things, their estates will attract no death duties. They enter into an arrangement.  Then we come along and we seek to change the law.  We are, I agree, entitled to change the law.  The Revenue Commissioners are, as Deputy Hogan said, entitled to change the rules of the game but they cannot change the score on the scoreboard.  That is the difference.  The new rules may apply from this on.  That is the just and fair way: it is utterly unjust to say, when the rules are changed, that they will carry their effect into the past and will affect the legal quality of a transaction entered into at some time in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it is sophistry to refer to these changes as retroactive legislation.  It is nothing less than retroactive legislation.  It is legislation affecting a transaction already concluded.  Of course it is retroactive. Of course, it is retrospective. We are supposed to have the duty and the obligation as legislators here not to wear blinkers.  We appear now to be doing something in conflict with the Constitution.  That is why I raise this. These benches have often in the past stressed the unconstitutionality of certain things and have been scouted and derided for their efforts.  But, quite frequently, in the last decade and a half our legislation here has been held to be unconstitutional by the courts, because Ministers would not listen. Where you have the conjunction of injustice, as you have here, and an apparent infringement of the Constitution, I prophesy that the Minister is heading for trouble.  It is perfectly clear that this tax avoidance device can cheerfully and with a great deal of good sense be ended by our legislation; it is a different matter altogether <Col N="1249" /> when we seek to change the score up to this point of time.  I do not think this is sophistry.  The Minister says it is.  He is entitled to his opinion.  I believe this legislation to be unjust and I think either of these amendments, simple amendments as they are, would provide against this injustice and should be accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins accused me of demagoguery.  He will know that I have carefully refrained from referring in anything but the most neutral language to the parties or the transactions, though I did, perhaps, go beyond that in my last remarks. If Deputy O'Higgins thinks I am being demagogic, I can assure him I can do much better than that. What I said was in the context of the picture painted by Deputy O'Higgins of the Revenue Commissioners being very upset and vindictive because somebody discovered a loophole in their legislation.  It was in that context I said what I did.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins says he considers this provision unjust.  I do not consider it unjust, for the reasons I have stated.  Deputy O'Higgins thinks this provision may be unconstitutional.  I do not think it is.  He painted a picture of what happens year after year &mdash; an accurate picture, I agree &mdash; but the fact that it happens year after year is the very point of principle we are discussing. I am not aware that this House has ever decided that the principle advocated by Deputy O'Higgins is one it should accept.  As I say, this goes on year after year.  It has gone on for a long time.  I will take the liberty now of quoting from the Official Report, column 1471 of volume 151, in relation to the debate on the Finance Bill of 1955.  I quote the late Deputy Briscoe:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me that he will examine the provision and see does it require some saving words and, in addition, will he say if he thinks it is fair to make this retrospective by having it apply now to transactions which have been completed maybe ten, 15 and 20 years ago and up to this were free from this particular method of getting extra <Col N="1250" /> money from the estate of a deceased person?</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Sweetman, who was Minister for Finance at the time, replied as follows:</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the last point Deputy Briscoe raised about retrospection. The position has always been that, in respect of death duties, the operative date has been the death of the person.  That has always been the practice right down through the years.  If it was desired to change the rate of estate duty at any time the change would have to be framed so that it would affect the deaths of people who were born on and after the date of the passing of the Act. Obviously, it might not come into effect for 60 or 70 years.  It would be quite nonsensical from the point of view of legislation and, from the point of view of administration, it would be utterly hopeless to have different rates running at the same time for people born at different times.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that what was said by the late Deputy Sweetman on that occasion, and has been said on many occasions before and since by different people particularly Ministers for Finance, represents the correct principle and the correct practice and that what Deputy O'Higgins is advocating is something that just could not be accepted.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows well&mdash;I am surprised at the Minister&mdash; that it is rather like a schoolboy debating device to quote Deputy Sweetman at me.  All right: let it be. He knows well that Deputy Sweetman was referring there to the broad incidence of death duties which, by reason of their name, operate and arise only on death because it is on death that the property passes.  It is as a result of death that legacy or other duties would attach.  But here, the operation we are dealing with is not the death: it is the entry into of this particular arrangement, the making of this arrangement, because surely we are dealing with what will happen on the death of the person?  The death is a known, accepted, inevitable happening.  It is the preparation for the death.</P>

      <P>Death duties can attach only on death.  We are concerned with what makes death duties attach to the occurrence of death after the enactment of this Bill &mdash; the effect of this section bearing on the arrangement which the deceased made during life.  As a result of this section, the arrangement he made will attract the imposition of death duties &mdash; not the death but the arrangement he made with this section impinging on it.  That is what brings about the liability for duty.  Here is a clear distinction.</P>
      <P>You can provide that all such arrangements made after the enactment of this Bill shall be caught by this section and shall be dealt with by this section but that arrangements made before the section was brought into operation should not be so caught.  It is not a question of death.  It is a question of arrangements <i>inter vivos,</i> during his lifetime, made by the person concerned. There is a clear distinction.</P>

      <P>I shall explain what I have in mind.  If the Minister tells me it is covered by the proposed section 37 I am quite happy.  Under the provisions of section 7 (10) of the Finance Act, 1894, there is a prohibition or relief against double estate duty.  It provides that estate duty cannot be levied in respect of the same death on the same property.  It seems to me that the effect now of sections 20 and 21 of the 1965 Finance Act, as amended, is to provide for two different types of property deemed to pass on death &mdash; in the one instance, a benefit from the company and, in the other instance, a provision arising from the dividend that will now come into operation.  These are two different types of property.  It seems to me that there may be a danger of double estate duty falling because the property is not the same.  Even if it is covered for a different reason by the proposed section, I am quite happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure if what I am about to say covers the precise point made by Deputy O'Higgins.  The Deputy I think has referred to section 20 (8) of the 1965 Finance Act the contents of which I need not go into.  If a company controlled by the deceased transfer an asset to an individual or to another company controlled by the deceased, the shares of the first company will be valued on the basis of the diminished assets and no question of a double charge will arise.  If a claim for duty arises in respect of an instruction received by the company for the transfer, and also in respect of the asset transferred, the possibility of a double charge is eliminated either by section <Col N="1253" /> 20 (3) (b) of the Finance Act, 1965, or by this proposed new section 37 to which I have referred previously.</P>
