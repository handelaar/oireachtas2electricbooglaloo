    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health with reference to a reply of 3rd June if he will state the location and date of the sample of Dublin Bay water mentioned by him which indicated excessive pollution and the steps which have since been taken to remove the cause of such excess pollution or to warn the public of its existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>The samples of sea water referred to were taken in April, 1969, at the base of the West Pier in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>Warning notices were immediately erected by the Dún Laoghaire Corporation advising bathers of the undesirability of bathing up to a certain point in Seapoint strand.</P>
      <P>The excess pollution was caused by the discharge into the sea at the West Pier of crude sewage from a small number of houses.  The corporation are taking steps to divert this sewage into a holding tank and eliminate the nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state if it is safe to bathe in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, the work has not yet been completed so, presumably, it would not be safe to bathe there.  The work is being carried out as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton  Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan  Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald, Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. P. Belton</b> asked the Minister for <Col N="638" /> Health how frequently samples of sea-water in Dublin Bay are taken to test for pollution; at how many points in the bay they are taken; and on the basis of the sampling the statistical chances of serious pollution occurring without being detected by these tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regular tests are made on samples of sea-water taken twice a month from March to October at nine points in Dublin Bay.  Less frequent samples are taken at three other points.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the condition of water at a bathing place cannot be judged on one particular sample but must be judged through analysing a series of samples; and the recent report of the Dublin Deputy Chief Medical Officer indicates that it has not been the experience here that the degree of pollution of sea-water in Dublin constitutes a health hazard.</P>
      <P>It may be possible that gross sewage may be washed in to any particular beach on a combination of tide, current, wind and temperature, but this would be an extremely rare occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to inform the House as to the location of the nine points at which tests are regularly carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tests are carried out as follows: at Claremont strand; Dollymount&mdash;two points; Sandymount; Seapoint; Sandycove and at Killiney&mdash; three points.  Less frequent samples are taken from Sutton, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire&mdash;Scotsman's Bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how near danger point the samples have reached?  Could he inform the House as to the steps that should be taken by bathers in Dublin Bay to avoid any damaging consequences to themselves by reason of the presence of sewage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not appear to have information as regards the actual count in respect of these areas.  Perhaps the Deputy would put down a question on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="639" /> Health if he will make a statement on his current plans for the future of Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my statement introducing the Estimate for the Department of Health on the 8th April last I dealt at some length with the general question of the future of our hospital services with particular reference to the recommendations in the FitzGerald Report.  I then indicated that, while the Government had accepted the whole of the report in principle, it would take some time for me to study in depth the proposals for the location of general hospitals, particularly in the midlands area.  I also made it clear that no major change in the use of a hospital would take place without full consultation with the interests concerned.</P>
      <P>In the case of Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, an important link has been established with St. Laurence's Hospital, Dublin, whereby visiting physicians from St. Laurence's provide a consultant medical service for Our Lady's Hospital.  I would hope to see an extension of ties such as this for this hospital and a strengthening of the outpatient consultant services provided there.  I expect that this process will be facilitated by the new administrative structure which is provided for in the new Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are excellent surgical services available in this hospital and it is essential that these be maintained, particularly for acute cases?  Is the Minister further aware that it is highly desirable that Meath people be hospitalised where they can be easily visited by their relatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As pointed out in the reply, no major change in the user of the hospital will be made without consultation with the interests concerned. The Deputy may be assured it will be a very considerable time before any such change will be contemplated.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="640" /> Health if he is aware of the hardship caused to many nurses who receive only cheques in payment of salaries during the current bank closure; and if he will request hospital authorities to arrange payment in cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no intimation that difficulty is being experienced by nurses in cashing pay cheques.  If the Deputy would furnish particulars of cases where hardship is arising I will see what can be done to ease the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister investigate the position in a number of hospitals in Dublin, certainly in a number of Dublin Health Authority hospitals, in which no cash facilities have been made available for night nurses?  Because of the long hours they work the Minister will appreciate that they have great difficulty in having access to cash facilities which might be available to other nurses.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough immediately, and without further investigation, to notify all health authorities that they should endeavour to make cash facilities available to all nurses in their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will take steps to have CIE postpone any increase in fares pending a full investigation into all the circumstances relevant to the proposed increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Under section 8 of the Transport Act, 1958, CIE are free to fix such charges as the board thinks fit for any services provided by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> The board notified me of their intention to increase fares and rates but at my request have deferred action pending consideration of the matter.</P>
    <P>I am investigating fully all the circumstances relevant to the proposed increases in CIE fares and rates.</P>
    <P>As indicated in my reply to a question on this subject on 26th May, 1970, the reasons for the proposed increases are increased costs, mainly labour costs.</P>
    <P>I see no necessity to set up a committee to inquire into the workings of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is not unusual to have as many as six officials engaged in training six trainee conductors in the Dublin area?  In Glasgow as many as 50 trainees are trained by one official. Does the Minister not consider this a colossal waste of money and does he not consider that, in the interests of everybody, he should set up this investigating committee and let people see where the waste is in CIE?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if, in view of the fact that it is only five or six months since this Dáil passed a new Transport Act making financial provision for CIE over the next five years, it does not seem extraordinary that a few months later CIE should come along and suggest an exorbitant increase in fares? Does this not indicate all is not well in the management of CIE?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware&mdash;practically everybody in Dublin is&mdash;that it is not an isolated case in which six officials are engaged in training six trainees.  It is the usual procedure and any bus conductor will tell the Minister that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for the pressures to which the Minister made reference in his original reply, can the Minister indicate what conceivable circumstances could justify CIE in seeking to increase bus fares by 45 to 50 per cent, which is the scale of fares proposed by CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>By agreement between Eurocontrol, the United Kingdom and this country air traffic control from 10,000 feet up in a sector of Irish airspace which includes County Donegal is exercised on behalf of this country and Eurocontrol by the British air traffic control service.  This sector of Irish airspace extends like a peninsula into British controlled airspace and it would be inconvenient and unsafe to require overflying aircraft to switch from British to Irish communication frequencies for the few minutes required to pass through it. For similar operational reasons Irish air traffic control extends into a sector of British air space due east of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The air traffic control training school at Shannon was established in 1964 at a cost of £40,000 which represented principally the cost of a radar simulator.</P>
      <P>It was found necessary recently to transfer the school from Shannon for the following reasons.  Aircraft movements which can be used for radar training purposes are more conveniently available at Dublin Airport. Army Air Corps aircraft for special training flights can be made available more economically and conveniently there.  Civil aircraft are available to a greater extent over the daylight hours and can and do, with the pilots' co-operation, participate to a greater extent in practice radar approaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> A further reason is the increase in the number of training movements at Shannon which are now a substantial source of revenue but which cannot be used for radar training purposes because of the nature of the movements. In these circumstances it had been found necessary, to a growing extent, to send Shannon ATC personnel on courses to Dublin Airport for radar training.</P>
    <P>The radar simulator provided for the school will be removed from Shannon to Dublin Airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to look into the whole question of future training facilities for air traffic control in view of the fact that the range and area covered by Shannon Control is far greater than the range and area covered by Dublin? It follows from that that the range of training facilities is also much wider and everything points to the fact that Shannon should be the air traffic control training centre.  Would the Minister care to look into this whole matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeing a deputation from Shannon Airport on the matter.  The fact is Army aircraft are available in Dublin.  Shannon is actually too busy and the business they do, through night flights in particular, is not suitable for training purposes. Facilities in Dublin are more suitable for training purposes.  However, as I say, I am meeting a deputation about this.</P>

      <P>I am not empowered to remove abandoned vehicles.  Apart from powers exercised by a local authority under the sanitary services code, existing powers to deal with abandoned vehicles are contained in section 97 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  In pursuance of that section a member of the Garda Síochána may remove a vehicle which has been abandoned on a public road or may cause any other person to remove it. Section 63 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, substituted a new section for section 97 which empowers me to make regulations providing for the removal, storage and disposal of vehicles which have been, or appear to have been, abandoned on a public road or in a public car park or which have been parked illegally.  These powers would be exercisable by the local authority or the Garda as may be appropriate. At this stage, final drafting of the proposed regulations is proceeding.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the lifts in Ballymun are of poor quality.  On the contrary, I am advised that these lifts are of sophisticated design and robust construction. Their design commenced in September, 1965.  Manufacture began soon afterwards and continued, up to last year, during the course of construction of the flats.  The National Building Agency Limited accepted the lowest tender for the supply of the lifts which had to comply with an exacting standard specified by them.  The lifts were so designed that their operation would be unaffected by adverse weather conditions, and that they would be used internally, in accordance with normal practice.</P>

The records in my Department show that on 28th December, 1966, the Minister, on appeal, refused an application for the retention of structures on the site which were being used as a bacon factory.  The enforcement of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963, is a matter for the planning authority in the first instance and I would suggest that the Deputy should approach Dublin Corporation to see what steps they may be taking in this matter.  The question of an action for breach of a covenant in the lease is also a matter for the corporation.

      <P>The number issued was 429,719.</P>
      <P>My Department maintains records of all licences issued.  These records enable existing licensees to be reminded when renewal is due and inquiries to be instituted in cases where renewal is not effected within a reasonable time. Householders who are not recorded as holding licences and who are suspected of having television sets, are written to and if necessary visited.  Intensive campaigns against evaders are held from time to time.  A special television detector van&mdash;the most modern of its type available&mdash;was recently brought into use.</P>
      <P>Persons found in possession of unlicensed sets are prosecuted as a matter of course.  New legislation providing, <i>inter alia,</i> for increased fines is in course of preparation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospects for increased employment and increased production this year do not look too good at present.  The projections of growth for 1970 are down on the growth projections for 1969.  Quite apart from any political crisis there <Col N="666" /> may be in the country at present there is a crisis in industry as a whole because of increasing competition and this summer, when we will have another reduction in the tariffs between our goods and those of Britain, there will be that much keener competition on our home market.</P>
      <P>I have already pointed out that a serious situation faces us on the so-called home market.  There is a great increase in the amount of imported confectionery of all kinds, biscuits and cheese, with the result that comparable Irish goods are not being purchased in the same volume.  If one looks at the figures for biscuits, cakes and confectionery between 1967 and 1969 there has been an increase of 147 per cent in imports.  The main component of this increase is in the biscuit field. In many of our supermarkets at present it is easier to buy English biscuits than the comparable Irish article. There is a fantastic and phenomenal increase in the sale of these goods.  It is more than a coincidence that many of these supermarkets have already fallen under the control of British parent firms.  I think of the supermarket chain, Powers, and their association with Associated British Foods.  They are, in co-operation with these agencies in England, intensifying their attacks on our home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had some pious platitudes in his speech about his desire to see small retail outlets increased. He said he desired to see them fostered and rendered more efficient.  The plain statistical facts are that these small retail outlets are being swallowed up by the large supermarket chains and that an appreciable element is controlled by Britain.  This means that the home market is being steadily taken over by British agencies.  Similarly, in imported clothing and footwear on the home market there has been an increase of 123 per cent between 1967 and 1969.  All of these increases are directly attributable to the effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  We can prove in pounds, shillings and pence that the increases are directly related to the manner in which our tariffs have gone down summer by summer.  We can say with absolute certainty that, after the further <Col N="667" /> tariff reduction this summer, these imports will have increased commensurately by this time next year.  There has been an increase too in imports of agricultural machinery, notably tractors. Admittedly we cannot manufacture our own tractors but it is regrettable in relation to a great deal of the other machinery necessary for agriculture and industry that we evidently cannot make any arrangements to manufacture or provide this at home.  There has been an increase of 80 per cent in imports of agricultural machinery between 1967 and 1969.</P>
    <P>All these storm signals for our home market must be studied with great care by the Government if they are interested in these things any longer.  It means that this so-called secure home market is more and more under siege by competitors abroad.  Without ever going into the EEC the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement contains all the ingredients for a massive onslaught on our home market.  Without ever invoking the Treaty of Rome this Government, by their participation in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, have put in jeopardy the jobs of thousands of Irish people. Therefore, in those areas where there has been a great penetration by British interests we should seek a review of the effects of this agreement.  Most certainly we should cast a cold eye over the entire operation of this agreement because, whatever may have been said at the outset about its benefits and advantages to this country, since its inception it apparently means that the British partner in the agreement has gone ahead and done exactly as he saw fit to suit his particular condition at any time.</P>
    <P>It is true that there was an increase in jobs in 1969 but in our projections of job creation we have constantly underestimated the number of people leaving agriculture.  Each year the number of young people leaving agriculture &mdash;and they are mainly young people&mdash; has exceeded the projection made the year before.  Each year the number leaving agriculture has been in excess of the number estimated by 4,000, 5,000 or 6,000 people.  We must revise our expectations of the number of <Col N="668" /> people leaving agriculture over the next few years.  In each year the number leaving will exceed the official numbers we have had up to now by 4,000 or 5,000 people.  This is one of the reasons why we are not creating any new opportunities for the population as a whole.  Last year the number of new jobs created in industry roughly equalled the number of people leaving agriculture, so that we are tending to maintain a stationary position in the matter of jobs.  We are not making any notable advance.  We are merely cancelling out the losses in agriculture by the number of new jobs we create each year in industry.</P>
    <P>It may be all right for the Minister to say that he is in favour of small firms, small distribution agencies, continuing. The cold facts suggest that the foreign competition, the larger grouping in supermarkets, is steadily making life impossible for the small shopkeeper.  In fact, the real effects of Government policy must mean the ending of the small shop era.  This, I am afraid, is rapidly becoming a fact up and down the country.  I do not know what the turnover of the average small shopkeeper is.  We hear a lot about the claims of different interests in our community&mdash;farmers, urban workers and so on&mdash;for an agreed annual increase in their income, but I would say that a number of small shopkeepers must be living on less than £9 or £10 a week.  They may have a large turnover but many of them must be earning no more than this per week for much longer hours than any other element in the community.</P>
    <P>There is an unfavourable trend in the new industries we are getting and I do not know what the answer to it is.  The equation between the capital we are putting into it and the number of people who will be employed seems to be becoming more and more chaotic and out of balance.  For the Pfizer plant in County Cork, with a suggested capital of £8 million, we will get 350 jobs.  This is a very high price for new jobs created.  For the BASF factory proposal, for a suggested capital of £20 million, we are getting 700 new jobs.  It is true that in many of these cases if these firms link up with existing firms and if, for example, in that <Col N="669" /> southern area we are planning to establish a chain of chemical industries, it may be considered worthwhile.  But we must remember that, where capital investment of £8 million to a foreign industry is involved, then the Irish taxpayer is paying many millions into that investment and, consequently, less money is available for starting industry in other parts of the country.  The positive side of such investment is the employment it creates, but it must mean also that our scarce capital is rendered that much more scarce and cannot be spread around. Certainly the equation of £8 million for 350 jobs requires much argument before it can be accepted.  I hope the Minister has indulged in this kind of argument.  We must subject each new investment of this size to the most stringent criteria to ensure that the capital we have available is used to the best possible effect.</P>
    <P>Everything we say or do is affected by our application to join the EEC. There is enough fissionable material in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement to explode any possibilities we have of building up an independent home market and thereby creating more jobs.  The EEC will be the challenge of all challenges if we are forced to join it.  The Government's White Paper on the EEC states it is necessary to face up to the fact that membership of the EEC would pose problems, possibly of a serious nature, for some sectors of industry as well as for individual firms.</P>
    <P>We must know what negotiating terms the Government propose in their application for membership and what remedial action they propose to take to ensure that jobs are made secure.  We cannot simply leave this to the good will of the Confederation of Irish Industries, the Federated Union of Employers or even to the Government itself; there must be total co-operation of all those involved in providing jobs.</P>
    <P>Every Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the present Minister is no exception, in his Estimate speech has admitted that certain firms have not adapted as rapidly as desired.  The present Minister has admitted that <Col N="670" /> certain sectors of industry do not seem to be concerned that the outcome of our entry to the EEC may be to diminish the number of jobs and close many firms.  The Government cannot ignore this attitude any longer.  We can count as lost all the jobs provided at present by firms who have not adapted or have not shown any interest in competing in an open European market.  The Government must take emergency action, if they are serious about saving jobs and ensuring that the mental attitudes&mdash;which the Minister has stressed are so important in the face of free trade&mdash;of managements controlling these firms are changed, and must consider removing the aids, grants and tax concessions from those firms because the criminal neglect of the future of their employees calls for such stern action.  I realise this course of action is unorthodox but in cases where firms are not co-operating or preparing for entry into a free trade area I think it is necessary.  It is not sufficient that year after year we should come in here and bewail the fact that so many firms are not interested in making these necessary preparations.  We must take stern action.</P>
    <P>It is true that any enlarged market area will give us further export opportunities but what has influenced this party's attitude to the possibilities of free trade and what has made us oppose the measures suggested so far has been our realisation that we have a low level of development.  We are not in the same category as our future partners.  Industry in member countries is far better developed than ours and these countries are in a far better position to take advantage of any large marketing area.  We require a different relationship with any free trade area than these countries would.  We need a particular relationship to suit our under-developed conditions.</P>
    <P>If we are to take advantage of this large export area which may be opened up to us in any future arrangement our preparation must not be confined to physical adaptation of plant and so on. The amount we spend on research in industry is pitiful by international standards.  If we are to take advantage <Col N="671" /> of these newly opened export markets we must devote a greater amount of cash to research.</P>
    <P>Marketing itself is at a very early stage of development here.  It is doubtful if management is convinced about the importance of marketing techniques. The development of a proper marketing technique calls for research of the product and development in selling.  Such facilities are employed by many firms in Europe but our small unit size means that these areas are purely of academic interest.  Proper attention to market production, development and so on is essential if we are to take advantage of these new export markets.  Many home produced goods are losing their place on the home market to foreign produced goods and this is probably due to our poor command of design.  Clothing and footwear imports amounted to nearly £5 million in 1967 and to £11 million in 1969.  There are many firms engaged in manufacturing clothing and footwear here but I think these import figures are attributable to the lack of design and lack of style of our goods.  The Kilkenny Design Workshop is doing an admirable job in this field but a great deal more needs to be done especially in the clothing and footwear lines where style is the important factor.  What chance have Irish goods abroad if people here refuse to buy them to the tune of £11 million in spite of the fact that there is a very high duty on all goods imported from Europe?</P>
    <P>These are some of the problems that Government reports talk about when they say we have encountered X problems and we are considering Y of them and we shall be issuing a further report in due course.  This official manner of brushing away real problems is at this moment a luxury we can ill afford.  That is a startling increase in the volume of imports in this particular area and does not give us much encouragement as to our capability of withstanding the keen competition that faces us in the future.</P>
    <P>It has not been all a case of lack of progress and dismal failure; there has been some initiative on the part of Irish firms and it must be hailed and <Col N="672" /> welcomed and, if possible, improved. The initiative of the eight leading sweet or candy manufacturers&mdash;as they now call themselves&mdash;and the Sugar Company in an effort to open up a new export market to the United States must be hailed.  This is the kind of thing we want.  If our small firms are on unit size too small, co-operation is no longer a luxury.  Individualism in industry will not pay in future.  We must have more co-operation and we must have the Department of Industry and Commerce itself initiating merger talks between companies.  No longer should they be content to turn up when the mergers take place, to cut tapes and act as bystanders.  Through the IDA and other specialised agencies the Department must enter into the merger area, bring about the merger of Irish firms working in the one industry and tell these firms that their safety in future depends on their co-operation now and that now is the time for them to get together to withstand future competition.</P>
    <P>What we have been saying in the wilderness for years past about the necessity for the State itself to make a positive approach in the matter of industrial investment and to involve itself in the creation of new industry, we can now see will be ever more necessary in the future.  Those Deputies in every part of the House who have been calling for our involvement in the EEC or in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement must now realise that in order to defend the taxpayers' investment in the country the State itself must take far greater responsibility for ensuring that employment and economic control can be maintained to the greatest degree possible in Irish hands in the future.  The State itself must initiate mergers and take part in the decision-making in Irish industry at present to a far greater extent than in the past.</P>
    <P>There has been a merger between Carrolls, UDI and Waterford Glass and that is a very welcome development also but there are too few examples in Irish industry of this kind of merger to face the dangerous future. Too many firms are apparently still refusing to go ahead with adaptation and so on and I have suggested certain <Col N="673" /> remedies should they continue in that attitude.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, it is only a minority of firms but I noticed last week in a report of, I think, the women's outer garment industry that at least five firms&mdash;I shall not mention names; some of them were Dublin firms&mdash;had received grants but had refused to fill in a questionnaire to tell the Department concerned with the report exactly how their adaptation was proceeding. They could take the taxpayers' money but would not answer the Government's questions.  This kind of approach in Irish industry must be ended because if any Government is to negotiate for proper conditions in the EEC it is essential that they should know the true position in Irish industry.  If Irish firms consider that they can continue on a Sinn Féin course of refusing to give any information to the Government about their adaptation and preparedness at this time they must be disillusioned because they are not playing the game.  They receive taxpayers' money but will not answer the taxpayers' representative when he asks them how the money was spent and what are their plans for the coming year.  I read in that report of at least five or six firms who refused to answer the questionnaire.  All of us must complete income tax forms as individuals each year and we are heavily penalised if we do not.  I think we must also consider penalties for those firms which take money and refuse to answer the questions they are asked.</P>

      <P>We all welcomed the changes in the IDA, which were very important, giving greater flexibility to this State agency.  We now have shareholding powers in the IDA and in the legislation setting it up we have stressed the whole idea of linkage. In our report on grant-aided industry printed in 1967 reference was made to this lack of any concept of linkage in the way we gave grants to industries.  Now at least this concept is acknowledged in the legislation setting up the IDA.  Whether the IDA is at present sufficiently well staffed to live up to the expectations of the legislation <Col N="674" /> is another matter.  I do not know sufficient about its staffing arrangements at present but certainly some of the mistakes made by that body's predecessor in the past are directly attributable to the lack of specialised staff and the loss of some of the taxpayers' money can be attributed to the same failure and lack in that State agency.</P>
      <P>The Devlin Report talked about the necessity of linking it up with the foreign service.  As a small country the primary aims of our foreign service must be to win new markets, new trading partners, new export markets. We should bring under the one roof the activities of the IDA, Córas Tráchtála and the Credit Corporation.  After all, the initial contact abroad, the research at home and the eventual establishment of the firm are inter-related activities.  Some years ago I had occasion here to criticise the kind of diplomat who was ludicrous in our circumstances, the diplomat who considered trade a dirty word.  I think there is a different approach today and that all our embassies are alive to the necessity of winning trade for this country.  Perhaps some consideration could be given to a link-up between these activities, the foreign service and the industrial and State agencies at home because there is a great deal of work to be done in securing foreign markets.</P>
      <P>It is tragic to travel around the USA and find in their supermarkets goods of every country, from Lapland to Finland, and find no Irish cheese.  It is also tragic to find, as I was told when I was in the US, that Irish people could find Polish ham on sale at the corner shop but no word of any similar Irish product.  Admittedly, last year the Poles were getting rid of a glut and were, in fact, dumping their ham.  Still it is true that in many of these countries with which we have maintained a traditional friendship and where there is a large number of Irish people with a great deal of goodwill towards our products, in some cases seemingly, if properly developed a more faithful grouping of purchases could result than we are likely to meet in any of the European countries in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> It is tragic that so many of the states of the USA have so few Irish products on display.  There is no easy answer to this, I agree, but there is a great deal to be said for sending more men into that field and paying them according to the initiative they display and the amount of business they open up. There is no such things as a nine to five job in this area and I would be quite prepared to pay a State servant or anybody else on results in winning new markets.  The sky should be the limit for the salary of the CTT official abroad who opens up a valuable new market and on whose initiative the contacts were made.  There need be no ceiling to such a person's salary.  I believe also that the reverse holds, that those who are not making valuable contacts or gaining results abroad should have their terms of service reconsidered and be brought back home. Winning new markets means new jobs at home, more prosperity, raising incomes at home and achieving the targets we have not achieved in the matter of employment.</P>
    <P>I was very much impressed by the work of CTT in New York and other parts of the United States.  I was also convinced that our own foreign service in the United States is considerably undermanned.  We have dedicated officials working in drab offices which could not have impressed many callers and certainly would not have enticed any industrialists to set up a firm in the home country.  A great deal more work needs to be done.  There have been many well-publicised trips abroad by Ministers for Industry and Commerce. As the Minister knows, his predecessor had a veritable passion for being abroad and he travelled to the Middle East, the United States and Australia. I do not know which country had his attentions most of the time, but I would prefer to see more working trips abroad by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, less palaver with officials and more searching questions to find out what exactly has been achieved in each area.</P>
    <P>If every other country on the face of the earth can sell its products or even a portion of its products in places <Col N="676" /> like the United States, there is something wrong if we cannot do it. Admittedly, there are quota restrictions and all sorts of inbuilt prejudices in the American Government; it is quite astonishing to find our own people here so deluged with propaganda about free trade, but the United States Government are not so taken with it: free trade when it suits American businessmen but restrictive practices when they are affected by exports from abroad.  Of course, this is a sensible attitude on the part of any country but we are seemingly converts all the way in the matter of free trade.  We have to go along with it, but we have not the amount of muscle that the Americans or other large industrial countries can command.  More must be done in those markets where at least we have some emotional ties among certain sections of the population.  More must be done to exploit those sentimental ties than is being done at present. If we cannot export to those markets then our prospects when we join the EEC will be very poor.  All along we have been saying that there has been a great deal of moonshine talked about EEC possibilities.  With a stronger industrial foundation I would not have seen any objection to participation in the EEC, but knowing as I do, to some extent at any rate, the weakness of most of our industry, I have very great fears about our prospects of surviving in that area.  So far I do not see the same reaction to this state of affairs evident in the Government benches.  Rather we see a state of total confidence and unflappability. This is all very well but when the storm breaks I hope we shall not discover that this confidence on the part of the Government was misplaced.</P>
    <P>The IDA should be asked to give us without delay some facts consequent on our membership of the EEC.  There should be a review as soon as possible of some of those firms which will be vulnerable to foreign takeover when we join the EEC, because this will undoubtedly follow.  There will be a great spate of takeover bids and many old firms will go to the wall.  It may be that we shall see a decision by those foreign firms which have established Irish subsidiaries to close down the <Col N="677" /> independent operation of the Irish subsidiary and to turn it into a packaging unit to pass out the products of the foreign firm.  Certainly an examination is needed by the IDA of those areas of Irish industry which may prove to be particularly vulnerable to takeover and merger with all the consequences this may have for the employees of such firms.</P>
    <P>There must be a positive approach in regard to mergers.  The State and the merging firms should engage in a joint venture, a partnership.  In this connection one could imagine the seconding of appropriate officials from the IDA and other State agencies where there are such specialised people.  I noted that the spokesman for Industry and Commerce of the Fine Gael Party did not think a great deal of opening up markets in eastern Europe.  He spoke about relying on the British market.</P>

      <P>I believe that no political boundaries should curtail our trading activities.  It does not occur in the case of other countries whose Christianity or other religious belief may be as sincere as ours.  It is wrong that any political reason should prevent us from trading wherever trading is possible.  Perhaps Deputy Donegan did not mean this.  He referred to the tough negotiations one encounters with such countries.  I agree with him.  Most of these countries engage in very tough bargaining, but our target should be the diversification of our markets.  It is a geographical fact that the British market will always be our most important one, but we must diversify our markets as much as possible.  It would be foolish to allow the prospect of tough bargaining or any political consideration to prevent us from opening up new markets.  We in this country have matured sufficiently to recognise that trading with a country does not necessarily mean approving of its political system.  Whatever our politics are, trade with other countries is as essential as the air we breathe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment will be down this year. There will not be the same growth in <Col N="678" /> production.  There will be keener competition from Britain this year after the tariff cut.  The <i>Quarterly Survey</i> of the Federation of Irish Industries for March, 1970, suggests that our sales might have been increasing at a slower rate than in the previous quarter.  They suggest there has been a general slowing down in the increase in both production and home sales.  That means, of course, that 1970 will not be a remarkable year for growth, for new jobs, and that the problem we face this year will be very serious</P>
    <P>I would mention the problem of mounting prices.  We have not yet got the quarterly reports for May but the indication from consumers in the shops is that the price increases which the Irish public are facing are far in excess of the taxation increases in the Budget. This means that the entire cost-of-living index will jump sharply.  When we have the figures we will be able to confirm this, but pressure must commence all round, in the total confusion that now reigns, for more wage increases this year.  There are already problems about wage costs, and what the answer to this confused situation is I do not know.  It is a very big problem.</P>
    <P>Of course we are reaping in 1970 the effects of so many years of lack of decision on incomes planning and it seems this will be the year which will catch us, which will catch the Government out for their lack of planning, their lack of decision.  I do not think we can count this year on the rate of capital inflow we had last year.  I doubt it. That, of course, has been one of the things that has prevented our balance of payments going totally crazy.  Whether we can count on it this year is, as I have said, highly problematical.</P>
    <P>We come back, then, to the old problem of the whole balance of payments situation.  According as gross national production goes up, according as we get more capital investment in industry, according as we get more industries, we have the tragic dilemma for a country attempting to right its balance of payments that we can talk about the balance of payments situation being affected that much more grievously because most of the machinery for industry has to be imported.  I give the <Col N="679" /> example of the Cork firm.  A comparable British firm can be seen to give benefits right through the economy, whereas we can see here that the import of machinery for the setting up of a large industry will hit grievously at our balance of payments.  The reason a comparable British investment in an industry spreads prosperity throughout the economy is that they have a large industrial base, a better industrial infrastructure than we have.</P>
    <P>Our comparable infrastructure should be agriculture, but here we have had the horrible situation where the food industry, and the industries associated with it based on our agriculture, is falling increasingly into the hands of foreigners.  The only industry native to this country, the one from which new investment might be seen to have a multiplier effect throughout the economy, is being taken over by large British combines.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the maintaining of independence in the years ahead will call for a strategy which this Government are incapable of having, for an awareness which this Government have shown themselves to be incapable of having.  This independence in the years ahead, the kind of independence that will allow control to remain over certain of our economic decisions, is something to which the Government have shown themselves to be insensitive.  They have shown themselves to be unimpressed by the necessity to have that independence. The food industry more and more becomes a prey to foreign investment and the prospect is that the main momentum of future industrial development in this country will come from capital inflow from abroad.  That is a very precarious basis on which to plan industrial development.</P>
    <P>The year 1970 is the one in which the Department of Industry and Commerce especially will come under strain.  The Department must endeavour, first of all, to incorporate the various State agencies, bodies like the IDA, the CTT and others, into industrial planning for the future.  Whatever our political ideologies, it is clear that in free trade conditions it is necessary that the State be utilised fully to <Col N="680" /> preserve our independence.  In economic decision-making, the State must become the main prow of any advance we make in providing employment, and for that purpose I suggest that the Minister should encourage the more rapid merger of particular firms, the State itself going into partnership in those firms, on their boards, to provide for a greater say by the taxpayer in the affairs of firms on which taxpayers' money has been spent.</P>
    <P>In the area of industrial advance, in the area of more employment, of maintaining economic independence, it becomes essential that the State should not stand idly by.  This Department in the past has played the role of a referee in the matter of industrial development&mdash;a referee who provided the funds and did not ask questions, a referee who was satisfied with the reports and passed benign comments on them.  This role is not any longer sufficient. I do not know whether our plea will fall on deaf ears but I emphasise the necessity for the Department of Industry and Commerce to depart from this role of a referee and to use the specialised agencies available to it in the development of industry and in the provision and the maintenance of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I fully agree with the observations of my colleague, Deputy Donegan, when he said he regretted that the Minister did not avail himself of the opportunity presented by the debate on this Estimate to outline the possibilities for Irish industry in the European Economic Community. Although I accept that a full-scale debate on EEC membership will take place in the near future, because he has come to the Department recently I think the Minister might have availed of this opportunity to throw some light on the problems confronting Irish industry if we become members of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that fears have been expressed in certain sectors of our manufacturing industry about the likely consequences of EEC membership. I do not claim to be an expert on it and when he is replying, perhaps, the Minister will let us know his own <Col N="681" /> views, let us know what he thinks the possibilities and the problems will be for Irish industry when we become members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan dealt in great detail with every aspect of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I want to pick out a few aspects of the work of the Department which have not been adverted to so far by any speaker.  In regard to the small industries division of the Department the Minister's predecessor, a short time before the Government crisis which led to the changing of Ministries, announced that he was proposing to change the definition of &ldquo;small industry&rdquo;.  Up to this a small industry was one which employed up to a maximum of 20 people and anybody with a proposal or an idea for the establishment of such an industry was referred to the small industries division of the Industrial Development Authority.  The Minister's predecessor announced that it was proposed to change the figure and to apply the definition &ldquo;small industry&rdquo; to any industry employing 50 or under.  The Minister did not refer to this matter when he was introducing his Estimate. I have been extremely interested in the progress of the small industries division and on many occasions here I have spoken in support of their aims and objectives.  I have had personal contact with the officials of the division in Dublin and also with some of the field men who are sent to investigate proposals and I must say they are a band of very dedicated men.  They more or less started from scratch, because there was no precedent for such an agency here to encourage the establishment of small industries.  I have been very impressed by the progress they have made.</P>
    <P>The idea of confining the functions of the small industries division to industries which did not employ more than 20 was rather restrictive.  I presume there are strong arguments in favour of designating any industry with an employment content of up to 50 as a small industry.  I want the Minister to throw some light on this matter in view of the trend towards regionalisation.  It is only a short time ago since we had a debate here on a Bill to extend the functions of <Col N="682" /> the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which, in fact, brought into existence for the first time the first regional organisation in this country and I should like to know from the Minister what his intentions are in regard to the future role of the small industries division.  Irrespective of whether or not we enter the EEC, and no matter what the trend may be, there is a special place for an agency such as the small industries division. It is worth nothing that even in the most highly advanced and most highly industrialised countries, such as the United States of America, Britain, Germany and, indeed, in most countries in western Europe, there are official agencies specifically charged with promoting the establishment of small industries.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the employment content of industry in the USA or on the Continent of Europe, one very remarkable thing emerges and that is the proportion of people employed in very small industries.  There is a tremendous scope for the development of small industries particularly of the craft type of industry.  In Germany there is an organisation which was set up specially to promote craft industries. There is in this country a large amount of latent skill which has been inherited over several generations in various families.  An example of highly skilled craft work which springs to mind, particularly to one coming from Limerick, is the traditional craft of producing Limerick lace.  It is a well-known fact that we have had the experience in the Limerick region, and particularly in the duty free shop at Shannon, of having had a tremendous number of inquiries for this type of product.  Due to the high labour content and the long period of training which is necessary to produce a product like Limerick lace, the demand for the product has considerably exceeded the supply for quite a time.  Limerick lace is produced by the Good Shepherd nuns in Limerick.  I understand that the possibility of streamlining the production of Limerick lace and of having a special factory set up to produce it was investigated.  One potential industrialist who investigated the possibility of producing Limerick <Col N="683" /> lace commercially informed me that this particular type of skill or craft does not lend itself to mass production of the lace.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous scope for the small industry, the craft industry, or the cottage industry, as it is often popularly called.  Since the establishment of the small industries division five or six years ago new ground has been broken and the division have done a tremendous job of work, but the time is opportune now when the whole approach to the development of small industries and the encouragement of craft industries and so forth might be reviewed with a view to streamlining the whole operation.  In the course of my inquiries into the production and marketing of these types of products I found that in a household or in a family there will be someone who has a natural ability for, say, woodcarving or something like that, and somewhere else there will be someone who is doing crochet work or some other type of work, and the problem is that while these people can produce the goods they do not know how to market them or sell them.  There is a great need for some special type of marketing organistation, perhaps, within Córas Tráchtála. There is need for a specialised unit which would engage in marketing the products of small craft industries; perhaps it might be a unit in Córas Tráchtála similar to the small industries division of the IDA.</P>
    <P>There is one outstanding example of considerable progress having been made in marketing the products of cottage industries in the west of Ireland. I refer to the Slieve Bawn Co-operative which I understand is situated on the border of County Roscommon and County Mayo.  What has happened in this case is an interesting example of the application of the principles of co-operation to the marketing of manufactured products.  The first step taken in this instance was to encourage people who had the talent and skill to produce these goods.  When the goods were produced they were taken to a special depot and a separate organisation looked for, and supplied, the markets for the products.  It is not of much use <Col N="684" /> to encourage a man to produce goods unless an effort is made to find a market for the products.  I am not satisfied with existing marketing arrangements and this applies in particular to the export market for craft work.  The Minister comes from a rural area and I am sure he knows of people who have the necessary talent and skill to produce high-quality goods.  There is a demand but the marketing aspect needs to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>A matter which has been referred to on several occasions in this House, and Deputy Donegan mentioned it recently, is the present system operated by Irish Steel Holdings for purchasing scrap steel.  I have no personal axe to grind in this matter&mdash;it does not concern my constituency except perhaps in a minor way&mdash;but from a study of the subject in the last week it appears to me that nothing short of a racket is operating here.  The prices paid by Irish Steel Holdings for scrap steel range from an average of £4 15s per ton for lots of up to 5,000 tons to £8 11s 6d for lots over 18,000 tons. This means that the large concern receives nearly double the amount the small businessman will get.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the reasoning behind this.  One explanation given to me was that Irish Steel Holdings must ensure that its production is kept at a maximum and the best way of ensuring an adequate supply of raw material is to encourage the large concerns to go into the business. I understand one company is supplying the bulk of the scrap steel delivered to Haulbowline every year and that the managing director of that concern is also a director of Irish Steel Holdings: the private commercial firm is Hammond Lane Limited.</P>
    <P>There is also another aspect of this matter.  CIE supplies all of its scrap steel to Haulbowline and I am told the average price is £6 per ton.  It would appear that in addition to subsidising CIE, the taxpayers are indirectly subsidising Irish Steel Holdings.  I cannot see any justification for having such a wide differential in prices; 15 different prices are listed in the quoted prices for scrap steel ranging from £4 15s per ton for lots of up to <Col N="685" /> 5,000 tons to £8 11s 6d for lots in excess of 18,000 tons.</P>
    <P>The small scrap merchant who perhaps delivers 500 tons in the course of a year to Irish Steel holdings is entitled to the same price as that given to the larger concern.  I have no personal involvement in this matter but it appears to me from submissions made to me and from my inquiries that the whole question of the purchase of scrap steel by Irish Steel Holdings warrants an inquiry.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter with a view to having this outrageous situation remedied.  It infringes every basic concept of fair play that this large monopoly, whose managing director is also a director of Irish Steel Holdings, should have a monopoly of the scrap steel industry of this country while the unfortunate small man trying to make a livelihood is being victimised and treated most unfairly. Perhaps the Minister, since Deputy Donegan mentioned this, has looked into it.  I want to tell him that I intend to pursue this matter and I intend to raise it at Question Time with a view to having an inquiry into it and having a rational price system introduced so that fair play will be given to every person engaged in the scrap steel business.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the establishment of industrial estates.  In the recent debate regarding the extension of the functions of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary, reference was made to the Shannon industrial estate and to the fact that an industrial estate is being established at Limerick. There is no doubt that the setting up of industrial estates and the building of advance factories in particular&mdash; whether these advance factories are provided in single units or in groups within an industrial estate&mdash;are necessary prerequisites for the attraction of industry.  There is every advantage in having an advance factory ready for occupation.  In many cases in the past, particularly where foreign industrialists were examining the possibilities of a certain location, because of the fact that the infrastructure did not exist there was between the time of the first <Col N="686" /> inquiry and the time when the industry was ready to go into production a time lag of two years and more.  Where there are advance factories ready for occupation there is minimum delay between the first inquiry and the time the factory can go into production.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the last debate on the Estimate for this Department the Minister's predecessor said in reply to a point I made that he did not intend to have advance factories sprouting like mushrooms all over the country.  I accept this but, certainly, if certain towns are to be designated as growth towns it is essential that advance factory buildings should be provided.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this which I have been reading about of late. Perhaps when the Minister is replying he would throw some light on it.  I understand that in certain areas it is intended to provide demountable, prefabricated industrial buildings.  This, I believe, applies in the case of small industries.  A building can be erected in a certain town and if, after a period of time, it is not needed it can be demounted and reconstructed in another area.  This term &ldquo;demountable, prefabricated industrial building&rdquo; is coming into the news of late.  I should like if the Minister would explain what exactly is meant by this and for what purposes such buildings are to be established.</P>
    <P>I have already said that the setting up of industrial estates and the provision of advance factories and the necessary infrastructure are prerequisites for the development of industry.  There is one problem which is beginning to come to light in recent times.  It is the absence of a proper manpower policy, the absence of surveys into the manpower available in certain regions, A manpower policy and employment surveys are absolutely necessary.  I understand there is a shortage of manpower and of qualified personnel to undertake these surveys. I have read the report of the Waterford Industrial Survey and was very impressed by it.  The pilot survey carried out in Drogheda, in Deputy Donegan's constituency, is also worthy of mention.  This was carried out by the Economics Department of UCD.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> Some months ago I was approached by certain commercial interests in my constituency and asked to investigate the possibility of obtaining assistance for a manpower survey in the area.  I found there was a serious shortage of persons qualified to undertake this work.  Industrialists coming in here from abroad are particularly concerned about the prospective availability of manpower.  There is also the situation arising that in certain areas there is a serious shortage of certain types of skilled labour.  In the Limerick/Shannon region at present there is a shortage of female labour.  One industrialist who came into Limerick, anxious to set up a manufacturing enterprise there in which 66 per cent of the employment would be for women, was advised to go away from the Limerick/Shannon region as there was a shortage of suitably qualified female workers in the area.  This is a serious problem.  It is of vital importance that when foreign industrialists are being encouraged and persuaded to come in here and certain locations are recommended to them all this scientific and technical data should be made available.  I am particularly conscious of the absence of statistical information on the availability of workers and particularly on the availability in future of certain types of workers.</P>
    <P>I have just realised, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the question of manpower policy does not come within the scope of the Minister's Department.  If I have infringed the rules I apologise. My intention was to point out to the Minister the implications in the absence of a manpower policy from the point of view of industrial development, for which the Minister is responsible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department.  While I realise that his stay there will be very short, I sincerely hope it will be very happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly glad to see an additional £3½ million being made available to the Industrial Development Authority in the current financial year.  The authority is doing an excellent job and it is only right <Col N="688" /> that the moneys made available to it should be increased as and when we can afford to increase them.</P>
      <P>In the rural areas we should concentrate more and more on small industries. We should encourage local people to start thinking for themselves in terms of the type of industry which would thrive best in their particular area and we should find out from them what ideas they have for the development of the local village or local town.  In every town and village there should be a local development association, the primary objective of which should be to acquire a site which would be available should some suitable industry offer for the area.  The provision of sites would attract industrialists. With the increasing value of land and the fall in the value of money people could not lose out on an investment like this.  Money spent on sites would be money well spent.  I would approve of the erection of factories in the larger towns of 1,000 or more population.  Perhaps the Minister would consider giving a grant to enable people to purchase sites.  The money would be well secured having regard to the value of property.  The local development associations should consider industries based on local raw material, such as fish, wool, timber and agricultural products.  I am particularly concerned about the quantity of foreign goods for sale here, particularly in the footwear and clothing trade.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to find out the real reason for these imports. I think there may be a greater margin of profit in the retailing of foreign clothing and foreign footwear.  I may be wrong in that, but it is something that should be investigated.  Far too many businesses are too keen to push foreign goods.  There is something wrong in this.  The profit margin may be the primary consideration here. Deputy Michael O'Leary said he thought it was a question of style; I doubt that very much.  It is probably a question of profit.  The time has come when another intensive Buy Irish campaign should be launched.  An all-out effort should be made to encourage <Col N="689" /> retailers to display Irish goods and to encourage customers to buy them.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the role of county development teams in the development of industry in the different counties.  These teams are doing excellent work.  The Kerry team has almost completed a survey on manpower.  The team worked on this for the past 18 months and covered practically every parish in the county.  It is now in a position to tell any industrialist what the manpower prospect is in any particular district and forecast what the position will be for quite a number of years ahead.  Every encouragement should be given to these teams to complete these surveys as quickly as possible.  Every encouragement should also be given to industrialists to move away from the larger centres of population out into the provincial towns.  Even if it is necessary to subsidise the cost of transporting the raw materials into these towns and the finished article out of them that would be money well spent.  It would be well worth the exercise to consider this method as a means of encouraging industrialists to set up factories down the country where there is manpower rather than encouraging the labour content to move to the larger cities and towns and to the industrial estates.</P>
      <P>I am aware, of course, that there are attractive additional grants in respect of industries in certain counties but perhaps these grants may not be sufficient in certain cases.</P>

      <P>In the interest of workers a closer watch should be kept <Col N="690" /> on industries in so far as sales and output are concerned.  It often happens that the first we hear of the closure of some small industry or, perhaps, a larger industry that may not be doing well, is when we are told that they have a stockpile of manufactured goods.  Perhaps the Minister would consider exercising some control or, at least, would consider carrying out a study to see what could be done to ensure that there is not too great a stockpile of manufactured goods in the stores attached to industries.  The Department might also endeavour to ensure that there is a continuance of sales of manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>The time has come when, apart from the issuing of leaflets to foreign industrialists giving details of grants, tax concessions and other facilities, the Industrial Development Authority should also publish information in booklet form with regard to the employment situation, the labour content and the advantages for industries in the various counties, stating exactly the position in each county.  This information should be supplied to anybody making an inquiry with a view to setting up an industry here.  A copy of the booklet could be sent to every industrialist who even in the remotest way was interested in coming here. The booklet could be distributed, in particular, to industrialists in countries where there is a huge labour problem. I shall not detain the House any longer but I should like to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he introduced the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In all discussions on industrial development there has been certain controversy as to whether industries should be spread thinly throughout the country or concentrated in a few centres.  Most expert opinion is now moving towards the idea that people should not have to travel a distance of more than ten miles or so to work.  In America it is said that one should not have to spend more than 15 minutes on the road morning and evening.  Give or take five miles, this is a reasonable suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this limit is extended to any great extent, worthwhile time which could be spent in valuable recreation is lost. <Col N="691" /> Furthermore, there is the cost element both to the individual and to the community of the provision of adequate transport facilities.  There is also the factor that if people spend too long a time travelling they cannot get home from work sufficiently early in the evening to have their main meal.  This creates a demand for more elaborate canteen facilities in factories.</P>
    <P>I agree, of course, that a certain amount of centralisation is necessary in that, in regard to the provision of sanitary and water facilities, there can be greater efficiency in a reasonably concentrated area.  There is also the fact that, if industries are concentrated, one industry will beget another.  However, we must arrive at a balance between natural local pride in having an industry in one's town and the need to supply the necessary infrastructure for industry at minimum cost.  The suggested travelling distance of ten miles is reasonable and people should not have to travel further than that.  Many people in my constituency must travel a great deal further than ten miles to their work.  There are people in south Meath and north Kildare who travel daily to Dublin and in many cases must travel through the city to the suburbs.</P>
    <P>The amount of time they spend on the road to and from their work is greatly in excess of the generally considered maximum time and distance. In this context there is a definite need for a more concentrated effort to supply local industry in parts of County Meath and north Kildare more convenient to those people who at present have to travel long distances.  There is also the possibility of providing either through tax or some other method some form of subsidisation towards travelling expenses incurred by the people who have to travel long distances to work as they do at present as a result of industrial concentration in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas in County Meath to which I should particularly like to draw the Minister's attention in this regard.  One such place is Athboy in the western part of the constituency, which is a considerable distance from Dublin and whose population <Col N="692" /> cannot find sufficient employment in the centre provided at Navan. It is arguable that there should be some form of industrialisation in the area between Athboy and Clonmellon in County Westmeath.  We have likewise an area like Enfield which is in the middle of a small farming area. This is very important because Meath is the third greatest agricultural county in the country and many of the farmers in County Meath are small farmers whose farms do not come within the category of viable farms.  As a result, many of them have to leave farming and find work in the surrounding area.  In the areas where there is the greatest concentration of small farms there is likely to be the greatest need for alternative industrial employment.</P>
    <P>Enfield in south Meath is such an area.  There is a clear need to establish some industry in that area because of its considerable distance from Dublin.  One would also supply an industrial focus for an area of north Kildare as well as south Meath if one were to develop industry in Enfield. Kells is another place which suffers in this context.  It is about nine miles from the Cavan border.  As we all know, Cavan is a designated area.  It is an area where instead of receiving 45 per cent grants they receive 60 per cent grants.  This means that Kells is at a significant disadvantage as against places in Cavan with regard to attracting industries.  Industrialists thinking of setting up industries in that broad general area will choose elsewhere in Cavan rather than Kells. There is a need here to consider the possibility of extending the designated areas to cover those areas of north Meath which have at present a high concentration of non-viable farms, and a high concentration of people in need of employment&mdash;people who have similar problems to the people who are at present residing in the designated areas.  The fact that an industrialist has to go only a few miles up the road in order to find better grant facilities in Cavan and Monaghan has a severe disincentive effect as regards supplying necessary industry across a wide area of north County Meath.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> As a result of this places like Kells, as I mentioned already, Drumconrath and Nobber have all suffered in the matter of attracting industry because of the unbearable competition they receive from alternative sites with higher grant facilities in Monaghan and Cavan.  Another place with problems, to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, is that area of north Kildare which I represent as a Deputy in this House.  The big question here is the future of Bord na Móna. Will they be laying off workers over the next ten or 15 years and, if so, how many?  The industrial needs of this area depend on the answer to that question.  There is need for somewhat greater clarity in this regard so that the people and the Department of Industry and Commerce can prepare more effectively to supply more employment in this area if it is the case that people will as a result of the run down of the bogs become disemployed. There is no significant indication at the moment that this is happening to any great extent.  However, it is only natural to expect that those bogs will become run down.  I am concerned that we should be ready and prepared well in advance to supply alternative employment for the people in this area.  It is quite possible that existing employment in Bord na Móna in this area will survive in the foreseeable future.  We should have a little more clarity and a little more information in this regard so that our fears can either be laid at rest or remedial action can be taken.</P>
    <P>I have also some concern with the area around Navan.  We all know that Navan has in the past few years developed significantly in the industrial field.  There has been a substantial development of the furniture industry in this town but there are some grounds for disquiet that some of the smaller furniture factories there will find it difficult to face highly competitive conditions in the EEC.  I hope the Minister will encourage and assist the taking of any preparatory action which may be necessary to preserve the jobs of people employed in the furniture industry in Navan.  We should also in the general context of industrialisation in <Col N="694" /> Meath bear in mind, as I said earlier in my speech, that this is the third greatest agricultural county in the country and that we should consider the question of providing industries based on agriculture in this area.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any substantial industry in the county which is based on agriculture.  We should give this careful consideration.  It is a possibility which should be considered by the Minister in consultation with his colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to ensure that, when we enter the EEC and the new market for spring lamb opens up in the EEC, Meath should as a major sheep producing county be given some favourable consideration in regard to the siting of a spring lamb processing plant.  There is also a danger in a general context, and I would not say it was any more or any less applicable to Meath than to many other places.  It is the question which was set out in the report, <i>Challenge,</i> published by the Federation of Irish Industries, as it then was.  The suggestion was made that we should to some extent rely on craft industries.  I know they suggested a number of other things as well but there was a suggestion that in free trade conditions we would probably be better suited in the field of craft industries than in some other fields.  There is a danger of the limited market becoming flooded. There is a limited market at present for any type of craft work and this market can easily become flooded.  We should ensure that this does not happen and that people engaged in craft industries have an adequate market available to them.</P>
    <P>As regards the infrastructure in County Meath there are difficulties to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  These difficulties are generally in the fields of transport and communications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, but the Minister's work could be severely affected by unnecessary restrictions in these fields. <Col N="695" /> The roads on the Meath border leading into Dublin are not sufficiently good to attract industry to County Meath. Coming into Dublin one meets traffic jams on twisting roads.  Many people have to bring their produce along these roads to Dublin.  Bad roads discourage people.  On the road to Kildare there is a dual carriageway.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Chair's indulgence in this matter.  I wish to remind the Minister of the need to ensure that there is adequate industrial development in the western and northern portions of my constituency and, indeed, throughout County Meath. Some places in this region are distant from the focal point of current industrial development in Dublin.  There is a heavy concentration of small farms in the area.  A relatively high number of people leave agriculture to seek industrial employment.  There is a need for industry in the area in order to avoid journeys of 30 to 40 miles to employment in Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to consider the extension of the designated areas in order to include those portions of north County <Col N="696" /> Meath which have common problems with the designated areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment and wish him every success in his post. No doubt the Minister will prove to be as illustrious as his predecessors.</P>
      <P>I wish to express my strongest disapproval of trading stamps and their use.  There are a number of companies selling trading stamps to various retailers. This is a most unfair form of trading.  I understand that representations have been made to the Minister's Department and that the Department of Industry and Commerce are examining the whole question.  The public at large are being hoodwinked when stamps are given, with their purchases. A housewife may prefer to be given six trading stamps with ¼lb. of tea, rather than go to a shop where there is an offer of 2d or 3d off that particular brand of tea on a particular day.  The value of the half-dozen stamps which this unfortunate, misguided shopper receives is really less han ½d.  Roughly 1,600 of these stamps are equivalent to 10s.  A motorist may get 50 stamps with his petrol but he is really getting 3¼d discount on his £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this trading stamp business which I do not like. I do not wish to use very strong language but I feel it is a form of blackmail of those traders who refuse to use trading stamps.  A book of trading stamps costs a shopkeeper £5.  This is money spent in a non-productive way. Trading stamp companies are making money in an unfair way.  If something like the Christmas clubs were introduced for Easter or bank holiday weekends more discounts would be given directly to the customers.  The trading stamp companies do not help to lower the cost of living.  In fact, they add to the cost of living.  The Minister should seriously consider outlawing such companies. The arguments against trading stamps far outweigh the arguments in their favour.  The trading stamp companies argue that the so-called gifts are important in that they provide employment in industry but in fact similar goods are available and can be purchased in almost any store in Ireland. <Col N="697" /> I do not like to see people being misled.  Trading stamp companies are misleading the public into thinking that they are getting bigger discounts than they actually are.  I was talking to one retailer recently who told me that even when he took threepence off a packet of tea as a special offer the shop next door which was offering six trading stamps on a packet of tea was crowded with customers.  This might be good business for the trading stamp companies but it is dishonest.  We have all heard of the old tag &ldquo;Let the buyer beware&rdquo;.  Trading stamps are an unfair way of making money because they are taking the money from the people who can least afford it.  When the Minister is concluding I hope he will tell the House what his views are on trading stamps and if he proposes to take any action in the near future. It is time the Department of Industry and Commerce put its foot down in relation to the giving of trading stamps. I raise this point on this Estimate in order to stress how strongly I feel about it.  I hope the Minister will lose no time in making a decision about the giving of trading stamps.</P>

      <P>This Estimate affects the whole country but as a representative from Laois-Offaly I want to speak about that area.  At the end of my speech I shall say something about national policy but as the Minister has said that our proposed entry to the EEC will be debated at a future date I shall make very little comment on that now.</P>
      <P>The Government have paid scant attention to the development of Laois-Offaly; in fact, we have fallen behind the rest of the country.  Anyone looking at the overall picture would think Laois-Offaly was being actively discriminated against.  All the counties in Connaught are in designated areas, so also are Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Longford.  In 1966 legislation was passed for An Foras Tionscal to develop industrial estates in Galway and Waterford.  The industrial functions of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company were extended to include Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  If one looks at the country one sees the western seaboard on the one hand which comes within the area which is specially treated for industrial development. Waterford, Limerick and North Tipperary come in under the industrial estates and in the northern part of the country we have Cavan, Longford and Monaghan.  Dublin attracts a large <Col N="699" /> number of industries because of its natural potential as a capital city and because of the availability of markets and the counties in the hinterland namely, Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and Louth have benefited as a result.  The Ross Report, published by the Economic and Social Research Institute, deals with the personal incomes county by county in 1965.  The author of the report, Dr. Michael Ross, who is an officer in the institute, stated in his report that the record is such as to make one wonder if the efforts to develop the west have not led to a comparative neglect of the midlands and the Shannon has continued to be regarded as the dividing line even with the adjustments for Longford.  I want to pay tribute to a local Laois-Offaly paper which has highlighted this report. The <i>Leinster Express,</i> Portlaoise, made a good contribution as a local paper in pointing out adequately the facts outlined in the Ross Report.  The report showed the imbalance we suffer in Laois-Offaly.  Having dealt with other counties it says:</P>
      <P>Offaly is also a transition county and here will be considered in conjunction with Leix which, by 1965, should properly be regarded as one of the less prosperous groups.  In 1960, average personal income per head in Leix and Offaly was broadly similar and comparable to that of Westmeath and Wexford.  The growth in average personal income between 1960 and 1965 in both counties was very low.  Leix had the lowest rise in the State and Offaly was third from the bottom.</P>
      <P>I believe this is highly significant, that a county with reasonably good farming land like Laois, should be in such a position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offaly had experienced a very high rate of decline in agricultural employment and a very small increase in non-farming jobs.  Leix experienced a smaller rate of decline and a larger rate of increase.  Even so, in both counties the drop in numbers employed exceeded 4.7 per cent.  In Offaly this was accompanied <Col N="700" /> by a rise in total population: in Leix by a fall in population of over 1 per cent.  In both the population between 15 and 64 years of age fell&mdash;by over 2.5 per cent in Leix.</P>
    <P>This report brought out by the Industrial Research Institute is significant. It is a reliable paper of which we should take note and I request the Minister and the officials of his Department to take special note of it.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>Offaly is rather akin to Westmeath in being less dependent on agriculture for its income.  Leix derives about 10 per cent more of its income from this source in both years.  This difference may offer a partial explanation to the greater severity of the decline in Leix.  It would also appear to be due to the failure of these counties to attract their share of new employment. Once again this raises the question as to whether the designation of special areas for industrialisation has not worked to the disadvantage of the Leinster midlands generally.</P>
    <P>This excellent report deals specifically with actual incomes in different tables. In Table 9 it deals with income per head in 1965 and in Table 10 with income per head in 1960.  A few of the figures will help to show how incomes in these two counties have fallen behind.  While I welcome the increases secured all over the country, and I say that sincerely and I wish them well and hope their incomes will continue to increase, nevertheless we hope to see an increase in incomes for the people in Leix-Offaly also.  The income per head of population in Offaly in 1960 was £177 and in Leix £173.  In 1965 income per head in Offaly had risen only to £237 while income in Leix had risen to only £235.  Contrast this with Clare, which in 1966 was lower than Offaly at £166, and which increased to £246.  Kerry was also behind Offaly at £170 in 1960 and had gone up to £242.  This goes to show that people in Leix-Offaly have not had the employment to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>The situation at the time was so serious that Offaly County Council <Col N="701" /> passed a resolution which was sent to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Ross Report was published in November, 1969, and I believe it stimulated the council's concern. A report was circulated by Offaly County Council at the time headed &ldquo;Lack Of Employment Opportunities The Cause Of Emigration&rdquo;. This report pointed out that the county's population had fallen from 60,187 in 1901 to 51,717 in 1966.  The overall decline in population there has been greater than the national average. Net emigration between 1961 and 1966 has been estimated at 3,024 while in the same period the natural increase in population was 3,208.  Those who emigrate are generally between 15 and 30 years of age, and when emigration like this continues too few adults are left to support a relatively dependent age group: those under 15 and over 60. This is a situation that needs the attention of the Department of Industry and Commerce if it is to be counteracted. Prolonged emigration and the drop in incomes is basically due to the lack of a sufficiently large and varied occupation structure.  Not enough opportunity is available for people to provide themselves with suitable employment.  There are not adequate opportunities for industrialists to establish industries in these counties.</P>
    <P>A motion in connection with this report was passed by the county council in April and we were told that it would be considered by the Department but, to date, we have had no definite reply as to whether any special efforts will be made.</P>
    <P>At Clara at present about 600 people are on short time in a factory there. A Tullamore firm is also on short time and in the town of Birr a railway was closed a few years ago and a shoe factory was allowed to close.  The shoe factory made several efforts with different Government Departments to obtain grants but they were met with a deaf ear and got no financial support to enable them to continue in production. Many of my best friends and people I knew at that time are now employed in Britain and Canada. These people had been trained for a particular business and were skilled <Col N="702" /> operatives.  Their energy, intelligence and industry are lost to this country.</P>
    <P>In spite of this and in spite of the fact that we have not been getting the necessary encouragement, I am pleased to report that the people in these two counties have been making every effort to help themselves.  If we had not been able to help ourselves, then the figures I have quoted would be much worse.  Birr Urban Council have acquired an industrial site and the people of the town will service it and make it available for industry.  I am sure the people in Tullamore and Clara will also help themselves, failing Government aid.  There is a great obligation on the Government to help these two counties which are in the centre of the country.  They are the gateway to the south and the west and people travelling through the country can get an idea of the prosperity of the area.  They deserve further attention. If the people there are given the incentive then they will be able to change those figures and meet their commitments.  They can then play their part if and when this country joins the EEC.  It would also be relevant to mention another local paper, the <i>Midland Tribune,</i> which had a leading article about the notice of motion which was passed by Offaly County Council requesting that the county be appointed a designated area.  The heading of this article was: &ldquo;Offaly Makes a Request&rdquo;, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The immediate problem is that the county needs 1,000 new jobs for male personnel within the next five years.  This is a formidable task.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in which this paper is also very interested.  Perhaps it is because Offaly has such a natural asset that the Department of Industry and Commerce did not allow it in with the other counties which got preferential treatment.  I quote again from the <i>Midland Tribune:</i></P>
    <P>Granted that the spectacular and successful development of Offaly's bogs mitigated the county's problems, it must be remembered, as the County Secretary's report points out, that these are a wasting asset and their remaining usefulness will not stand one full generation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> On the economic side, perhaps, that is true and, if so, the need is all the greater for those two counties to get special attention.</P>
    <P>On the brighter side excellent employment is being provided in these two counties by a firm which utilises the turf in the area when it is cut away to a certain extent.  The product is made from the cutaway bogs, from the silt and the organic soil.  With different portions of the bogs being cut away, Bord na Móna have a vast asset at their disposal.  When the bog is cut away, if it is not cut down too low, the land is suitable for the development of horticultural products like peas, beans and carrots.  I am sure Bord na Móna will recognise the value of this asset.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to a firm here in Ireland, the Guinness firm. The people in this firm came under severe criticism.  I have no wish to attack the former Minister who made this criticism.  He has troubles enough of his own without my adding to them. However, the attack he made was unfair.  It was out of place and unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This firm are providing a great deal of employment in my constituency in the development of hotels, the boating industry and the canals.  The reference to the people of this firm as belted earls was unfair. They are providing excellent employment in my constituency.  There is over £1 million going into the development of the Shannon and the canal.  There is also great potential in the boat-building industry in that not alone public companies but the average person can participate.  At the moment it is only wealthy people who can make use of the canals and the rivers, but I can foresee a stage when small firms will be able to use their own boats.  I would hope that the Guinness firm would consider going into this industry.  If they come to Laois-Offaly they will receive full co-operation from everyone if they wish to develop this <Col N="704" /> industry.  If the boat industry is developed properly it can provide plenty of employment.</P>
      <P>Money being invested in hotels and tourism affects all of us: it helps the farmers, the shopkeepers, the small business people.  I hope, therefore, for continued development of this industry.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see the Minister back in the House and I hope he will give this project his full attention.  I emphasise, for his benefit, the prospect that the special grants available for industries in the counties of Laois and Offaly will attract industries to those areas.  Laois-Offaly is not regarded as a special area.  If one were looking around for an area in which to set up an industry and if other areas can get special exemptions, special allowances, special grants, if they can provide free premises, free fixed assets, interest free loans, one would be inclined to go to areas like that.  I therefore ask the Minister to give special attention to this situation and when he is replying I hope he will refer to it specifically.</P>
      <P>A number of protected industries may be affected by entry to the EEC and people may feel that there is not sufficient time between their establishment and our entry to the EEC to make them fully capable of withstanding the competition that will come with entry.  There was a specific case made for south Italy, however.  Special consideration was given to industries there to allow them to develop.  I believe Ireland can hope to get the same consideration. I believe our negotiators will seek and obtain special recognition for small protected industries here.  Because the Minister did not go into the matter of our entry to the EEC I will not go into it at present: I will defer comment on it until we have the special debate which we have been promised.</P>

      <P>Initially I should like to explain that I have a little difficulty in collecting my thoughts because I had not anticipated that the debate on the Estimate for my Department would conclude so speedily.  I should like at this stage to acknowledge the general good wishes that were extended to me <Col N="705" /> on introducing this, the first of many Estimates for my Department during the years I shall be Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Opening the debate for the Opposition, Deputy Donegan criticised my introductory speech from the point of view that I did not go into matters in greater detail.  He referred also to my deferring reference to the overall effects of our possible entry to the EEC.  In my introductory remarks I referred specifically to the fact that because a debate had been promised in relation to the White Paper, I did not think I should go into the matter at this stage.  In his concluding remarks Deputy Enright indicated he did not think it necessary to refer to the implications of EEC membership because he anticipated it would be fully dealt with during the debate on the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan indicated that, as the new incumbent in the Department, he thought I should give a broad outline of my plans and proposals.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has been so well managed and so capably looked after during the past 12 or 13 years by those who have been called my illustrious predecessors that I do not think a statement of broad new policy is called for or justified, particularly because of the tremendous amount of basic groundwork that has been done by my predecessors in those years.</P>
      <P>As usual, Deputy Donegan displayed his happy knack of praising us for one or two things we have done while at the same time taking full credit for having originally suggested the good ideas to us.  From my point of view, so long as it is in the national interest and for the overall good of the country in the matter of industrial development, it does not matter from whom the suggestion comes.  I am always willing and happy to accept constructive suggestions from any side of the House. Deputy Donegan must accept that if there is a good idea and if he feels he has a suggestion that would improve things, he already has an example&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will always accept a good suggestion and I have no objection to Deputy Donegan taking the credit.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy returned to the House I said I was taken by surprise because I had hoped there would be some more constructive ideas from the far side.  I am rather disappointed, possibly, that I have not had the benefit of some more voices from that side.  Deputy Donegan made a point in relation to his interpretation of some of my introductory remarks.  He referred to the investment of £66 million of capital and 28,000 jobs.  He referred to grant-aided industries established in the designated areas from 1952 to 1st March last.</P>
      <P>This, in fact, represents an average capital investment of £2,300 odd per job.  The average cost per job has risen quite steeply in recent years and is currently estimated at £5,000.  An increased number of capital intensive industries, greater selectivity in the promotion of desirable industries, plus the rising cost of fixed assets, are the main causes for this increase.  It should be mentioned, however, that the cost of providing a job varies very widely depending on the type of industry concerned, that is whether the industry is capital intensive or employment intensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan also made the point that my Department, in conjunction with the IDA, should consult with the Department of Local Government about regional developments and should decide where the roads and other infrastructural facilities should go as a means towards promoting local industry and development in selected localities.  In this regard let me say that, as far as the industrial estates are concerned, there is an infrastructural committee for each of the estates in Waterford and Galway.  The committees consist of representatives of the IDA, the National Building Agency, the Department of Local Government and the local authority.  Each committee is <Col N="707" /> concerned with all the infrastructural requirements for the various facilities on those industrial estates.  Apart from that, a steering committee which is representative of the IDA, the Department of Labour and the Department of Local Government, has been set up to co-ordinate industrial development planning for the country as a whole. The infrastructural requirements for new industries in any part of the country are considered by this steering committee.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that there were so few contributions to this debate I was particularly struck by the contributions made by Deputy Donegan, on the one hand, and by Deputy Bruton, on the other hand.  Deputy Donegan criticised the present policy of the IDA in relation to the non-granting of grant aid to a cabinet maker somewhere near the Border.  He mentioned that this man was quite well known and was quite efficient in the production of church furniture and that his firm had quite an export potential.  He said that it was wrong that the IDA were not allocating grants to cabinet making as such and to suggest that the trade was so much overdone that this man&mdash;whom I do not know&mdash;should not have qualified for a grant.  Deputy Donegan was here this evening to listen to Deputy Bruton making the contra-case.  He was worried about the furniture industry in Navan and he said that some protection should be given to the small cabinet makers in the Navan area.  This in its own way indicates that the pressures are such that the IDA would be leaving themselves very much open to criticism from that type of industrialist if they appeared to be encouraging further production from, if you like, a neighbour up the road.  This, as I see it, is one of the biggest problems that have to be tackled by the IDA in circumstances such as this.  Here we have the type of situation in which they can be left wide open to criticsm for using the taxpayers' money further to grant aid to one firm and put another firm, which has got off the ground without such State assistance, out of business. It is hardly necessary for me to reply to Deputy Donegan's observations in <Col N="708" /> that regard because, I suggest quite seriously, Deputy Bruton has replied to him on my behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan also raised the question, which is a logical one at this stage and one which will come up for discussion more in relation to our White Paper, of whether industrial grants and tax reliefs can continue when we are in the EEC.  There is no doubt that our facilities for industrial grants will come under review by the Commission which will be required to establish the extent to which our grant system is compatible with the provisions of the Rome Treaty.  State aids which distort or threaten to distort competition are, to the extent to which they adversely affect trade between member countries, deemed to be incompatible with the Common Market idea.  As indicated in the White Paper we would certainly argue, having regard to the purpose of grants for industrial development here and the circumstances of our economy, that they are in keeping with the objectives of the Treaty.  There is no doubt that the Rome Treaty prohibits the granting of export profits tax reliefs in respect of exports to other member States except to the extent that they have been previously approved by the Council on a proposal from the Commission.  There is no doubt that our system of tax reliefs will also come up for consideration but in view of the importance of these reliefs in promoting industrial development let me say <Col N="709" /> that I would hope it would be possible to secure the Council's agreement to the retention of these measures. This is a matter which we can go into more deeply in the discussion of the White Paper but since the matter was raised I wanted to express my personal views on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary said that the IDA should more widely use the power which they have to appoint members to the boards of grant-aided industries and that the State must go into partnership in industry and have a greater say in the policy of these new concerns.  This power, of course, was taken under the most recent Act but it is not the policy of the IDA to interfere in the day-to-day affairs of grant-aided industrial concerns.  It is considered preferable that they should make their own policy decisions and in any case the industrialist has a far greater investment in the particular project than has the authority.</P>
      <P>The IDA encounter very keen competition from other countries that are also prepared to grant equity participation in industry and it is only in the major projects that the IDA are interested in acquiring equity participation. Speaking in the Dáil in the debate on the IDA Bill, 1969, regarding the power proposed for the authority to take shares in industry, my predecessor said:</P>
      <P>It arises because particularly in the case of larger industrial undertakings where very substantial grants were given it seems to me that many of these cases are very sound commercial propositions which are clearly going to make a good deal of money.  If it is possible for us to arrange it in this way, we ought to try to ensure that the State will get back some of its investment and this is a good way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases the promoters would not be prepared to agree to it but there are some cases in which they would be prepared to agree to it.  Again, it would form another aspect of providing a package deal. The principal reason behind it is to enable us, in cases which are deemed to be suitable, to recover some of <Col N="710" /> the State's money that is invested in projects.</P>
    <P>The enabling legislation for the IDA to use this power was provided in order to protect the State investment to the greatest extent possible but, at the same time, it will be used as sparingly as possible in an endeavour to ensure the very minimum interference in the day-to-day affairs of grant-aided industries.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Donegan and Deputy Michael O'Leary referred to the Committee on Industrial Progress and Deputy Donegan suggested that there should be more extended market appraisal than we have had to date. Deputy O'Leary referred to the various surveys being carried out at present and mentioned in particular the report on women's outer wear industry.  The Committee on Industrial Progress is doing valuable work.  I expect within the next week a further report from them on the processing of fruit and vegetables and in the next few months three further reports&mdash;one on hosiery and knitwear, one on the metal trades and one dealing with paper, paper products and printing.</P>
    <P>It is essential that both management and workers should take an interest in the reports that are issued and with that in mind I arranged a press conference in relation to the issue of the report on women's outer wear industry in order that the maximum publicity should be given to this matter.  The fullest use should be made of the observations contained in the reports and I am indebted to the committee for the work they have undertaken in their compilation.  I strongly recommend that all those involved in the industries concerned should study the recommendations very carefully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael O'Leary drew attention to the questionnaires sent to firms. I saw for myself that a number of firms did not reply to the questionnaires sent to them and I took note of the fact that some of these firms were from the city and some from the country. My immediate reaction to the people who had not taken time to reply to the questionnaires was that they were not sufficiently interested but they are the very people whose industry might well <Col N="711" /> fail because of this lack of interest. Many of the firms concerned were quite small businesses.  Perhaps there is a feeling among small firms that the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have means of collecting information which is supplied in reply to various questionnaires.  In relation to the work being done by the Committee on Industrial Progress and to the further inquiries they will be making from a number of industries, it might be no harm for me to say here that it was spelled out that the information was confidential as far as the firm itself was concerned.  I want to spell out quite clearly, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that all information supplied by the management or proprietors of those firms is dealt with, and will continue to be dealt with, in a most confidential way and is only used in the preparation and the assimilation of information that goes into the preparation of those reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>But the real point I was referring to was those firms which had, in fact, received grants and had not in return filled in any questionnaires. Their case really needs looking into.  There may be other firms which have not answered questionnaires but the real point is those firms which have received cash and refused to answer questionnaires subsequently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  I share the Deputy's view that it is not good enough and I would be inclined to look into it though, as against that, let me be quite frank and say that when a firm gets a grant, except that from the point of view of principle, one would feel it was the right thing to do, I do not think that I should <Col N="712" /> arrange that they should be legally bound to complete every form which we send out to them.  I take a poor view of their not filling the form. Let me put it that way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just learned as a result of inquiries which I made subsequent to the Deputy's remarks that some firms which did not complete questionnaires did, in fact, subsequently co-operate otherwise in the survey.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan referred to what he described as an industry of which a large percentage was involved in his own constituency&mdash;the boot and shoe industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>One half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he said 50 per cent of the boot and shoe industry is concentrated in County Louth.  He drew attention to the impending withdrawal of the quota restriction and he expressed worry about this and the fact that the consequential duty would be insufficient to deter any influx of foreign produced shoes.  I appreciate the Deputy's point of view but I feel that his statement was an emotional one and not quite supported by the facts.  While the footwear manufacturers have expressed some unease about the situation with which they will be faced after the 1st July there is no positive reason to believe that the position will in any way be as catastrophic as suggested by the Deputy.  There has, in fact, been a body of opinion among the manufacturers in favour of the removal of the quota.  This decision to remove the quota will eliminate the duty free importation of 185,000 pairs of shoes.  The quota imports themselves tended to be almost entirely in higher quality shoes and the manufacturers will now have a far better opportunity of competing with this type of shoe, a fact which is looked upon as being beneficial to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> I have gathered, since taking up the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce, that one of the things that are proving a problem to the shoe trade is the importation of plastic shoes and they were freed from quota restrictions some years ago.  The manufacture and sale of plastic shoes has increased considerably.  There has been an increase since last year of 400 per cent. Admittedly, it started from a low mark. There was little or no plastic production recorded in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We export far more Irish footwear than we import foreign footwear. I found myself recently, arising from a statement I made down the country, being quoted on a Sunday newspaper as calling on our people to buy Irish in preference to foreign goods.  I have used every occasion on which I have spoken to exhort the people to buy quality Irish produce.  In press reports normally there are words excluded and I found myself getting a letter from a prominent Irish exporter complaining about my anxiety to see the Irish people buying quality Irish.  In fairness to him I was quoted as just saying to buy Irish.  I was attacked in writing by this gentleman who claimed that if Ministers in other countries adopted the attitude I was <Col N="714" /> adopting the various exporters in this country would, of necessity, go out of business and we would have difficulty in balancing our trade.  I am afraid I cannot accept this.  I cannot see my way to apologise to anybody for asking our people to buy quality Irish goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, I cannot see myself being justified in asking or expecting our people to buy an Irish product which is the same price as some foreign produce that may be available to them in a shop.  I do not think there is even the necessity for this because I feel our manufacturers and our workers are capable of turning out products which are equal to their counterparts imported from the other side.</P>
      <P>I have no intention whatsoever of apologising to anyone for asking him or her to provide quality Irish goods. We have a duty and a responsibility to do so.  I would appeal to those in the distributive trade to refrain from tendering the kind of advice some of them offer customers: &ldquo;We have these shirts.  They are Irish, but we will have good ones in next week&rdquo;.  I have had experience of this kind of thing myself and I want to use my platform here now to condemn this practice. I appeal to all engaged in the distributive trade to be more mindful of their colleagues in employment.  We are facing a very competitive time.</P>
      <P>To come back to footwear, Deputy Donegan quoted a case of shoes imported at 18s or 19s a pair and sold at 85s a pair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The total import amounts to 185,000 pairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Leather or plastic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Leather.  Having made inquiries, I discovered that in the majority of cases a superior type of shoe is imported.  If I were an importer with a limited licence for, say, 30,000 pairs, they would have a sort <Col N="715" /> of snob value because of their scarcity. If I imported them at 25s a pair I could put them in my window at 90s a pair in the knowledge that no other footwear of the same kind would come in for another 12 months.  That would be good business, if you like, and the temptation would be to shove the Irish shoe on to the back shelf. There is that problem.  There is the problem of weaning people off foreign shoes.  It is a little frustrating to have to talk of weaning people off foreign shoes.  For some reason or other there are those amongst us who do not seem to have the proper national approach. That may sound like a cliché, but I do not know in what other way to put it.  Most people, when asked, will not admit to the purchase of a foreign article in preference to an Irish article. But it happens.  I have had experience of asking if a particular article was Irish manufacture and the attendant in the store looking at me as if to ask what sort of &ldquo;quare fella&rdquo; I was. That has been my experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunately the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not good enough. There is need for our consumers to be mindful of their national responsibility to purchase quality Irish goods.  That cannot be said too often.  I hope that everybody will play his or her part in conveying this message to the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy Donegan and Deputy O'Donnell referred to the scrap steel situation.  I have not had an opportunity of examining this.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to a price list.  I understand that the bigger the bulk of scrap Irish Steel Holdings can procure the more economic it is from their point of view.  However, there does seem to be a pretty big gap in the prices.  I shall look into this, but I understand there is a good deal of justification for it from the point of view of the economic working of Irish Steel Holdings.  Bulk buying is a better proposition than the purchase of small lots.  However, as I said, I shall examine this to satisfy myself that the procedure is a proper procedure.  I shall <Col N="716" /> communicate with both Deputies giving them my views on the matter after I have examined it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually I did not raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My information was that Deputy Donegan made reference to this but perhaps it was Deputy O'Donnell.  In that case, I shall communicate with Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>If my reply to the House is not as comprehensive as I would have wished, it is because I had been expecting a longer debate on the Estimate and I had proposed making some further inquiries.  However, I was deprived of the opportunity of so doing by reason of the reluctance of Deputies to criticise or praise me as the case might be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to what he described as the menace of stamp trading and he asked if steps could be taken to have this practice discontinued. I am aware that invitations were issued to the public to offer comment on stamp trading but replies were received from only 49 parties.  All of those replies are at present being considered.  In addition to this, arrangements have been made for collecting information on the experience of other countries with a view to having such information considered also.  I am hoping to take a decision on this matter reasonably shortly.  I hold some views in regard to stamp trading and I am not entirely happy with the practice as such.  However, I should like to have all available information before making a decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a matter today that interested me.  He also raised this matter during the debate on the IDA Bill.  I refer to his pronounced interest in the small industries division of the IDA.  He asked if it would be possible to make arrangements whereby a unit could be created within CTT which would have special responsibility for marketing the products of small industries who are not geared to marketing&mdash;a division which, he said, would have special reference to exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that CTT and the IDA have been already considering this.  It is a matter that attracts my attention <Col N="717" /> further because there is no doubt that the problem of the small craft industrialist is that, having produced goods, he is unable to find a market for them. CTT have been active in this regard but perhaps the Deputy's idea is one that should be followed up.  I assure Deputy O'Donnell that I shall be looking into this matter because the greatest deterrent to the small man is, that having produced goods, he finds difficulty in having them marketed.  The setting up of some type of State agency who would have available to them the good offices and expertise of Córas Tráchtála is worth considering.</P>
    <P>Deputy John O'Leary showed an interest in the development of industries in small towns, as he said, with a population of 1,000 or less.  This is very much to be encouraged and we are endeavouring to encourage it.  I would join with him in recommending that local development associations, some of which are extremely active in endeavouring to attract industry to their areas, should endeavour to aim at acquiring small sites in an effort to attract industries.  On the whole, local development associations, while some of them have been active in criticising the IDA and the Department of Industry and Commerce for failure to get industries in their area, have had a good deal of success in their active pursuit of industries.  In many cases this success has been obtained as a result of their perseverance during the years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went further and recommended that development associations should try to provide factory premises, and he became enthusiastic in suggesting that perhaps the IDA or the Minister might help by way of grants. Invariably a grant is eventually paid; but grant aiding the provision of premises by a local development association without having anything to go into the premises, might lead to the creation of &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo; and in fact, act as a deterrent to further industrial development.  However, I do not think we have too many &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo;.  There is a grant but it is only payable when the industry has got off the ground and is not paid in anticipation of an industry.  There is <Col N="718" /> an arrangement whereby the IDA have power to do this themselves and there is also provision under the 1969 Act. That is as far as it is advisable to go at this stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Michael O'Leary in paying a tribute to the various county development teams for the amount of preparatory and survey work they have done.  I hope the graph of industrial progress in the State will continue to rise.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Enright, my colleague in my constituency, called for the designation of the two counties of Laois and Offaly.  I was out of the House when he was speaking and I did not hear the points he made, but with the knowledge I have of that area I did not need to be present to hear Deputy Enright justifying the case in this regard.  This matter has been under active consideration for some time.  The designation of new areas presents serious difficulties.  It is agreed, however, that the counties of Laois and Offaly have a very good case for special consideration.  The matter is being looked into and I expect a decision will be made on this shortly. Deputy Bruton mentioned one factor in that regard.  He was speaking as a fringe Deputy&mdash;and I do not mean that in any derogatory way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>The Deputy mentioned that in his constituency, extending into north Kildare, a certain amount of employment was given by Bord na Móna.  Considerable employment has been given by Bord na Móna down the years in County Offaly.  As Deputy Bruton said, there is no reason for thinking that reasonable employment will not continue to be given by Bord na Móna in the immediate future, but looking at things from the long term point of view, say, over a 20 year period, it appears the time has come to begin looking at the possibility of alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that this is not the specific responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It comes within the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power, but the employment <Col N="719" /> given by Bord na Móna and the consequential loss of employment if Bord na Móna began going slow for one reason or another is something which would certainly interest the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I know that Bord na Móna, in conjunction with An Foras Talúntais, have been having a look at the prospects of the bogs for some time.  This, of course, is a factor affecting the maintenance or extension of employment in that area.  I want to assure my colleague, Deputy Enright, that I am concerned about the lack of industrial progress in the Laois-Offaly area.  I hope to be able to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the House for the way they dealt with the Estimate.  I hope, as I said at the outset, that during my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce I may find it possible to continue the tremendous progress made by my predecessors in this Department.</P>

      <P>Before I ask a question, I should like to say that we on this side of the House should like to thank the Minister for the very courteous way in which he replied to the Estimate.  As he is a courteous man, we should like to express that to him. The Minister referred to 185,000 pairs of leather shoes being imported on quota no longer being so imported.  He referred to my statement about shoes being imported at 18s 6d.  The shoes I referred to were, of course, the plastic or non-leather shoes.  About 150,000 of them were imported at this sort of price and sold in Grafton Street at something like 79s 6d, as I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to tell me what he thinks of this situation. Almost 2,000,000 pairs of shoes sold in Ireland, apart from the 180,000 and the 150,000 referred to, are supplied by the Irish shoe manufacturers.  These will now be subject to full competition, when the British manufacturers have paid the tariff of 22½ per cent.  Does the Minister not feel that the real crunch is not on the 150,000, not on the 180,000, but on the entire home market itself and that the difficulty <Col N="720" /> now is not the attack on the export market but the short-term defence of the home market which provides the bulk of the business that employs all our shoe operatives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Our export of shoes in the main is to the UK and our manufacturers are able to sell our shoes in Britain against the shoes produced over there on level terms.  If that is so I do not see any reason why our manufacturers here, protected by a 22½ per cent duty, cannot compete successfully with imported shoes on the home market provided our own people have the right mentality and can match shoe with shoe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that, if a girl is offered ten pairs of shoes, of which seven are British and three Irish, the probability is that she will not buy Irish but simply choose the one she likes best?  Therefore, there would be seven chances for the British shoes and three for the Irish on the basis of 70 per cent of the shoes for here being produced by the home market and 30 per cent being exported.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said ten pairs of shoes&mdash;seven foreign and three Irish.  On the basis that 70 per cent would be the home produced shoes and 30 per cent imported shoes, is it not logical to assume that we have seven pairs of Irish as against three pair of British shoes?</P>

      <P>I do not deny I am worried to a certain extent.  It is something I will watch with a view to seeing what steps to take if the situation is such that it interferes with the home market. As I said recently to somebody in relation to a similar matter: &ldquo;If it is not going right come back and we will see what remedial steps we can take&rdquo;. The man's reply to me was: &ldquo;That is the same as giving me a kick in the teeth and asking me does it hurt.  Do you not know it will hurt?&rdquo; A number of manufacturers resisted this two-year quota extension.  There was a certain amount of pressure from the point of view of trading to try to arrange for a further extension.  The majority of the manufacturers are now in favour of doing away with the quota restriction and arranging it as it will be after 1st July.  As of now I have confidence that the shoe trade will stand up to this particular challenge.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (d), lines 34 and 35, to delete &ldquo;(if requested by them)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My object in seeking this amendment is to emphasise to the Minister that there must be consultation with these organisations and that they should not have the choice as to whether there will be consultation or not.  As it stands at the moment I read it that the organisations can request consultation and they will have to be listened to.  In view of the fact that this deals with the choice of competitions and the composition of teams, the Minister should have power to insist that he shall be heard and that what he says shall be listened to.  As it stands the Minister can consult with the organisations about competitions or the composition of teams only if requested to do so by the organisations.  The Minister should be in a position to have the consultations without first being requested to have them.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point on this.  I think that it would be unwarrantable interference with the right of the various horse organisations to pursue their own objectives without obligatory reference to the Minister or to Bord na gCapall.  Deputy Cooney's amendment could readily lead to a situation where the existing horse organisations would be thrust into a sort of secondary position.  This might adversely affect the position of the board.  They might have the role of big brother thrust upon them in the bad sense of &ldquo;big brother&rdquo;.  I appreciate Deputy Cooney's point but I think it is outweighed by the necessity there is to maintain the present position of the existing horse organisations and not to thrust upon them the necessity to refer to the board at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister.  Everybody in this country wants the best possible team to represent us abroad.  Twenty-five to 30 years ago Commandant O'Dwyer, Commandant Corry and others brought international fame to Irish horses and riders.  When one picked up the paper the next morning the tricolour was flying for Ireland and her horses.  We all admit that there has been a decline in the standard of our team during the last 15 years.  I do not think those organisations would resent the State interfering.  I do not look upon it as interference.  I look upon it as co-operation with and consultation between the State and these organisations. I agree with Deputy Cooney that the board should consult and advise those organisations so that the best team, whether it be from members of the Army or members of the general public, can be picked to represent the country.  I cannot imagine those organisations looking upon it as the big brother trying to put something down their necks.  Those words should be deleted and the organisations should be consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with nearly all that Deputy L'Estrange has said. The whole purpose of this Bill is to get a better international team and a better horse industry.  Deputy L'Estrange spoke about the necessity for mutual help and co-operation in this regard but we ought not start off by telling existing organisations that they must consult with the board.  Rather should we say to them that Bord na gCapall is here for the purpose of helping them and would be very pleased if they would avail of this help.  When this idea is accepted and understood it will be far better at that stage to insert the amendment proposed by Deputy Cooney to this particular section.  The amendment introduces a rather harsh note of compulsion which I feel is totally unnecessary.  In fact, I would go so far as to say it would damage the Bill.  At the end of it all Bord na gCapall cannot help these organisations unless they ask for help.  These organisations cannot have help thrust upon them and if such a situation obtained it would have a damaging <Col N="726" /> effect.  It is not terribly serious but I think the Bill is better the way it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the danger to which the Minister has referred.  We are really discussing this as if the onus to consult is on the equestrian bodies but the onus to consult is, in fact, on Bord na gCapall.  When we realise the onus is that way the exercise of that onus without the necessity for a request for its exercise will adversely affect relations between the board and the various equestrian bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people we are requiring to do something is the board itself not the equestrian bodies. All we are saying is that the functions of the board are to consult with the relative equestrian organisations as the Bill at present says &ldquo;if requested by them&rdquo;.  If those words are left in the Bill, the board might never be able to consult with, for example, the Irish Olympic Horse Society, the Irish Show Jumping Association or the Master of Foxhounds Association.  If the request for consultation does not come the board is out as far as that particular equestrian organisation is concerned. I should like to see the board <Col N="727" /> with the power to go to these various equestrian organisations and consult with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If we stipulate that consultation should be from the board to the equestrian organisation in that one direction does the Deputy not think that this one direction consultation will naturally invoke consultation in the other direction as well?  I still think the Bill, as drafted, is better.  My note here says that if the board are unqualifiedly to be obliged to consult with the equestrian organisations the latter would have to be obliged to consult with the board and this would be quite inappropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill is drafted there is no obligation on the Minister to appoint a person from any of the organisations referred to.  The report of the survey team recommended that Bord na gCapall should have representatives on it from different bodies; in fact, some of them were specified but, as the Bill is drafted, the Minister is entirely free to nominate from the bodies or take nominations or appoint people from outside the bodies.  If, as the survey team recommended, some nominations at any rate should be taken from these bodies the selection would have been left to the Minister and this might have involved automatic contact.  I do not know if the Minister at this stage feels in a position to indicate whether it is proposed to draw membership from some of these bodies or not?</P>

We all know the best teams were not always selected due to snobbishness and class distinction.  In fact, <Col N="728" /> Tommy Wade was unfortunately passed over.  If someone wants to pass over the Army team in future the board will have no power to do anything about it, whereas all we are asking for is consultation. As far as co-operation between this board and the Department is concerned it all depends on the formation of the board and the people put on the board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see some difficulty in regard to the functions of the board <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Racing Board which does not come under the aegis of the Minister.  Nevertheless, I think this matter must be tackled at this stage as otherwise we shall be in the daft position of Bord na gCapall having very extensive functions in regard to the horse industry and not having its relationship with another very important board adequately defined.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (1) (a) (i) states as one of the functions of the board to advise the Minister &ldquo;in relation to the breeding, sale and export of horses and associated activities&rdquo;.  I think there cannot be any argument about the racing of horses being very much an associated activity and the body that controls the racing of horses is, willy-nilly, brought into contact with the functions of Bord na gCapall.  The present exercise by that other board of its functions in regard to the racecourses which it has threatened with extinction leaves a lot to be desired. Whether this board will be able to say to the Racing Bord: &ldquo;You cannot withdraw the subsidy from Kilbeggan because we, Bord na gCapall, think Kilbeggan racecourse deserves to be maintained as a racecourse&rdquo; is the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will Bord na gCapall have authority to say that, bearing in mind that Bord na gCapall will know that Kilbeggan racecourse has a long and honourable history and is a racecourse which is on the way up having been in a difficult financial position?  By means of voluntary work it has put <Col N="731" /> itself on a sound financial footing.  It has improved its track immensely and it attracted over 200 runners at its last meeting.  Ostensibly, according to the Racing Board, the reason for threatening the withdrawal of subsidy is that it was costing money but the Kilbeggan executive have not been able to find out from the Racing Board how much, if any, Kilbeggan course is costing. The other courses under sentence of death may be those that are costing the money.  Kilbeggan does not think it is costing money because the number of bookmakers betting and paying levy and the tote turnover have been on the increase to a considerable extent.</P>

      <P>Section 7 (a) (1) relates to the sale and export of horses and paragraph (h) relates to the organisation of sales of horses other than thoroughbred horses.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of what has happened in the past.  The people who buy horses for international jumping do not seem to have the necessary <Col N="733" /> finance to purchase the best horses to compete for Ireland.  The horses are bred and trained here but when they come up for sale they are bought by the Italians, the Germans, the English or the Americans, who come back and defeat our team.  Is it the intention of the Minister to set up a body like Bord na gCon, who buy dogs?  If it is, I certainly do not want to see the scandal and the corruption we have in Ireland today in regard to the purchase of greyhounds where there is at least one southern buyer of greyhounds and also members of Bord na gCon who will not buy dogs unless they receive £50 or £100 as a &ldquo;backhand&rdquo;. We should not stand for that kind of corruption.  If the Minister is appointing a board I hope they will be men or women of honesty and integrity.  I know of a greyhound purchased for £600 by a well-known member of Bord na gCon and sold for £1,000. Nobody in this House should stand for this type of racket.</P>
      <P>I hope that when this board is set up horses bought either for the Irish Army or for resale to America, England, France or anywhere else will be bought by public auction or, if not, that the purchaser will have to sign a form indicating from whom he purchased the horse, the genuine price for which it was bought and what he got for it when it was exported.  This is a very important industry and it would be a sin if racketeers and chancers were allowed to grow fat on the hard work of honest-to-goodness farmers who breed horses.  It is also unfair that buyers whether they are British or any other nationality should be fleeced.  I have no objection if the breeder gets the money but I certainly object to a man buying a greyhound for £600 and selling it for £1,000 in the circumstances I have outlined.  I want the Minister to get men of integrity.  Unfortunately in this materialistic age they seem to be in short supply.  However, the Minister should ensure that anyone who engages in this malpractice will be lodged in Mountjoy, because that is where some of those who are buying greyhounds for export should be.</P>

He is assuming, before the board is established at all, that it will draw its personnel from racketeers, chancers, <i>et cetera.</i> When we are asking a group of men to come together without remuneration to assist the horse industry as it requires to be assisted, it is most unfortunate that they should be branded, before they are named at all, as racketeers.</P>

      <P>Section 7 (1) (d) gives the board power to assist teams or members thereof in the following ways: by the provision of money to meet, in whole or in part, the costs of entering and taking part in competitions&mdash;at home or abroad presumably&mdash;or the provision of horses for use by the teams or members, as the case may be, in competitions.  One can see a situation where the board would make a subvention to a team going abroad.  That team could be very successful, and a very successful team, in terms of modern day prize money for show jumping, could win a lot of money. In any case where there is a subvention from Bord na gCapall, there should be some recoupment to the board out of prize money won in those circumstances.  It might be difficult to arrange in practice, but I think it would be only proper.  Furthermore, very often following a good performance a horse can be sold at a very <Col N="735" /> high price.  It might be going too far to expect commission on the sale for Bord na gCapall, but I should not like to see Bord na gCapall subsidising teams to go abroad and these teams then making considerable private profit. There should be some arrangement for recoupment.  The people engaged in the horse industry are not the most naive section of the community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 17, after &ldquo;Board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who shall be Irish citizens&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is to ensure that the members of the board will all be Irish citizens.  I move it without any apology to those who might suggest that I am being provincial.  I have no doubt that in the organisations associated with the horse industry there are ample and adequate people to make up the membership of the board. The horse industry is so important to the economy of the country that it is most desirable it should be controlled by Irish citizens.  I think the Minister will agree it is necessary that only Irish citizens should be in control and will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, it is quite true that normally the people of this country have above average competence in the matter of horses and that the likelihood of people who are not Irish citizens becoming members on the board is rather slight.  The amendment is somewhat inhibiting in that one can conceive that a person with exceptional qualifications in the matter of horses might not be an Irish citizen but the board might like to use his ability and expertise.  I think, <Col N="740" /> therefore, that it would be an unnecessary provision deliberately to exclude such a person.</P>
      <P>Everybody's inclination would be to have Irish citizens on the board whereever possible but I do not think we should slam the door totally on such a person as I have been talking about, a person with exceptional competence in the matter of horses who would be of real value to the Irish horse industry. The proposed amendment would exclude such a person.  I do not know if Deputy Cooney has any particular anxiety in this matter.  I think he will agree it is conceivable that people who are not Irish citizens but who have great competence in the matter of horses have established themselves here but have not become Irish citizens.  I do not think they should be excluded by the Act itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular reason beyond that of principle.  This will be the superior body for a very Irish industry and the body should be composed entirely of Irish citizens.  If any person with the expertise to which the Minister refers should come along and there is a wish to avail of his services there is ample provision in the section for setting up committees. That person might serve much more adequately and more aptly on a committee than as a member of the over-all governing body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that it might be interpreted like that but for this industry it would be unduly sensitive to interpret it like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that but the acceptance of this amendment will impose an inhibition &mdash;it would be slight but it would be there&mdash;and it would be restricting the choice, and forever, without real cause.  Any Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would be just as enthusiastic as Deputy Cooney is to see that wherever possible, first of all, that the best people would go on the board and, secondly, that if possible they would be Irish citizens.  There is <Col N="741" /> nothing wonderful about this; this is perfectly natural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister accepts my amendment it might relieve the Minister of a possibly embarrassing situation.  Naturally, the Minister would consult with the various equestrian organisations before appointing the board to see who they might have in mind and it could happen that a name suggested might happen to be that of a non-Irish citizen who would be very acceptable to the equestrian body concerned but not to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the fellow who will do the deciding. The Minister can and will consult with the competent people about the constitution of the board but the choice eventually will be for himself.  It is for him to determine whether it would be desirable to have a non-national on the board or not.  Generally speaking, and all other things being equal, it would be better to have an all-Irish board and that is probably what we will have.  Non-nationals should not deliberately be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could see more validity for the Minister's argument if this board were going to deal with the thoroughbred industry which is much more international than what will be dealt with by the Horse Board. Then you could hardly avoid having non-nationals but when their main function is confined to the non-thoroughbred industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, I think you will agree with me that international show-jumping is becoming much more international.  There is a greater mobility in the people who participate in it.  You may have at some time in the future, because of the increasing mobility of these people between Britain and here and the Continent and here, the possibility of very special horse people deciding to establish themselves here, people who would have very special qualifications, and I do not think we should shut the door on them.  We should just watch the door and examine very carefully to see if, in fact, they have the qualifications looked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave has already stated, the survey team recommend that the organisation be allowed appoint members to the board but subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Before appointing a member of the Board, the Minister shall consult with such organisations (if any) as he thinks appropriate in relation to the appointment.</P>
      <P>This very important board will have a very onerous job to do.  The Minister stated that only men with outstanding qualifications could hope to be on the board.  We have voluntary organisations associated with horse breeding who have done very valuable work over the years and the time has come when we should trust those voluntary organisations.  I can think of many offhand and the Minister if he is appointing 11 members should allow at least six members to be appointed by those organisations.  We have national farmers organisations who represent the majority of farmers who breed horses; we have the different breeders organisations, the different stallion organisations, the different show pony societies, the different show-jumping societies throughout the country on the committees of which there are small farmers, business people, townspeople who do very valuable work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but they can come together as has often happened in the past.  There is no reason why the Minister should not ask all the show-jumping societies to come together and nominate a person; there is no reason why all the breeders could not be asked to come together and nominate somebody, or the NFA, or all those training jumping teams. As I said earlier, the Minister and his Department will be judged by the type of board set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>People on it should be selected for their knowledge of and their work on behalf of the horsebreeding industry.  They should be men of integrity <i>et cetera.</i> Let us admit that in the past such positions have been havens of rest for ex-Fianna Fáil Deputies and supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In reply to a question which I tabled last week I learned that on the board of Irish Shipping we have Deputy Blaney's aide-de-camp who is drawing £500 a year.  We remember Deputy Corry in this House.  We know what happened when a letter was read out in this House and we know the corrupt practices he had indulged in. Afterwards he was appointed a director of the beet board.  That is scandalous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a new man coming to this important position of Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and I hope he starts on the right foot.  His predecessor set up a National Agricultural Council but he did not take the advice he was given; he put his own stooges on the council and refused to co-operate with the voluntary organisations and afterwards the council proved to be a failure and it is now dead.  This is of such vital importance that it behoves the Minister to start on the right road.  It is not enough to consult with those people. Even at this late stage the Minister should have faith in those organisations which have done such valuable work down through the years.  Many of those people in those organisations love horses.  They are dedicated to the horse breeding industry, let it be breeding horses, show-jumping or hunting, or whatever it may.  They have done <Col N="744" /> valuable work and we should recognise that and at least say to those people &ldquo;I will allow you to appoint six, or, perhaps, seven or eight members&rdquo; and the Minister could appoint the remainder.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the full co-operation of everybody on this side of the House.  We are all interested in the horse breeding industry and we know how desirable it is that it should prosper. It needs help and advice but much depends on the board the Minister will set up.  Instead of saying that he will consult with the organisations, the Minister should ask them to nominate six, seven or eight people and appoint three or four people himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The object of this Bill is to establish a board to be known as Board na gCapall which will discharge important functions in relation to one of our major industries.  The horse breeding industry is a major industry from the point of view of the money it produces for the breeders of thoroughbred and other horses and it is important because it is one of the shop windows of this country, it is one of our prestige industries.</P>
      <P>I welcome the idea behind the Bill. I had occasion during a debate on the Department of Defence some time ago to say that I thought not nearly sufficient money was being injected into the Army jumping team and that enough money was not spent on the provision of the best horses for the team.  All Irish people are interested in and proud of Irish horses, whether they are competing in the Derby, the Grand National or any of the other great races or at the international show-jumping fixtures.  Like so many other Bills&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy discussing the Bill or section 8 which deals with members of the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am dealing with the Bill and very materially with section 8 because this is the operative section of the Bill.  I have made my remarks by way of general introduction and I was about to say that, like so many other Bills, in <Col N="745" /> recent times, this Bill is operated through regulations made by a Minister&mdash;in this case by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;and by a board to be set up by the Minister. This Bill will operate through section 8: if it is a success it will be so by virtue of the people who are appointed under this section; likewise, if it is a failure it will be so because of the people who have been appointed under section 8.</P>
      <P>I make a special appeal to the Minister to ensure, if he is in office when the members of the board are appointed, that people with the highest qualifications are appointed.  While it is true that in certain technical spheres we have a shortage of technical know-how and quite often we have to seek experts from abroad to advise us on industrial matters, in matters relating to the horse industry we can export to the rest of the world.  In this field, the best knowledge and skills are held by Irish people and it is well known that wealthy people from abroad come to us for advice on matters relating to the horse industry.  It would be a great pity if any consideration other than that of the highest possible qualifications would influence the Minister in appointing members of the board under section 8.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that subsections (6) and (7) of section 8 deprecate the appointment of politicians to the board and, by and large, I agree with that. Those subsections state that active politicians should not be eligible for appointment or retention on the board. It would be nearly impossible to get people with no political affiliations but it would be wrong to appoint those whose main qualification appears to be that they are supporters of the Government in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister objected to references to Bord na gCon.  With all due respect, I think references to Bord na gCon are relevant in this discussion because, in relation to the Bill we are now discussing, the most comparable board that has been set up in this country is Bord na gCon.  That board has come to be regarded as the preserve of politicians: the first chairman was a <Col N="746" /> former Member of this House, although admittedly he was interested in the greyhound racing industry, and the executives under him were too closely associated with the Government party. Such appointments are calculated to lead people to believe that the best brains are not being used, and that the vital qualification is the political one. If that happens in this board it would be a great mistake.</P>
    <P>It is well known or it is said that Bord na gCon have operated on a political basis, that there is serious and objectionable political bias in the appointments and in the administration of that board.  If that is so and if people say that, it is hard to blame them when the first chairman of the board walked out of a Government bench in this House and became chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is in order.  A reference to Bord na gCon is not out of order but to go into detail on the matter is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I do not want to be disorderly but I think it is relevant to point out that what happened in the case of appointments made to Bord na gCon should not be repeated here and to say why, in my opinion, the appointments of members of Bord na gCon were objectionable.</P>
      <P>I repeat that we have in this country unequalled brains, unequalled experience and unequalled traditions in the horse breeding industry which should be availed of, and whatever Minister is in power at the time should go out to select the best possible brains for appointment to this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to certain organisations.  While I have taken an interest in horse jumping and horse racing and dog breeding and racing I do not hold myself out as an expert but there are well-known organisations in this country in the sphere of horse breeding, horse jumping and horse racing and I feel it would inspire confidence in the operation of this Bill if the Minister were to shed some of the authority for appointing members and hand at least some of that authority over to those organisations who have <Col N="747" /> the experience, the know-how, the knowledge and the skill in the fields covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not been extravagant in anything I have said.  I feel very strongly about this and I believe that the Minister, in making these appointments, shall appoint people on merit and on merit alone.  In making appointments not alone must they be made on merit but they must appear to be made on merit if they are to give satisfaction and instil confidence.  I believe that if the Minister operates section 8 of this Bill as it should be operated he will have done a lot to improve the horse racing and horse jumping industry.  On the other hand, if he, or whoever is in his place, just appoints political party hacks to this board he will do nothing but bring the board and its operation into contempt and ridicule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as drafted gives complete freedom to the Minister to appoint a board not exceeding 11. The survey team, as I understand it, at paragraph 33 of their recommendations, recommended a controlling body on which certain named organisations or societies would have representation. The Minister has not indicated any particular reason why that part of the recommendation was not adopted.  It could be argued that it is impossible to cover all the organisations or bodies but as I understand this particular recommendation&mdash;they refer to the Royal Dublin Society, the Equestrian Federation, the Show Jumping Association of Ireland and some others&mdash;the total number, including the Department of Agriculture, that was recommended by the body would have come to nine, according to this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister considered the desirability of specifically mentioning the major organisations and drawing from them, say, a single representative and then nominating the rest of the board from any appointees he might consider? In that way these major organisations would be represented.  The selection of the nominee from the organisations could even, in fact, be left to the Minister but it would ensure that the bodies that had done so much would be represented. <Col N="748" /> Most people recognise that within the limits that were available, financial and otherwise, and realising that in every case, with the possible exception of one or two persons appointed to carry out executive duties, all the members of these bodies gave their services voluntarily, over the years they made a very considerable contribution.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside a long-established body like the RDS, to take a more recently established association, the Show Jumping Association, which came together, as it is now known, something over 25 years ago, it undoubtedly raised very considerably the standard of jumping and the standard of fences and regulations and judging and the whole running of shows and gymkhanas throughout the country.  By their work they have contributed to a very considerable extent to the growth of interest as well as the numbers participating from the civilian section of the community.  So far as this is concerned, we need not take into account the Army Equitation School because it was already there and was part of the structure of the Army, but the provision of facilities such as fences, the recruitment or the arrangement of panels of judges, the improvement in the standard required and generally the organisation and running of shows and gymkhanas throughout the country are due to a great extent to the work of these bodies.</P>
    <P>I am not talking of the major shows like the RDS, or Cork, or Limerick, but the general increase in interest and the success of these shows generally is due in great measure to the voluntary work done by members of these bodies, particularly the Show Jumping Association.  They have been assisted.  Through their own exertions they attracted sponsoring by a number of firms which contributed in no small measure to a general improvement and made the whole exercise financially more attractive.  But, without the initiative of these people and without the effort they made, much of the success that has attended show jumping in recent years might never have evolved. The survey team recommended that these bodies should have some representation while, at the same time, <Col N="749" /> continuing to operate as independent units.  As the Bill is drafted, this aspect of the recommendation has not been included in the Bill.  The Minister might consider amending it in order to give some representation to the major organisations concerned.  Such representation would ensure that their voluntary work and their efforts were recognised.  It would also ensure their goodwill and co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not for good and sufficient reason refer specifically to any organisation.  The survey team did recommend giving representation to some of the organisations. One argument I would advance against the inclusion by name of any organisation is that such inclusion would assume their performance and their willingness to participate as members of their societies.  Two organisations have already indicated that they are not willing to serve on the board.</P>
      <P>Rural Deputies will be aware that a large sector of the horse industry is totally unorganised and it would be unfair to those in that large sector to allot special places to people who belong to organisations of one kind or another and thrust them into a position of secondary importance simply because they did not belong to organisations. It was pointed out by several speakers on Second Reading that those who are most concerned in producing horses are very small operators indeed. They are commonly people with only one mare.  They do not belong to any particular organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion by name of societies or organisations would also, I think, give rise to unnecessary jealousy.  There are a great many of these organisations. If any one which did participate decided at a later stage to withdraw, for some reason or other, the board would be deprived of possibly one or more members.  In view of all these arguments it is right, I think, that the Minister should retain the power of selecting the members of the board. He should also be able, if he so desires, to consult with such organisations as he thinks may be of assistance to him in the setting up of the board.  It is the Minister's business, and his alone, <Col N="750" /> to see that the board that is selected is the best possible board.  If a measure is introduced which compels him to give <i>ex officio</i> places on the board to certain organisations then his power would be inhibited.  I do not think it should be done in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on Second Reading I said that the success or failure of this piece of legislation depended entirely on the quality of the people appointed to this board. The Minister has the job of piloting through this House a piece of legislation for which he himself was not responsible. Consequently, he must do the best he can and he is, I suppose, reluctant midway through to change the Bill or to say that he does not agree with everything that is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I disagree entirely with the case made by the Minister.  He says this is an industry which is completely unorganised. I agree with him in that. As Minister for Agriculture and fisheries, it is his job to encourage organisation in every branch of the industry so that, when he appoints someone to the board, that someone will not be speaking for himself but for a group of people engaged in this type of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that some of these organisations might disappear with the effluxion of time.  All things can disappear with the effluxion of time.  We have to deal with circumstances as we find them at any given time and we are now proposing to set up a board to run the horse breeding industry, particularly the half-bred industry, and we must, I think, throw the maximum responsibility on those who are engaged in that industry.  I am very fearful&mdash;I am sure the Minister appreciates this angle&mdash;that if the Minister handpicks these people, no matter how good they happen to be, the same faith will not be reposed in them as would be were they appointed by those directly concerned in the industry.  We all know the faith that was reposed in one famous&mdash;should I say infamous?&mdash;body set up by a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the NAC.  It was doomed to failure <Col N="751" /> from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; because the people on it were handpicked.  Let me admit straight away that there were some excellent people on that body.  There were others who were picked for specific reasons and who could not be expected to give a good performance ever.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility to the organised bodies.  All these groups have been listed in the survey team's report and many of them have been doing excellent pioneering work while the Minister's Department was doing the very minimum by way of encouragement to the industry generally. These people have been doing excellent work with very little assistance.  They should be given some credit for this, some credit for their experience and for the amount of effort they have put into their work.  The suggested recognition is the obvious recognition.  I have no doubt but that, when the Minister is selecting his board, he will have regard to these facts and will pick people who have been engaged in these organisations but, unless they are the selections of the organisations themselves, they will be speaking as individuals and not on behalf of their organisations. That I would regard as a major defect and something which must inevitably militate against the success of the board.</P>
    <P>The case made here by previous Ministers was: &ldquo;If I select people I am responsible for them: I have to come in here and answer for them.&rdquo; That is quite so.  The Minister must come in and answer for them, but he can always say he could not get better people; they were the best he could get.  That is the answer.  It is not a good answer.  We want these organisations to appreciate that the part they have played over the years is being recognised. We want to encourage all who are interested in this industry to organise and get together.</P>
    <P>In all efforts of this kind it is our desire that the people should come together in bigger groups.  One might as well say, for instance, that there are large areas in the working population that are not organised.  Nevertheless, we <Col N="752" /> recognise the trade unions and consult them before making any particular move and whenever boards are being set up.</P>

      <P>Invariably, representatives are appointed from these recognised workers' groups who have been working intimately with the particular industry for a number of years.</P>
      <P>A very strong case can be made for the recommendations of this survey team.  This team was set up because they were regarded as being experts on the industry.  They have done a good job and they have produced a good report that has been left lying for far too long.  We should recognise the interest and the efforts that they put into the production of their report and we should proceed along the lines they suggested.  We must accept that they exercised great care in the preparation of this report and that they had due regard to all the interests and sections of the industry.  The importance of this should be borne in mind when appointments to the board are being made.  The Minister should say to any one organisation: &ldquo;Give me three or four names and I will pick one but I will be confined to those three or four&rdquo; so that these organisations will be represented.  This should be carefully considered by the Minister before reaching a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the organisations are concerned, they should be represented, but I would not go the whole way with Deputy Clinton.  The Minister might as well be given the right to nominate members as to be given three or four names from which to choose.  That would be putting temptation in his way.  We have had experience of this before.  If an organisation has the right to nominate they should nominate a certain person and that person should be their representative. Neither do I go the whole way with Deputy Clinton on the question of the trade unions being fully represented because one of the strongest cases against the Minister's attitude in this is what happened with regard to the Agricultural Wages Board, which <Col N="753" /> is also under the aegis of this Department, when we had the famous case of a workers' representative who was working as a builders' labourer in Birmingham.  The Minister elected that person and re-elected him for a number of years in spite of the fact that he could not attend meetings or do anything about the question of the wages of farm workers in this country. We have a situation at present where small farmers who have never worked for hire are acting as workers' representatives on the regional boards.  Perhaps at the time of re-election the new Minister will take note of this.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that these people are appointed for political purposes.  One may ask what does it matter but it is a question of some fellow being able to say that he was on some national organisation and apparently that is good enough for some of the people who still vote for Fianna Fáil.  I do not wish to introduce a note of acrimony into this debate but it would be wrong to have a situation in which the Minister could select from some people who would be recommended to him because we could guess from where the recommendations would come.  The people who are at present taking an interest in the industry should be the people to select the representatives.  The Minister rightly says that the industry is not a well organised one.  I agree with Deputy Clinton in that the way to ensure that the industry is well organised is by arranging that certain organisations already involved in it and doing a good job would have the right to nominate representatives.  If they should not nominate the best men at first there would be other opportunities to do so at the times of re-election.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House but I must say that it would be for better if the Minister were to decide to put in a provision to the effect that the organisations representing the industry should at least select a fair number of people for the board.  I am sure that the Minister will not assume the post of chairman.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision. Deputies on all sides of the House are <Col N="754" /> anxious that the best possible board be established.  We wish for co-operation with people who are already involved in the industry&mdash;people who, by their work and voluntary efforts down through the years, have succeeded in sustaining the horse breeding industry. The Minister's argument against the suggestion is a weak argument.  He has stated that there are many unorganised sections within the industry and he has mentioned that there are those people who may keep only one mare.  I would remind the Minister that the majority of those small farmers are at least members of the NFA or of some other organisation.  For that reason, the NFA should be allowed to nominate somebody to the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of unnecessary jealousies in relation to the nomination of people.  I do not see how this could be so if they are grouped together and asked for a nominee but there certainly will be jealousy if the Minister picks one or two people from certain organisations. With all due respect to the Minister, the members of these different organisations know more about the ability of the particular people whom they would nominate than could any Minister of State.  Because of the valuable work done by these organisations down through the years the Minister should allow them to appoint half the members.</P>
      <P>The survey team did excellent work. In all fairness to the Minister I must say that it is not he who is departing from their recommendations.  It was not he who drew up the Bill.  We should all like to see a new look in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  For too long, we have had arrogance and a dictatorial attitude in that Department.  We should thank the members of those organisations who have done such valuable voluntary work and the Minister, since he is new to the Department, should endeavour to sweep the carpet clean. We remember the little Napoleon we had in the past and his friend who could not stay on his own horse, but both of those have now gone from the political scene.  This Bill was drawn up by one of them.  Perhaps it was drawn up by both.</P>

      <P>The section, as drafted, provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may from time to time as occasion requires appoint a member to the Board to be chairman thereof.</P>
      <P>We have had a long debate on the importance of having personnel of a certain standard appointed to the board.  Having read the Minister's reply on Second Stage, I have no doubt that he is very conscious of this necessity, but it seems inconsistent that he would not allow people who would be of that standard to appoint their own chairman.  Perhaps insulting is too strong a word, but it is what I have in mind.  The people who would comprise the board should be allowed to appoint their own chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a precedent for this in the Act which deals with the Racing Board.  The Racing Board Act provides <Col N="756" /> that the board shall appoint their own chairman and I have not heard any criticism of that system.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  The other amendments are of course consequential.  I do not think there is anything I could say on amendment No. 4 except that the chairman acts for a year and is reappointed at an annual meeting.  Casual vacancies within the board will also be appointed by the members of the board and in the event of equality of votes the post of chairman will be filled by drawing lots.</P>
    <P>The Minister is dealing with an industry where the personnel as I have already described them are not the most naive section of the community. The very opposite can be said about the people engaged in the horse breeding industry.  They are people of very determined mentality.  &ldquo;Ruthless&rdquo; is too strong a word but certainly they are not sentimental.  They are very independent-minded and it could set a wrong tone for the Minister to say who is to be the chairman.  If the personnel are right they must elect a proper chairman from among themselves.  The Minister has indicated he realises the importance of the personnel being right so it is only logical that having appointed the right personnel he would show initial confidence in them by allowing them to elect their own chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be able to say whether or not the reason he has suggested that the Minister should select the chairman is that he wants to have someone who would have continuity over a number of years and eventually would receive a stipend? It has happened with minor boards that the members are not paid but the chairman receives a certain payment.  Is that the idea at the back of it or why should not the members of the board be entitled to elect their own chairman, somebody they would be able to trust and who would have the trust of those working under him? One of the worst possible positions is where the members of a board do not trust the chairman.  When I was speaking a few minutes ago I asked about this.  The Minister has no idea that <Col N="757" /> he would assume the position of chairman? There is a precedent for that in the board which Deputy Clinton referred to which unfortunately could have done good work but because of the fact the wrong chairman elected himself it fell to pieces and was not able to continue.  In the case of the Agricultural Wages Board, the chairman is a quorum.  Could the Minister ensure that in this case it would not happen that not alone would you elect a chairman but you would in fact elect a dictator and if a meeting was called the chairman would be a quorum and decisions could be taken in the absence of members?  This is the sort of thing which can flow from a handpicked chairman being put in there by a Minister for the purpose of carrying out a job.  There would be far more trust in this board if the board had the right to elect their own chairman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister will nominate the members of the board it would appear to me to be logical that he should therefore nominate the chairman also.  I simply do not apprehend what Deputies mean when they speak of lack of trust between the chairman and the members of the board.  I do not think that, because the chairman would be nominated by the Minister, there would be a likelihood thereafter that an absence of trust between the chairman and the members of the board would arise. I think, too, that the Minister, since he eventually will be responsible for the effectiveness of the board, ought to be entitled to nominate the chairman whom he would think best and the most likely to give the co-operation between him and the chairman that would be absolutely essential for the working of the Bill which is now before the House.</P>
      <P>I do not think the arguments that have been advanced are in any way substantial.  As I say, since the Minister himself is eventually responsible for the functioning of the board, the Minister should then be entitled to nominate his chairman.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in effect, is saying that the chairman should be <Col N="758" /> a conduit pipe between him and this independent board.  That is terribly dangerous.  If the chairman is there to reflect the Minister's views to the board he is not a chairman in the true sense.  That was the impression I got from what the Minister said. The Minister indicated that is the way his mind is running.  He has not indicated any reason as to why the board should not be allowed to select their own chairman.  He says because he selects the members of the board he should go a step further and select the chairman.  He has not dealt with the point I made that the Racing Board, an analogous body, selects their own chairman and there has not been any complaint about the chairing of the meetings of that board.</P>

      <P>I only want to make one comment and it is that I also do not consider that the Minister has made any argument against the right of the board to elect their own chairman except the one argument which he did not come right out with but which was at the back of his mind.  I interpret the Minister as saying that he wants a chairman to do what he and the Government want done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister did not mean that what did he mean by saying that they might not do what was best?  His own words gave the impression that he felt a chairman elected by the other members might in fact do what they consider to be best for the industry but which would not be the point of view adopted by the Minister or the Government of which he is a member.  He felt therefore that the person who was acting as chairman should be somebody handpicked by himself, or himself, who would in fact do what the Government wanted done. That is the way the Minister put it across.  He has been less than fair to himself if that is not what he meant.  I would suggest that we could get more clearly from the Minister what he meant.  I have an open mind on this.</P>

      <P>I look on this as an abuse of power by the Minister. The Minister stated he cannot be responsible for what Deputy Tully says or thinks.  Surely the Minister should be responsible for what he himself says.  The Minister stated that the choice of chairman which he makes should be acceptable to the board.  I think it is far from logical that if the Minister nominates the members he should nominate the chairman.  If the Minister nominates the members of the board and if he trusts them and has faith in them, if he puts in the proper type of man who is interested in horse breeding, it is more proper to leave it to those people to select their own chairman than it is for the Minister to appoint a political hack who will do his bidding.  We have had far too much of this by the Minister's predecessor.  Many of the boards have been complete failures in the past.  We appeal to the Minister not to adopt the same arrogant, dictatorial attitude as his predecessor adopted in this House in answering questions and in the appointment of boards.  Surely if the House has agreed that the Minister will nominate the members and if the Minister has trust and faith in those members and if they are people who have been associated with the horse industry and have built it up it <Col N="760" /> is better for those people to appoint their own chairman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): One of the principal objects of the board to be established under section 8 of this Bill is to advise the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  If advice is to be worthwhile at all it should be independent advice.  If advice is to be of any value to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that advice should come from fresh minds and from clear thinking on the problem on which the Minister wishes to be advised. Otherwise the advice will not be worth the paper it will be written on, if given in writing, or the breath used to convey it, if given verbally.</P>
      <P>The Minister has successfully resisted the suggestion that members of the board should be nominated by organisations engaged in the horsebreeding, racing or jumping industry on the grounds that it would be unlikely that if he were to accept that nomination a fair cross-section of the industry would be represented because, as he says, there are many small breeders who are not organised and who would not be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has succeeded by the force of numbers in carrying that argument. If we are to have an independent board that will be at all worthwhile, it should be given some authority. We all know that elected bodies of one sort or another have as their principal function, and their big moment each year, the appointment of their chairman.  When a member of an elected council or of a board or a golf club or of a creamery committee attends the annual general meeting he feels on that occasion he has some authority which he is entitled to exercise in choosing the chairman for the year.  The Minister, having got his way and being entitled as the Bill stands to appoint 11 members, is not prepared to entrust those 11 members of his own appointment with the function of deciding who will preside over their deliberations.  Does the Minister want an independent board to give him worthwhile, independent advice or does he want a creature of his own making?  In section 8 subsection (9) the <Col N="761" /> Minister is bringing into existence a creature of his own who will have no independent mind but will be manipulated by ministerial strings.  This is very unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an extraordinary statement when he said it was necessary he should have authority to appoint the chairman because he would be able to ensure that the chairman would be acceptable to the members. This is an extraordinary proposition. I cannot accept it and I do not think any Member of the House can accept it.  The fact that the Minister appoints the chairman will only ensure that the chairman will be acceptable to the Minister.  If the Minister leaves the appointment of the chairman to the 11 members of the board he will at least ensure that the chairman so elected will be acceptable to six members of that board because it will take a simple majority of the board to elect the chairman.  If the Minister appoints the chairman, the chairman might not be acceptable to anybody. So far as the other ten members of the board are concerned he would be the sore thumb, the odd man out, the man who was not acceptable to any of them, who was planted there by the Minister.  I do not think that argument will hold water.  It cannot stand. If I had my way, and if we were a perfect society and if we could legislate in detail in the House, I would be against ministerial regulations and ministerial boards but I am prepared to concede that in this day and age it is not possible to write everything into a Bill.  In the interests of democracy and in the interests of maintaining public interest in the affairs of the country let us give boards which are appointed as much authority as possible. Let them feel they have some say.  Here we have, immediately we appoint the board, a situation where we take from them the first function that one might expect the board to perform.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from the Bill whether the chairman is to be remunerated or not.  I think the balance of probability is that he is not to be remunerated.  It says in some other section that the members of the board may be paid expenses. <Col N="762" /> It does not say anything specifically about the chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i> Section 8 (9) of the Bill says:</P>
      <P>A member of the Board or of any committee established by the Board shall be paid, out of the funds at the disposal of the Board, such allowances for expenses as the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, considers reasonable.</P>
      <P>By and large, that confines the thing to payment of expenses but it does not say anything about the chairman. Leaving that out of the argument&mdash;I am not making the case that the Minister has a sinister idea in appointing a chairman and later paying him a salary &mdash;I am making the case very strongly that if the board are to be worthwhile and if the advice which they give is to be worthwhile they must be a self-respecting board.  It must be a board which believes it has some authority and some independence.  Whatever independence the board might have under section 8 is taken from it by section 9.  One could conceivably have the situation where there were 11 members on the board nine of whom believe that A would be the best possible chairman and possessed the best qualities for chairmanship of the board but because the Minister thought B should be appointed the other nine members would be frustrated.  That is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the National Agricultural Council.  I know the Minister cannot appoint himself chairman of the board, but I think the example of the National Agricultural Council, which was set up to advise the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, shows how absurd we can get and how devoid of common sense Ministers can become.  The NAC was set up on the advice of the Minister. Who did we then have as chairman of that organisation?  We had the Minister himself.  I quote that instance merely to show the absurdity to which parliamentary measures can be reduced. I appeal to the Minister, in the name <Col N="763" /> of common sense, to let the members of that board appoint their chairman. Under section 8 the Minister will be able to appoint his 11 men to that board but I appeal to the Minister to let the members appoint their chairman, otherwise he might as well have no board and no chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that no matter how long we argue and no matter how good a case we make the Minister has made up his mind, like his predecessor, that not a single line in this Bill will be changed and not a single amendment will be accepted by him.  I have seen this attitude ever since I first came into this House.  I cannot ever remember one amendment being accepted by a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first argument put forward by the Minister in opposing the amendment put down by Deputy Cooney is that since he has decided to hand pick every single member of this board it would be totally illogical for him not to hand pick the chairman.  If the Minister does what we consider wrong in the first instance he must be consistent and do the wrong thing in the second instance. The second argument he makes is that since he is responsible for the performance of this board it is right he should hand pick the most important man, namely, the chairman.  This attitude arises from a complete misconception of his responsibility as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  We are all familiar with the misconception that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must be a dictator.  I do not share that view.  The Minister's responsibility is to provide the conditions under which producers can organise and run their own business.  It is not his responsibility to act as dictator.  It is obvious the Minister wants to dictate policy from the top through the chairman of this new board.  The Minister wants to be able to tell the chairman what he wants.  There is no doubt that at some stage this position will be a big or a small plum.  I am not against giving a reasonable allowance to a chairman who is going to put a lot of work into the organisation.  In fact, I think it is right he should get an allowance <Col N="764" /> because if he does not get an allowance the selection is confined to a certain number of people who can afford to give up their time to take up that office and, as everyone knows, time is money nowadays.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this is going to be a plum.  I have no doubt if the Minister persists with his present attitude it is going to be a hand-out as well.  We want to resist this and it is for this reason Deputy Cooney put down this amendment.  It is quite obvious from the Minister's attitude that we are going to have a continuation of the attitude to which we have become so accustomed from Ministers for Agriculture in the past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Haughey&mdash;who does not know as much about horses as he thought he did&mdash;set up this body he told them that he wanted them to approach their task in a bold and imaginative way.  We want the Minister to approach the task before him now in the same way.  The setting-up of an important board depends largely on the chairman.  We do not want to see this board tainted with politics, as we know it will undoubtedly be if it <Col N="765" /> L'Estrange because he revealed a is left in the Minister's hands.  The Minister has authority from this House to select the 11 members of the board but we feel they are entitled to select their chairman.  We do not want the Minister's puppet on a string in this situation.  The new Minister should forget politics and forget the political touts who are waiting in the byways to be given a job at £1,000 a year not because of their loyal service to the horse-breeding industry but because of their loyal service to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We want to see an end to that kind of thing in this country because that is not what the men of 1916 died for; they spoke about cherishing all the children of this nation equally.  Deputy Haughey told those members that if we want to develop we must be as enterprising as possible within the limits dictated by the circumstances of any given situation.  We want the Minister to be as enterprising as possible and breakaway from the precedent set by his predecessor.  If the Minister has faith in the members he is going to appoint to this board he should allow them to select their chairman.  Certainly the chairman should not be a puppet of the Minister or the Government.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister will not accept this amendment, because I think it is a most reasonable one.  I am astonished at the trivial reasons which the Minister has produced for refusing to accept it.</P>
      <P>For the third time I want to mention the position of the Racing Board which is analogous to this board and whose chairman is elected by the members of the board.  Apparently, that has not caused any dissatisfaction to the Minister's colleague in Finance.  So far as we know he has not been worried by the conduct of the chairman of the Racing Board nor have the members of the Racing Board ever indicated that they are dissatisfied with their own chairman.  If they are, they have power to remove him.  That is not possible in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister being human, can err like anybody else&mdash;I am sure he <Col N="766" /> choice that would be unfortunate from the point of view of members of the board.  The chairman might have an abrasive personality, might lack diplomacy, might be unaware of procedure or of the finer points of the industry. I have no doubt the Minister will set out to appoint a suitable person but the Minister is human and might err. If the Minister did err in making his appointment, the chairman's faults would be apparent, not to the Minister but to the members of the board who would not be in a position to remove the chairman.  The efficacy and efficiency of the board would be highly impaired.  I would ask the Minister to indicate if the experience of the Racing Board is so unsatisfactory in regard to the appointment of a chairman that he has found it necessary to draft this Bill as it stands and set his face so firmly against this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister would not accept an amendment that is reasonable on its face and when subjected to examination must be seen to be reasonable.  The amendment cannot take from the efficacy of the board or diminish the Minister's powers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the board because, obviously, it is an independent board to which the Minister will not attempt to dictate.  He has even said that.  I can see no reason, beyond the warped logic of the Minister, why, having appointed the members, he should then appoint the chairman. He has given us no reason of substance as to why he will not allow the members of the board, adult, mature men dealing with a very important industry, to appoint their own chairman.</P>

      <P>There are many examples of boards where this does not apply.  The one that comes immediately to mind is An Bord Bainne which has a nominated chairman. Deputy Cooney seeks to suggest that I have found something wrong with the Racing Board because that does not happen there.  This does not follow. What all the opposition speakers have failed to demonstrate is that the way suggested in the Bill is not a perfectly reasonable and tried method of procedure. In an odd way the House should be thankful to Deputy <Col N="767" /> will admit that&mdash;and could make a certain type of opposition thinking. He spoke of puppets on a string and Fianna Fáil touts and made the usual type of L'Estrange contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I believe I am relevant in arguing that the chairman of this board should be appointed by the members of the board and not by the Minister, because I would not trust a Minister for Agriculture of the present Government to appoint the best man.  If I am to develop that argument I have to discuss Ministers for Agriculture; otherwise I might as well sit down.  The Minister has brought this type of discussion on himself because he introduced this Bill to the House and will not yield an inch to anything.  He will not listen to the arguments of Deputy Cooney who himself and whose people before him are steeped in the horse breeding industry and who has long and valuable experience in it.  Does the Long Title of the Bill not recite that the function of the board shall be to advise the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries?  If that advice is to be worthwhile it should be independent advice.  We tried here for a considerable time in your absence, Sir, to get the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to agree that at least some of the 11 members should represent organisations experienced in the horse breeding industry.  The Minister could not see his way to accept that suggestion because he thought that certain regions or sections of the country might not be represented if appointments were confined to any large extent to direct nomination by organisations associated with horse breeding, jumping or racing.  He scored there by virtue of numbers, as far as we know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it comes to the appointment of the chairman, and I have been making the case that if this board is to give any worthwhile advice to the Minister it should be independent advice.  Independent advice can be given only by a self-respecting board, and I fail to see how a board can maintain their self-respect if they are to be disfranchised, if they are to be deprived of the most elementary function that any committee, elected or nominated, business, political or cultural, can have, that is, the right to <Col N="771" /> appoint their own chairman.  The principle of the Bill has been accepted after a Second Reading debate.  We are now in Committee and if the Minister does not agree to have second thoughts on this it is obvious that for one reason or another he is not prepared to listen to reason; he is not prepared to improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>Could it be that he does not want to let down or appear to let down or to embarrass the man he is succeeding? If that is his attitude on this it is not a worthy one.  It is a matter that we in this House must take into consideration at this time.  It might be different if we were reassembled after a general election, but in the conditions prevailing here I apologise to no one either inside or outside this House for being critical, for being suspicious and for fine-combing and delving into every measure that is brought into this House by any member of the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my support to the arguments put forward from this side of the House on Deputy Cooney's amendment, which is a reasonable one.  Speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill I made the point that the success or failure of Bord na gCapall will depend on the board to be appointed.  The Minister has power to appoint a member of the board and I cannot see why the ordinary democratic process could not operate whereby the members of the board would have the power and the right to elect their own chairman.  I am in favour of this amendment because I believe it would lead to a much more effective board.  It would lead to greater harmony and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor is that the chairman of the board will have a very important function, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, to act in an advisory capacity. If the chairman is appointed by the Minister then it will be difficult for him, human nature being what it is, to offer totally objective and independent advice to the Minister.  On the other hand, if the chairman is appointed by the members of the board he <Col N="772" /> will be in a much stronger position to offer objective advice to the Minister, which I believe is necessary for the efficient working of the board.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the arguments that have been put forward in favour of the amendments.  I am satisfied that if the Minister accepts these amendments he will be doing a good job and taking a major step forward in ensuring that the board will work efficiently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a real slap in the face to the body who issued this report.  The survey team met on many occasions at their own expense and they recommended that the members of the board should elect a chairman from within their own number.  They also suggested that it would be desirable that the directors should be unpaid, voluntary workers.  There is a report from dedicated men who knew what they were talking about, who during the years had given their services free&mdash; men who were prepared to co-operate with the Government and the Minister in an unpaid capacity and who continued to work in the interests of the horsebreeding industry.</P>
      <P>I wonder is there any reason at all left in the Minister?  Everybody seems to be out of step but our Jim.  I think it was Carson who said: &ldquo;Not an inch.&rdquo; We would expect more co-operation from the Minister.  He is filling the shoes of an arrogant man and he should not continue in the same arrogant, dictatorial manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that there are many examples of the Government or the Minister appointing chairmen of boards.  We know there are many examples, too many examples.  You have Fianna Fáil touts appointed not because they have knowledge of the industry but because this was another plum for the boys.  That is what we want to get away from.  The Minister mentioned the chairman of Bord Bainne.  That is anything but a fair comparison.  He is a State official who is paid £5,000 or £6,000.  Of course, he is another good Fianna Fáil appointee.</P>

      <P>We are all anxious to have the best possible board elected in the interests of the horse industry and in the interests of those concerned <Col N="774" /> with breeding, training and exporting horses.  However, if the board are to be successful they must have a chairman in whom the board have faith and trust; there must be a chairman in whom those engaged in this industry have faith and trust.  The Minister wants to ensure that he will have a political tout, a puppet on a string, responsible to nobody but to the Minister. If there is any reason in the Minister he will allow his own 11 nominees to appoint a chairman.  The Minister is the last man in the House who should talk about suspicion.  It is said that suspicion haunts the guilty mind. They are annoyed when we tell them the truth.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister now suspicious of the people he is about to appoint on the board?  Is he so suspicious of them that he is not prepared to allow them to elect their chairman, or have things become so bad among Fianna Fáil and their supporters that they cannot trust each other?</P>

      <P>The Minister still has not dealt with the point I made about the Racing Board.  I suppose one can imply that he is satisfied with the system because he did not make any allegation against it.  The Racing Board constitute a better analogy than Bord Bainne.  Then, if this system works for the Racing Board, where the same type of work is being done by men of similar qualifications, why will he not allow the same system to operate in respect of the board we are now appointing?  The team who made the survey and issued the report by common agreement very thoroughly investigated the industry and recommended that this board should elect their chairman from among their own number.  If the Minister has accepted so much of their report&mdash;this Bill is entirely made up from their recommendations&mdash;why will he not accept this point and allow the board to elect their chairman?</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's refusal.  If it is a point of principle to concede nothing, then that is an empty and barren principle.  The Minister has said nothing which suggests that that is the reason.  The thinking behind this piece of legislation seems to be that a Bill as drafted, representing the initial ideas of a Minister, is from that moment sacrosanct because no sensible reason has been given by the Minister for his refusal to accept the amendment.  I have been trying to search in the Minister's replies for some reason which would show that it would be a matter of commonsense; which would show that the board appointing their own chairman would mean that the board would not work efficiently, or would disagree over the appointment, or that they would appoint a chairman who would not know his business&mdash;that it is something like that which influences the Minister in thinking that the work of the board would be impaired and that is why he is so steadfast in his refusal to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say if he is satisfied with or if he has heard any complaint about the working of the Racing Board.  This is the most apt comparison we have.  That board deals with horses and the people connected <Col N="776" /> with the industry and I cannot see why if the system has worked there it would not work equally well with this board. The Minister has given us no reasons to show that what we suggest might impair the efficiency of the board and therefore he cannot blame us for becoming suspicious about why he wants to covet this power to himself.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly relevant that we should examine his motives and his reasons. The first thing we must consider is who introduced this Bill.  It was the Minister's predecessor and I understand from my colleagues that his attitude to any Bill which he introduced was that not a single comma would be changed and that it would have to be steamrolled through.  One possible explanation is that this Minister feels he owes it to his predecessor to continue with that mentality.  It is not a very convincing explanation but the Minister has not given us any convincing explanation and he cannot blame us if in seeking an explanation we find explanations that are not convincing.</P>
    <P>Another explanation put to me by my colleagues, and to which when it was first put up I was inclined not to give much weight, was that for political reasons or for some other improper reasons the Minister wanted to retain this power.  The Minister can tell us that there is no such reason for wanting to retain this power but if he wants us to believe that he must give us <i>bona fide</i> commonsense reasons.  To my mind, all the arguments are in favour of this board appointing their own chairman.  The board will be composed of sensible men, experts in their own field, to look after a very important industry and to be appointed after the recommendations of a survey team.  That that board should not be capable of appointing their own chairman is beyond comprehension.  It is beyond comprehension that the Minister should want to take away this elementary function. As I said before, this industry is run by hard-headed business people and the Minister could very easily cause antagonism in the industry by keeping this power to himself.  The Minister should be very careful to ensure that no action of his would set this new <Col N="777" /> departure in the horse breeding industry off on the wrong foot.  I am very much afraid that if he persists in this attitude he could set the board off on the wrong foot and annoy the members. The people in this industry are very independent minded people and, by and large, a tough bunch of people; and the Minister is taking a grave risk in showing such a lack of faith and trust in the body he is setting up to control this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has denied my suggestion that the chairman would be merely a conduit pipe between himself and the board to reflect his views to the board.  I have not heard any reason from the Minister which would justify his attitude to this amendment.  I am anxious to hear him deal with why something which is acceptable in the structure of the Racing Board is not acceptable in Bord na gCapall.</P>

The survey team recommended that the board select their own chairman; we on this side of the House have also made this recommendation and we believe it is a fair recommendation.  We cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.  If it is not a plum for the boys, for some of those Tacateers or others who have subscribed to the party down through the years, then why would the Minister not say that it is not his intention to appoint a Fianna Fáil man for this important position, that it is not his intention to appoint a puppet on a string?

The fact that the Minister is acting in the same arrogant and dictatorial manner as his predecessor, adopting Carson's attitude of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;, is proof that this post has already been promised to &ldquo;one of the boys.&rdquo;  The Minister is not compelled to behave as his predecessor did.  He was arrogant and we see where he is today.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give one good reason why he wants to retain this prerogative of appointing the chairman?  According to section 8 the Minister appoints the members of the board.  The survey team established by the Minister recommended, after lengthy deliberation, that the members of the board should represent the various organisations.  Many people in those organisations have done sterling work for the horse industry, very often at financial loss to themselves.  For example, there are excellent horse shows held in Mullingar and Athlone and much of the work is done voluntarily by local people who are interested both in the horses and in helping their town.</P>
      <P>The survey team consulted with the following organisations: All Ireland Polo Club; The Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse Owners' Association of Ireland; Bord Fáilte; BBA (Ireland) Limited; British Equine Veterinary Association; Connemara Pony Breeders' Society; Córas Iompair Éireann; Córas Tráchtála Teo; County committees of agriculture of the following counties: Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary N.R., Waterford, Westmeath, and Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey team further consulted with the Curragh Stud Farmers' Association; Department of Agriculture and Fisheries; Department of Defence; Department of Finance/ Revenue Commissioners; Department of Transport and Power; An Foras Talúntais; Messrs. R.J. Goff and Co. <Col N="779" /> Ltd; The Hunters' Improvement and National Light Horse Breeding Society; Irish Masters of Foxhounds Association; Irish National Stud Company, Limited; Irish Olympic Horse Society; Irish Pony Club Advisory Board; Irish Show Pony Society; Irish Shows Association; National Farmers' Association. Although the Minister stated that they had not an organisation to represent them, I claim that the NFA represent many, if not all, farmers who breed horses and this board will have jurisdiction over them.</P>
    <P>The survey team also consulted with the Racing Board; the Royal Dublin Society; the Show jumping Association of Ireland; Stallion Owners' Association of Southern Ireland; Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau (U.S.A.); University of Dublin, Trinity College; University College, Dublin, and the Veterinary Council of Ireland. All those organisations have a thorough knowledge of the industry and have done much to help it.</P>
    <P>After consulting all the organisations, the survey team submitted their recommendations regarding the setting up of the board.  They recommended that the members of the board should elect the chairman from within their own number.  It must be stated that the people on the survey team acted in a voluntary capacity; they were not speculators, Tacateers; they were not interested in working for gain. They further recommended that in the team's view it was desirable that the directors of the new body, including the chairman, should be unpaid voluntary workers.  We have here a group of men who performed voluntary work recommending to the Minister that the chairman should be selected from the members of the board and should be an unpaid voluntary workers.  In this materialistic age there are very few people inclined to do voluntary work; all want to get as much as possible with the minimum of effort.  We should, therefore, be properly appreciative of the contributions made by the survey team and by people in the organisations connected with this industry.</P>
    <P>From the beginning our party have <Col N="780" /> said we did not want politics to come into this matter and we were prepared to co-operate fully with the Minister in seeing that a first-class board was set up.  We wanted a board of men of integrity who would act in the best interests of the nation.  We argued that the various organisations should nominate the members but the Minister would not accept that.  Now it is agreed that the Minister himself will nominate the members of the board but we find that, even with this power, the Minister is so suspicious that he cannot trust his own nominees to elect the chairman he wants.</P>
    <P>Is that not the position?  The Minister has the power to nominate the members.  He may, if necessary, consult those bodies.  He may consult the bodies that down through the years have done this excellent voluntary work.  In any case he appoints the 11 members.  Now he tells us, after getting authority from this House to appoint the 11 members, that he is so suspicious of the 11 members that he will not allow them to appoint a chairman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice, Sir, that I wished to raise the following matter on the Adjournment:</P>
      <P>The refusal of the Minister for Defence to set up a commission on the lines of the Conroy Commission to inquire into pay, promotion and disciplinary conditions of Army personnel.</P>
      <P>I did not particularly want to bring the Minister back on the Adjournment, but this is an extremely serious matter and it has gone to the point where it is an extremely urgent matter.  I wanted, as Fine Gael spokesman on Defence, to draw attention to this in the best possible way that I could and to take advantage of any opportunity I have to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, advocated the setting up of a commission on a previous occasion.  I have been <Col N="781" /> supported on this by the leader of the party, Deputy Liam Cosgrave.  No commission has been set up.  I am not setting out to blame the present Minister for Defence.  He cannot be held responsible for what his predecessors have failed to do since 1964. I say 1964 deliberately because it was in 1964 that the chief of staff first requested a comprehensive review of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>To make a case for a commission it is necessary to go into a little bit of history.  The chief of staff made this request and he let the matter go on for a period of two years.  Nothing happened. He repeated the same request in 1966.  On each of these occasions I believe he made his case well but nothing happened even after the 1966 repeat request.  In 1968 he again made a very strong submission to the Minister of the day for the setting up of a commission.  What he had in mind was a commission on the lines of the Conroy Commission which inquired into the situation in the Garda Síochána.  He got no commission.  Instead, he got what the Minister describes as a working party in 1969.  This working party was supposed to report back to the Minister before last Christmas.  They failed to report before last Christmas and they have failed to report since.  I think the chief of staff had considerable difficulty in getting the people under his command to understand why nothing was appearing to be done and why this review body set up by the Minister was not producing anything.</P>
    <P>I spoke on this matter in another place last night and it is reported in this evening's newspapers.  It is no secret that this group has now broken up and it has broken up mainly because it was wrongly constituted, because it was not a commission proper.  It was composed of one Army colonel, one member of the Secretariat of the Department of Defence and one member from the Department of Finance.  One can easily see that such a body was doomed to failure because it was loaded against the military arm of the Army.  We all know that in the Department of Defence there are two sides&mdash;there is the Civil Service side and there is the military side.  The Civil Service, as we all know, <Col N="782" /> are mainly interested in saving money. On the other hand, the military side are keenly conscious of the great responsibility they carry at all times when the chips are really down.  They are the last line of defence and when the country is really up against it we look to the Army to come in and save the situation for us.</P>
    <P>We do not want this type of working party because this is only an excuse for a commission.  We want a real commission that will make a searching inquiry not only into pay, not only into promotion, not only into disciplinary matters&mdash;we want a searching inquiry into all the sources of discontent that are so evident today, an inquiry into the reasons why resignations are on the increase, an inquiry into the reasons why we have failed over the years, in spite of all our recruiting efforts, to bring the Army up to its full strength. Why has the Army not been more attractive to people?  These are the sorts of things a commission must inquire into.  I do not believe that an increase in pay will reverse the present deteriorated condition of the Army.  I feel this will require far deeper searching. There is a discontent and a dissatisfaction there which should be obvious to everybody and I do not think that will be settled by just giving the eleventh round or the twelfth round. The Army has fallen behind people similarly qualified in civilian life.  These are some of the reasons why the morale never was as low as it is at present.  I am making the statement and I believe I am right in saying that colonels are travelling from the most distant parts of the country to report in Dublin to the chief of staff on the deterioration in the morale of the Army and to complain that unless something is done as a matter of urgency we will be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>We require, as never before, a strong Army, an Army that is confident in its ability to maintain peace and security in this State in the special circumstances of the difficulties in the north, the threats that are within and without.  I feel that all these matters call for the searching scrutiny of a commission and that no other body can do it.  The Minister now has this <Col N="783" /> responsibility left to him.  Not only would this commission look into the present-day needs of the Army but they would look forward into the position in which we will be in perhaps two years' time when both sides of the Border will be in the EEC.  That is what we all expect; that is what we are all hoping.  It will not at all surprise me at that point if the British decide to phase themselves out of the North of Ireland.  That is the point at which we will need the strongest Army that we ever had in this country to maintain peace during this transition period.  We all say in this House that the reunification of this country is inevitable and I agree with that.  But we will never secure the reunification of the country on peaceful terms until we strengthen the Army here and this is the price the people will have to pay for it.  Ministers in other Departments of State insist on insurance policies being taken out for one thing or another.  You cannot take a car on to the road unless you have an insurance policy in case you may injure, maim or kill another road user.  The only insurance policy we have against future mass disorder, against bloodshed and loss of life is a strong army. We need one.  We need an army twice the size of the Army we have at the moment, twice as well equipped, an army with morale and with confidence in its ability to maintain peace in the kinds of circumstances I have described.</P>
    <P>There is a serious responsibility now on the Minister's shoulders to set up this commission to make this investigation in order to restore confidence in the Army and in those who serve in it. All of us are proud of those who serve in our Army and, because we are proud of them, we should insist that they are properly looked after.  The Civil Service has its own arbitration machinery for looking after its needs. The Garda Síochána have a representative body that can make their claims. But even they were given a commission and we know how near we were to serious trouble in the Garda Síochána because this commission was not producing the goods; even when it did produce them there were storm clouds <Col N="784" /> gathering because the recommendations of the commission were not being implemented.</P>
    <P>We have arrived at a similar position now in regard to the Army and we are doing nothing about it.  I am appealing to the Minister&mdash;a new Minister and a young Minister&mdash;to take a serious look at the situation, to send for the chief of staff and listen to what he has to say.  Do not listen to the civil servants all the time.</P>
    <P>There are two angles to this.  There is a serious situation and I appeal to the Minister seriously to look into it.  I have brought him back here tonight to hear what he has to say and what he intends to do.  The country wants to know what the Minister's intentions are in this situation. It has gone on for far too long.  The present situation is the result of a lack of interest, of an obvious political apathy in relation to the country's defence and in relation to the Army. Nobody cares but, mark you, people are beginning to care because of recent disturbances and because of future expectations. There is now much more concern about and much more interest in the Army.  I believe the people are prepared to pay the insurance premium necessary in order to increase the Estimate for Defence for the purpose of providing the money needed to bring the Army to that pitch at which it should be.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to Deputy Clinton's remarks and I fully agree with what he said in praise of the Army.  Last Sunday I had an opportunity of visiting Curragh Camp. It was my first official visit there and I took advantage of it to express my appreciation, and that of the Government, of the loyalty and dedication which our Defence Forces have shown down through the years both at home and overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think, however, that I can at this stage add anything to what I have already said by way of reply to a question tabled by Deputy Barry Desmond and Deputy Hogan.  I indicated on that occasion that, as the House had previously been told, a special review of the pay of the <Col N="785" /> permanent Defence Forces and related matters is at present being carried out by a working party from the Department of Finance and the Department of Defence, including a military representative.</P>

In addition, I mentioned I was taking steps, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to ensure that the task of the working party is completed as a matter of urgency.  Indeed, I can say at this point that, in my two weeks as Minister for Defence, I have addressed myself to this question of the finalisation of the pay review and I am very pleased to be able to assure the House tonight that the report of the working party will be submitted in a matter of days.  In the circumstances, I would ask the Deputy to await the decision which will fall to be taken after the report has been received and considered.  I repeat, very sincerely, that this matter will be given top priority.</P>
