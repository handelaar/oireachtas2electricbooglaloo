      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, in view of the statement I issued earlier this morning and of the fact that I shall require a meeting of the Government and, as already announced, that I hope to have a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Dáil Members, I suggest that the House does not proceed with the sitting at this time but adjourn to a later hour. I suggest that the Dáil meet later this evening in view of the fact that I have already announced 6 p.m. as the meeting time for my party.  Therefore, I would suggest that the Dáil meet at 10 p.m. tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire from the Taoiseach, before deciding whether or not to meet at 10 p.m. tonight, if he can inform the Dáil what Ministers have had their assignments as members of the Government terminated since yesterday?  Furthermore, would the Taoiseach inform the Dáil what business will be taken at 10 p.m. tonight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have called for the resignation of two Ministers who were named in the announcement I have already made.  The third Minister tendered his resignation.  I suggest that the business that would be ordered later on can be communicated in the course of the day through the Whips of the other parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the two Ministers resigned or what precisely is the position of the two persons named?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet received their resignations but the Constitutional position is that I am entitled to act on my request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not object to the proposal by the Taoiseach that the Dáil do now adjourn but, perhaps, the Taoiseach would say what difficulties there are in convening the meeting of his party earlier than 6 p.m. this evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made my announcement early this morning I was not in a position to anticipate what the decision of the Dáil might be at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Dáil&mdash;because the Dáil was already ordered to convene at 11.30 this morning and to adjourn at 6 p.m.  It was not for me to anticipate that the Dáil might agree to my proposition to adjourn at this time. That is the reason the meeting was summoned for 6 p.m. this evening.  It was on that basis that notices have been sent to members of my party who are not immediately available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach cannot anticipate when there may be a conclusion to the meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Do we take it, therefore, that 10 p.m. tonight is a tentative proposal or is it a definite hour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting it as a reasonable hour when we anticipate the meeting of my party will definitely have concluded.  Nobody can suggest at this stage when the meeting will end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be unreasonable but the business of the Dáil and of the country is entitled to precedence over a Fianna Fáil Party meeting.  No matter what are the difficulties, the Fianna Fáil Party meeting should be brought forward today to an earlier hour so that the Dáil can meet at an earlier hour this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be practical about this.  The business of the Fianna Fáil Party is the business of that party but in fairness to the Taoiseach and the other members of his Government, this is a matter which must be considered by their party.  However, I would suggest <Col N="633" /> that the meeting be held at an earlier hour and that there be named now a definite hour for the resumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be sure that I can get members of my party together.  Some of them are abroad and messages have been sent to them.  I am rather taken aback by Deputy Cosgrave's last suggestion because, <Col N="634" /> shortly before we came in, I understood we had agreed on a 10 o'clock resumption. I am prepared to give an assurance at this stage that we will resume at 10 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.45 a.m. until 10 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th May, 1970.</P>
